AB In contrast to abrupt changes caused by land cover conversion, subtle changes driven by a shift in the condition, structure, or other biological attributes of land often lead to minimal and slower alterations of the terrestrial surface. Accurate mapping and monitoring of subtle change are crucial for an early warning of long-term gradual change that may eventually result in land cover conversion. Freely accessible moderate-resolution datasets such as the Landsat archive have great potential to characterize subtle change by capturing low-magnitude spectral changes in long-term observations. However, past studies have reported limited success in accurately extracting subtle changes from satellite-based time series analysis. In this study, we introduce a supervised framework named 'PIDS' to detect subtle forest disturbance from a comprehensive Landsat data archive by leveraging disturbance-based calibration sites. PIDS consists of four components: (1) Parameter optimization; (2) Index selection; (3) Dynamic stratified monitoring; and (4) Spatial consideration. PIDS was applied to map the early stage of bark beetle infestations (i.e., a lower per-pixel fraction of trees cover that show visual signs of infestation), which are a typical example of subtle change in conifer forests. Landsat Analysis Ready Data were used as the time series inputs for mapping mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle disturbance between 2001 and 2019 in Colorado, USA. PIDS-detection map assessment showed that the overall performance of PIDS (namely 'F1 score') was 0.86 for mountain pine beetle and 0.73 for spruce beetle, making a substantial improvement (> 0.3) compared to other approaches/products including COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance, LandTrendr, and the National Land Cover Database forest disturbance product. A sub-pixel analysis of tree canopy mortality percentage was performed by linking classified high-resolution (0.3- and 1-m) aerial imagery and 30-m PIDSdetection maps. Results show that PIDS typically detects mountain pine beetle infestation when >56% of a Landsat pixel is occupied by red-stage canopy mortality (one year after initial infestation), and spruce beetle infestation when >55% is occupied by gray-stage mortality (two years after initial infestation). This study addresses an important methodological goal pertinent to the utility of event-based reference samples for detecting subtle forest change, which could be potentially applied to other types of subtle land change.

AB The agriculture, waste management, and energy sectors make major contributions of methane to the atmosphere. Cost-effective means of locating both anthropogenic and natural sources of methane and other gases are needed in order to improve understanding of greenhouse gas budgets and facilitate mitigation. One approach uses imaging spectrometers operating on remote sensing platforms, such as aircraft or satellites, to locate specific types of plumes. This paper develops spectral algorithms for the detection of any absorptive gas, for example, methane in the shortwave infrared region. The presence of a target gas is inferred from its known absorptivity spectrum along with local background statistics gathered by the sensor. The problem of distinguishing the target signal from clutter is usually solved by modeling the spectral background with some member of the class of elliptical distributions, most commonly a multivariate Gaussian. That class of models is replaced here by the lognormal distribution. A logarithmic transformation then recasts the associated hypothesis test into a standard form, allowing derivation of a uniformly most powerful solution. It is theoretically optimal simultaneously for all gas concentrations. This leads further to new algorithms for the detection and quantification of gas mixtures.

AB Imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool for mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution of species compositions. Most spectroscopy studies rely on extensive field campaigns to assess classification accuracies against ground-truth samples. Their findings are correlative and not based on first principles and by design they often do not provide for an end-to-end traceability of error budgets. In this study, we present a simulation approach for modeling canopy-level reflectance using three-dimensional plant models arranged on a synthetic landscape. This type of simulation offers an important avenue for understanding the interplay between instrument parameters and landscape characteristics for different ecosystems. The simulation approach was applied using species-level leaf reflectance data from the biodiversity hotspot in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa. We simulated 140 random realizations, each of 20x20m in size, encompassing 10 to 70 species to understand how changing the diversity and image resolution (pixel size) affected spectral mixing and the ability to discern species within the plot. Overall, across all resolutions and species mixtures, the mean classification accuracy was 0.690?0.184 (mean F1-score?standard deviation across realizations), however, this varied widely from 0.812?0.057 at a pixel size of 60 cm for landscapes with 30 species to 0.196?0.106 for landscapes with 70 species and a pixel size of 240 cm. As expected, classification accuracy decreased with increasing spatial grain from 0.763?0.064 at 15 cm resolution to only 0.414?0.214 at 240 cm. Classification accuracies across different levels of species richness remained fairly constant except in the coarsest grain size (240 cm). This suggests an increasing challenge in species identification as grain sizes become coarser than the constituent organisms. In summary, this approach can facilitate detailed simulation of reflectance while exploring various ecological scenarios such as changing species composition or the impacts of environmental variability such as drought.

AB No single satellite remote sensing system is able to provide the observations on the Earth's surface at both high spatial and high temporal resolution due to the general trade-off between orbit revisit frequency and satellite sensor's spatial resolution. This paper presents a spatio-temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) method for assimilating remote sensing data sets acquired by multiple remote sensing systems with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial resolutions. By extending the traditional Cokriging technique from a sole spatial domain to a spatio-temporal domain, we derived and implemented ST-Cokriging algorithm that explicitly takes the spatial covariance, temporal covariance and spatio-temporal covariance structures within and between different data sets into account. Compared with previous downscaling methods, such as, STARFM and FSDAF, our ST-Cokriging method produces more accurate and reliable assimilation results for the heterogeneous region, with associated uncertainty estimates. This method has been implemented into a software package using Python language within ArcGIS environment. The advantages and effectiveness of our ST-Cokriging method have been demonstrated through an application example, in which MODIS images (daily, 250 m and 500 m spatial resolution) and Landsat TM/ETM+ images (16 days revisit cycle, 30 m) are assimilated to generate daily spectral bands and NDVI images at 30 m spatial resolution. Our validation and accuracy assessments indicate that our ST-Cokriging method can effectively fill in data gaps due to clouds and generate reliable assimilation results and uncertainty estimates at both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency

AB Among the fastest sinking cities globally, the metropolitan area of Mexico City is the target of an unprecedented satellite investigation based on over 300 Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric Wide swath mode scenes acquired in 2014-2020. Two-pass differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and the parallelized Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) repeat-pass InSAR approach provide a complete account of spatial patterns, long-term trend and present-day settlement rates affecting the city. The 3D deformation field reveals that foremost is the role of the vertical velocity V-U, with peaks of -38.7 cm/year in Nezahualcoyotl, -32.0 cm/year in Gustavo A. Madero and Venustiano Carranza, and -39.1 cm/year in Iztapalapa. Settlement at the metropolitan Cathedral in Cuauhte ' moc is ongoing at up to -8.8 cm/year, consistently with the last six decades. Volcanic edifices mark ground stability "islets" inside the main subsidence bowls. East-west rates are limited, except for some horizontal strain (up to +/- 5 cm/year) within the subsidence bowls. Comparison with surface geology and geotechnical zoning confirms that aquitard compaction is the predominant process. The power relationship between V-U [cm/year] and the thickness of lacustrine clay deposits H-C [m] is: V-U = 1/76*H-C(1.8). The 2019-2020 deformation scenario shows that subsidence still involves most of Nezahualcoyotl, with -3.0 cm/month VU. A well-defined long-term deformation behaviour comes out from 2014-2019 InSAR time series and comparison with 2008-2020 GPS data. RMSE of 0.9 cm is found at MMX1 station deployed within the lacustrine unit, and 0.6 cm at TNGF station onto hard volcanic rocks. The sharpest subsidence gradients and angular distortions beta in 2017-2019 (up to over 1/400, i.e. 0.14 degrees) - thus the greatest vulnerability to surface faulting and cracking as a consequence of large tensile stress in the soil caused by differential settlement - are found at the foothills of Sierra de Santa Catarina, Penon del Marques, Cerro Chimalhuachi, Penon de los Banos and Sierra de Chichinautzin, where the transition unit is narrower (or absent). Faults and cracks develop where beta > 1/3000, i.e. 0.03%, in 2017-2019. The observed width of the influence zone (i.e. damage band), where beta is still significant to induce damage, is 250 m. Differential settlement and surface faulting could compromise the serviceability of housing and utility infrastructure. It is estimated that over 457,000 properties and 1.5 million inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (ZMVM) are in zones at high to very high surface faulting risk, mainly in Iztapalapa, Tlahuac, Chimalhuacan and Chalco. Increased flood exposure due to formation of topographic depressions involves over 751,000 properties and -2.7 million inhabitants of the ZMVM, mainly in Nezahualcoyotl, Tlahuac, Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero and Ecatepec de Morelos. These municipalities are often hit by catastrophic floods.

AB Present study estimates the shortwave radiative effects of absorbing aerosols (dust and carbonaceous aerosols) over the Indian landmass using a synergy of spaceborne and ground-based observations. Vertical profiles of dust and total aerosols are estimated using the multi-year (2006-2017) observations from CALIOP (Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) over the Indian region. Pre-monsoon enhancement (March - -May) in aerosol loading over the Indian region is significantly contributed (similar to 56%) by the transported mineral dust at free tropospheric altitudes. Though, shortwave radiative effect due to dust in the atmosphere increases about three times from winter to pre-monsoon, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) it causes cooling. Dust induced cooling reverses the positive radiative effect induced by non-dust aerosols at TOA over Indo-Gangetic Plains. Though the natural dust dominates the aerosol loading during pre-monsoon, anthropogenic dust contributes significantly (similar to 65%) to the total dust loading during winter. Over Indo-Gangetic Plains, high aerosol warming (up to similar to 2 Kday(-1)) observed within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is mainly caused by carbonaceous aerosols (85%). The observed heating rates over the Indian region can have significant implications over regional climate, air quality, and changing precipitation patterns.

AB This study presents an improved method to identify the Location of the Agulhas Current's Core and Edges (LACCE), throughout the greater Agulhas system. In this study the method is applied to daily altimetric fields of absolute dynamic topography and geostrophic velocities. LACCE compares favourably with previous algorithms used to track the position of the Agulhas Current. The ability of the LACCE to correctly identify the core and edges of the Agulhas Current is also established through comparisons with along-track altimetry datasets and in situ observations of current speed and direction across both the Agulhas Current and the Agulhas Return Current. Our results show that LACCE can successfully be applied to a merged altimetry dataset to monitor changes in the Agulhas Current's position caused by mesoscale processes such as early retroflection events or transient features like Natal Pulses. To demonstrate the use of the LACCE, the Agulhas Current position outputs from the algorithm computed over a 26-year period (1993 to 2018) are then used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of the Retroflection. Our results show that the Agulhas Retroflection generally occurs in the region from 15.01-20.03 degrees E and 40.47-38.44 degrees S. The retroflection exhibits a trimodal distribution, indicating three preferential longitudes (15, 18 and 19.5 degrees E). Despite not being statistically significant, the results suggest some seasonal variation in the modal position of the Retroflection, with it frequenting western longitudes more during the austral summer, in agreement with previous studies. Early retroflections were found to occur more often during the austral spring and summer, with few taking place in winter and almost none in autumn. The observations from this study agree with previous studies that found the triggering mechanism for early retroflections (east of 22.54 degrees E) to be the interaction between large Agulhas Current meanders (Natal Pulses) with northward extensions of Agulhas Return Current meanders.

AB Rangelands cover 70% of the world's land surface, and provide critical ecosystem services of primary production, soil carbon storage, and nutrient cycling. These ecosystem services are governed by very fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon, nutrients, and plant species at the centimeter-to-meter scales, a phenomenon known as "islands of fertility". Such fine-scale dynamics are challenging to detect with most satellite and manned airborne platforms. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an alternative option for detecting fine-scale soil nutrient and plant species changes in rangelands tn0020 smaller extents. We demonstrate that a model incorporating the fusion of UAV multispectral and structure-from-motion photogrammetry classifies plant functional types and bare soil cover with an overall accuracy of 95% in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment and disturbed by fire. We further demonstrate that employing UAV hyperspectral and LiDAR fusion greatly improves upon these results by classifying 9 different plant species and soil fertility microsite types (SFMT) with an overall accuracy of 87%. Among them, creosote bush and black grama, the most important native species in the rangeland, have the highest producer's accuracies at 98% and 94%, respectively. The integration of UAV LiDAR-derived plant height differences was critical in these improvements. Finally, we use synthesis of the UAV datasets with ground-based LiDAR surveys and lab characterization of soils to estimate that the burned rangeland potentially lost 1474 kg/ha of C and 113 kg/ha of N owing to soil erosion processes during the first year after a prescribed fire. However, during the second-year post-fire, grass and plant-interspace SFMT functioned as net sinks for sediment and nutrients and gained approximately 175 kg/ha C and 14 kg/ha N, combined. These results provide important site-specific insight that is relevant to the 423 Mha of grasslands and shrublands that are burned globally each year. While fire, and specifically post-fire erosion, can degrade some rangelands, post-fire plant-soil-nutrient dynamics might provide a competitive advantage to grasses in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment. These novel UAV and ground-based LiDAR remote sensing approaches thus provide important details towards more accurate accounting of the carbon and nutrients in the soil surface of rangelands.

AB This paper introduces the CASINO (CAnopy backscatter estimation, Subsampling, and Inhibited Nonlinear Optimisation) algorithm for above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation in tropical forests using P-band (435 MHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The algorithm has been implemented in a prototype processor for European Space Agency's (ESA's) 7th Earth Explorer Mission BIOMASS, scheduled for launch in 2023. CASINO employs an interferometric ground cancellation technique to estimate canopy backscatter (CB) intensity. A power law model (PLM) is then used to model the dependence of CB on AGB for a large number of systematically distributed SAR data samples and a small number of calibration areas with a known AGB. The PLM parameters and AGB for the samples are estimated simultaneously within pre-defined intervals using nonlinear minimisation of a cost function. The performance of CASINO is assessed over six tropical forest sites on two continents: two in French Guiana, South America and four in Gabon, Africa, using SAR data acquired during airborne ESA campaigns and processed to simulate BIOMASS acquisitions. Multiple tests with only two randomly selected calibration areas with AGB > 100 t/ha are conducted to assess AGB estimation performance given limited reference data. At 2.25 ha scale and using a single flight heading, the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) is <= 27% for at least 50% of all tests in each test site and using as reference AGB maps derived from airborne laser scanning data. An improvement is observed when two flight headings are used in combination. The most consistent AGB estimation (lowest RMSD variation across different calibration sets) is observed for test sites with a large AGB interval and average AGB around 200-250 t/ha. The most challenging conditions are in areas with AGB < 200 t/ha and large topographic variations. A comparison with 142 1 ha plots distributed across all six test sites and with AGB estimated from in situ measurements gives an RMSD of 20% (66 t/ha).

AB Multi-sensor remote sensing data fusion technologies have been developed and widely applied in recent years, providing a feasible and economical solution to increase the availability of high spatial and temporal resolution data. These methods, however, have been challenging to apply in highly heterogeneous areas, especially in complex agricultural landscapes where there are rapid changes at small scales, while features at larger scales change more slowly. In this study, we developed a novel method to reconstruct daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat and Landsat-like platforms, and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). This method utilizes a crop reference curve (CRC) approach, in which a set of NDVI time series are extracted from pure MODIS pixels (250 m resolution) identified using the CDL, and then used to fit Landsat-like observations (30 m). The CRC based method was applied over a complex agricultural landscape in the Choptank River watershed on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Landsat data from 2013 and 2014 and Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data from 2018 were used to reconstruct 30 m daily NDVI maps for major crop types. Results show that the relative error (RE) in reconstructed NDVI is around 6-8% during periods of rapid crop growth, and 3-5% during peak periods when growth is slow. The accuracy of the CRC method outperforms a standard image pair-based data fusion algorithm (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model; STARFM), which yields RE of 4-9% in slow-growth periods and 10-16% in fast-growth periods when clear Landsat images are scarce. The CRC method was also compared with time-series data fusion methods, including a harmonic fitting model and the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) model. The results show that CRC gives similar results when the Landsat-like image availability is high (around 27 images per year), but outperforms other methods when availability is limited (less than 15 images per year). The reconstructed NDVI time series for corn, soybean, winter wheat/soybean and forest at 30-m resolution show clear phenological patterns at the sub-field scale. The resulting 30-m NDVI timeseries data provide useful information for mapping crop phenology and monitoring crop condition in complex agricultural landscapes, especially for complex double-cropping areas. However, the input requirement of an accurate 30-m crop classification map constrains its application to areas and periods where classifications are available.

AB Computational and data handling limitations have constrained time-series analyses of land-cover change at high spatial resolution over large (e.g., continental) extents. However, a new set of cloud-computing services offer an opportunity for improving knowledge of land change at finer grain. We constructed a historical set of seven high resolution wall-to-wall land-cover maps at continental scale for Australia and analyzed temporal and spatial changes of land-cover from 1985 to 2015 at 5-year time-steps using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We used 281,962 Landsat scenes for producing median cloud-free composites at each time-step. We established a pseudo ground truth dataset and used a PCA-based outlier detection method to reduce its uncertainty. A random forest model was trained at each time-step for classifying raw data into six land-cover classes: Cropland, Forest, Grassland, Built-up, Water, and Other areas, using 49 predictor datasets and nearly 20,000 training points. We further constructed uncertainty maps at each time-step as a proxy of per-pixel confidence. The average overall accuracy of the seven 30 m-resolution land-cover maps was-93%. Built-up and Water areas displayed the highest user and producer accuracies (>93%), with Grasslands and Other areas slightly lower (similar to 82-88%). Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e., large expanses of a single land-cover class). Around 510,975 km(2) (+/- 69,877 km(2)) of land changed over the 30 years at an average of similar to 17,033 km(2) yr(-1) (+/- 2329 km(2) yr(-1)). Cropland and Forests declined by similar to 64,836 km(2) (+/- 16,437 km(2)) and similar to 152,492 km(2) (+/- 24,749 km(2)) over 30 years, mainly converting to Grassland. Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increases, increasing from 12,320 km(2) in 1985 to 15,013 km(2) in 2015 (similar to 19.2%, +/- 3.1%). The sensitivity, i.e., proportion of pixels correctly classified as having changed, was over 96%, whereas the specificity, i.e., the proportion of pixels correctly classified as no-change, was over 68%. Numerous potential applications of these first-of-their-kind, detailed spatiotemporal maps of land use and land-change assessment exist spanning many areas of environmental impact assessment, policy, and management. Similarly, this methodological framework can provide a useful template for assessing continental-scale, high-resolution land dynamics more broadly.

AB The southeastern United States is unique in terms of both the intensity and scale of forest management, which includes substantial thinning and other forms of harvesting. Because thinning is not a land use transition, and the disturbance signal is relatively subtle compared to a clear cut, there is a dearth of studies that attempt to detect thinning over large areas. Our goal was to detect pine thins as an indicator of active forest management using Landsat data. Areas which undergo thinning are indicative of active forest management in the region.
   Our approach uses a machine learning method which combines first-order harmonics and metrics from 3-year Fourier regression of Landsat time series stacks, layers from the Global Forest Change product, and other vetted national products into a random forests model to classify forest thins in the southeastern US. Forest Harvest Inspection Records for Virginia were used for training and validation. Models were successful separating thins from clear cuts and non-harvested pines (overall accuracy 86%, clear cut accuracy 90%, thin accuracy 83% for a simplified 10-predictor variable model).
   Examination of variable importance illustrates the physical meaning behind the models. The curve fit statistics (R-2 or RMSE) of the NDVI, Pan, and SWIR1 harmonic curve fits, which are an indication of a departure from typical vegetation phenology caused by thinning or other disturbances, were consistently among the top predictors. The harmonic regression constant, sine and cosine from the Landsat 8 panchromatic band were also important. These describe the visible reflectance (500-680 nm) phenology over the time period at a high spatial resolution (15 m). The Loss Year from the Global Forest Change product, which is an indication of stand replacing disturbance, was also consistently among the most important variables in the classifiers.
   High performance computing, such as Google Earth Engine, and analysis-ready data are important for this approach. This work has importance for quantification of actively managed forests in a region of the world where production forestry is the dominant land disturbance signal and a significant economic engine.

AB The development of effective strategies to manage the river ice breakup process or the associated risks is hindered by a lack of understanding and information. Radar earth observation satellites offer excellent potential for collecting up-to-date information on the conditions of and changes in river ice cover during the breakup period. This text describes the development, performance and limitations of an automated procedure to map breaking river ice by means of C-band, HH-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. An original two-step supervised classification model (IceBC), which uses backscatter intensities, lies at the core of the procedure. First, IceBC identifies three primary classes: water, sheet ice and rubble ice. Next, each primary ice class is divided in three secondary classes that denote top surface roughness scale differences. Input images must have incidence angles from similar to 27 degrees to similar to 60 degrees. Below similar to 36 degrees, IceBC may assign a class labelled "unclassified" to water or sheet ice pixels. The primary classification model yields overall accuracies of similar to 86% and similar to 93% for independent test pixels with incidence angles <= similar to 49 degrees and >= similar to 29 degrees or >= similar to 36 degrees, respectively. The associated class accuracies for water, sheet ice and rubble ice are similar to 97% & 96%, similar to 69% & 85% and similar to 97% & 99%. Given its connection to ice jam flood events, the classification accuracy achieved for rubble ice is particularly important. Maps produced by means of IceBC comprise detailed spatial information regarding ice cover conditions and the development of the breakup process. Their quality may be affected by: freezing conditions, wet snow cover, meltwater pools, infrastructure, rapids or high winds. Monitoring is the key to managing the impacts of most of these challenges. An IceBC prototype has been used operationally since 2015.

AB The functions and traits of plants are key to understanding and predicting the adaptation of ecosystems to environmental changes. Remote sensing has been used to monitor the status of vegetation across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The remote sensing of vegetation is now undergoing a paradigm shift from monitoring structural parameters to monitoring functional traits. In particular, recent advances in hyperspectral techniques of remote sensing provide an opportunity to map vegetation traits and functions over a range of scales. In this editorial, we first present the background of the recent advances in the remote sensing of vegetation traits and functions and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) of chlorophyll. We then summarize eight of the papers in this special issue that focus on new remote-sensing techniques and algorithms developed for retrieving plant functional traits, such as pigment and nitrogen contents and functional parameters. These contributions cover two major scientific themes: (1) estimating and monitoring plant traits and functions and (2) interpreting and understanding remotely sensed SIF signals. The research in this special issue will improve the development of the satellite remote sensing of plant traits and functions, allowing for improved estimation of vegetation processes such as photosynthesis and its associated water and carbon cycles.

AB The ESA's forthcoming FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission is dedicated to the global monitoring of the vegetation's chlorophyll fluorescence by means of an imaging spectrometer, FLORIS. In order to properly interpret the fluorescence signal in relation to photosynthetic activity, essential vegetation variables need to be retrieved concomitantly. FLEX will fly in tandem with Sentinel-3 (S3), which conveys the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that is designed to characterize the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation at a spatial resolution of 300 m. In this work we present the retrieval models of four essential biophysical variables: (1) Leaf Area Index (LAI), (2) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), (3) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and (4) fractional vegetation cover (FCover). These variables can be operationally inferred by hybrid retrieval approaches, which combine the generalization capabilities offered by radiative transfer models (RTMs) with the flexibility and computational efficiency of machine learning methods. The RTM SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) was used to generate a database of reflectance spectra corresponding to a large variety of canopy realizations, which served subsequently as input to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm for each targeted variable. Three sets of GPR models were developed, based on different spectral band settings: (1) OLCI (21 bands between 400 and 1040 nm), (2) FLORIS (281 bands between 500 and 780 nm), and (3) their synergy. Their respective performances were assessed based on simulated reflectance scenes. Regarding the retrieval of Cab, the OLCI model gave good model performances (R-2: 0.91; RMSE: 7.6 mu g. cm(-2)), yet superior accuracies were achieved as a result of FLORIS' higher spectral resolution (R-2: 0.96; RMSE: 4.8 mu g. cm(-2)). The synergy of both datasets did not further enhance the variable retrieval. Regarding LAI, the improvement of the model performances by using only FLORIS spectra (R-2: 0.87; RMSE: 1.05 m(2).m(-2)) rather than only OLCI spectra (R-2: 0.86; RMSE: 1.12 m(2).m(-2)) was less evident but merging both data sets was more beneficial (R-2: 0.88; RMSE: 1.01 m(2).m(-2)). Finally, the three data sources gave good model performances for the retrieval of fAPAR and Fcover, with the best performing model being the Synergy model (fAPAR: R-2: 0.99; RMSE: 0.02 and FCover: R-2: 0.98; RMSE: 0.04). The ability of the models to process real data was subsequently demonstrated by applying the OLCI models to S3 surface reflectance products acquired over Western Europe and Argentina. Obtained maps showed consistent patterns and variable ranges, and comparison against corresponding Sentinel-2 products (coarsened to a 300 m spatial resolution) led to reasonable matches (R-2: 0.5-0.7). Altogether, given the availability of the multiple data sources, the FLEX tandem mission will foster unique opportunities to quantify essential vegetation properties, and hence facilitate the interpretation of the measured fluorescence levels.

AB This paper proposed an improved method for separating soil and vegetation component temperatures from one pixel land surface temperature (LST) using multi-pixel and multi-temporal data. The two main features of the method are (1) the use of a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to describe component temperatures and (2) the application of a spatial weighting matrix to consider the spatial correlation of component temperatures. The proposed method was evaluated using an extensive simulated dataset with five component temperature types, three LST errors and 69 fractional vegetation cover (FVC) types, and field measurements with a high temporal frequency. Due to the time extendibility of DTC model, the possibility for retrieving component temperatures at any time was analyzed. Correspondingly, the schemes for selecting the best observations for four representative periods, i.e., 10:00-12:00, 09:00-18:00, 18:00-03:00 (on the next day) and 09:00-03:00, were determined. The validations showed satisfactory accuracies, and it was found that the errors were significantly influenced by the original LST retrieval error. In addition, the difference between the ideal temperature pattern from the DTC model and the actual temperature variation also affected the accuracy of the temporally extended component temperatures. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicated that the separation accuracy was independent of the uncertainty of the component emissivity but was influenced by FVC. Specifically, the retrieval accuracy was sensitive to the size and variation of FVC, and the latter had a more significant influence, but the result was less sensitive to the retrieval error and angular effect of FVC. Considering its accuracy, operability and robustness, the proposed method is effective for separating soil and vegetation component temperatures.

AB With a growing number of Earth observation (EO) products available through operational programmes such as the European Union's Copernicus, there is increasing emphasis on product accuracy and uncertainty, necessitating evaluation against in situ reference measurements. Whilst existing reference datasets have proven a valuable resource, they incorporate little data with which products from recent EO instruments can be assessed. A reliance on individual field campaigns has also led to several inconsistencies, whilst limiting the extent to which temporal variations in EO product performance can be captured. Recently established environmental monitoring networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which collect routine in situ measurements using standardised instruments and protocols, provide a promising opportunity in this respect. The Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service was initiated in recognition of this fact. In the first component of the project, raw observations from existing networks have been collected and processed to provide reference data for a range of EO land products. In this study, we focus on leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Raw digital hemispherical photography (DHP) from twenty NEON sites was processed to derive in situ reference measurements, which were then upscaled to provide high spatial resolution reference maps. Using these data, we assess the recently released Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) 300 m Version 1 (V1) products derived from PROBA-V, in addition to existing products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). When evaluated against reference data, the CGLS 300 m V1 product demonstrated the best agreement (RMSD = 0.57 for LAI and 0.08 for FAPAR), followed by the Collection 6 VNP15A2H and MOD15A2H products (RMSD = 0.81 to 0.89 for LAI and 0.12 for FAPAR). Differing assumptions of the products and in situ reference measurements, which cause them to be sensitive to slightly different quantities, are thought to explain apparent biases over sparse vegetation and forest environments. To ensure their continued utility, future work should focus on updating the GBOV in situ reference measurements, implementing additional corrections, and improving their geographical representativeness.

AB Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data with both rich spectral and spatial features can effectively improve the classification accuracy of vegetation species. However, the spectral data of hundreds of bands brings about problems such as dimensional explosion, which poses a huge challenge for hyperspectral remote sensing classification based on classical parameters models. Deep learning methods have been used for remotely sensed images classification in recent years, but the popular HSI datasets including Kennedy Space Center, Indian Pines, Pavia University scene and Salinas scene, have low spatial resolution, significant differences between categories, and regular boundaries. When applied to the classification of forestry tree species, the accuracy often decreases because the spectral response of different plants of the same family and genus are very similar, especially under the fragmented species distribution, complex topography and the occluded canopy. So we collect new data sets, selected Gaofeng State Owned Forest Farm in Guangxi province in south China as the research area and adopted the airborne hyperspectral data obtained by the LiCHy system of the Chinese Academy of Forestry to explore an improved three-dimensional convolutional neural network(3D-CNN) model for tree species classification. The proposed model uses raw data as input without dimension reduction or feature screening, and simultaneously extracts spectral and spatial features. After the 3D convolutional layer, the captured high-level semantic concept is a joint spatial spectral feature representation, so we can turn it into a one-dimensional feature as a new input to learn a more abstract level of expression. The widely used earlystop method is also used to prevent overfitting. The proposed model is a lightweight, generalized, and fast convergence classification model, by which the short-time and large-area of multiple tree species classification with high-precision can be realized. The result shows that the 3D-1D CNN model can shorten the training time of the 3D CNN model by 60% and achieve a classification accuracy of 93.14% within 50 ha in 6.37 min, which provides a basis for the classification of tree species, the mapping of forest form and the inventory of forest resources.

AB The understanding of subsurface events that cannot be directly observed is dependent on the ability to relate surface-based observations to subsurface processes. This is particularly important for nuclear explosion monitoring, as any future clandestine tests will likely be underground. We collected ground-based lidar and optical imagery using remote, very-low-altitude unmanned aerial system platforms, before and after several underground high explosive experiments. For the lidar collections, we used a terrestrial lidar scanner to obtain highresolution point clouds and create digital elevation models (DEMs). For the imagery collections, we used structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and a dense grid of surveyed ground control points to create high-resolution DEMs. Comparisons between the pre- and post-experiment DEMs indicate changes in surface topography that vary between explosive experiments with varying yield and depth parameters. Our work shows that the relationship between explosive yield and the extent of observable surface change differs from the standard scaled-depth-of-burial model. This suggests that the surface morphological change from underground high explosive experiments can help constrain the experiments' yield and depth, and may impact how such activities are monitored and verified.

AB The influence of adjacency effect on high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery in the visible and near infrared region has been studies since the 1980s. However, the adjacency effect is usually neglected in the thermal infrared (TIR) region. The conventional TIR radiative transfer equation (RTE) only takes into account radiance from target pixel and neglects radiance contribution from surrounding background pixels. In this study, two TIR RTEs taking into account the adjacency effect for uniform and non-uniform Lambertian surfaces were deduced based on the radiative transfer theory. In terms of the TIR RTEs, we analyze the dominating influence factors of the adjacency effect and quantify the magnitude of the adjacency effect in the TIR region using simulation and actual satellite data. Two different definitions of the adjacency effect are presented in this study: (1) the effect due to radiance from background pixels scattered into sensor's instantaneous field of view, and (2) the effect due to apparent thermal contrast between target and background pixels. The results show that atmospheric visibility, water vapor content, sensor spectral band, and background pixel land surface temperature (LST) have significant influence on the adjacency effect. For a specific simulation scene, the magnitude of the first definition of the adjacency effect is larger than 0.5 K when atmospheric visibility is lower than 23 km. This magnitude is as much as 2 K under haze weather conditions with atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results indicate that the adjacency effect should be taken into account in the radiative transfer simulation. The magnitude of the second definition of the adjacency effect is less than 0.3 K, even at atmospheric visibility of 5 km. The results reveal that the accuracy of the TIR RTE for a uniform Lambertian surface is enough for the development of LST retrieval algorithm under relatively haze weather conditions. In situ LST measurements collected at the Hailar, Urad Front Banner, and Wuhai sites in China were used to validate the accuracies of the LST retrieved by the RTE-based single channel algorithm with/without adjacency effect correction. There are nearly no discrepancies between the LST retrieved with/without adjacency effect correction when aerosol optical depth (AOD) is low than 0.3. However, the RMSE of the differences between the retrieved LST and the in situ LST decreases from approximately 1.4 K for the LST retrieved without adjacency effect correction to approximately 0.6 K for the LST retrieved with adjacency effect correction when AOD is high than 0.3.

AB Although accurate 3-D reservoir bathymetry is a key input for multiple applications (such as global hydrological models, local water resources related studies, and others), such information is only available for very few locations. To fill this knowledge gap, we generated a 30 m resolution bathymetry dataset for 347 global reservoirs, representing a total volume of 3123 km(3) (50% of the global reservoir capacity). First, Area-Elevation (A-E) relationships for the identified reservoirs were derived by combining altimetry data from multiple satellites with Landsat imagery data. Next, the resulting A-E relationships were applied to the Surface Water Occurrence (SWO) data from the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset to obtain bathymetry values for the dynamic areas of the reservoirs. Lastly, an extrapolation method was adopted to help achieve the full bathymetry dataset. The remotely sensed bathymetry results were primarily validated against the following: (1) They were validated against Area-Elevation (A-E) and Elevation-Volume (E-V) relationships derived from the in situ elevations and volumes for 16 reservoirs, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of elevation from 0.06 m to 1.99 m, and normalized RMSE values of storage from 0.56% to 4.40%. (2) They were also validated against survey bathymetric maps for four reservoirs, with R-2 values from 0.82 to 0.99 and RMSE values from 0.13 m to 2.31 m. The projected portions have relatively large errors and uncertainties (compared to the remotely sensed portions) because the extrapolated elevations cannot fully capture the underwater topography. Overall, this approach performs better for reservoirs with a large dynamic area fractions. It can also be applied to small reservoirs (e.g., reservoirs with surface areas of a few square kilometers or less), where ICESat observations are available, and to large natural lakes. With the contribution of ICESat-2, this dataset has the potential to be expanded to thousands of reservoirs and lakes in the future.

Megacities in particular are facing severe problems due to excessive population growth, urban area expansion, human activity, increased energy consumption, and increased anthropogenic heat. In this study, a physical modeling approach based on a triple-source surface energy balance (triple-SEB) model was developed to uncover the effect of AHF on land surface temperature (LST) and surface anthropogenic heat island (SAHI) intensity. For this purpose, satellite imagery along with climatic and meteorological data from 1985 to 2019 were studied for six selected megacities: Los Angeles, Atlanta, Athens, Istanbul, Tehran, and Beijing. First, LST and the fraction of different surface covers were calculated by using a single-channel algorithm and a normalized spectral mixture analysis model, respectively. In the second step, impervious surface cover (ISC) and the urban main boundary area (UMBA) of each city were extracted based on the biophysical composite index and city clustering algorithm, respectively. In the third step, anthropogenic LST (ALST) was modeled using a triple-SEB model. In the fourth step, the ALST and UMBA were used together to model SAHI intensity at different dates. Finally, the relationship between the estimated ALST and ISC, as well as between SAHI and ISC, was examined. Results show that the average value of estimated ALST for the megacities increased from 2.02, 0.55, 0.61, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.72 to 2.99, 1.73, 1.66, 1.19, 2.32, and 2.76 degrees C, respectively. The coefficient of determination between the mean value of ISC and the estimated ALST for all megacities yielded 0.8, which was higher than that between ISC and satellite-derived LST. Moreover, the SAHI intensity for these megacities was found to have increased to 0.73, 0.92, 0.95, 0.98, 0.95 and 1.32 degrees C, respectively, which can be predicted by ISC with a coefficient of determination of 0.78, 0.79, 0.79, 0.73, 0.71 and 0.52, respectively. This suggests that the triple-SEB model proposed by this study allowed for independent modeling of AHF's influence on SUHI and a better determination of the effect of ISC on LST and SUHI intensity. This approach facilitated comparative analysis of LST and SAHI for a city at different times as well as SAHIs in different cities with different geographic and climate settings.

AB The accurate estimate of surface chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) by remote sensing presents a number of challenges where inherent and apparent optical properties have significant spatial or temporal variability. Indeed, Chla algorithms for Case 2 waters are often lake or region specific, and they are usually highly sensitive to changes in the dominant chromophoric constituents. This study develops and validates an absorption-specific approach to estimating Chla across an optically heterogeneous dataset. The approach is based on the classification of the optically dominant constituent. We tested this approach with in situ data from Taihu Lake, Poyang Lake, Chaohu Lake, Shitoukoumen Reservoir, Pearl River Estuary and Daya Bay as well as using HydroLight simulated data. The results show an improved performance when compared to most single Chla algorithms. We validated the approach with data from the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Results showed that this absorption-specific approach provided good Chla estimates over clear to very turbid waters with a wide range of optical conditions (R-2 = 0.76, r(RMSE) = 35%, n = 230, p < 0.01).

AB Monitoring irrigation is essential for an efficient management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. We propose to estimate the timing and the amount of irrigation throughout the agricultural season using optical and thermal Landsat-7/8 data. The approach is implemented in four steps: i) partitioning the Landsat land surface temperature (LST) to derive the crop water stress coefficient (Ks), ii) estimating the daily root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from the integration of Landsat-derived Ks into a crop water balance model, iii) retrieving irrigation at the Landsat pixel scale and iv) aggregating pixel-scale irrigation estimates at the crop field scale. The new irrigation retrieval method is tested over three agricultural areas during four seasons and is evaluated over five winter wheat fields under different irrigation techniques (drip, flood and no-irrigation). The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R similar to 0.95 and RMSE similar to 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and -8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.

AB The attention towards possible link of earthquakes (EQs) and ionosphere in the form of seismo ionosphere anomalies (SIAs) has increased exponentially by utilizing new data and more accurate observations. The integrated atmosphere and ionosphere monitoring satellites has played a decisive role in this development and provided detection and analysis of anomalies attributed to seismic processes. In this paper, we study EQ anomalies in ionosphere from IGS permanent Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based Total Electron Content (TEC) and f(o)F2 parameter (highest frequency reflected from the main ionospheric F2 layer on a vertical propagation path), retrieved from stations operating within the seismogenic zone in Japan for EQs of magnitude M-w > 6.0. Furthermore, spatial composite maps of geopotential height, air temperature, and Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Center for Environmental Prediction (NOAA/NCEP) are analyzed to support the hypothesis of diffusion of SIAs through the atmosphere over the epicenter during the seismic preparation zone. We find evidences of TEC and f(o)F2 anomalies in the analysis of nearby IGS permanent stations within seismogenic zone on main shock day, when geomagnetic activities remain quiet. In addition, atmospheric composite indices manifest anomalies attributed to the EQ on the same day as TEC and f(o)F2 perturbations. Similarly, differential ionosphere and atmosphere values indicate that EQ abnormalities are significant on main shock day during UT = 10-12. Our results show that atmospheric and ionospheric measurements may play a role for the analysis and prediction of EQs.

AB Satellite radar altimetry has been widely used in the monitoring of water levels of lakes, rivers and wetlands in the past decades. The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth's surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016-2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis.

AB Remote sensing-derived cropland products have depicted the location and extent of agricultural lands with an ever increasing accuracy. However, limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands, and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semi-arid areas. In the Sahel, one of the largest dryland regions worldwide, crop-fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration. Yet, little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, regardless of the spatial scale. With a 10 m spatial resolution and a 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields, facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for big data handling. Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10 m resolution for the baseline year 2017, accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas. Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution, the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63% (403,617 km(2)) for the Sahel in 2017. Similar results are obtained for five contemporary cropland products, with fallow fields occupying 57-62% of the cropland area. Yet, it is noted that the total estimated area coverage depends on the quality of the different cropland products. The share of cropped fields within the Copernicus cropland area is found to be higher in the arid regions (200-300 mm rainfall) as compared to the semi-arid regions (300-600 mm rainfall). The woody cover fraction within cropped and fallow fields is found to have a reversed pattern between arid (higher woody cover in cropped fields) and semi-arid (higher woody cover in fallow fields) regions. The method developed, using cloud-based Earth Observation (EO) data and computation on the GEE platform, is expected to be reproducible for mapping the extent of fallow fields across global croplands. Future applications based on multi-year time series is expected to improve our understanding of crop-fallow rotation dynamics in grass fallow systems being key in teasing apart how cropland intensification and expansion affect environmental variables, such as soil fertility, crop yields and local livelihoods in low-income regions such as the Sahel.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) from the land surface is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. Since the advent of Earth observation by satellites, various models have been developed to use thermal and shortwave remote sensing data for ET estimation. In this review, we provide a brief account of the key milestones in the history of remote sensing ET model development in two categories: temperature-based and conductance-based models. Temperature-based ET models utilize land surface temperature (LST) observed through thermal remote sensing to calculate the sensible heat flux from which ET is estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance or to estimate the evaporative fraction from which ET is derived from the available energy. Models of various complexities have been developed to estimate ET from surfaces of different vegetation fractions. One-source models combine soil and vegetation into a composite surface for ET estimation, while two-source models estimate ET of soil and vegetation components separately. Image contexture-based triangular and trapezoid models are simple and effective temperature-based ET models based on spatial and/or temporal variation patterns of LST. Several effective temporal scaling schemes are available for extending instantaneous temperature-based ET estimation to daily or longer time periods. Conductance-based ET models usually use the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation to estimate ET with shortwave remote sensing data. A key put to these models is canopy conductance to water vapor, which depends on canopy structure and leaf stomatal conductance. Shortwave remote sensing data are used to determine canopy structural parameters, and stomatal conductance can be estimated in different ways. Based on the principle of the coupling between carbon and water cycles, stomatal conductance can be reliably derived from the plant photosynthesis rate. Three types of photosynthesis models are available for deriving stomata] or canopy conductance: (1) big-leaf models for the total canopy conductance, (2) two-big-leaf models for canopy conductances for sunlit and shaded leaf groups, and (3) two-leaf models for stomatal conductances for the average sunlit and shaded leaves separately. Correspondingly, there are also big-leaf, two-big-leaf and two-leaf ET models based on these conductances. The main difference among them is the level of aggregation of conductances before the P-M equation is used for ET estimation, with big-leaf models having the highest aggregation. Since the relationship between ET and conductance is nonlinear, this aggregation causes negative bias errors, with the big-leaf models having the largest bias. It is apparent from the existing literature that two-leaf conductance-based ET models have the least bias in comparison with flux measurements. Based on this review, we make the following recommendations for future work: (1) improving key remote sensing products needed for ET mapping purposes, including soil moisture, foliage clumping index, and leaf carboxylation rate, (2) combining temperature-based and conductance-based models for regional ET estimation, (3) refining methodologies for tight coupling between carbon and water cycles, (4) fully utilizing vegetation structural and biochemical parameters that can now be reliably retrieved from shortwave remote sensing, and (5) to improve regional and global ET monitoring capacity.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables 24-hour, all-weather flood monitoring. However, accurate detection of inundated areas can be hindered by the extremely complicated electromagnetic interaction phenomena between microwave pulses, and horizontal and vertical targets. This manuscript focuses on the problem of inundation mapping in areas with emerging vegetation, where spatial and seasonal heterogeneity makes the systematic distinction between dry and flooded backscatter response even more difficult. In this context, image interpretation algorithms have mostly used detailed field data and reference image(s) to implement electromagnetic models or change detection techniques. However, field data are rare, and despite the increasing availability of SAR acquisitions, adequate reference image(s) might not be readily available, especially for fine resolution acquisitions. To by-pass this problem, this study presents an algorithm for automatic flood mapping in areas with emerging vegetation when only single SAR acquisitions and common ancillary data are available. First, probability binning is used for statistical analysis of the backscatter response of wet and dry vegetation for different land cover types. This analysis is then complemented with information on land use, morphology and context within a fuzzy logic approach. The algorithm was applied to three fine resolution images (one ALOS-PALSAR and two COSMO-SkyMed) acquired during the January 2011 flood in the Condamine-Balonne catchment (Australia). Flood extent layers derived from optical images were used as validation data, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm had an overall accuracy higher than 80% for all case studies. Notwithstanding the difficulty to fully discriminate between dry and flooded vegetation backscatter heterogeneity using a single SAR image, this paper provides an automatic, data parsimonious algorithm for the detection of floods under vegetation.

AB Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms in permafrost areas, and their formation can be attributed to the thawing of ice-rich permafrost. The spatial distribution and impacts of RTSs on the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood due to their remote location and the technical challenges of automatic mapping. In this study, we innovatively applied DeepLabv3 +, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, to Planet CubeSat images, which are satellite images with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our method allows us to automatically delineate 220 RTSs within an area of 5200 km(2) with an average precision of 0.541. The corresponding precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.863, 0.833, and 0.848 respectively, when the threshold of intersection over union is 0.5. Moreover, approximately 100 experiments on k-fold cross-validation (k = 3, 5, and 10) and data augmentation show that our method is robust. And a test in a different geographic area shows that the generalization of the trained model is very good. We find that (1) most of the RTSs are small (areas < eight ha and perimeters < 2000 m) and (2) RTSs preferentially develop at locations with gentle slopes (four to eight degrees), and in areas lower than the surroundings (the mean topographic position index is - 0.17) and receiving less solar radiation (i.e., north-facing slopes). The results show that the method can map RTSs automatically from Planet CubeSat images and can potentially be applied to larger areas.

AB Satellite-based active fire data provide indispensable information for monitoring global fire activity and understanding its impacts on climate and air quality. Yet the limited spatiotemporal sampling capacities of current satellites result in considerable uncertainties in fire observation and emissions estimation. The mitigation of these uncertainties mainly relies on new remote-sensing technology. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series observes fires across North and South Americas at an unprecedentedly spatiotemporal resolution of nominal 2 km every 5-15 min. This study evaluated the GOES-16 (the first GOES-R satellite) ABI active fire product using active fire data derived from the 30-m Landsat-8 and the 375-m and 750-m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and ground-based burning data across the southeastern Conterminous United States (CONUS) during the 2018 peak fire season. Specifically, we characterized the overall fire detection performance of the ABI active fire detections, estimated omission and commission errors, and evaluated ABI fire radiative power (FRP). The results showed that the ABI fire detection probability and its omission and commission errors were highly related to fire size and temporal period. ABI detection probability was higher than 95% for the fire pixel that contained over 114 Landsat-8 (30 m) fire detections or 11 VIIRS (375 m) detections. During a period of +/- 8 h, ABI detected 19% and 29% more fires observed by Landsat-8 and 375-m VIIRS, respectively. Correspondingly, the omission error could reduce by up to 33%. Further, ABI was able to detect 6-22% and 31-42% more ground-recorded fires than VIIRS in Georgia and Florida States, respectively, but ABI still missed many very small fires because ABI was hard to detect fires smaller than similar to 34.5 MW. Additionally, compared with 750-m VIIRS FRP, ABI FRP was similar to 30-50% larger in individual fire events but was overall similar at a regional scale.

AB The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode sea level anomalies (SLAs) of Sentinel-3A altimetry mission around the Australian coastal region were validated using eight in situ tide gauge sea level records and retracked Jason-3 datasets from a modified Brown-peaky (MBP) retracker. The MBP is a modified version of our existing Brown-peaky retracker aimed at enhancing BP's performance. We compared the noise of Sentinel-3A SLAs averaged across three posting rates (i.e. 1 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz) with the 1 Hz noise of MBP-derived Jason-3 SLAs. At distances >10 km from the coast, the noise level of 1 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs (similar to 1.2 cm) is lower than that of the MBP-retracked Jason-3 SLAs (similar to 1.7 cm). Moreover, the noise level of 2 Hz Sentinel-3A SLAs is comparable to that of the 1 Hz MBP-derived Jason-3 dataset, indicating that Sentinel-3A can provide precise SLAs at finer spatial scales. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of differences between the tide gauge SLA time series and the equivalent SLA time series at each along-track altimeter point was used to assess pointwise data quality. For both Sentinel-3A and MBP-retracked Jason-3, the along-track RMSEs of 20 Hz SLAs vary between 0.05 m and 0.2 m. The mean and standard deviation (STD) of 1 Hz SLA differences at crossover points were computed for each individual altimetry mission to assess overall data quality. When compared with the crossover analysis results, the quality of Sentinel-3A SLAs is superior to that of the retracked Jason-3 dataset in terms of smaller STDs at crossover points (8.8 cm vs. 10.7 cm).

AB Long-term ocean color satellite missions have the ability to help monitor algal blooms. However, satellite identification of algal blooms and species in turbid coastal waters has been challenging. There is an urgent need for simple and effective methods to identify locations, areas, durations, and species present in algal blooms through satellite observation, to aid in the operational and emergency monitoring of the marine environment. In this study, based on a three-band blended model, we propose an indicator (Red tide Detection Index, RDI) that is suitable for the purpose of detecting algal blooms in turbid coastal waters using multi-source ocean color data. MERIS, MODIS, and GOCI data used for the detection of algal blooms demonstrate consistent results using the RDI indicator, and these results correlate with in situ investigations. Furthermore, based on a green-red spectral slope, we propose a method that uses MERIS data to identify dominant species of diatoms and dinoflagellates in algal blooms in the East China Sea (ECS). The 10-year time series MERIS data collected between 2003 and 2012 indicates that algal bloom occurrences are mainly distributed in the nearshore areas of the ECS, and possess a distinct climatological cycle. The 10-year time series MERIS data help discriminate diatom and dinoflagellate blooms in the ECS, and show the dissimilarity in the seasonal timing of their life cycles. We find that these two dominant species in algal blooms are usually distributed in different spatial locations in the ECS. Additionally, by defining a divergence index (DI), the limitations of spectral resolutions of satellite data used for algal bloom species differentiation are quantitatively assessed.

AB In this study, we set up a new drone-borne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for soil moisture mapping. The whole radar system weighs 1.5 kg and consists of a handheld vector network analyzer (VNA) working as frequency domain radar, a lightweight hybrid horn-dipole antenna covering a wide frequency range (250-2800 MHz), a GPS for positioning, a microcomputer with the controlling application, and a smartphone for remote control. Soil moisture is derived from the radar data using full-wave inverse modeling based on the radar equation of Lambot et al. and multilayered media Green's functions. The inversion is performed in the time domain and focuses on the surface reflection. The antenna-drone system is characterized by global reflection and transmission functions which are determined through a calibration procedure. We performed drone-GPR measurements over three different agricultural fields in the loess belt region of Belgium. In this study, we used the 500-700 MHz range to avoid soil surface roughness effects and to focus on the top 10-20 cm of the soil. These fields present a range of landform conditions leading to specific soil moisture distributions. The soil moisture maps were constructed from the local measurements using kriging. The obtained soil moisture maps are in good agreement with the topographical conditions of the fields and aerial orthophotography observations. These results demonstrated the potential and benefits of drone-GPR for fast, high-resolution mapping of soil moisture at the field scale, and to support, e.g., precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

AB The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and its sole scientific instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), was launched on 15 September 2018 with a primary goal of measuring changes in the surface of the Earth's land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). ATLAS is a photon-counting laser altimeter, which records the transit time of individual photons in order to reconstruct surface height along track. The ground-track pattern repeats every 91 days such that changes in ice sheet surface height can be estimated through time. In this paper, we describe the set of algorithms that have been developed for ICESat-2 to retrieve ice sheet surface height from the geolocated photons for the Land Ice Along-Track Height Product (ATL06), and demonstrate their output and performance using a synthetic dataset over various land-ice surfaces and under different cloud conditions. We show that the ATL06 algorithm is expected to perform at the level required to meet the ICESat-2 science objectives for land ice.

AB The direct and diffuse components of downward shortwave radiation (SW), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the Earth surface play an essential role in biochemical (e.g. photosynthesis) and physical (e.g. energy balance) processes that control weather and climate conditions, and many ecological processes. Space based observations have the unique advantage of providing reliable estimates of SW and PAR globally with sufficient accuracy for constructing Earth's radiation budget and estimating land-surface fluxes that control these processes. However, most existing space-based SW and PAR estimations from sensors onboard polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites have inherently low temporal resolution and/or limited spatial coverage of the entire Earth surface. The unique location/orbit of Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to obtain global estimates of SW and PAR accurately at a high temporal resolution of about 1-2 h. In this study, we developed and used a model (random forest, RF) to estimate global hourly SW and PAR at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees (about 10 km at equator) spatial resolution based on EPIC measurements. We used a combination of EPIC Level-2 products, including solar zenith angle, aerosol optical depth, cloud optical thickness, cloud fraction, total column ozone and surface pressure with their associated quality flags to drive the RF model for estimating SW and PAR. We evaluated the model results against in situ observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD). We found the EPIC SW and PAR estimates at both hourly and daily time scales to be highly correlated and consistent with these independently obtained in situ measurements. The RMSEs for estimated daily diffuse SW, direct SW, total SW, and total PAR were 19.10, 38.47, 33.52, and 14.09 W/m(2), respectively, and the biases for these estimates were 1.71, -0.77, 1.04 and 4.11 W/m(2), respectively. We further compared the estimated SW and PAR with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic 1 degrees x 1 degrees (CERES SYN1deg) products and found a good correlation and consistency in their accuracy, spatial patterns and latitudinal gradient. The EPIC SW and PAR estimates provide a unique dataset (i.e. observations from single instrument from pole-to-pole for the entire sunlit portion of Earth) for characterizing their diurnal cycles and their potential impact on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes.

AB Optimal Estimation (OE) methods can simultaneously estimate surface and atmospheric properties from remote Visible/Shortwave imaging spectroscopy. Simultaneous solutions can improve retrieval accuracy with principled uncertainty quantification for hypothesis testing. While OE has been validated under benign atmospheric conditions, future global missions will observe environments with high aerosol and water vapor loadings. This work addresses the gap with diverse scenes from NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) India campaign. We refine atmospheric models to represent variable aerosol optical depths and properties. We quantify retrieval accuracy and information content for both reflectance and aerosols over different surface types, comparing results to in situ and remote references. Additionally, we assess uncertainty of maximum a posteriori solutions using linearized estimates as well as sampling-based inversions that more completely characterize posterior uncertainties. Principled uncertainty quantification can combine multiple spacecraft data products while preventing local environmental biases in future global investigations.

AB Landsat satellites have been operating since 1972, providing the longest continuous observation record of the Earth's land surface. Over the past half century, the Landsat user community has grown exponentially, encompassing more diverse and evolving scientific research and operational uses. Understanding current and future user needs is crucial to informing the design of Landsat missions beyond Landsat 9. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a user needs collection process to document needs from U.S. Federal civil subject matter experts who rely on moderate-resolution land imaging data across a diverse range of scientific research and application domains. In total, 379 moderate-resolution land imaging user needs were collected through structured interviews. The findings indicate that, at present, users need continuity in Landsat capabilities with free and open data access. Improvements to future Landsat systems should include 10 m spatial resolution and at least weekly cloud-free observation frequency. Spectral enhancements should include the addition of red edge bands, and multiple, narrower visible, near infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared bands. Ideally, a variety of applications need continuous, full-spectrum coverage in 10 nm-wide bands spanning the visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) region (400-2500 nm) and 5 to 8 multispectral thermal infrared bands. Non-Federal (state, local, commercial, academic, and international) sources found similar results, but a more comprehensive comparison across these communities through a broader survey may provide additional insights. USGS-collected moderate-resolution land imaging user needs are an input to the Landsat 10 Architecture Study to develop and assess feasible Landsat 10 mission architectures.

AB Nighttime cool skin sea surface temperature (SST) signals, defined in this study as the differences between the SSTskin from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard Envisat satellite and in situ SSTs from drifting buoys and moorings, Delta T = SSTskin - SSTinsitu, are investigated on a global scale from July 2002 to April 2012. Global mean Delta T, averaged over the full study period, is -0.13 K, with most values falling between -0.1 and -0.2 K. The dominant role of wind speed on the Delta T is shown, with weaker winds usually corresponding to a cooler skin. The effect of air-sea temperature difference is also significant: warm skin (Delta T > 0 K) can be observed under large positive air-sea temperature differences. Other geophysical variables, such as the total column water vapor, in situ SST, and net heat flux, also affect Delta T, but to a lesser degree. Significant increase of Delta T size with SSTinsitu is observed when SSTinsitu is > 28 degrees C. Tropical waters, such as the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical warm pool (western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean), are more frequently covered with a cool skin, largely due to the calm winds, very warm waters (especially for SSTinsitu > 28 degrees C), and other environmental conditions supporting the development of large cool skin events. The Delta T seasonal pattern in the southern hemisphere is more regular, compared to the northern hemisphere. In both hemispheres, larger cool skin signals are seen during the local summer, mainly due to weaker winds. According to several previous cool skin models, higher winds tend to result in thinner cool skin layer depths, and hence in smaller Delta T amplitudes, regardless of stronger evaporation and heat loss. Given that wind is closely coupled with waves and turbulent mixing with wave breaking, the dependencies of Delta T on a few wave parameters are also investigated. A strong (moderate) dependency of Delta T on wave height (wave steepness) is identified, while the dependency of Delta T on wave breaking probability is less discernible.

AB The monitoring of forest phenology in a cost-effective manner, at a fine spatial scale and over relatively large areas remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, similar to 7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of < 1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is effective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phonological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R-2 < 0.50) in this study. An opportunity is now available to track very fine scale land surface changes over contiguous vegetation communities, providing information which could improve characterization of vegetation phonology at multiple scales.

AB Remote sensing can inform agricultural knowledge of crop water use through observation of land surface temperature, which can act as an indicator of plant function and health. This study uses remotely sensed data to quantify thermal variability within fruit and nut orchards during an intense drought period in California's Central Valley (2013-2015). First, fractions of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil were derived for a variety of crop species using visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectra imaged by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Fractional estimates were then used to select thermal endmembers for each class using simultaneously collected MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) thermal imagery and a crop species map. Expected pixel temperatures of non-stressed crop fields were then modeled, and the per-pixel difference between measured and expected temperatures was calculated as a temperature residual. Crop residuals serve to capture variability in temperature that may be attributable to differences in crop health and/or management practices. We found multiple distinct thermal classes to exist across the study site. Furthermore, crop temperatures correlated to expected crop ET rates, and temperature residuals showed correlations to changes in crop yields during the study period. Further assessment of findings revealed an increase in temperature residuals during the study period that is consistent with increasing stress, likely linked to the progression of drought. The method presented here shows utility for regional agricultural analysis of crop water use and is particularly relevant for ECOSTRESS and the upcoming Surface Biology & Geology mission.

AB Surface sail moisture is a critical but often neglected component of the hydrologic budget. Within mountain environments, surface soil moisture is highly heterogeneous and challenging to measure. Point measurements are often poorly representative of larger areas, while satellite pixels are generally too coarse in these topographically varied landscapes. In the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, rapid glacier recession is impacting downstream water supply in timing, quantity and quality. Recent research has shown that these proglacial valleys provide vital ecosystem services and store considerable amounts of water within the groundwater systems. However, the spatial and temporal variability of soil water storage is poorly understood. In this tropical Andean setting, we use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with multispectral (visible, near infrared, thermal infrared) sensors to map sections of two proglacial valleys in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru at sub-metre resolution. We use the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) (Sandholt et al., 2002), and apply it for the first time to UAV borne imagery to estimate absolute surface soil moisture through calibration with in-scene field measurements. Resulting surface soil moisture maps have 50 cm spatial resolution with an R-2 value of 0.55 and 0.76 for the two study sites, Pachacoto and Llanganuco respectively. We analyse the multispectral orthomosaics and soil moisture maps to improve our understanding of the controls on spatial variability in surface soil moisture within the proglacial valleys of the Cordillera Blanca. The maps permit us to identify both important groundwater spring sources and areas where domestic grazing impacts observed soil moisture estimates. The high resolution observations provided by the UAV facilitate a greater understanding of fine scale heterogeneity within these environments.

AB The multi-satellite-retrieved (ESA CCI SM) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah-simulated (GLDAS-Noah) surface soil moisture (SM) datasets are compared for global drought analysis over a multi-decadal time period (1991-2015). Global drought events and their duration, frequency and severity are assessed on a grid basis with soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The results show that the ESA CCI SM and the GLDAS-Noah based SMAPI values are significantly (p < 0.05) correlated over most (83%) of the study region, of seasonally dependent. Both datasets show similar global patterns in drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. The droughts present generally longer duration, higher frequency and more severity in arid and semi-arid regions than humid and sub-humid regions. The ESA CCI SM droughts are relatively higher in frequency and more intense in severity than the GLDAS-Noah SM droughts in many regions of the globe, while the two datasets show considerable differences in drought duration over arid, semi-arid and highly vegetated regions. For long-term trend detection, both datasets show high consistency in spatial pattern of SMAPI, with major significant drying trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Part (similar to 20%) trends are confirmed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation dataset using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The two SM datasets exhibit large disparity in trending drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. Despite that, both show major significant increasing trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Both soil moisture datasets are capable of identifying extreme drought events reported in southern China, North America, Europe and southern Africa. The ESA CCI SM dataset is more effective in determining the severity and spatial pattern of drought excluding densely vegetated regions, while the GLDAS-Noah dataset is more powerful in detecting drought occurrence, even over densely vegetated regions. Overall, the ESA CCI SM and GLDAS-Noah SM show potential in global drought analysis, yet cautions should be paid to arid and semi-arid regions where drying trends are prevalent and large discrepancy presents between two datasets.

AB Monitoring the effects of water availability on vegetation globally using satellites is important for applications such as drought early warning, precision agriculture, and food security as well as for more broadly understanding relationships between water and carbon cycles. In this global study, we examine how quickly several satellite-based indicators, assumed to have relationships with water availability, respond, on timescales of days to weeks, in comparison with variations in root-zone soil moisture (RZM) that extends to about 1 m depth. The satellite indicators considered are the normalized difference vegetation and infrared indices (NDVI and NDII, respectively) derived from reflectances obtained with moderately wide (20-40 nm) spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimated from thermal infrared observations and normalized by a reference ET. NDVI is primarily sensitive to chlorophyll contributions and vegetation structure while NDII may contain additional information on water content in leaves and canopy. ET includes both the loss of root zone soil water through transpiration (modulated by stomatal conductance) as well as evaporation from bare soil. We find that variations of these satellite-based drought indicators on time scales of days to weeks have significant correlations with those of RZM in the same water-limited geographical locations that are dominated by grasslands, shrublands, and savannas whose root systems are generally contained within the 1 m RZM layer. Normalized ET interannual variations show generally a faster response to water deficits and enhancements as compared with those of NDVI and NDII, particularly in sparsely vegetated regions.

AB The production of global land cover products has accelerated significantly over the past decade thanks to the availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data and increased computation capabilities. The quality of these products should be assessed according to internationally promoted requirements e.g., by the Committee on Earth Observation Systems-Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS-WGCV) and updated accuracy should be provided with new releases (Stage-4 validation). Providing updated accuracies for the yearly maps would require considerable effort for collecting validation datasets. To save time and effort on data collection, validation datasets should be designed to suit multiple map assessments and should be easily adjustable for a timely validation of new releases of land cover products. This study introduces a validation dataset aimed to facilitate multi-purpose assessments and its applicability is demonstrated in three different assessments focusing on validating discrete and fractional land cover maps, map comparison and user-oriented map assessments. The validation dataset is generated primarily to validate the newly released 100 m spatial resolution land cover product from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS-LC100). The validation dataset includes 3617 sample sites in Africa based on stratified sampling. Each site corresponds to an area of 100 m x 100 m. Within site, reference land cover information was collected at 100 subpixels of 10 m x 10 m allowing the land cover information to be suitable for different resolution and legends. Firstly, using this dataset, we validated both the discrete and fractional land cover layers of the CGLS-LC100 product. The CGLS-LC100 discrete map was found to have an overall accuracy of 74.6 +/- 2.1% (at 95% confidence level) for the African continent. Fraction cover products were found to have mean absolute errors of 9.3, 8.8, 16.2, and 6.5% for trees, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and bare ground, respectively. Secondly, for user-oriented map assessment, we assessed the accuracy of the CGLS-LC100 map from four user groups' perspectives (forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and climate modelling). Overall accuracies for these perspectives vary between 73.7% +/- 2.1% and 93.5% +/- 0.9%, depending on the land cover classes of interest. Thirdly, for map comparison, we assessed the accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map at 30 m spatial resolution. Using the subpixel level validation data, we derived 15,252 sample pixels at 30 m spatial resolution. Based on these sample pixels, the overall accuracy of the Globeland30-2010 map was found to be 66.6 +/- 2.4% for Africa. The three assessments exemplify the applicability of multi-purpose validation datasets which are recommended to increase map validation efficiency and consistency. Assessments of subsequent yearly maps can be conducted by augmenting or updating the dataset with sample sites in identified change areas.

AB Cloud detection in optical remote sensing images is a crucial problem because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in the analyses of surface and atmospheric parameters. Sentinel-2 provides high spatial resolution satellite data distributed with associated cloud masks. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 Level-1C cloud mask products to discriminate clouds over a variety of biogeographic scenarios and in different cloudiness conditions. Reference cloud masks for the identification of misdetection were generated by applying a local thresholding method that analyses Sentinel-2 Band 2 (0.490 mu m) and Band 10 (1.375 mu m) separately; histogram-based thresholds were locally tuned by checking the single bands and the natural color composite (B4B3B2); in doubtful cases, NDVI and DEM were also analyzed to refine the masks; the B2B11B12 composite was used to separate snow.
   The analysis of the cloud classification errors obtained for our test sites allowed us to get important inferences of general value. The L1C cloud mask generally underestimated the presence of clouds (average Omission Error, OE, 37.4%); this error increased (OE > 50%) for imagery containing opaque clouds with a large transitional zone (between the cloud core and clear areas) and cirrus clouds, fragmentation emerged as a major source of omission errors (R-2 0.73). Overestimation was prevalently found in the presence of holes inside the main cloud bodies. Two extreme environments were particularly critical for the L1C cloud mask product. Detection over Amazonian rainforests was highly inefficient (OE > 70%) due to the presence of complex cloudiness and high water vapor content. On the other hand, Alpine orography under dry atmosphere created false cirrus clouds. Altogether, cirrus detection was the most inefficient. According to our results, Sentinel-2 L1C users should take some simple precautions while waiting for ESA improved cloud detection products.

AB Earth observation data are increasingly used to provide consistent eco-physiological information over large areas through time. Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R-2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71-0.89 (9.87-17.47 g CO2 d(-1)) and 0.59-0.83 (6.86-22.20 g CO2 d(-1)) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t h(-1)) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha(-1)). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C-3 and C-4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C-3 and C-4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index.

AB The use of laser scanning acquired from the air, or ground, holds great potential for the assessment of forest structural attributes, beyond conventional forest inventory. The use of full-waveform airborne laser scanning (ALS(FW)) data allows for the extraction of detailed information in different vertical strata compared to discrete ALS (ALS(D)). Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can register lower vertical strata, such as understory vegetation, without issues of canopy occlusion, however is limited in its acquisition over large areas. In this study we examine the ability of ALS(FW) to characterize understory vegetation (i.e. maximum and mean height, cover, and volume), verified using TLS point clouds in a Mediterranean forest in Eastern Spain. We developed nine full-waveform metrics to characterize understory vegetation attributes at two different scales (3.75 m square subplots and circular plots with a radius of 15 m); with, and without, application of a height filter to the data. Four understory vegetation attributes were estimated at plot level with high R-2 values (mean height: R-2 = 0.957, maximum height: R-2 = 0.771, cover: R-2 = 0.871, and volume: R-2 = 0.951). The proportion of explained variance was slightly lower at 3.75 m side cells (mean height: R-2 = 0.633, maximum height: R-2 = 0.470, cover: R-2 = 0.581, and volume R-2 = 0.651). These results indicate that Mediterranean understory vegetation can be estimated and accurately mapped over large areas with ALS(FW). The future use of these types of predictions includes the estimation of ladder fuels, which drive key fire behavior in these ecosystems.

AB The vegetation index-based (VI-based) mixture model is widely used to derive green fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from remotely sensed data. Two critical parameters of the model are the vegetation index values of fully-vegetated and bare soil pixels (denoted V-x and V-n hereafter). These are commonly empirically set according to spatial and/or temporal statistics. The uncertainty and difficulty of accurately determining V-x and V-n in many ecosystems limits the accuracy of resultant FVC estimates and hence reduces the utility of VI-based mixture model for FVC estimation. Here, an improved method called MultiVI is developed to quantitatively estimate V-x and V-n from angular VI acquired at two viewing angles. The directional VI is calculated from the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43A1) data. The results of simulated evaluation with 10% added noise show that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of FVC is approximately 0.1 (the valid FVC range is [0, 1]). Direct evaluation against 34 globally-distributed FVC measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) sites during 2000 to 2014 demonstrated that the accuracy of MultiVI FVC (R-2 = 0.866, RMSD = 0.092) exceeds than from SPOT/VEGETATION bioGEOphysical product version 1 (GEOV1) FVC (R-2 = 0.795, RMSD = 0.159). MultiVI FVC also exhibits higher correlation to the VALERI reference FVC than does the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product (MCD15A2H; R-2 is 0.696). A key advantage of the MultiVI method is obvious in areas where fully-vegetated and/or bare soil pixels do not exist in moderate-coarse spatial resolution imagery when compared to the conventional VI-based mixture modelling. The MultiVI method can be flexibly implemented over regional or global scales to monitor FVC, with maps of V-x and V-n generated as two important byproducts.

AB The spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of snow in Arctic regions have a direct impact on the regional energy balance and hydrologic cycle. However, our knowledge of snow cover in Arctic regions is very limited due to the sparseness of in situ measurements. This study presents a new method to derive snow accumulation information for Arctic regions through tracking the surface elevation changes of numerous frozen arctic lakes measured by Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat) repeat altimetry observations. The original ICESat elevation product for continental surface was generated by tracking the centroids of the emitted and the returned laser waveforms. This product contains many biased measurements over frozen arctic lake surfaces due to the scattering effects induced by thin clouds and blowing snow. This study derives an operational approach that produces more reliable altimetry observations by converting the elevation measurements from the centroid scheme to the max-amplitude-peak scheme. Time-variable biases exist between the repeat elevation measurements acquired in different ICESat campaigns. The correction of these inter-campaign biases in this study significantly improves the quantification of the surface elevation change, thus enabling more consistent subsequent snow accumulation estimates. Besides snow fall, lake ice growth also contributes to the surface elevation change. We developed a method to measure and remove this contribution from the total lake surface elevation change, which leads to more accurate estimates of snow accumulation on frozen surfaces of 277 lakes in Arctic regions of northern Alaska. The results were validated using in situ snow depth observations from terrestrial stations on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. After the correction of the ICESat inter-campaign biases and the removal of contribution by lake surface phase transformation, the snow accumulation derived from the repeat ICESat elevation measurements are highly correlated with in situ snow depth observations with a Pearson's correlation coefficient r of 0.88. In comparison with ground-based measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of our snow accumulation estimates is approximately 5 cm. Our method makes it possible to provide much denser snow accumulation information as compared to the existing in situ observations for the Circum-Arctic coastal regions and also the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where seasonal frozen lakes are abundant.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are currently the most reliable resource for flood monitoring, though still subject to various uncertainties, which can be objectively represented with probabilistic flood maps. Moreover, the growing number of SAR satellites has increased the likelihood of observing a flood event from space through at least a single SAR image, but generalized methods for flood classification independent of sensor characteristics need to be developed, to fully utilize these images for disaster management. Consequently, a neuro-fuzzy flood mapping technique is proposed for texture-enhanced single SAR images. Accordingly, any SAR image is first processed to generate second-order statistical textures, which are subsequently optimized using a dimensionality reduction technique. The flood and non-flood classes are then modelled within a fuzzy inference system using Gaussian curves. Parameterization is achieved by training a neural network on the image through user-defined polygons. The results of the optimized texture-based neuro-fuzzy classification were compared against the performance of the SAR image alone and that of SAR enhanced with randomly selected texture features. This approach was tested for a COSMO-SkyMed SAR image at two validation sites, for which high resolution aerial photographs were available. An overall accuracy assessment using reliability diagrams demonstrated a reduction of 54.2% in the Weighted Root Mean Squared Error (WRMSE) values compared to the stand-alone use of SAR. WRMSE values estimated for the proposed method varied from 0.027 to 0.196. A fuzzy validation exercise was also proposed to account for the uncertainty in manual flood identification from aerial photography, resulting in fuzzy spatial similarity values ranging from 0.67 to 0.92, with higher values representing better performance. Results suggest that the proposed approach has demonstrated potential to improve operational SAR-based flood mapping.

AB Defoliation by herbivorous insects is a widespread forest disturbance driver, affecting global forest health and ecosystem dynamics. Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales. However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied. Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared. These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales. During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest. We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity. LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects. In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures. Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37% vs. Adj. Rsquared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11%). The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46%). Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level. Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models.

AB Productive upwelling zones such as the southern Benguela can exhibit phytoplankton biomass variability over several orders of magnitude, from near oligotrophic offshore waters to hypertrophic inshore blooms of > 100 mg m(-3). This introduces complexity for ocean colour applications such as Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) monitoring. As low and high biomass algorithmic approaches for ocean colour differ, no single algorithm can optimally retrieve accurate Chl a over such a wide range of biomass. We propose a novel technique to apply and blend two different Chl a algorithms - an empirical blue-green algorithm for low to moderate biomass and a red-NIR band-ratio algorithm for moderate to high biomass. The blending method is based on the 708 and 665 nm reflectance wavelength ratio, where the blue-green algorithm is applied when the rho(w)(708)/rho(w)(665) ratio is < 0.75, the red-NIR algorithm is applied > 1.15, whilst the two are blended using a weighted approach in between these values. When applied to in situ and satellite match-up data this method provides a median absolute relative difference (MARD) of 37.9 and 45.7%, respectively, and a RMSD of 0.27 and 0.35 respectively, over Chl a concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude. Application is demonstrated for both MERIS and OLCI sensors, providing a smooth transition between different biomass levels and algorithm Chl a returns.

AB The L-band (1.41 GHz) passive microwave remote sensing technique is the approach used by the first satellites dedicated to soil moisture measurement, the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These satellites aim to provide global soil moisture maps for the top similar to 5 cm layer of soil with an accuracy better than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). However, with a passive microwave observing resolution of similar to 40 km, non-soil targets such as surface rock may possibly confound the brightness temperature observations and degrade the accuracy of retrievals for many SMOS and SMAP pixels across the world. Since the microwave contribution of rock is not well accounted for in current soil moisture retrieval algorithms, simply ignoring its existence may be detrimental to the performance of resultant soil moisture products. Using a combination of model simulations and airborne field campaign data from central Australia, this study has determined that a rock cover fraction threshold of up to 0.4 can be tolerated before the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) soil moisture target accuracy is potentially exceeded under extreme dry or wet conditions. However, this threshold reduces to 0.2 when assessed in terms of a brightness temperature impact > 4 K. These rock fraction thresholds have subsequently been applied to the Ecoclimap rock cover map, identifying the SMOS and SMAP pixels globally that are likely to be adversely affected if rock is unaccounted for. The results show that approximately similar to 3.3% of all SMOS and SMAP pixels may have brightness temperature impacts exceeding 4 K from surface rock, with Asia being the most affected, having similar to 6.0% affected pixels. These values reduce to similar to 1.5% of SMOS and SMAP pixels globally, and similar to 3.1% for Asia, when assessed in terms of soil moisture errors expected to possibly exceed 0.04 m(3)/m(3) when not accounting for surface rock.

AB Mixing layer height (MLH) is a key parameter for evaluating the transport and diffusion of atmospheric pollutants in both air quality forecasting and satellite data retrieval. However, there is a lack of methods for obtaining the nocturnal MLH. In this study, a novel instrument named the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detection system (CCD-LADS) was developed to study the nocturnal MLH and boundary layer structure from the surface. The system mainly includes a continuous laser and a charge-coupled device camera with a fisheye lens. Structures of atmospheric layers characterized by the CCD-LADS were compared with those measured by a ceilometer. The heights of two atmospheric layers quantified by measurements with the CCD-LADS and the ceilometer show good agreement, with a relative difference of 5%. The results of this comparison demonstrated that the CCD-LADS is capable of distinctly identifying the nocturnal vertical structure of the atmosphere. The advantage of the CCD-LADS in retrieving the nocturnal MLH is that the CCD-LADS can provide the boundary layer structures under 100 m, while the ceilometer and other lidar measurements cannot retrieve the atmospheric structures below that altitude. CCD-LADS was deployed in a comprehensive field campaign measuring air pollution in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the border between the North China Plain and Yanshan Mountain, during January 2016. The fine characteristics and patterns of the nocturnal boundary layer structures were derived with the CCD-LADS measurements.

AB Vegetation response to flooding across large dryland areas such as Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB) is not understood synoptically and with locally relevant detail. We filled this knowledge gap by quantifying vegetation dynamics, defined here as greening and browning due to changing chlorophyll content and leaf area index, in response to flooding and rainfall across the floodplains of the entire MDB. We quantified vegetation and flooding dynamics using the same data source, namely 26 years of high resolution, wall-to-wall satellite data, in a top down statistical modeling approach, where we controlled for rainfall. Our time series (1986-2011) covered a period of extreme hydroclimatic variability, including the South East Australian Millennium Drought, thus providing a research opportunity to investigate how the relationship between vegetation and flooding changed during wet and dry periods. Our results showed that besides rainfall, flooding plays a key role in driving floodplain vegetation dynamics, yet the role of flooding varied across the MDB floodplains. We quantified a change in the relationship of how vegetation responds to rainfall and flooding with an unprecedented level of spatial detail. The change in the relationships coincided primarily with the onset of the Millennium Drought, yet local and regional differences in the timing of the change did occur, suggesting that the beginning of the Millennium Drought did not impact all floodplain areas at the same time. Our synoptic while locally relevant quantification of the changing response of vegetation to rainfall and flooding is a first step to help underpin Australia's investment into environmental water allocations.

AB Mixed pixels universally exist in remote sensing images, and they are one of the main obstacles for further improving the accuracy of land cover recognition and classification. Since the concept of sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is proposed, SPM technology has rapidly become an important method to solve the problem of mixed pixels. To further improve SPM accuracy, this paper first proposes a double-calculated spatial attraction model (DSAM) combining the advantages of the spatial attraction model (SAM) and the pixel swap model (PSM). Then, based on the full validation of the proposed DSAM, how multiple factors affect the SPM accuracy is analyzed using the multispectral remote sensing (MRS) images. Finally, by analyzing the maximum variations in the ranges of the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient under different multiple factors, the order of factors influencing SPM accuracy is determined as follows: reconstruction scale > image spatial resolution > pixel spatial relationships. The results can serve as a reference for other scholars in setting model parameters and selecting the appropriate remote sensing data, thereby helping them achieve more accurate SPM results.

AB The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) quantifies temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration (ET) metric describing the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (f(RET)) as derived from satellite remote sensing. At regional scales (3-10 km pixel resolution), the ESI has demonstrated the capacity to capture developing crop stress and impacts on regional yield variability in water-limited agricultural regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to spatial and temporal limitations in the standard ESI products. In this study, we investigated potential improvements to ESI by generating maps of ET, f(RET), and f(RET) anomalies at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m pixels, daily time steps) using a multi-sensor data fusion method, enabling separation of landcover types with different phenologies and resilience to drought. The study was conducted for the period 2010-2014 covering a region around Mead, Nebraska that includes both rainfed and irrigated crops. Correlations between ESI and measurements of maize yield were investigated at both the field and county level to assess the potential of ESI as a yield forecasting tool. To examine the role of crop phenology in yield-ESI correlations, annual input f(RET) time series were aligned by both calendar day and by biophysically relevant dates (e.g. days since planting or emergence). At the resolution of the operational U.S. ESI product (4 km), adjusting f(RET) alignment to a regionally reported emergence date prior to anomaly computation improves r(2) correlations with county-level yield estimates from 0.28 to 0.80. At 30-m resolution, where pure maize pixels can be isolated from other crops and landcover types, county-level yield correlations improved from 0.47 to 0.93 when aligning f(RET) by emergence date rather than calendar date. Peak correlations occurred 68 days after emergence, corresponding to the silking stage for maize when grain development is particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of remotely sensed ET in conveying spatially and temporally explicit water stress information to yield prediction and crop simulation models.

AB In the western United States, the rapid expansion of exotic saltcedar along riparian corridors has drastically altered landscape structures and ecosystem functions. Monitoring the geographical distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of this invasive species is essentially critical to conduct the systematic restoration of affected riparian ecosystems. Previous studies indicated that the leaf senescence stage is the optimal time window to remotely monitor saltcedar distributions. Yet due to climate variability and anthropogenic forcing, the timing of saltcedar leaf senescence varies over space and time. Given that the saltcedar leaf senescence stage only lasts for a short temporal window (i.e., three or four weeks), pinpointing the appropriate Landsat image across years and locations without the expert knowledge is challenging. Remotely sensed phenological time series analysis provides a practical means to locate the leaf senescence date on a per-pixel basis. However, affected by temporal revisit rates and cloud contamination, Landsat time series can only capture very limited temporal segments of vegetation phenology. The lack of Landsat imagery throughout the year makes the conventional time series analysis difficult. In this study, we developed a multiyear spectral angle clustering (MSAC) model to monitor the inter-annual leaf senescence of saltcedar with limited Landsat imagery on a per-pixel basis. The MSAC model leverages the Landsat images across years to temporally predict the fall phenology of plant species in a single year, and constructs the synthesized time series of spectral signatures to estimate critical phenological transition dates. Results indicated that the MSAC model could guide the construction of the composite Landsat surface reflectance image to accommodate spatial and inter-annual variation in the timing of plant leaf senescence. The phenology-guided composite image from the MSAC model achieved a greater saltcedar mapping accuracy than any single Landsat image in 2004. The proposed MSAC model provides new insights in estimating phenological transition dates of plant species with limited Landsat imagery. It opens up unique opportunities to guide the selection of representative remotely sensed imagery on a per-pixel basis for repetitive saltcedar mapping over wide geographical regions.

AB Coastal fronts can significantly impact the cross-shelf material exchange and the marine ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to detect their locations and intensities as well as temporal evolutions. In this article, we show that coastal tidal mixing front (TMF) signals can be extracted from both 20-Hz and 1-Hz along-track sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) measured by satellite altimetry. The physical mechanism for the existence of the TMF in the SSHA data is explained. Then the Hilbert-Huang Transform is applied to selected along-track Jason-2 data over Georges Bank. The extracted fronts have a cross-front sea surface height difference of 13-21 cm over distance of 20-27.5 km. The surface geostrophic current anomalies associated with these fronts are estimated to be 0.38-0.45 m s(-1), consistent generally with previous studies from in situ observations. The present study clearly demonstrates the potential of satellite altimetry for monitoring TMFs. It is also shown that tidal fronts can be better extracted from the 20-Hz than 1-Hz data.

AB A technique and implementation for deriving ocean color product using the imaging band (I-band) measurements from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) have been developed. The three VIIRS-SNPP image bands (638, 862, and 1600 nm) with spatial resolution of 375 m are much better than the VIIRS moderate (M) resolution bands of 750 m, which have been used for routinely producing VIIRS global ocean color products. In particular, the high spatial resolution of VIIRS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 638 nm (11 band) nL(omega)(638) can provide useful information about water optical, biological, and biogeochemical properties over turbid coastal and inland waters. In addition, VIIRS-derived nL, (638) data provide an important spectral point and coverage along with nL(omega)(1) from the seven VIIRS M-bands at wavelengths of 410, 443, 486, 551, 671, 745, and 862 nm, particularly over turbid coastal and inland waters. In this paper, we describe our effort to develop a technique for deriving VIIRS nL(omega)(lambda) spectra for both M-bands and I-bands using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. Some examples of VIIRS-derived nL(omega)(638) are provided and discussed, showing the usefulness of this added capability for providing water properties over global turbid coastal and inland waters. Therefore, MSL12 is now capable of routinely and efficiently producing VIIRS nL(omega)(638) for both spatial resolutions of 375 and 750 m, along with nL(omega)(lambda) spectra at VIIRS Ml-M7 with the spatial resolution of 750 m.

   INFORMATION
AB In this paper, a novel approach to estimate fractional snow cover (FSC) from MODIS data in a complex and heterogeneous Alpine terrain is represented by using a state-of-the-art nonparametric spline regression method, namely, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). For this purpose, twenty MODIS - Landsat 8 image pairs acquired between April 2013 and December 2016 over European Alps are used. Fifteen of the image pairs are employed during model training and five images are reserved as an independent test dataset. MARS models are trained by using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, normalized difference snow index, normalized difference vegetation index and land cover class as predictor variables. Reference FSC maps are generated from higher spatial resolution Landsat 8 binary snow cover maps. Multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) models are also trained by using the same input data. During the training and the testing, the effects of the training data size and the sampling type on the predictive performance of ANN and MARS models are investigated. An additional search is also conducted to reveal whether the choice of the transfer function used in the output layer of ANN has a significant contribution to the network's FSC mapping performance. The final ANN and MARS FSC products are at 500 m spatial resolution. The results on the independent test scenes indicate that the developed ANN models with linear and hyperbolic tangent transfer functions in the output layer and the MARS models are in good agreement with reference FSC data with the same average values of R = 0.93. In contrast, the standard MODIS snow fraction product, namely, MOD10 FSC, exhibits slightly poorer performance with average R = 0.88. The proposed MARS approach is statistically proven to have the same performance with ANN, yet it is computationally more efficient in model building.

AB The identification of individual tree species is crucial for forest inventory, carbon stocks assessment as well as for habitat and ecosystem change studies. Previous studies have shown the potential of using both the geometrical information (proportions, shape of the crown profile, etc.) and return intensities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds to identify trees. So far, single wavelength (1064 nm or 1550 nm) ALS systems have been the most common. Teledyne Optech Inc. (Vaughan, Canada) introduced the Titan multispectral airborne lidar, the first three-wavelength system, equipped with 1550 nm, 1064 nm and 532 nm lasers. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of this discrete return multispectral lidar (MSL) for identifying the species of single trees, compared to standard discrete single wavelength lidar. Two distinct datasets were acquired in the Toronto region, Canada. The point clouds of single trees were extracted and 3D and intensity classification features were computed. New intensity features were developed for this purpose, such as lidar NDVIs (normalized difference vegetation index). The species of each tree were identified with a random forest classifier using features calculated from 1) each channel separately and 2) all channels. A stringent selection strategy was employed to reduce the number of features down to 5-9, from 99-142. Trees were classified either as broadleaved (BL) or needleleaf (NL), by genus (4-7 classes), or by species (10 classes). When using all channels, the classification accuracy surpassed what was achieved with single channels, but this advantage was only significant when the number of classes was high, i.e. in the case of seven genera, or ten species. Using MSL data, the out-of-bag error was 3-5% for the BL-NL classification, 13% and 20% for respectively four and seven genera, and 24% for ten species. In the latter case, the best single-channel classification (based on 1550 nm data) resulted in an error of 35%. In the MSL classification, the most useful features were the NDVIs (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, based on the intensity of infrared and green channels) and the 1550 nm intensities. We therefore conclude that species identification accuracy can be improved by using a three-wavelength ALS such as the Titan system compared to single channel ALS systems, especially when tree species diversity is fairly large (seven classes or more).

AB Chlorophyll fluorescence is widely used as an indicator of photosynthesis and physiological state of plants. Remote acquisition of fluorescence allows the diagnosis of large field extensions, even from satellite measurements. Nevertheless, fluorescence emerging from chloroplasts, the one directly connected to plant physiology, undergoes re-absorption processes both within the leaf and the canopy. Therefore, corrections of the observed canopy fluorescence, taking into account these two re-absorption processes may help to draw accurate inferences about plant health. Here, we show the theoretical development and experimental validation of a model that allows to retrieve the spectral distribution of the leaf fluorescence spectrum from that on top of canopy(TOC) using a correction factor which is a function of both canopy and soil reflectance, and canopy transmittance. Canopy fluorescence spectra corrected by our theoretical approach and normalized shows 95% correlation with the normalized fluorescence spectrum at leaf-level, thus validating the model. Therefore, our results provide a physical explanation and quantification for fluorescence re-absorption within the canopy, a phenomenon which has only been mentioned but never measured up to the date. From a more general perspective, this new analytical tool together with the one previously developed by Ramos and Lagorio (2004) allows to obtain the spectral distribution of chloroplast fluorescence spectrum from that on top of canopy (TOC).

AB Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CO) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978-2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of >100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.

AB The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is now moving into its sixth phase and aims at a more routine evaluation of the models as soon as the model output is published to the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). To meet this goal the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the systematic evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP, has been developed and a first version (1.0) released as open source software in 2015. Here, an enhanced version of the ESMValTool is presented that exploits a subset of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Phase 2 and this version is used to demonstrate the value of the data for model evaluation. This subset includes consistent, long-term time series of ECVs obtained from harmonized, reprocessed products from different satellite instruments for sea surface temperature, sea ice, cloud, soil moisture, land cover, aerosol, ozone, and greenhouse gases. The ESA CCI data allow 'extending the calculation of performance metrics as summary statistics for some variables and add an important alternative data set in other cases where observations are already available. The provision of uncertainty estimates on a per grid basis for the ESA CCI data sets is used in a new extended version of the Taylor diagram and provides important additional information for a more objective evaluation of the models. In our analysis we place a specific focus on the comparability of model and satellite data both in time and space. The ESA CCI data are well suited for an evaluation of results from global climate models across ESM compartments as well as an analysis of long-term trends, variability and change in the context of a changing climate. The enhanced version of the ESMValTool is released as open source software and ready to support routine model evaluation in CMIP6 and at individual modeling centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB A wide range of ecological, agricultural, hydrological and meteorological applications at local to regional scales requires decametric biophysical data. However, before the launch of SENTINEL-2A, only few decametric products are produced and most of them remain limited by the small number of available observations, mostly due to a moderate revisit frequency combined with cloud occurrence. Conversely, kilometric and hectometric biophysical products are now widely available with almost complete and continuous coverage, but the associated spatial resolution limits the application over heterogeneous landscapes. The objective of this study is to combine unfrequent decametric spatial resolution products with frequent hectometric spatial resolution products to improve the temporal frequency and completeness of decametric observations. The study focuses on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation (FAPAR) because of its important role in canopy models and small dependency to scaling issues.
   An algorithm is developed to provide near real time estimates of FAPAR called DHF (for Decametric Hectometric Fusion) at a decametric resolution and dekadal time step. It is assumed that the FAPAR time course is described by a second-degree polynomial function over a limited 60-days temporal window for each decametric pixel. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, landcover classes are considered instead of each individual pixel. For each class, the coefficients of the polynomial function are adjusted using the temporal course of the available decametric FAPAR products, under the constraint of providing a good match with the time course of the hectometric dekadal FAPAR products. The point spread function associated to the hectometric FAPAR products and the possible biases between the decametric and hectometric FAPAR products are explicitly accounted for.
   The algorithm was evaluated over a time series of decametric Landsat-8 FAPAR images (30 m) and hectometric (330 m) dekadal GEOV3 FAPAR derived from PROBA-V images acquired in 2014 over a site in the South-West of France.
   Results show that the estimated DHF FAPAR products capture well the expected seasonal variation and spatial distribution while improving the temporal frequency and spatial and temporal completeness of the original Landsat-8 products. A leave one out exercise shows that the DHF values are in very good agreement with the Landsat-8 FAPAR (RMSE = 0.05-0.14) that were not used when computing the DHF. This demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm and interest under cloudy regions. Additional comparison with ground measurements collected over 14 sunflower fields along the growth season confirms the good performances of the DHF FAPAR products (RMSE = 0.11).

AB Discrete airborne laser scanning (ALS) data has emerged as a useful tool for mapping forest leaf area index (LAI). Both empirical and physically-based approaches linking pulse penetration to LAI through gap probability theory have been widely used. We contrasted these approaches using field measurements of LAI (n = 135) acquired in stands of pure Pious radian D. Don in New Zealand. For the empirical approach, we addressed several methodological questions: (1) Identification of important covariates from an extensive list of lidar metrics with empirical or theoretical links to LAI. (2) Evaluation of the impact of lidar plot radius on metric importance and model accuracy by trialling fixed radii and radii based on mean top height (MTH). (3) For ratio metrics, which require selection of a height threshold (HT), identification of the optimum fixed HT and to evaluate a novel variable HT set as a percentage of canopy height. Custom lidar software evaluated all combinations of metric, radius, and HT. For model development, we tested elastic net linear regression for regularisation and variable selection, as well as random forests to explore potential nonlinear relationships and to provide insight into variable importance using conditional importance scores accounting for intercorrelation. For the physically based model, a proxy for vertical canopy gap fraction was sought from ALS metrics measuring pulse penetration for use in a nonlinear model based on the Beer-Lambert law. Empirical models were strongly impacted by calibration and larger plot radii and higher HTs generally reduced RMSE and highlighted a common set of ratio metrics characterising pulse penetration. Elastic net models performed best with the lowest RMSE = 0.57 LAI at radius = 100% of MTH and HT = 20% of canopy height. Models with low RMSE often had radii in the range of canopy height - supporting theoretical links to instrument view distance. The best fixed-radius model (RMSE = 0.64) had radius = 20 m and HT = 20% of canopy height. Random forests results were similar, with little evidence of nonlinear relationships (lowest RMSE = 0.64). Physically-based models produced results close to the best calibrated empirical models (RMSE = 0.72) using a single metric. This approach offered the potential to estimate forest type coefficients that could allow ALS-LAI mapping without the need for calibration and with greater potential for transferability between ALS campaigns. These results support the use of physically-based models for discrete ALS-LAI mapping.

AB Models of animal density often use coarse landcover categories that homogenize vegetation attributes, thereby limiting specificity of results. Alternatively, models including land surface phenology (LSP) metrics derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery capture continuous time-series data describing plant growth and senescence. LSP metrics may better discriminate the vegetation conditions influencing species habitat and distribution. Additionally, applications modeling animal density often use clusters (i.e., groups of individuals) but omit differences in cluster sizes. Ignoring how cluster size varies with landscape characteristics risks misrepresenting the spatial distribution of an animals' density. Using lesser prairie-chickens (LEPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) as an example, we integrated the spatial distributions of cluster density and cluster size with LSP metrics to better predict its density in Texas, USA. We modeled LEPC cluster density using hierarchical distance sampling and cluster size with zero-truncated generalized linear modeling. Variables included landcover categories, LSP metrics, human infrastructure and topography. Models incorporating LSP metrics received most support and identified conservation areas that landcover models missed. Cluster density associated with LSP metrics, road density, oil and gas well density, topography, and grassland to shrubland ratio. Cluster size associated with topography and LSP metrics. Omitting the spatial distribution of cluster size underestimated LEPC density. Our approach generates geospatial predictions for prioritizing LEPC protection, habitat restoration, and evaluating impacts from development or phenological change. This study demonstrates the utility of integrating LSP metrics, cluster density and cluster size for predicting species density across large and heterogeneous landscapes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Knowledge and information of post-fire vegetation recovery are essential for our understanding of ecosystem stability and resilience in response to present and future disturbances. Although previous studies have examined the post-fire vegetation recovery at landscape and regional levels, the lack of continent-wide analysis limits our understanding of fire effect on vegetation recovery across ecoregions and climate zones. With advanced technology in satellite observations as well as large-scale database development, it is possible for us to explore the large-scale effect of concurrent and lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems to fire disturbances. In this study, we investigated the recovery of vegetation greenness in the early post-fire period in North America by integrating two national-level fire perimeter datasets and multiple Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We developed a new algorithm to estimate fire effect on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by comparing fire pixels with their surrounding unburned pixels. Our results showed the fire effect on needleleaf trees was stronger than on other vegetation types, and the high-latitude ecoregions had larger NDVI reduction and longer recovery time than the mid-latitude ecoregions. We also found the variations in vegetation composition and fire severity can explain a large fraction of post-fire vegetation greenness recovery. Our satellite-based analysis showed a longer NDVI recovery time than the existing estimates, which indicates a stronger fire effect on ecosystems than previously thought. Findings in this study indicate that more sophisticated parameterization schemes of fire severity and post-fire vegetation recovery are needed for the vegetation-fire models to better simulate the terrestrial carbon cycling and climate-ecosystem feedbacks.

AB The snow cover on first-year sea ice plays a paramount role in thermodynamics by modulating sea ice ablation and accretion processes. However, meteoric accumulation and redistribution of snow on first-year sea ice is highly stochastic over space and time, which makes it a poorly understood parameter. In this study, a region of late winter snow thickness on first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is estimated using time series spaceborne C-band microwave scatterometer and optical MODIS data and a simple snow melt model. Results show good correspondence between the modeled snow thickness and remotely sensed dates of melt onset and pond onset. The mean snowmelt duration for 20 study sites is 24.6 +/- 1.2 days, and the estimated mean snow thickness is 14.7 +/- 3.0 cm. The overall performance of the model reveals a RMSE of 4.0 cm and a mean bias of 0.3 cm. The methodology shows promise; particularly because it can easily be scaled up in order to estimate snow thickness on seasonal sea ice on a regional basis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the use of multispectral thermal imagery to retrieve land surface emissivity and temperature. Conversely to concurrent methods, the temperature emissivity separation (TES) method simply requires single overpass without any ancillary information. This is possible since TES makes use of an empirical relationship that estimates the minimum emissivity epsilon-min from the emissivity spectral contrast captured over several channels, so-called maximum-minimum difference (MMD). In previous studies, the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship of TES was calibrated and validated for various sensor spectral configurations, where the proposed calibrations involved single or linearly mixed spectra of emissivity at the leaf or soil level. However, cavity effect should be taken into account at the vegetation canopy level, to avoid an underestimation of emissivity, especially for intermediate vegetation conditions between bare soil and full vegetation cover.
   The current study aimed to evaluate the performances of the TES method when applied to vegetation canopies with cavity effect. We used the SAIL-Thermique model to simulate a library of emissivity spectra for a wide range of soil and plant conditions, and we addressed the spectral configurations of recent and forthcoming sensors. We obtained good results for calibration and validation over the simulated library, except for full cover canopies because of the TES gray body problem. Consistent with previous studies, the calibration/validation results were better with more channels that capture emissivity spectral contrast more efficiently. Our TES calibrations provided larger epsilon-min values as compared to former studies, especially for intermediate vegetation cover. We explained this trend by the simulated spectral library that involved numerous vegetation canopies with cavity effect, thereby shifting up the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship. Consequently, our TES calibration provided larger (respectively lower) estimates of emissivity (respectively radiometric temperature) that were likely to be more realistic as compared to previous calibrations. Finally, SAIL-Thermique simulations permitted to show that increasing Leaf Area Index induced a displacement of the (epsilon-min, MMD) pairs along the empirical relationship. This was consistent with the TES underlying assumption, where any change in epsilon-min induces changes in MMD since epsilon-max is bounded on [0.98-1]. Further investigations should focus on validating the outcomes of the current study against ground-based measurements, and on assessing TES performances when accounting for instrumental and atmospheric perturbations.

AB Rapid assessment of algal blooms in bays and estuaries has been difficult due to lack of timely shipboard measurements and lack of spatial resolution from current ocean color satellites. Airborne measurements may fill the gap, yet they are often hindered by the high cost and difficulty in deployment. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in assessing an intense phytoplankton (Phaeocystis globosa) bloom (chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 73 to 45.6 mg/m(3)) in Weitou Bay in the western Taiwan Strait. The UAV was equipped with a hyperspectral sensor to measure the water color with a footprint of 5 mat every 30 m distance along the flight track. A novel approach was developed to obtain remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from the UAV at-sensor radiometric measurements. Compared with concurrent and co-located field measured R-rs (14 stations in total), the UAV-derived R-rs showed reasonable agreement with root mean square difference ranging 0.0028-0.0043 sr(-1) (relative difference similar to 20-32%) of such turbid waters for the six MODIS bands (412-667 nm). The magnitude of the bloom was further evaluated from the UAV-derived R-rs. For the bloom waters, the estimated surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) ranged 6-98 mg/m(3), which is 3-50 times of the Chl under normal conditions. This effort demonstrates for the first time a successful retrieval of both water color (i.e., R-rs) and Chl in a nearshore environment from UAV hyperspectral measurements, which advocates the use of UAVs for rapid assessment of water quality, especially for nearshore or difficult-to-reach waters, due to its flexibility, low cost, high spatial resolution, and sound accuracy.

AB The modelling of windblown mineral dust emissions remains a challenge. This is in part due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data on which these models are based, but also because the processes and mechanisms of aeolian dust emission are not well understood. Satellite imagery has been used extensively in the study of dust from the late 1990s with important contributions being made in terms of sources, transport pathways and deposition areas. Using MODIS imagery, the Namib Desert has been identified as one of the largest sources of dust in southem Africa. The opening of the Landsat archive presents the opportunity to investigate these events at a higher spatial resolution (up to 15 x 15 m) than previously possible. Despite the low temporal resolution, we used Landsat imagery to identify 40 major dust episodes over the last 25 years that originated primarily from the ephemeral river valleys and pan complexes, providing new insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the dust sources from dryland surfaces. Examination of the imagery enabled the identification of local-scale landform source points to direct ground based testing of the surfaces responsible for dust emission. Emissivity tests were undertaken using a PI-SWERL portable wind tunnel in three of the major dust producing river systems along the Namib coast, namely the Kuiseb, Omaruru and Huab Rivers. Preliminary observations suggest that human impact on the hydrological systems in two of the river basins, to cater for the increasing demand of water, have dramatically altered the emission patterns of dust. The source areas of greatest dust emission are found to be located on recently deposited fluvial surfaces which are not active in the contemporary environment.

AB In typical surface energy balance (SEB) models such as surface energy balance for land (SEBAL) and mapping evapotranspiration (ET) at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), calibration of sensible heat flux (H) requires identification of endmember (i.e. hot and cold) pixels. Such pixel selection is typically done manually, which makes it labor intensive to apply SEBAL or METRIC over large spatial areas or long time series. In this paper, we introduce a new automated approach that uses an exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) to identify endmember pixels for use in these models. The fully automated models were applied on 134 near cloud-free Landsat images with each image covering one of four flux measurement sites covering a distinct land cover type in humid Florida or relatively drier Oklahoma. Observed land surface temperatures (T-s) at automatically identified hot and cold pixels were within 0.25% of manually identified pixels (both coefficient of determination, R-2, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, >= 0.98, and root mean squared error, RMSE, <= 1.31 K). The new fully automated model performed better and demonstrated better consistency than an existing semi-automated method that used a statistical approach to subset coldest and hottest pixels within an image. Daily ET estimates derived from the automated SEBAL and METRIC models were in good agreement with their manual counterparts (e.g., NSE >= 0.94 and RMSE <= 0.35 mm day(-1)). Automated and manual pixel selection resulted in similar estimates of observed ET across all sites. The proposed automated pixel selection approach greatly reduces time demands (e.g. approximately one image per hour vs. hundreds of image per hour) for applying SEBAL and METRIC and allows for their more widespread and frequent use. This automation can also reduce potential bias introduced by an inexperienced operator and extends the domain of the models to new users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new algorithm to simultaneously retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) by adopting gradient optimization method. Different from traditional method the approach presented here can perform simultaneous retrieval from each individual AATSR swath rather than multiple days. A theoretical sensitivity study proves the proposed method is insensitive to the distortion of initial BRDF. The presented algorithm is tested on AATSR data around four different Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites representing various types of land surface. Compared with the four selected AERONET sites' AOD and BRDF-derived albedo from AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN) data in corresponding four AERONET sites, the presented algorithm proves considerable accuracy for various type of land surface with correlation of AOD ranging from 0.647 to 0.911 and correlation of BRDF-derived albedo ranging from 0.483 to 0.944. The intersensor comparison with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km AOD dark target product reveals high coverage rate of the presented method especially in bright surface or nonvegetation area and the correlation between the two sensors reaches up to 0.967. The improved estimation of BRDF from AATSR retrieval in AERONET Beijing site is compared with MODIS MCD43B1 product. The relative differences in hemispherical albedo calculated from average BRDF shape function parameters between AATSR and MODIS product are 133%, 1.52%, 2.60% and 4.28% at 550 nm, 670 nm, 870 nm and 1600 nm respectively.

AB Heavy reliance of East Africa (EA) on rain-fed agriculture makes it vulnerable to drought-induced famine. Yet, most research on EA drought focuses on meteorological aspects with little attention paid on agricultural drought impacts. The inadequacy of in-situ rainfall data across EA has also hampered detailed agricultural drought impact analysis. Recently, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing (rainfall, vegetation condition index - VCI, terrestrial water storage - TWS), reanalysis (soil moisture and TWS), and land surface models (soil moisture). Here, these products were employed to characterise EA droughts between 1983 and 2013 in terms of severity, duration, and spatial extent. Furthermore, the capability of these products to capture agricultural drought impacts was assessed using maize and wheat production data. Our results show that while all products were similar in drought characterisation in dry areas, the similarity of CHIRPS and GPCC extended over the whole EA. CHIRPS and GPCC also identified the highest proportion of areas under drought followed closely by soil moisture products whereas VCI had the least coverage. Drought onset was marked first by a decline/lack of rainfall, followed by VCl/soil moisture, and then TWS. VCI indicated drought lag at 0-4 months following rainfall while soil moisture and TWS products had variable lags vis-a-vis rainfall. GLDAS mischaracterized the 2005-2006 drought vis-a-vis other soil moisture products. Based on the annual crop production variabilities explained, we identified CHIRPS, GPCC, FLDAS, and VCI as suitable for agricultural drought monitoring/characterization in the region for the study period. Finally, GLDAS explained the lowest percentages of the Kenyan and Ugandan annual crop production variances. These findings are important for the gauge data deficient EA region as they provide alternatives for monitoring agricultural drought. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A methodological approach based on detailed land-use map, high-resolution LiDAR data and field surveys was developed to categorize productive and non-productive mixed forests, both in term of stand attributes and structural diversity. In 2011, leaf-off dedicated airborne LiDAR data were collected in a 20,000 ha inland patchy area which was representative of soil land use in the Apennines mountains of southern Italy. By combining field and LiDAR data in 5574 ha of forests with coexisting evergreen and deciduous species, we modelled common forest stand variables (height, diameter, volume and biomass) with high accuracy (0.60 <= Adj.R-2 <= 0.89). Moreover, a moderate correlation (0.425 <= tau <= 0.462) between field- and LiDAR-derived diversity indices was found. About 3393 ha of forests are enclosed in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, which in turn possesses 77% (similar to 576,286 Mg) of total aboveground dry biomass. Overall, eight forest types were identified, one of which, the European beech, is only found in the Natura 2000 sites, while other forest types are also found elsewhere. This is the first study to undertake a LiDAR analysis of Mediterranean forests in the Campania Region and might help better evaluate trade-off, especially in protected areas, in order to enhance multiple benefits and support sustainable management of forests.

AB The established position and increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as an important source of information including forest inventory, allows additional applications to be developed when such data are already available. One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0% for stream class and 82.9% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6%, and 68%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders. The majority of streams (74.4%) were not accessible for anadromous fish. For fish-bearing streams, we found that only 0.2% had a mean stand height <2 m, while 2.4% had canopy cover of <20%, and only 7.3% received <10 h of shade. The ALS data thus enabled a holistic characterization of riparian ecotones, providing useful information on both stream and vegetation properties that can support sustainable forest management, inform on erosion risk, and become a foundation for the quantification of ecosystem goods and services.

AB We present three robust methods to accurately and automatically recognize tree species from terrestrial laser scanner data. The recognition is based on the use of quantitative structure tree models, which are hierarchical geometric primitive models accurately approximating the branching structure, geometry, and volume of the trees. Fifteen robust tree features are presented and tested with all different combinations for tree species classification. The classification methods presented are k-nearest neighbours, multinomial regression, and support vector machine based approaches. Three mainly single-species forest plots of Silver birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce, and two mixed-species forest plots located in Finland and a total number of trees over 1200 were used for demonstration. The results show that by using single species forest plots for training and testing, it is possible to find a feature combination between 5 and 15 features, that results in an average classification accuracy above 93% for all the methods. For the preliminary mixed-species forest plot testing, accuracy was lower but the classification approach presented potential to generalize to more diverse cases. Moreover, the results show that the post-processing of terrestrial laser scanning data of multi-hectare forest, from tree extraction and modelling to species classification, can be done automatically.

AB It is well known that satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) is capable of measuring surface displacement with a typical accuracy on the order of millimeters to centimeters. However, when the true deformation vector differs from the satellite line-of-sight (LOS), the sensitivity decreases and interpretation of InSAR deformation measurements becomes challenging. By combining displacement data from extensive ascending and descending TerraSAR-X datasets collected during the summer seasons of 2009-2014, we estimate two-dimensional (2D) InSAR surface displacement. Displacement data are decomposed into vertical and west/east deformation, dip and combined deformation vector, and validated using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. We use the decomposed dataset to visualize variations in surface velocity and direction on unstable slopes in a periglacial environment with sporadic permafrost in northern Norway. By identifying areas with uplift and subsidence, and detecting velocity changes (down slope acceleration/deceleration) and related areas of extension and compression, we are able to explain driving and controlling mechanisms and geomorphology in two rockslides and one area with solifluction landforms.

AB Long-term records of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes are necessary both for understanding basin scale changes to watersheds and for providing a key constraint for assessing processes driving blooms. However, due to the inherent constraints of in situ sampling and the short time period covered by modem space borne sensors, few long-term records exist. Historical data from sensors such as Landsat offer strong potential for creating new records of past blooms. Here, we use a novel evaluation procedure based on multiple metrics to assess algorithm suitability and robustness for generating long-term bloom records using Landsat 5 imagery. Evaluation metrics are based on bloom presence, spatial distribution, magnitude and timing, using both in situ Microcystis biovolume and remotely-sensed Cyanobacterial Index (CI) data from MERIS for 2002-2011. Applying this procedure for a test case focusing on Lake Erie's western basin, an algorithm based on a near infrared threshold with simple atmospheric correction through subtraction of the shortwave infrared band, combined with an additional "greenness" filter based on a hue threshold, performs best. Implementing this algorithm for 1984-2001 reveals the long-term trends in peak bloom magnitude prior to the start of the MERIS and MODIS record (2002-2015), and more than doubles the period of record that can be used to understand bloom occurrence and growth for this system. More broadly, we demonstrate that Landsat observations can be used to identify macro-scale features of blooms. For Lake Erie, the performance of the final Landsat algorithm is comparable to that of the MERIS CI algorithm, despite Landsat's broad spectral bands and long revisit time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB The traditional approach of map accuracy assessment based on an error matrix does not capture the spatial variation in classification accuracy. Here, per-pixel accuracy prediction methods are proposed based on interpolating accuracy values from a test sample in which the reference class of each sampled pixel has been determined. Different accuracy prediction methods were developed based on four factors: predictive domain (spatial versus spectral), interpolation function (constant, linear, Gaussian, and logistic), incorporation of class information (interpolating each class separately versus grouping them together), and sample size. Developing accuracy maps using the spectral domain is a new approach in contrast to previous efforts based on the spatial domain. Performance of the prediction methods was evaluated using 26 test blocks, with 10 km x 10 km dimensions, dispersed throughout the United States. Each block had complete coverage reference data manually extracted by interpreters and a land-cover map produced from Landsat imagery using a decision tree classification. The full scene maps were then compared to the corresponding reference maps to produce complete coverage accuracy information for each block. The predicted accuracy maps were produced from a sample of the reference data (i.e., the test dataset). The performance of the sample-based accuracy predictions was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Relative to existing accuracy prediction methods, our proposed methods resulted in improvements of AUC of 0.15 or greater. Evaluation of the four factors comprising the accuracy prediction methods demonstrated that: i) interpolations should be done separately for each class instead of grouping all classes together; ii) if an all-classes approach is used, the spectral domain will result in substantially greater AUC than the spatial domain; iii) for the smaller sample size and per-class predictions, the spectral and spatial domain yielded similar AUC; iv) for the larger sample size (i.e., very dense spatial sample) and per-class predictions, the spatial domain yielded larger AUC; v) increasing the sample size improved accuracy predictions with a greater benefit accruing to the spatial domain; and vi) the function used for interpolation had the smallest effect on AUC. To conclude, the ability to produce per-pixel accuracy predictions yielding simple to understand accuracy maps opens up new possibilities for error propagation of remotely sensed products in a variety of disciplines.

AB Ocean color remote sensing of chlorophyll concentration has revolutionized our understanding of the biology of the oceans. However, a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of oceanic ecosystems requires the characterization of the spatio-temporal variability of various phytoplankton functional types (PFTs), which have differing biogeochemical roles. Thus, recent bio-optical algorithm developments have focused on retrieval of various PFTs. It is important to validate and inter-compare the existing PFT algorithms; however direct comparison of retrieved variables is non-trivial because in those algorithms PFTs are defined differently. Thus, it is more plausible and potentially more informative to focus on emergent properties of PFTs, such as phonology. Furthermore, ocean color satellite PFT data sets can play a pivotal role in informing and/or validating the biogeochemical routines of Earth System Models. Here, the phenological characteristics of 10 PFT satellite algorithms and 7 latest-generation climate models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIPS) are inter compared as part of the International Satellite PFT Algorithm Inter-comparison Project. The comparison is based on monthly satellite data (mostly SeaWiFS) for the 2003-2007 period. The phonological analysis is based on the fraction of microplankton or a similar variable for the satellite algorithms and on the carbon biomass due to diatoms for the climate models. The seasonal cycle is estimated on a per-pixel basis as a sum of sinusoidal harmonics, derived from the Discrete Fourier Transform of the variable time series. Peak analysis is then applied to the estimated seasonal signal and the following phenological parameters are quantified for each satellite algorithm and climate model: seasonal amplitude, percent seasonal variance, month of maximum, and bloom duration. Secondary/double blooms occur in many areas and are also quantified. The algorithms and the models are quantitatively compared based on these emergent phenological parameters. Results indicate that while algorithms agree to a first order on a global scale, large differences among them exist; differences are analyzed in detail for two Longhurst regions in the North Atlantic: North Atlantic Drift Region (NADR) and North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre West (NASW). Seasonal cycles explain the most variance in zonal bands in the seasonally-stratified subtropics at about 30 latitude in the satellite PFT data. The CMIP5 models do not reproduce this pattern, exhibiting higher seasonality in mid and high-latitudes and generally much more spatially homogeneous patterns in phenological indices compared to satellite data. Satellite data indicate a complex structure of double blooms in the Equatorial region and mid-latitudes, and single blooms on the poleward edges of the subtropical gyres. In contrast, the CMIP5 models show single annual blooms over most of the ocean except for the Equatorial band and Arabian Sea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Drilling deep tunnels in alpine rocks might induce surface settlements of a few centimetres because of groundwater drainage and associated pore pressure reduction. Settlements of this order of magnitude are sufficient to pose a potential threat to the integrity of any large concrete structure such as arch dams located above the tunnel and an accurate survey of surface deformation before, during and after construction is of high importance. We present the spatial and temporal evolution of surface subsidence measured with satellite SAR interferometry associated with the construction of the 57 km long Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland. Significant deformations of 1 to 12 mm/year were detected between 2003 and 2010 with ENVISATASAR data above the tunnel on villages and sparsely vegetated alpine slopes where no displacement was recorded between 1992 and 2000 with ERS-1/2 SAR data. Our results, available also for sectors where there is no information from any other surveying technique, are important not only to assess the hazard posed on any large concrete structure but also for the development and calibration of numerical models - to be employed to simulate the expected surface deformation before and during the construction works - and to study the effect of groundwater drainage on the dynamic of large deep-seated landslides.

AB Empirical and theoretical evidence has shown that the scattering and absorptance of a homogeneous leaf canopy with black soil can be modeled using simple algebraic combinations of two spectrally invariant parameters (the recollision probability and the canopy interceptance) and one spectrally dependent quantity (the single scattering albedo of an average phytoelement). This study generalizes such results for vegetation canopies composed of one or more types of phytoelements and with a reflective background surface also composed of one or more materials, all of which are treated as endmembers of a nonlinear spectral mixture. The conservative radiation field of a canopy is represented by a finite state Markov chain, such that for a vegetation-surface medium composed of m endmembers, the model is thereby parameterized in terms of an m-length vector of endmember interceptances and an mth-order square matrix containing probabilities of photon recollision amongst the endmembers. Comparisons of some instances of the model with radiative transfer based approximations showed how the latter may overestimate canopy reflectance and transmittance. The two-endmembers model was also compared with Monte Carlo simulations for spherically-oriented leaf canopies with reflective soil. Results indicated that the analytical model accurately describes the radiation field for a wide range of soil reflectance and LAI values. Simulations also showed that while the zenith angle of the illumination source has a small influence on the recollision probabilities, the LAI value mainly determines these through distinct functional relationships. The application of the model to estimate the canopy radiation field of two coniferous species located on the Mexico City Conservation Land is also demonstrated using airborne hyperspectral measurements.

TI Does AMSR2 produce better soil moisture retrievals than AMSR-E over

AB The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), a follow-up microwave sensor to the AMSR for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), was launched on the Global Change Observation Mission 1- Water (GCOM-W1) satellite in May 2012. It is as yet unclear if instrumental improvements in AMSR2 over AMSR-E have led to better soil moisture (SM) estimates, especially since there is no overlapping period of data between the sensors. This study focuses on comparing the results of AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM over Australia, distinguishing four Koppen climate zones to determine if AMSR2 is better than AMSR-E. This is achieved by selecting two year-long comparative time periods from the operating periods of AMSR-E and AMSR2, based on their statistical similarities in modeled SM as a proxy, using Modem Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRAL). The AMSR2 and AMSR-E C- and X-band SM derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was evaluated. Both AMSR2 C- and X-band SM products were found to show similar temporal patterns and spatial agreement with AMSR-E C- and X-band SM, supported by unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and R-values with MERRA-L SM, respectively. Using lag-based instrumental variable analysis to estimate the random error component of SM retrievals, the noise-to-signal ratios in AMSR2 X-band SM were found to be slightly higher than their AMSR-E counterparts. The improvements in AMSR2, such as the superior radiometric sensitivity and spatial resolution, have therefore not led to statistically significant differences in performance for LPRM retrievals at 1/2 degrees x 1/2 degrees grid resolution, when compared with AMSR-E. However, similarities in the metrics for AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM suggest that AMSR2 provides a valuable continuation to AMSR-E. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The lower Liaohe plain is one of the most important industrial zones in Liaoning Province, China, and activities here include oil and gas exploration, aquaculture and salt production. Heavy land use may have contributed to the different magnitudes of land deformation in this region, and this has been detrimental to the environment and economic construction projects in this zone. In this paper, we employ the permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique with L-band ALOS/PALSAR imagery data to monitor the annual land subsidence and produce accumulative time-series maps for the years of 2007 to 2011. The unwrapped grid size was tested in order to recover the maximum deformation. InSAR results from two adjacent tracks were merged by considering the offset over the overlapped area. A PS standard deviation of 0.91 cm/year was achieved in the vertical direction, according to calculation from two independent PS results. Three kinds of land subsidence were analyzed quantitatively over the oil fields, coastal zones, and salt production areas. Some severe land subsidence regions were verified by field investigations.

AB A procedure based on analysis of time series of MODIS-Aqua satellite chlorophyll a images was developed in order to spatially delimit areas of the Alboran Sea with distinguishable annual cycles of productivity. For this objective, daily images of satellite chlorophyll were obtained from 2002 to 2013. Monthly means were calculated for each pixel and then the pixels were grouped by means of the statistical technique of non-hierarchical clustering analysis according to the features of their annual cycle. The outcome of the clustering analysis was validated by comparing the pixel grouping patterns with the spatial distribution of in situ chlorophyll a and nutrients as determined from the available data (about 2900 registers obtained in the 20 m upper seawater layer in 70 sampling stations). Six grouping areas were identified which reproduced the expected zonation according to the distribution of the main mesoscale hydrological structures that modulate the productivity in the study area (oligotrophic gyres and coastal upwelling). The grouping areas presented contrasting chlorophyll a concentrations as well as annual minimum and maximum occurring at different seasonal cycle timing. Seasonal means of in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate and phosphate concentrations calculated for the six grouping areas were significantly correlated, supporting that dissolved inorganic nutrients were the main factor controlling the productivity in the Alboran Sea. Consequently, the grouping of pixels based on satellite data reflected reasonably the underlying mechanisms that control the phytoplankton biomass in the study area. The utility of this technique to define spatial units for eutrophication management is discussed. These units can be used for spatial aggregation of eutrophication indicator data collected from in situ samplings as well as for calculating robust reference values and time trends. Furthermore, the pixel grouping is useful for optimizing the existing monitoring programs as it facilitates the selection and location of sampling stations in order to avoid collection of redundant and/or pointless information.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) mapping at the Landsat spatial resolution (100 m) is essential to fully understand water use and water availability at the field scale. Water use estimates in the Colorado River Basin (CRB), which has diverse ecosystems and complex hydro-climatic regions, will be helpful to water planners and managers. Availability of Landsat 8 images, starting in 2013, provides the opportunity to map ET in the CRB to assess spatial distribution and patterns of water use. The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model was used with 528 Landsat 8 images to create seamless monthly and annual ET estimates at the inherent 100 m thermal band resolution. Annual ET values were summarized by land use/land cover classes. Croplands were the largest consumer of "blue" water while shrublands consumed the most "green" water. Validation using eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and water balance approaches showed good accuracy levels with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.95 and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ranging from 0.66 to 0.91. The root mean square error (and percent bias) ranged from 0.48 mm (13%) to 0.60 mm (22%) for daily (days of satellite overpass) ET and from 7.75 mm (2%) to 13.04 mm (35%) for monthly ET. The spatial and temporal distribution of ET indicates the utility of Landsat 8 for providing important information about ET dynamics across the landscape. Annual crop water use was estimated for five selected irrigation districts in the Lower CRB where annual ET per district ranged between 681 mm to 772 mm. Annual ET by crop type over the Maricopa Stanfield irrigation district ranged from a low of 384 mm for durum wheat to a high of 990 mm for alfalfa fields. A rainfall analysis over the five districts suggested that, on average, 69% of the annual ET was met by irrigation. Although the enhanced cloud-masking capability of Landsat 8 based on the cirrus band and utilization of the Fmask algorithm improved the removal of contaminated pixels, the ability to reliably estimate ET over clouded areas remains an important challenge. Overall, the performance of Landsat 8 based ET compared to available EC datasets and water balance estimates for a complex basin such as the CRB demonstrates the potential of using Landsat 8 for annual water use estimation at a national scale. Future efforts will focus on (a) use of consistent methodology across years, (b) integration of multiple sensors to maximize images used, and (c) employing cloud-computing platforms for large scale processing capabilities.

AB Mediterranean ecosystems are adapted to recurrent forest fires by having regeneration mechanisms that overcome the immediate effects of fire. However, the increasing frequency of fires in most European Mediterranean countries is challenging the natural regrowth capability of these ecosystems. In this context, monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery is a priority for forest management and soil erosion control. In this work, a 13-year series (1999-2011) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) data was used to model post-fire vegetation recovery as a function of burn severity and to quantify post-fire resilience as a measure of vegetation cover regrowth. We evaluated a large forest fire located in Spain that burned approximately 30 km(2) of Pinus pinaster Ait. in August 1998.88 field plots of four burn severity levels (unburned, low, moderate and high) were measured in the field a year after the fire. As a variable representative of vegetation, we chose the shade normalized green vegetation fraction image (SGV) obtained by applying Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to the original Landsat TM/ETM + images. The SGV values were extracted for the 88 field plots and, after performing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test allowed us to estimate resilience of vegetation cover as the number of post-fire years exhibiting a statistically significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Next, SGV values were referenced to unburned control plots values and the vegetation recovery index (VRI) was defined. The evolution in time curve of VRI for low, moderate and highly fire affected vegetation was fit using trend models (specifically, an exponential trend for VRI in high and moderate burn severity levels; a linear trend for low burn severity level, Root Mean Square Error, RMSE = 0.18, 0.13, and 0.09, respectively). We observed that vegetation cover affected by low severity fire recovered to its original state after 7 years, and vegetation cover affected by moderate severity recovered after 13 years. Vegetation affected by high severity fire was estimated to recover after 20 years. We conclude that VRI time series based on multi-temporal MESMA fractions from Landsat data can be considered a valuable indicator of the post-fire vegetation cover recovery. Its temporal evolution represented post-fire vegetation cover regrowth adequately and facilitated the estimate of vegetation cover resilience in Mediterranean forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Woody plants play a major role for the resilience of drylands and in peoples' livelihoods. However, due to their scattered distribution, quantifying and monitoring woody cover over space and time is challenging. We develop a phenology driven model and train/validate MODIS (MCD43A4, 500 m) derived metrics with 178 ground observations from Niger, Senegal and Mali to estimate woody cover trends from 2000 to 2014 over the entire Sahel. The annual woody cover estimation at 500 m scale is fairly accurate with an RMSE of 4.3 (woody cover %) and r(2) = 0.74. Over the 15 year period we observed an average increase of 1.7 (+/- 5.0) woody cover (%) with large spatial differences: No clear change can be observed in densely populated areas (0.2 +/- 4.2), whereas a positive change is seen in sparsely populated areas (2.1 +/- 5.2). Woody cover is generally stable in cropland areas (0.9 +/- 4.6), reflecting the protective management of parkland trees by the farmers. Positive changes are observed in savannas (2.5 +/- 5.4) and woodland areas (3.9 +/- 7.3). The major pattern of woody cover change reveals strong increases in the sparsely populated Sahel zones of eastern Senegal, western Mali and central Chad, but a decreasing trend is observed in the densely populated western parts of Senegal, northern Nigeria, Sudan and southwestern Niger. This decrease is often local and limited to woodlands, being an indication of ongoing expansion of cultivated areas and selective logging. We show that an overall positive trend is found in areas of low anthropogenic pressure demonstrating the potential of these ecosystems to provide services such as carbon storage, if not over-utilized. Taken together, our results provide an unprecedented synthesis of woody cover dynamics in the Sahel, and point to land use and human population density as important drivers, however only partially and locally offsetting a general post-drought increase.

AB The remote sensing of PM2.5 (particulate matter concentration with aerodynamic diameter d <= 2.5 mu m) mass concentration is mostly based on the measurements of AOD (aerosol optical depth) that is a common product of satellite and ground instruments which measure spectral radiance. The relationship between surface PM2.5 and column integrated AOD is found associated with vertical and size distribution of aerosols. In this study, a non-linear regression model combining AOD and near surface backscatter for estimation of PM2.5 is developed and tested based on 6 years ground measurements from HUBC (Howard University Beltsville Campus) facility. Overall, the non-linear model explains similar to 60% of the variability in hourly PM2.5. The RMSE (root-mean-square error) is similar to 5.83 mu g/m(3) with a corresponding average PM2.5 of 15.43 mu g/m(3). That is a big improvement to the linear model using AOD alone (similar to 40% of the variability, RMSE is similar to 7.14 mu g/m(3)). The ceilometer measured near surface backscatter is found to improve the estimation of PM2.5-AOD relationship the most compared to other factors, such as aerosol size indicator, surface temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and pressure especially when AOD is large (AOD >= 0.3). As aerosol size indicator, two Angstrom exponents are calculated by AOD at three wavelengths of 415, 500, 860 nm and are found also important to the PM2.5-AOD relationship. In addition to the HUBC site, the model is tested based on the 4 years (2012 to 2015) measurements from ARM SGP site and the nearest EPA site. The results also show the significant role of the ceilometer measured near surface backscatter on improving estimation of PM2.5. This study illustrated the potential of ceilometer on investigation of air pollution. With broad ceilometer network, ground-level particle concentrations can be better determined.

AB Supercooled liquid water (SLW) clouds, where liquid droplets exist at temperatures below 0 degrees C present a wellknown aviation hazard through aircraft icing, in which SLW accretes on the airframe. SLW clouds are common over the Southern Ocean, and climate-induced changes in their occurrence is thought to constitute a strong cloud feedback on global climate. The two recent NASA field campaigns POlarimeter Definition EXperiment (PODEX, based in Palmdale, California, January-February 2013) and Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, based in Houston, Texas in August September 2013) provided a unique opportunity to observe SLW clouds from the high-altitude airborne platform of NASA's ER-2 aircraft. We present an analysis of measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during these experiments accompanied by correlative retrievals from other sensors. The RSP measures both polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels with wavelengths ranging from 410 to 2250 nm. It is a scanning sensor taking samples at 0.8 degrees intervals within 60 degrees from nadir in both forward and backward directions. This unique angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet size using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectances in the scattering angle range between 135 degrees and 165 degrees. Simple parametric fitting algorithms applied to the polarized reflectance provide retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non-parametric method, Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows retrieval of the droplet size distribution without assuming a size distribution shape. We present an overview of the RSP campaign datasets available from the NASA GISS website, as well as two detailed examples of the retrievals. In these case studies we focus on cloud fields with spatial features varying between glaciated and liquid phases at altitudes as high as 10 km, which correspond to temperatures close to the homogeneous freezing temperature of pure water drops (about-35 degrees C or colder). The multimodal droplet size distributions retrieved from RSP data in these cases are consistent with the multi-layer cloud structure observed by correlative Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) measurements.

TI Analysis of SMOS sea surface salinity data using DINEOF

ID SATELLITE DATA; AMAZON PLUME; OCEAN; RECONSTRUCTION; TEMPERATURE
AB An analysis of daily Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) at 0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees spatial resolution from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission using DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) is presented. DINEOF allows reconstructing missing data using a truncated EOF basis, while reducing the amount of noise and errors in geophysical datasets. This work represents a first application of DINEOF to SMOS SSS. Results show that a reduction of the error and the amount of noise is obtained in the DINEOF SSS data compared to the initial SMOS SSS data. Errors associated to the edge of the swath are detected in 2 EOFs and effectively removed from the final data, avoiding removing the data at the edges of the swath in the initial dataset. The final dataset presents a centered root mean square error of 0.2 in open waters when comparing with thermosalinograph data at their original spatial and temporal resolution. Constant biases present near land masses, large scale biases and latitudinal biases cannot be corrected with DINEOF because persistent signals are retained in high order EOFs, and therefore these need to be corrected separately. The signature of the Douro and Gironde rivers is detected in the DINEOF SSS. The minimum SSS observed in the Gironde plume corresponds to a flood event in June 2013, and the shape and size of the Douro river shows a good agreement with chlorophyll-a satellite data. These examples show the capacity of DINEOF to remove noise and provide a full SSS dataset at a high temporal and spatial resolution with reduced error, and the possibility to retrieve physical signals in zones with high initial errors.

TI Interannual anomalies of SMOS sea surface salinity

LA English
DT Article
ID TROPICAL ATLANTIC; 1ST ASSESSMENT; OCEAN; RAIN; PERFORMANCE; SIGNATURE
AB Sea Surface Salinity, SSS, retrieved from measurements of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS, satellite mission using the European Space Agency version 5 processors displays systematic errors, in particular in the vicinity of large land masses and in the open ocean as a function of latitude and season. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the contribution of systematic errors close to and away from land by examining the statistics of SMOS minus interpolated fields of in situ SSS before and after removal of climatological mean fields. Using interpolated fields of in situ SSS as reference, we find that the precision of monthly SMOS SSS anomalies, SSSANO, relative to a SMOS SSS monthly climatology computed over four years between 45 degrees N and 45 degrees S is 30% better than the one of SSS when considering pixels further than 1000 km from the coast. This improvement reaches 40% when all pixels are included. At 1600 km from the coast, the standard deviation of the difference between SMOS SSS and in situ interpolated fields is 0.15. These very encouraging results show that it is possible to correct part of the systematic errors in SMOS SSS from the SMOS SSS themselves, pending improvements in SMOS reconstructed brightness temperatures resulting from improved calibration and image reconstruction processes. The largest SSS anomalies are observed in the tropical Indian Ocean as related to Indian Ocean Dipole and in the tropical Pacific Ocean where latitudinal migration of the SSS minimum in the South Pacific Convergence Zone is related to El Nino Southern Oscillation phases and where strong SSS anomalies are observed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during positive phases of ENSO in early 2010 and in late 2014, early 2015.

AB A prototype algorithm for hemispheric scale detection of autumn soil freezing using space-borne L-band passive microwave observations is presented. The methodology is based on earlier empirical and theoretical studies of L-band emission properties of freezing and thawing soils. We expand a method originally developed for soil freeze thaw (F/T) state detection from L-band tower based observations to satellite scale, applying observations from the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The developed algorithm is based on first establishing spatially variable thresholds for L-band brightness temperatures representing frozen and thawed states of soil, and comparing these to current values of different indicators of soil freezing, calculated based on observed brightness temperature at different polarizations and incidence angles. An exponential relation between the freezing indicators and the depth of soil frost is developed based on a large amount of manual soil frost tube observations across Finland. An additional processing filter based on observed physical temperature and snow cover information is used to flag obvious F/T detection errors. The estimated soil F/F-states provided in this study are limited to the autumn freezing period, as melting snow in spring effectively prevents acquisition of information from the soil surface using microwaves for large areas in Northern latitudes. The F/T estimate is produced as daily information and provided in the equal-area scalable Earth (EASE) grid. Soil F/T-state is categorized into three discrete levels: 'frozen', 'partially frozen', and 'thawed', and accompanied with a quality data matrix estimating the data reliability for each freezing season separately. Comparisons to in situ data were conducted at 10 different locations in Finland, Northern America and Siberia. These comparison results indicate that the onset of autumn soil freezing can be estimated from SMOS observations to within 1 to 14 days, depending on the freezing indicator applied and the in situ data used in comparison. Although the initial results are encouraging, more comprehensive assessment of SMOS based soil F/T estimates still requires further comparison to other reference sites, particularly to sites with measurements available for all locally representative land cover types, as well as other satellite-based soil freezing products.

AB In this study the capabilities of seven multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imagers to estimate soil variables (clay, sand, silt and organic carbon content) were investigated using data from soil spectral libraries. Four current (EO-1 ALI and Hyperion, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) and three forthcoming (EnMAP, PRISMA and HyspIRI) satellite imagers were compared. To this aim, two soil spectra datasets that simulated each imager were obtained: (i) resampled spectra according to the specific spectral response and resolution of each satellite imager and (ii) resampled spectra with declared or actual noise (radiometric and atmospheric) added. Compared with those using full spectral resolution data, the accuracy of Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) predictive models generally decreased when using resampled spectra. In the absence of noise, the performances of hyperspectral imagers, in terms of Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ), were generally significantly better than those of multispectral imagers. For instance the best RPIQ for sand estimation was obtained using EnMAP simulated data (2.56), whereas the outcomes gained using multispectral imagers varied from 1.56 and 2.28. The addition of noise to the simulated spectra brought about a decrease of statistical accuracy in all estimation models, especially for Hyperion data. Although the addition of noise reduced the performance differences between multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, the forthcoming hyperspectral imagers nonetheless provided the best RPIQ values for clay (2.16-233), sand (2.10-2.17), silt (2.77-2.85) and organic carbon (2.48-2.51) estimation. To better understand the impact of spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the estimation of soil var iables, PLSR models were applied to resampled and simulated spectra, iteratively increasing the bandwidth to: 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 nm. Results showed that, for a bandwidth of 40 nm, i.e., a spectral resolution lower than that of current and forthcoming imagers, the estimation accuracy was very similar to that obtained with a higher spectral resolution.
   Forthcoming hyperspectral imagers will therefore improve the accuracy of soil variables estimation from bare soil imagery with respect to the results achievable by current hyperspectral and multispectral imagers, however this improvement is still too limited, to allow an accurate quantitative estimation of soil texture and SOC. This work provides useful indications about what could be expected, for the estimation of the most important soil variables, from the next generation of hyperspectral satellite imagers.

AB Understanding the dynamics of land-change processes in urban areas requires long-term land cover and land use data at high spatial and temporal resolution. Extending an established procedure for deriving annual, fractional estimates of impervious surface cover (ISC) from per-pixel Landsat composites, here we propose a new post classification methodology that characterizes ISC change as a continuous field in space and time. The method statistically derives the magnitude, timing and duration of ISC change at a per-pixel basis. We applied the method to a series of ISC maps of the Washington DC-Baltimore metropolitan region at an annual resolution from 1984 to 2010 to analyze the spatial, temporal and thematic patterns of urban/suburban land development. Our method was highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change, with producer's accuracy of the change-year classes (timing layer) varying between 59.4% and 97.4% and user's accuracy varying between 54.7% and 91.7%, based on a sample of independent validation points. Most misclassifications were found between neighboring years; relaxing the estimated change-year to +/- 1 year increased both producer's and user's accuracy to >80%. The derived change products showed that newly developed pixels on average had a 46% increase in ISC, with the majority (80%) reaching their ISC saturation level in <= 3 years. Across the study region, annual growth in impervious surface area accelerated from similar to 6 km(2)/year (0.7% of urban area in 1984) in the mid-1980s to similar to 12 km(2)/year in the late-2010s, with a large inter-annual variability among municipalities and over successive years. Of these emerged urban pixels, 89% were converted from non-urban to low- and medium-density urban features, mostly suburban residential land use. However, the relative proportions of low-, medium- and high density urban development changed dramatically over the study period, indicating that urban sprawl of the metropolis experienced major transitions in terms of land use intensity in the past three decades. Although primarily designed for change detection, our method can also be used as a temporal smoothing technique to remove noise in time-series of land cover datasets. Our results highlight the value of mapping and monitoring urban land expansion as continuous fields along the spatial-temporal-thematic dimensions for understanding the dynamics of urban land-change.

AB To effectively meet growing food demands, the global agronomic community will require a better understanding of factors that are currently limiting crop yields and where production can be viably expanded with minimal environmental consequences. Remote sensing can inform these analyses, providing valuable spatiotemporal information about yield-limiting moisture conditions and crop response under current climate conditions. In this paper we study correlations for the period 2003-2013 between yield estimates for major crops grown in Brazil and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) - an indicator of agricultural drought that describes anomalies in the actual/reference evapotranspiration (ET) ratio, retrieved using remotely sensed inputs of land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI). The strength and timing of peak ESI-yield correlations are compared with results using remotely sensed anomalies in water supply (rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission; TRMM) and biomass accumulation (LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS). Correlation patterns were generally similar between all indices, both spatially and temporally, with the strongest correlations found in the south and northeast where severe flash droughts have occurred over the past decade, and where yield variability was the highest. Peak correlations tended to occur during sensitive crop growth stages. At the state scale, the ESI provided higher yield correlations for most crops and regions in comparison with TRMM and LAI anomalies. Using finer scale yield estimates reported at the municipality level, ESI correlations with soybean yields peaked higher and earlier by 10 to 25 days in comparison to TRMM and LAI, respectively. In most states, TRMM peak correlations were marginally higher on average with municipality-level annual corn yield estimates, although these estimates do not distinguish between primary and late season harvests. A notable exception occurred in the northeastern state of Bahia, where the ESI better captured effects of rapid cycling of moisture conditions on corn yields during a series of flash drought events. The results demonstrate that for monitoring agricultural drought in Brazil, value is added by combining LAI with LST indicators within a physically based model of crop water use.

AB The topography of many floodplains in the developed world has now been surveyed with high resolution sensors such as airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), giving accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that facilitate accurate flood inundation modelling. This is not always the case for remote rivers in developing countries. However, the accuracy of DEMs produced for modelling studies on such rivers should be enhanced in the near future by the high resolution TanDEM-X WorldDEM.
   In a parallel development, increasing use is now being made of flood extents derived from high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for calibrating, validating and assimilating observations into flood inundation models in order to improve these. This paper discusses an additional use of SAR flood extents, namely to improve the accuracy of the TanDEM-X DEM in the floodplain covered by the flood extents, thereby permanently improving this DEM for future flood modelling and other studies.
   The method is based on the fact that for larger rivers the water elevation generally changes only slowly along a reach, so that the boundary of the flood extent (the waterline) can be regarded locally as a quasi-contour. As a result, heights of adjacent pixels along a small section of waterline can be regarded as samples with a common population mean. The height of the central pixel in the section can be replaced with the average of these heights, leading to a more accurate estimate. While this will result in a reduction in the height errors along a waterline, the waterline is a linear feature in a two-dimensional space. However, improvements to the DEM heights between adjacent pairs of waterlines can also be made, because DEM heights enclosed by the higher waterline of a pair must be at least no higher than the corrected heights along the higher waterline, whereas DEM heights not enclosed by the lower waterline must in general be no lower than the corrected heights along the lower waterline. In addition, DEM heights between the higher and lower waterlines can also be assigned smaller errors because of the reduced errors on the corrected waterline heights.
   The method was tested on a section of the TanDEM-X Intermediate DEM (IDEM) covering an 11 km reach of the Warwickshire Avon, England. Flood extents from four COSMO-SKyMed images were available at various stages of a flood in November 2012, and a LiDAR DEM was available for validation. In the area covered by the flood extents, the original IDEM heights had a mean difference from the corresponding LiDAR heights of 0.5 m with a standard deviation of 2.0 m, while the corrected heights had a mean difference of 03 m with standard deviation 1.2 m. These figures show that significant reductions in IDEM height bias and error can be made using the method, with the corrected error being only 60% of the original. Even if only a single SAR image obtained near the peak of the flood was used, the corrected error was only 66% of the original. The method should also be capable of improving the final TanDEM-X DEM and other DEMs, and may also be of use with data from the SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) satellite.

AB Ecological and land management applications would often benefit from maps of relative canopy cover of each species present within a pixel, instead of traditional remote-sensing based maps of either dominant species or percent canopy cover without regard to species composition. Widely used statistical models for remote sensing, such as randomForest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and generalized linear regression (GLM), are problematic for this purpose as they often fail to properly predict the absence of a target species, especially in areas of high vegetation diversity, due to the relative abundance of absence observations (or zero values) in the reference data used to train predictive models. Experience has shown that RF, SVM, and GLM models trained on such reference data produce biased values of PCC, for example, in forested areas absent the target species, PCC is overestimated, while in forested areas where a target species PCC is abundant, PCC tends to be underestimated. We used zero-inflated regression modeling to reduce such bias and better predict PCC-by-species within each pixel in mixed conifer forests. Zero-inflated regression models use a two-step process to first predict the presence or absence of the target species, and then to predict continuous levels of PCC only where the target species is present. We compared the results of three widely used methods (RF, SVM, and GLM) to nine zero-inflated models for their ability to predict continuous PCC for each of five different conifer species in heterogeneous forests of northwestern Montana using Landsat TM and OLI imagery. Our best zero-inflated models resulted in a mean difference of -3.84% to 2.26%, 95% confidence interval of 6.22% to 13.09%, and RMSE of 11.26% to 22.98%, depending on the species. The success of the zero-inflated model was robust across methods tested. Both the zero-inflated and traditional methods were successful in estimating continuous canopy cover, however, the traditional models showed a substantial bias by never correctly predicting the absence of the target species, while the zero-inflated models correctly predicted species absence 57% to 84% of the time, depending on the species. Visual inspection of the predicted maps compared to high-resolution imagery demonstrated that the zero-inflated models also more closely matched the landscape, as traditional models more often incorrectly predicted canopy cover in non-forested areas. Using the zero-inflated process dramatically reduced the bias of the results, allowing end users to make management decisions with increased confidence about where a target species is absent, something not possible with the traditional methods tested.

AB In ocean colour remote sensing, the use of Near Infra Red (NIR) spectral bands for the retrieval of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration in turbid and highly turbid waters has proven to be successful. In extremely turbid waters (TSM > 100 mg L-1) however, these bands are less sensitive to increases in TSM. Here it is proposed to use Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) spectral bands between 1000 and 1300 nm for these extreme cases. This SWIR spectral region is subdivided into two regions, SWIR-I (1000 nm to 1200 nm) and SWIR-II (1200 nm to 1300 nm) which correspond to local minima in the pure water absorption spectrum. For both spectral regions the water reflectance signal was measured in situ with an ASD spectrometer in three different extremely turbid estuarine sites: Scheldt (Belgium), Gironde (France), and Rio de la Plata (Argentina), along with the TSM concentration. A measurable water reflectance was observed for all sites in SWIR-I, while in the SWIR-II region the signal was not significant compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of current Ocean Colour (OC) sensors. For the spectral band at 1020 nm (present in Ocean and Land Colour Instrument - OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3) and at 1071 nm, an empirical single band TSM algorithm is defined which is valid for both the Gironde and Scheldt estuarine sites. This means that a single algorithm can be applied for both sites without expensive recalibration. The relationship between TSM and SWIR reflectance at 1020 and 1071 nm is linear and did not show any saturation for the concentrations measured here (up to 1400 mg L-1), while saturation was observed for the NIR wavelengths, as expected. Hence, for extremely turbid waters it is advised to switch from NIR to SWIR4 wavelengths to estimate TSM concentration. This was demonstrated for an airborne hyperspectral dataset (Airborne Prism Experiment, APEX) from the Gironde estuary having several spectral bands in the SVVIR-I. The empirical single band SWIR TSM algorithm was applied to the atmospherically corrected scene providing a TSM concentration map of the Gironde from mouth to more upstream with concentrations expected in this region ranging from a few to several hundreds mg L-1. These results, i.e. the existence of a single relationship for the Scheldt and Gironde, not showing any decrease of sensitivity, highlights the importance of having SWIR bands in future ocean colour sensors for studying extremely turbid rivers, coastal areas and estuaries in the world. A further implication of these results is that there is a TSM limit for application of atmospheric correction algorithms which assume zero SWIR marine reflectance. That limit is defined here as function of wavelength and sensor noise level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the benefits of assimilating SMOS soil moisture retrievals for hydrologic modeling, with a focus on soil moisture and streamflow simulations in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. In this basin, floods occur relatively frequently and initial catchment storage is known to be key to runoff generation. The land surface model is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model is calibrated using the available streamflow records of 169 gauge stations across the Murray Darling Basin. The VIC soil moisture forecast is sequentially updated with observations from the SMOS Level 3 CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS) soil moisture product using the Ensemble Kalman filter. The assimilation algorithm accounts for the spatial mismatch between the model (0.125) and the SMOS observation (25 km) grids. Three widely-used methods for removing bias between model simulations and satellite observations of soil moisture are evaluated. These methods match the first, second and higher order moments of the soil moisture distributions, respectively. In this study, the first order bias correction, i.e. the rescaling of the long term mean, is the recommended method. Preserving the observational variability of the SMOS soil moisture data leads to improved soil moisture updates, particularly for dry and wet conditions, and enhances initial conditions for runoff generation. Second or higher order bias correction, which includes a rescaling of the variance, decreases the temporal variability of the assimilation results. In comparison with in situ measurements of OzNet the assimilation with mean bias correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the modeled soil moisture from 0.058 m(3)/m(3) to 0.046 m(3)/m(3) and increases the correlation from 0564 to 0.714. These improvements in antecedent wetness conditions further translate into improved predictions of associated water fluxes, particularly runoff peaks. In conclusion, the results of this study clearly demonstrate the merit of SMOS data assimilation for soil moisture and streamflow predictions at the large scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Several remote sensing studies have documented widespread thermokarst lake expansion in continuous permafrost regions of North America over the past few decades. Other studies have found no long-term trends in water body extents, but large intra- and inter-annual changes driven by precipitation. These differences could be due to geographic variability in physical conditions (geology, climate, permafrost and hydrology) or in the data and methods used to extract water bodies. This study tested water extraction methods over the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, based on the Landsat 5 shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel and validated them using water extents obtained from 05 m resolution orthophoto imagery. Methods included applying thresholds to generate binary land/water classifications, as well as deriving 30 m water fractions from both linear unmixing and a new histogram breakpoint method. Results indicated that the histogram breakpoint method outperformed other methods, underestimating overall water fraction by 0.26% and overestimating the number of pure 30 m water pixels by 0.66% compared to water fractions calculated from orthophotos. The breakpoint method was then applied to a stack of 17 near peak-of-season Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 images acquired between July 4 and August 18 from 1985 to 2011 to create a water fraction time-series for examining both trends and inter-annual variation in water extent. Results showed an overall expansion of lake area along margins by 55 km(2) with isolated lakes experiencing rapid drainage totalling 15 km(2), leading to a net water area increase of 40 km(2) over the 26-year period.

AB Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

AB Fine-scale variation of vegetation structure in dryland systems, such as the Great Basin in the western US, is critical to understanding ecosystem responses to changing land-use conditions. High resolution airborne hyperspectral (HyMap) and LiDAR datasets acquired across independent collection sites can reduce uncertainty in predictive ecosystem modeling and provide a basis for regional upscaling to satellite observations of structural metrics such as cover and height. In the first part of our study, we combined ground reference and airborne data collected at three sagebrush-steppe locations and used the statistical data mining tool random forests to identify remote sensing variables most relevant to estimating shrub cover. In the second part of our study, we hypothesized that vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral satellite observations would not only reliably predict shrub cover but also be relatable to shrub height; thereby augmenting the collection of vertical structure estimates from future satellite platforms such as ICESAT-2. To test this hypothesis, we simulated HyspIRI observations to derive variables to relate to UDAR-based estimates of shrub cover and height. We generated the same hyperspectral variables as in the first part of this study but at coarser resolution (60 m) and we again used random forests to model shrub cover and height and identify predictors of greatest importance. Overall, combining LiDAR and HyMap datasets at the airborne scale improved shrub cover model results (r(2) = 0.58) compared to LiDAR alone (r(2) = 0.49). Primary shrub cover variables of importance were H-IQR (the interquartile range of height of all LiDAR vegetation returns), H-MAD (median absolute deviation from median height of all LiDAR vegetation returns), a narrowband index sensitive to anthocyanins, the ratio of LiDAR vegetation returns to total returns, and a red to green ratio. In addition, HyspIRI-simulated narrowband vegetation indices were relatable to LiDAR-derived shrub cover and height variables (r(2) ranging from 0.63 to 0.71) with relatively low root mean square error.

AB Accurate and up-to-date information on the time-varying topography of active volcanoes is crucial for assessing material flows through these volcanic systems and along their surfaces. As dome-building volcanoes can change on meter scale within short time intervals in active phases, conventionally used repeat-pass SAR-interferometry (InSAR) often fails due to decorrelation effects, while other methods to measure topography like aerial photogrammetry or Lidar depend on the availability of the local infrastructure and on good weather conditions. Here, we show the potential of the spaceborne Earth observation mission TanDEM-X to monitor topographic changes at active dome-building volcanoes. In this innovative satellite mission, two nearly identical satellites fly in a close formation, taking radar images of the Earth's surface at the same time in bistatic mode. This opens the possibility to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) of volcanoes. Analyzing a series of repeated DEMs enables assessment of volume changes caused by lava dome activity. We apply this method to Merapi in Indonesia by analyzing the volume changes during the hazardous 2010 eruption. During this eruption, the old lava dome collapsed, and a new lava dome was extruded which collapsed again within twelve days. We show three DEMs derived from bistatic TanDEM-X InSAR in descending orbit taken before and after the eruption. We found a mean volume change of 19 x 10(6) m(3) in the summit area. The two estimates differ by 0.4 x 106 m3 which is 2% of the average dome volume change. The TanDEM-X based results are about 25% lower than reference data, which can be explained by the shadow masks that were introduced to exclude geometrically decorrelated areas, resulting in conservative volume change estimates.

AB Plant coverage is a basic indicator of the biomass production in ecosystems. On the Tibetan Plateau, the biomass of grasslands provides major ecosystem services with regard to the predominant transhumance economy. The pastures, however, are threatened by progressive degradation, resulting in a substantial reduction in plant coverage with currently unknown consequences for the hydrological/climate regulation function of the plateau and the major river systems of SE Asia that depend on it and provide water for the adjacent lowlands. Thus, monitoring of changes in plant coverage is of utmost importance, but no reliable tools have been available to date to monitor the changes on the entire plateau. Due to the wide extent and remoteness of the Tibetan Plateau, remote sensing is the only tool that can recurrently provide area-wide data for monitoring purposes. In this study, we develop and present a grassland-cover product based on multi-sensor satellite data that is applicable for monitoring at three spatial resolutions (WorldView type at 2-5 m, Landsat type at 30 m, MODIS at 500 m), where the data of the latter resolution cover the entire plateau. Four different retrieval techniques to derive plant coverage from satellite data in boreal summer (JJA) were tested. The underlying statistical models are derived with the help of field observations of the cover at 640 plots and 14 locations, considering the main grassland vegetation types of the Tibetan Plateau. To provide a product for the entire Tibetan Plateau, plant coverage estimates derived by means of the higher-resolution data were upscaled to MODIS composites acquired between 2011 and 2013. An accuracy assessment of the retrieval methods revealed best results for the retrieval using support vector machine regressions (RMSE: 9.97%, 7.13% and 5.51% from the WorldView to the MODIS scale). The retrieved values coincide well with published coverage data on the different grassland vegetation types. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB In order to optimize frontal detection in sea surface temperature fields at 4 km resolution, a combined statistical and expert-based approach is applied to test different spatial smoothing of the data prior to the detection process. Fronts are usually detected at 1 km resolution using the histogram-based, single image edge detection (SIED) algorithm developed by Cayula and Cornillon in 1992, with a standard preliminary smoothing using a median filter and a 3 x 3 pixel kernel. Here, detections are performed in three study regions (off Morocco, the Mozambique Channel and north-western Australia) and across the Indian Ocean basin using the combination of multiple windows (CMW) method developed by Nieto, Demarcq and McClatchie in 2012 which improves on the original Cayula and Cornillon algorithm. Detections at 4 km and 1 km resolution are compared.
   Fronts are divided into two intensity classes ("weak" and "strong") according to their thermal gradient A preliminary smoothing is applied prior to the detection using different convolutions: three type of filters (median, average and Gaussian) combined with four kernel sizes (3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7, and 9 x 9 pixels) and three detection window sizes (16 x 16,24 x 24 and 32 x 32 pixels) to test the effect of these smoothing combinations on reducing the background noise of the data and therefore on improving the frontal detection. The performance of the combinations on 4 km data are evaluated using two criteria: detection efficiency and front length. We find that the optimal combination of preliminary smoothing parameters in enhancing detection efficiency and preserving front length includes a median filter, a 16 x 16 pixel window size, and a 5 x 5 pixel kernel for strong fronts and a 7 x 7 pixel kernel for weak fronts. Results show an improvement in detection performance (from largest to smallest window size) of 71% for strong fronts and 120% for weak fronts. Despite the small window used (16 x 16 pixels), the length of the fronts has been preserved relative to that found with 1 km data.
   This optimal preliminary smoothing and the CMW detection algorithm on 4 km sea surface temperature data are then used to describe the spatial distribution of the monthly frequencies of occurrence for both strong and weak fronts across the Indian Ocean basin. In general, strong fronts are observed in coastal areas; whereas weak fronts, with some seasonal exceptions, are mainly located in the open ocean.
   This study shows that adequate noise reduction achieved by a preliminary smoothing of the data considerably improves the frontal detection efficiency as well as the global quality of the results. Consequently, the use of 4 km data enables frontal detections similar to 1 km data (using a standard median 3 x 3 convolution) in terms of detectability, length and location. This method is easily applicable to large regions or at the global scale, with far less constraints of data manipulation and processing time using 4 km data relative to 1 km data.

AB Nearest neighbors techniques calculate predictions as linear combinations of observations for a selected number of population units in a sample that are most similar, or nearest, in a space of auxiliary variables to the population unit requiring the prediction. Nearest neighbors techniques have been shown to be particularly effective when used with forest inventory and remotely sensed data. Recent attention has focused on developing an underlying foundation consisting of diagnostic tools, inferential extensions, and techniques for optimization.
   For a study area in Norway, forest inventory and airborne laser scanning data were used with the k-Nearest Neighbors technique to estimate mean aboveground biomass per unit area. Optimization entailed reduction of the dimension of feature space, deletion of influential outliers, and selection of optimal weights for the weighted Euclidean distance metric. These optimization steps increased the proportion of variability explained in the reference set by as much as 20%, reduced confidence interval widths by as much as 35%, and produced standard errors that were as small as 3% of the estimate of the mean.

AB Mountain glaciers are pertinent indicators of climate change and their dynamics, in particular surface velocity change, is an essential climate variable. In order to retrieve the climatic signature from surface velocity, large-scale study of temporal trends spanning multiple decades is required. Satellite image feature-tracking has been successfully used to derive mountain glacier surface velocities, but most studies rely on manually selected pairs of images, which is not adequate for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a processing strategy to exploit complete satellite archives in a semi-automated way in order to derive robust and spatially complete glacier velocities and their uncertainties on a large spatial scale. In this approach, all available pairs within a defined time span are analysed, preprocessed to improve image quality and features are tracked to produce a velocity stack; the final velocity is obtained by selecting measures from the stack with the statistically higher level of confidence. This approach allows to compute statistical uncertainty level associated with each measured image pixel. This strategy is applied to 1536 pairs of Landsat 5 and 7 images covering the 3000 km long Pamir-Karakoram-Himalaya range for the period of 1999-2001 to produce glacier annual velocity fields. We obtain a velocity estimate for 76,000 km(2) or 92% of the glacierized areas of this region. We then discuss the impact of coregistration errors and variability of glacier flow on the final velocity. The median 95% confidence interval ranges from 2.0 m/year on the average in stable areas and 4.4 m/year on the average over glaciers with variability related to data density, surface conditions and strain rate. These performances highlight the benefits of processing of a complete satellite archive to produce glacier velocity fields and to analyse glacier dynamics at regional scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The MIPAS spectrometer onboard the Envisat platform observed infrared emission from the Earth's limb between 2002 and 2012. It recorded high-resolution spectra during day and night, from pole to pole and between 6 and 70 km altitude in the nominal measurement mode or up to 170 km in special measurement modes, producing daily more than 1000 vertical profiles of various trace gases. The operational Level-2 data are processed by ESA/DLR but there exist three other, independent research Level-2 processors that are hosted by ISAC-CNR/University of Bologna, Oxford University, and KIT IMK/IAA. All four Level-2 processors rely on the same Level-1b data provided by ESA but their retrieval schemes differ. As part of ESA's Ozone Climate Change Initiative project, an intercomparison of the four MIPAS processors took place, in which vertical ozone profiles retrieved by these four processors from MIPAS nominal mode measurements were compared for 2007 and 2008. We present the results of this comparison exercise, which consisted of five parts: an information content study of the vertical averaging kernels, an intercomparison of zonal seasonal means and spreads, a determination of biases through comparison to ozonesonde and lidar measurements, a comparison to other satellite records (bias estimation and precision assessment with respect to ACE-FTS and Aura-MLS data), and a geophysical validation of the provided error bars using MIPAS MIPAS collocations.
   The four processors demonstrate similar performance. All processors use the same Level-1b data from ESA, apply global fits, and use microwindows instead of the full spectrum. The main differences in the processing schemes include the choice of microwindows, the regularization approach, the treatment of negative retrieved values, and the cloud detection threshold. The different regularization schemes lead to a different trade-off between noise and resolution, but without a clear average advantage for any particular data set. The vertical resolution is typically 3-5 km and the single profile precision is about 2-3%. In the middle and upper stratosphere, at 25-45 km, all four MIPAS processors clearly show a high bias of 2 to 5% relative to all reference instruments. The similarity of the structure and magnitude of the bias among the MIPAS data sets indicates that the bias is most likely linked to the use of microwindows of the MIPAS AB band. The satellite intercomparisons show furthermore that for the KIT dataset, the onset of the high bias starts at a somewhat higher altitude (only above 35 km) than for the other three datasets. This is likely due to the more restrictive use of the AB band by the KIT processor, which comes at the cost of a coarser vertical resolution near the ozone volume mixing ratio (vmr) peak. In the troposphere, the Level-2 algorithms that suppress negative ozone values in the iterative retrieval process produce a larger positive bias than the algorithm that does not follow such a strategy. Our main conclusion is that the four MIPAS processors are more similar to each other than to any other reference instrument. This indicates that the observed biases are very likely instrument-related. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing data play an important role in the monitoring of forest changes. Methods are needed to provide objective estimates of forest loss to support monitoring efforts at various scales, and with increasing public availability of remote sensing data, accurate deforestation measurements at high temporal resolution are becoming more realistic. While several time series based methods have recently been described in the literature, there are few studies focusing on tropical forest areas, where low data availability and complex change processes present challenges to forest disturbance monitoring. Here, we present a robust data-driven method to track tropical deforestation and degradation based on Landsat time series data. Based on the previously reported Breaks For Additive Season and Trend Monitor (BFAST Monitor) method (Verbesselt et al, 2012), we show that BFAST Monitor, when applied to Landsat NDVI rime series data using sequentially defined monitoring periods, can be used to track small-scale forest disturbances annually in an Afromontane forest system in southern Ethiopia. Using an ordinal logistic regression (OLR) approach, change magnitude, calculated based on differences between observed and expected values in a monitoring period, was found to be an essential predictor variable for disturbances. After applying a NDVI change magnitude threshold of -0.065, overall accuracy was estimated to be 78%, and both producer's and user's accuracy of the disturbance class were estimated to be 73%. The method and results presented here are relevant to tropical countries engaged in REDD + for whom data availability and complex forest change dynamics limit the ability to reliably track forest disturbances over time.

AB Vegetation phenology strongly controls photosynthetic activity and ecosystem function and is essential for monitoring the response of vegetation to climate change and variability. Terrestrial ecosystem models require robust phenology models to understand and simulate the relationship between ecosystems and a changing climate. While current phenology models are able to capture inter-annual variation in the timing of vegetation spring onset, their spatiotemporal performances are not well understood. Using green-up dates derived from MODIS, we test 9 phenological models that predict the timing of grassland spring onset via commonly available climatological variables. Model evaluation using satellite observations suggests that Modified Growing-Degree Day (MGDD) models and Accumulated Growing Season Index (AGSI) models achieve reasonable accuracy (RMSE < 20 days) after model calibration. Inclusion of a photoperiod trigger and varied critical forcing thresholds in the temperature-based phenology model improves model applicability at a regional scale. In addition, we observe that AGSI models outperform MGDD models by capturing inter-annual phenology variation in large semi-arid areas, likely due to the explicit consideration of water availability. Further validation based on flux tower sites shows good agreement between the modeled timing of spring onset and references derived from satellite observations and in-situ measurements. Our results confirm recent studies and indicate that there is a need to calibrate current phenology models to predict grassland spring onsets accurately across space and time. We demonstrate the feasibility of combining satellite observations and climatic datasets to develop and refine phenology models for characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of grassland green-up variations.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(l)) represent key biophysical and biochemical controls on water, energy and carbon exchange processes in the terrestrial biosphere. In combination, [LAI and Chi(1), provide critical information on vegetation density, vitality and photosynthetic potentials. However, simultaneous retrieval of LAI and Chl(l) from space observations is extremely challenging. Regularization strategies are required to increase the robustness and accuracy of retrieved properties and enable more reliable separation of soil, leaf and canopy parameters. To address these challenges, the REGularized canopy reFLECtance model (REGFLEC) inversion system was refined to incorporate enhanced techniques for exploiting ancillary LAI and temporal information derived from multiple satellite scenes. In this current analysis, REGFLEC is applied to a time-series of Landsat data.
   A novel aspect of the REGFLEC approach is the fact that no site-specific data are required to calibrate the model, which may be run in a largely automated fashion using information extracted entirely from image-based and other widely available datasets. Validation results, based upon in-situ LAI and Chl(l) observations collected over maize and soybean fields in central Nebraska for the period 2001-2005, demonstrate Chl(l) retrieval with a relative root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) on the order of 19% (RMSD = 8.42 pg cm(-2)). While Chli retrievals were clearly influenced by the version of the leaf optical properties model used (PROSPECT), the application of spatio-temporal regularization constraints was shown to be critical for estimating Chl(l) with sufficient accuracy. REGFLEC also reproduced the dynamics of in-situ measured LAI well (r(2) = 0.85), but estimates were biased low, particularly over maize (LAI was underestimated by -36 %). This disparity may be attributed to differences between effective and true LAI caused by significant foliage clumping not being properly accounted for in the canopy reflectance model (SAIL). Additional advances in the retrieval of canopy biophysical and leaf biochemical constituents will require innovative use of existing remote sensing data within physically realistic canopy reflectance models along with the ability to exploit the enhanced spectral and spatial capabilities of upcoming satellite systems.

AB Uncertainties in the spectral remote-sensing reflectance for SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua are characterized based on globally distributed data sets of in situ/satellite matchups. The in situ data sets were derived from fixed mooring sites and ship data using a variety of field radiometers. An optical classification procedure was applied to the satellite reflectance from each matchup pair to derive its fuzzy membership to eight previously characterized, optical water types. The memberships were then used as weights to derive uncertainty measures for the optical water types. The resulting uncertainty measures are shown to vary by optical water type for both sensors. Overall, the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) for open ocean waters is low and diminishes with increasing wavelength. The RMSD increases with optical complexity and is the highest in coastal waters associated with highly absorbing or highly scattering conditions. Although it plays a small role in RMSD, a spectral bias with a distinct zigzag pattern was detected across all water types. The most sensitive measure associated with optical water types is the relative uncertainty, which is shown to be near the desired 5% threshold for much of the open ocean for both SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, but exceeds 50% in waters where the reflectance signal is low. This approach provides an objective method for characterizing uncertainty in water environments with distinct optical properties, and the results can be used in the processing of future satellite data to derive their associated uncertainty fields.

AB Accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) often depends on how features of different spatial scales are represented. Scale dependence is particularly important in low gradient coastal environments where small vertical errors can affect large areas and where representation of fine scale topographic features can influence how DEMs are used for modeling inundation. It is commonly observed that different types of DEMs represent larger, coarse-scale topographic features similarly but differ in how they represent smaller, finer-scale features. The spatial-scale dependence of DEM accuracy can be quantified in terms of the correlation scale (lambda(C)); the spatial wavelength above which models agree with spectral coherency >05 and below which they differ. We compare cross spectral analyses of the GDEM2 and SRTM global DEMs with 14,572 LiDAR-derived elevations along transects in diverse coastal environments of New York City. Both global DEMs have positive bias relative to LiDAR ground elevations, but bias (mu) and uncertainty (sigma) of GDEM2 (mu: 8.1 m; sigma: 7.6 m) are significantly greater than those of SRTM (mu: 1.9 m; sigma. 3.6 m). Cross-spectral coherency between GDEM2 and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of lambda < similar to 3 km, while coherency between SRTM and the LiDAR DEM begins to roll-off at scales of lambda < similar to 1 km. The correlation scale below which coherency with LiDAR attains a signal to noise ratio of I is similar to 1 km for GDEM2 and similar to 0.5 km for SRTM; closely matching the divergence scales where the surface roughness of the land cover exceeds the roughness of the underlying terrain.

AB Mapping and monitoring land cover and land cover change remains a top priority for land managers. Uniquely, remote sensing offers the capacity to acquire information in a systematic (spatially, temporally, and categorically) and synoptic fashion that is appealing from monitoring and reporting perspectives. The opening of the Landsat archive and new processing and analysis opportunities enable the characterization of large areas and the generation of dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive information products. Best Available Pixel (BAP) approaches enable the production of periodic image composites free of haze, clouds, or shadows over large areas. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated protocol to produce spatially exhaustive annual BAP image composites that are seasonally constrained and free of atmospheric perturbations. These annual BAP composites for the years inclusive of 1998 to 2010 provide for generation of a suite of change metrics for the period 2000 to 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data. The study area is the >375,000 km(2) forested area of Saskatchewan, Canada. We evaluate the robustness of the protocol by comparing in-filled (or proxy) values with a true reference set for surface reflectance. An initial change detection pass is used to aid in the allocation of proxy values (for missing and anomalous values) and to allocate change events to the correct year, with a second pass to characterize key change points and related time series trends (e.g., change year, post-change slopes, among others). In so doing, a multi-temporal data cube (via a series of annual proxy composites) and a set of change metrics are generated. Approximately 35% of the pixels in our study area required proxy values, either as a result of missing data or our noise detection approach. Overall, our results indicate strong agreement between the assigned proxy values and the reference data (R = 0.71-0.91, RMSE = 0.008-0.025). Agreement was stronger for pixel series with no change events (R = 0.73-0.92, RMSE = 0.007-0.024), relative to pixel series with change events (R = 0.63-0.87, RMSE = 0.010-0.029). The generated change metrics, derived via temporal and spatial analysis of the annual BAP composites, were an important precursor to the generation of valid proxy values, and - importantly - provide valuable information for the further assessment and understanding of land cover and land cover change. Our results indicate that the demonstrated protocol provides a reliable approach to generate proxy image composites containing no data gaps, along with a suite of informative change metrics that provide a comprehensive characterization of land cover changes (including disturbance and recovery) allowing for an improved understanding of landscape dynamics. The protocol is efficient and may be applied over large areas to support regional and national mapping and monitoring activities.

AB The detection of urban heat island (UHI) is generally conducted from ground observations of air temperature and remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST). Satellite remotely sensed LST has many merits, such as global coverage and consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weaknesses of ground observations related to the footprint, site distributions, and costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, air temperatures are equally important. This study explores the potential to estimate the near-surface air and dew-point temperatures from the MODIS 07 atmospheric profile product (MOD07_L2) to capture the UHI dynamics at 5 km resolution. Four mega-cities in North America: Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, and Toronto, are evaluated during 2003-2013 summers. The comparison between the MODIS near-surface temperature and the ground observations suggests an accuracy of 3-7 K RMSE for different cities and times of day. For air temperature, the Aqua overpass has better agreements, and nighttime has higher accuracy than daytime in most cases. In general, very dry (Phoenix) and very moist (Houston) climate conditions increase the variability of the MODIS temperature accuracy. This study also develops an urban heat island curve (UHIC) to represent UHI intensity by integrating the urban surface heterogeneity in a curve, showing the relationship between air temperature and urban fraction. UHIC provides a new way to quantify UHI city by city, which emphasizes the temperature gradients, consequently decreasing the impact of data biases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 10-year archive of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data is an invaluable resource for studies on lake system dynamics at regional and global scales. MERIS data are no longer actively acquired but their capacity for global scale monitoring of lakes from satellites will soon be re-established through the forthcoming Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). The development and validation of in-water algorithms for the accurate retrieval of biogeochemical parameters is thus of key importance if the potential of MERIS and OLCI data is to be fully exploited for lake monitoring. This study presents the first extensive validation of algorithms for chlorophyll-a (chl-a) retrieval by MERIS in the highly turbid and productive waters of Lake Balaton, Hungary. Six algorithms for chl-a retrieval from MERIS over optically complex Case 2 waters, including band-difference and neural network architectures, were compared using the MERIS archive for 2007-2012. The algorithms were locally-tuned and validated using in situ chl-a data (n = 289) spanning the five year processed image time series and from all four lake basins. In general, both band-difference algorithms tested (Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)) performed well, whereas the neural network processors were generally found to much less accurately-retrieve in situ chl-a concentrations. The Level 1b FLH algorithm performed best overall in terms of chl-a retrieval (R-2 = 0.87; RMSE = 4.19 mg m(-3); relative RMSE = 30.75%) and particularly at chl-a concentrations of >= 10 mg m(-3) (R-2 = 0.85; RMSE = 4.81 mg m(-3); relative RMSE = 20.77%). However, under mesotrophic conditions (i.e., chl-a < 10 mg m(-3)) FLH was outperformed by the locally-tuned FUB/WeW processor (relative FLH RMSE < 10 mg m(-3) = 57.57% versus relative FUB/WeW RMSE < 10 mg m(-3) = 46.96%). An ensemble selection of in-water algorithms is demonstrated to improve chl-a retrievals. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Low-intensity farming systems are of great importance for biodiversity in Europe, but they are often affected by soil degradation or economic pressure, leading to either land abandonment or intensification of agriculture. These changes in land use influence local biodiversity patterns and require annual monitoring of land cover. To accurately map land cover in such spatio-temporal complex landscapes, it is important to capture their phenological dynamics and fine spatial heterogeneity. Multi-seasonal analyses using optical sensors with a medium spatial resolution from 10 to 60 m (e.g. Landsat) have been used for this task, but data availability can be scarce due to cloud cover, sub-optimal acquisition schedules and data archive access restrictions. Combining coarse spatial resolution data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat provides opportunities to close these gaps by simulating Landsat-like images at MODIS temporal resolution. In this study, we test whether and by what degree land cover maps of complex Mediterranean landscapes improve by integrating multi-seasonal Landsat imagery, as well as whether STARFM-simulated imagery can be used whenever original multi-seasonal Landsat observations are unavailable. Therefore, we develop different classification scenarios based on seasonally varying data availability and based on original and simulated Landsat data. Results show that multi-seasonal Landsat data from spring and early autumn are crucial for achieving satisfying mapping accuracies (overall accuracy 74.5%). Using synthetic Landsat imagery increases classification accuracy compared to using single-date Landsat data, but accuracies were never as good as a classification based on original data. We conclude that multi-seasonal data is essential for mapping complex Mediterranean landscapes and that STARFM can be used to compensate for missing Landsat observations. However, if Landsat data availability is sufficient to cover all phenologically important dates, we suggest relying solely on Landsat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This work aims at the development and validation of a zeroth order radiative transfer (RT) approach to describe the visible band (555 nm) reflectance of conifer-dominated boreal forest for the needs of remote sensing of snow. This is accomplished by applying airborne and mast-borne spectrometer data sets together with high-resolution information on forest canopy characteristics. In case of aerial spectrometer observations, tree characteristics determined from airborne LIDAR observations are applied to quantify the effect of forest canopy on scene reflectance. The results indicate that a simple RT model is feasible to describe extinction and reflectance properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous forest scenes (corresponding to varying scales of satellite data footprints and varying structures of forest canopies). The obtained results also justify the application of apparent forest canopy transmissivity to describe the influence of forest to reflectance, as is done e.g. in the SCAmod method for the continental scale monitoring of fractional snow cover (FSC) from optical satellite data. Additionally, the feasibility of the zeroth order RT approach is compared with the use of linear mixing model of scene reflectance. Results suggest that the nonlinear RT approach describes the scene reflectance of a snow-covered boreal forest more realistically than the linear mixing model (in case when shadows on tree crowns and surface are not modeled separately, which is a relevant suggestion when considering the use of models for large scale snow mapping applications).

AB With the launch of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) in 2006, the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) took the initiative to implement the first global-scale systematic acquisition strategy for satellite sensors at fine and medium (2.5-20 m) spatial resolution. Comprising all three sensors on ALOS (PALSAR, PRISM, AVNIR-2), the plan was designed to serve all ALOS user categories and aimed at producing spatially and temporally consistent baseline coverages over the planet on a repetitive basis, to accommodate systematic global-scale, fine-resolution, monitoring of the environment. Unlike the common background missions defined for most fine-resolution Earth Observation satellites, the observation strategy was implemented as a top-level foreground mission with a priority second only to that of special observation requests and emergency observations and sensor calibration.
   While the ALOS mission regrettably ended in April 2011, the global acquisition strategy nevertheless produced a comprehensive and homogeneous global archive in which consistent time-series of data are available for any arbitrary land area on Earth (excluding Antarctica >77.5 degrees South latitude, which could not be reached by the sensors). Clouds and haze inevitably constituted limitations for the optical sensors, while for the PALSAR instrument, two cloud-free and near-gap free (similar to 95%) global coverages were achieved annually during the 4.5 years in operations. Previously, such uniform data archives existed only for coarse-resolution sensors such as AVHRR, MERIS and MODIS. The ALOS BOS supported a variety applications from local to global scales, ranging from structural deformation, monitoring of wetlands regional inundation patterns and mapping of forest extent and changes over nations and continents at spatial resolutions as fine as 10 m.
   The Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) was launched on May 24, 2014. Equipped with an enhanced L-band SAR sensor (PALSAR-2), ALOS-2 resumes the global wall-to-wall acquisitions to assure continuity and consistency with JAXA's global mission objectives and unique L-band SAR archive created by ALOS PALSAR.

AB Empirical chlorophyll algorithms depend on the inter-relationships of the various in-water optical constituents which may change in both space and time in optically complex estuaries. Thus, algorithms developed for one case may not be applicable for others due to their different requirements on the model forms, wavebands, or model parameters. Here, using both in situ and satellite data collected from two estuaries in the United States, namely Tampa Bay and Chesapeake Bay, we attempted to address this technical challenge through water type classification and type-specific algorithm tuning. Based on an existing NTD675 (Normalized Trough Depth at 675 nm) water classification method that was originally devised for inland turbid waters, the estuarine waters were divided into three water types, and then used to develop type-specific empirical algorithms using different bands (2-band, 3-band, and 4-band algorithms). The 2-band model outperformed the other models, whose band selection varied with water types. Application of the type-specific models to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data showed uncertainties of 32.5% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 4.7 mg m(-3) in root mean square error (RMSE) for chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) ranging between 2 and 20 mg m(-3). As a comparison, a unified model tuned for all water types without classification showed inferior performance with a MAPE of 50.5% and a RMSE of 5.9 mg m(-3). By means of the in situ data, the type-specific models for the classified waters yielded a general improvement in MAPE by 8.4%, in comparison with the model for the non-classified water. Application to satellite imagery also showed reasonable spatial distribution patterns of Chla in Tampa Bay and Chesapeake Bay. These results suggest that the type-specific models coupled with the NTD675 water classification have the potential for improving Chla retrievals over optically complex waters, while general applicability of the approach to other estuaries still requires further research.

AB The Three Gorges region of central western China is one of the most landslide-prone regions in the world. However, landslide detection based on field surveys and optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques remains difficult owing to the dense vegetation cover and mountain shadow. In the present study, an area of Zigui County in the Three Gorges region was selected to test the feasibility of detecting landslides by employing novel features extracted from a LiDAR-derived DTM. Additionally, two small sites Site 1 and Site 2 were selected for training and were used to classify each other. In addition to the aspect, DTM, and slope images, the following feature sets were proposed to improve the accuracy of landslide detection: (1) the mean aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on four texture directions; (2) aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on aspect; and (3) the moving average and standard deviation (stdev) filter of aspect, DTM, and slope. By combining a feature selection method and the RF algorithm, the classification accuracy was evaluated and landslide boundaries were determined. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The feature selection method demonstrated that the proposed features provided information useful for effective landslide identification. (2) Feature selection achieved an improvement of about 0.44% in the overall classification accuracy, with the feature set reduced by 74%, from 39 to 10; this can speed up the training of the RF model. (3) When fifty randomly selected 20% oflandslide pixels (P-LS) and 20% of non-landslide pixels (P-NLS) (i.e., 20% of P-LS and P-NLS) were utilized in addition to the selected feature subsets for training, the test sets (i.e., the remaining 80% of P-LS and P-NLS) yielded an average overall classification accuracy of 78.24%. The cross training and classification for Site 1 and Site 2 provided overall classification accuracies of 62.65% and 64.50%, respectively. This shows that the random sampling design (which suffered some of the effects of spatial auto-correlation) and the proposed method in this present study contribute jointly to the classification accuracy. (4) Using the Canny operator to delineate landslide boundaries based on the classification results of Pis and Pms, we obtained results consistent with the referenced landslide inventory maps. Thus, the proposed procedure, which combines LiDAR data, a feature selection method, and the RF algorithm, can identify forested landslides effectively in the Three Gorges region.

AB The effective soil temperature (T-eff) is essential for the retrieval of soil moisture information, when satellite microwave remote sensing data are used. In this investigation, a new two-layer scheme (Lv's scheme) is developed to estimate T-eff considering wavelength, soil moisture, sampling depth, and soil temperature. The accuracy of the estimated T-eff is verified with data collected in a field experiment at the Maqu Climate and Environment Observatory in the source region of the Yellow River. In addition to clearly defining the physical meaning of Lv's scheme, this study explains the physical meaning of Choudhury's C parameter, which is empirically determined by a least-square method. It was found that Lv's scheme does not require the fitting parameters. Further, Lv's scheme can be used to estimate T-eff based On soil moisture data at surface level or any other specified soil depths, thus creating the opportunity to use observation and modeled data from different depths.

AB Coastal upwelling events are effective in fluxing nutrients upward to the euphotic layer, thus promoting the growth of marine phytoplankton. Satellite data may provide useful information to detect and characterize upwelling events in regions of sparse in-situ observations. We analyze the coastal upwelling process on the western San Maths Gulf, on the northern continental shelf of Argentina, based on the analysis of remote sensing and in-situ data. Upwelling events are characterized by their frequency of occurrence and magnitude. During the austral summer we found roughly 6 upwelling-favorable wind events per year. Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) data provide evidence of upwelling in 85% of the cases between 2000 and 2008. Analysis of specific events provides clues on the wind forcing characteristics required to generate upwelling, and on characteristic space and time scales of the process. On February 2005 SST data reveal a narrow coastal band (similar to 10 km) of relative cold water extending similar to 100 km along the west coast of SMG. The SST in this band was 1.5 degrees C lower than further offshore. Near bottom temperature fluctuations from in-situ daily observations collected at two nearshore locations are significantly correlated with along-shore wind stress, suggesting that coastal upwelling is a dominant process controlling high-frequency temperature fluctuations near-shore. A simple quantitative estimate reveals a volume of upwelled water reaching the sea surface of about 10(10) m(3) during one relatively intense upwelling event.

AB Urban heat island (UHI) is a major anthropogenic alteration on Earth environments and its geospatial pattern remains poorly understood over large areas. Using MODIS data from 2003 to 2011, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal surface UHI intensity (SUHII, urban-suburban temperature difference) in China's 32 major cities, and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. Results show that the annual mean SUHII varied markedly from 0.01 to 1.87 degrees C in the day and 035 to 1.95 degrees C at night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. Higher SUHIls for the day and night were observed in the southeastern and northern regions, respectively. Moreover, the SUHII differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in winter during the day, and the opposite during the night for most cities. Consequently, whether the daytime SUHII was higher or lower than the nighttime SUHII for a city depends strongly on the geographic location and research period. The SUHII's distribution in the day related closely to vegetation activity and anthropogenic heat releases in summer, and to climate (temperature and precipitation) in winter, while that at night linked tightly to albedo, anthropogenic heat releases, built-up intensity, and climate in both seasons. Overall, we found the overwhelming control of climate on the SUHII's spatial variability, yet the factors included in this study explained a much smaller fraction of the SUHII variations in the day compared to night and in summer relative to winter (day vs. night: 57% vs. 72% in summer, and 61% vs. 90% in winter, respectively), indicating more complicated mechanisms underlying the distribution of daytime SUHII, particularly in summer. Our results highlight the different diurnal (day and night) and seasonal (summer and winter) SUHII's spatial patterns and driving forces, suggesting various strategies are needed for an effective UHI effect mitigation.

AB Improved monitoring of forest biomass and biomass change is needed to quantify natural and anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Landsat's temporal and spatial coverage, moderate spatial resolution, and long history of earth observations provide a unique opportunity for characterizing vegetation changes across large areas and long time scales. However, like with other multi-spectral passive optical sensors, Landsat's relationship of single-date reflectance with forest biomass diminishes under high leaf area and complex canopy conditions. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is largely determined by its disturbance and recovery history, we conceived a method that enhances Landsat's spectral relationships with biomass by including information on vegetation trends prior to the date for which estimates are desired. With recently developed algorithms that characterize trends in disturbance (e.g. year of onset, duration, and magnitude) and post-disturbance regrowth, it should now be possible to realize improved Landsat-based mapping of current biomass across large regions. Moreover, given that we now have 40 years of Landsat data, it should also be possible to use this approach to map historic biomass densities.
   In this study, we developed regression tree models to predict current forest aboveground biomass (AGB) for a mixed-conifer region in eastern Oregon (USA) using Landsat-based disturbance and recovery (DR) metrics. We employed the trajectory-fitting algorithm LandTrendr to characterize DR trends from yearly Landsat time series between 1972 and 2010. The most important DR predictors of AGB were associated with magnitude of disturbance, post-disturbance condition and post-disturbance recovery, whereas time since disturbance and pre-disturbance trends showed only weak correlations with AGB. Including DR metrics substantially improved predictions of AGB (RMSE = 30.3 Mg ha(-1), 27%) compared to models based on only single-date reflectance (RMSE = 39.6 Mg ha(-1), 35%). To determine the number of years required to adequately capture the effect of DR on AGB, we explored the relationship between time-series length and model prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy increased exponentially with increasing number of years across the entire observation period, suggesting that in this forest region the longer the historic record of disturbance and recovery metrics the more accurate the mapping of AGB. However, time series lengths of between 10 and 20 years were adequate to significantly improve model predictions, and lengths of as little as 5 years still had a meaningful impact To test the concept of historic biomass prediction, we applied our model to Landsat time series from 1972-1993 and estimated AGB biomass change between 1993 and 2007. Our estimates compared well with historic inventory data, demonstrating that long-term Landsat observations of DR processes can aid in monitoring AGB and AGB change. Instead of directly linking Landsat data with the limited amount of available field-based AGB data, in this study we used the field data to map AGB with airborne lidar and then sampled the lidar data for model training and error assessment By using lidar data to build and test our prediction model, this study illustrates that lidar data have great value for scaling between field measurements and Landsat data.

AB In this work the analysis of the surface and air heat island in Milan, Italy, by means of satellite maps is proposed. The urban heat island (UHI) maps were produced using data provided by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. Two types of UHI were analyzed simultaneously: the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) and the surface urban heat island (SUHI). The aim of this work is the realization of the SUHI and CLHI maps to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of surface and air heating; also, to highlight and quantify the different features (e.g. magnitude, spatial extent, orientation and UHI center location) a Gaussian surface was used to fit the spatially distributed heat island patterns.
   The analysis during summer months points out that the SUHI effect is a noticeable phenomenon throughout the whole diurnal cycle: it has a stronger intensity in the daytime with peaks around 9-10 K while in the nighttime, in the absence of solar forcing, it decreases by a factor of 2. In contrast, the canopy layer heat island during the daytime is absent: the CLHI emerges after sunset with an average intensity around 3-4 K, showing features similar to the nighttime SUHI.
   In addition, comparisons between UHI intensity and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were performed, confirming that green areas can contribute to the mitigation of this phenomenon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Air temperature (Ta) stations have limited spatial coverage, particularly in rural areas. Since temperature can vary greatly both spatially and temporally, Ta stations are often inadequate for studies on the health effects of extreme temperature and climate change. Satellites can provide us with daily physical surface temperature (Ts) measurements, enabling us to estimate daily Ta. In this study, we aimed to extend our previous work on predicting Ta from Ts in Massachusetts by predicting 24 h Ta means on a 1 km grid across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, extending both the temporal and spatial coverage, improving upon the methodology and validating our model in other geographical regions across the Northeastern part of the USA. We used mixed model regressions to first calibrate Ts and Ta measurements, regressing Ta measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random Ts slopes. Then to capture the ability of neighboring cells to fill in the cells with missing Ts values, we regress the Ta predicted from the first mixed effects model against the mean of the Ta measurements on that day, separately for each grid cell. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R-2 = 0.95 and R-2 = 0.94 respectively). We demonstrate how Ts can be used reliably to predict daily Ta at high resolution in large geographical areas even in non-retrieval days while reducing exposure measurement error.

AB Considering a large satellite dataset (i.e. similar to 16 years of ERS-2 and ENVISAT observations) we investigate the reliability of remotely-sensed data for calibrating a quasi-two dimensional (quasi-2D) hydraulic model of a similar to 140 km reach of the middle-lower portion of the Po river (Northern Italy), for which detailed topographical information and in-situ hydrometric data are available. In particular, we refer to traditional and remotelysensed hydrometric data for: 1) evaluating if ERS-2 and ENVISAT data can be used for model calibration; 2) assessing whether remotely-sensed water elevation data can integrate traditional hydrometric data and improve the reliability of the hydraulic model. Satellite overpasses are generally characterized by low frequencies and the accuracy of remotely-sensed water surface levels is still limited. Nevertheless, the results of our analysis indicate that for medium-to-large rivers ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite data can effectively enhance our knowledge of the average streamflow regime of a given reach: they can be directly used in calibration, and their integration with in-situ data may significantly enhance the representation of the hydraulic behaviour of the study river. Considering our study reach, if compared to the model implemented on the basis of in-situ data only the hydraulic model parameterized on the basis of satellite and in-situ hydrometric data provides a better reproduction of average flow conditions, and it also results in the most accurate representation of the maximum water profile observed during a major flood occurred in October 2000.

AB We studied the absorption properties of in-water constituents among 15 boreal lakes belonging to various lake types. One of the lakes was also monitored frequently during its growth season to reveal the seasonal variation of absorption properties. Within the studied lakes, CDOM absorption a(CDOM)(442) varied from 0.4 to 15 m(-1). CDOM was clearly dominating the absorption signal at low wavelengths, but even at the red-end of the spectra its contribution to total absorption was notable, varying from 48 to 99% of total absorption (excl. water) at 442 nm and from 5 to 86% at 665 nm. Slope of the CDOM absorption spectra S-CDOM(400-700) varied from 12.9 to 193 mu m(-1). Higher slopes were obtained when the wavelength range was extended to the UV-range (350700 and 300-700 nm). Non-linear relationships were noted between a(CDOM) and S-CDOM calculated over various wavelength ranges. Despite the significant relationship between DOC concentration and a(CDOM), almost fivefold variation was noted in DOC-specific CDOM absorption at 442 nm. This variation was clearly associated with concurrent changes in S-CDOM. Non-algal particulate absorption varied from 0.037 to 1.8 m(-1) at 442 nm, contributing <1 to 34% of total absorption at 442 nm and <1 to 27% at 442 nm. Slope of the NAP absorption spectra S-NAP(380-700) varied from 7.6 to 12.8 mu m(-1). Despite of the apparent covariation between weight of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and a(NAP), six-fold variation was observed in SPM-specific NAP absorption at 442 nm, which was mostly associated with organic content of the particle pool. Contribution of phytoplankton pigments ranged from 1 to 28% of total absorption at 442 nm, and 13 to 86% at 665 nm, respectively. Chlorophyll a (Chla) specific absorption of phytoplankton pigments varied from 0.012 to 0.038 m(2) (mg Chlar)(-1) at blue peak, and from 0.008 to 0.020 m(2) (mg Chla)(-1) at red peak. Observed values cluster around the low-end of the previously reported range, indicating a high package effect of phytoplankton cells in lakes. Observed variation was modeled as function of Chla (ranging from 1.8 to 95 mg m(-3)). Parameters and relationships presented in this study provide useful information for remote sensing of lakes, as well as for various ecological and geochemical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sea surface infrared reflectivity is an important parameter in oceanic remote sensing. Most analytical models consider single surface reflections, and the polarization is usually ignored. However, a loss of energy is reported for large observation angles (theta > 50 degrees) because multiple surface reflections are ignored. This article generalizes the infrared reflectivity derivation of Li etal. (Appl. Opt., Vol. 52, 6100-6111, 2013) for 1D surfaces (2D problems) to 2D surfaces (3D problems), so that the cross-polarization effect can be taken into account. The contributions of one and two successive surface reflections are analyzed separately. The bidirectional reflectivity and the hemispherical reflectivity are studied. It is shown that the sea surface infrared reflectivity is significant for large incidence and observation angles. The energy conservation criterion is then checked. The loss of energy is largely reduced after taking into account two surface reflections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multispectral sea surface temperature (SST) algorithms applied to infrared (IR) radiometer data exhibit regional biases due to the intrinsic inability of the SST algorithm to cope with the vast range of atmospheric types, mainly influenced by water vapor and temperature profiles. Deriving a SST correction from simulated brightness temperatures (BTs), obtained by applying a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) atmospheric profiles and first guess SST, is one of the solutions to reduce regional biases. This solution is envisaged in the particular case of Metop-A Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived SST. Simulated BTs show errors, linked to RTM, atmospheric profiles or guess field errors. We investigated the conditions of adjusting simulated to observed BTs in the particular case of the Mediterranean Sea over almost one year. Our study led to define optimal spatio/temporal averaging parameters of the simulation observation differences, both during day and night, summer and colder season and for two simulation modes: operational (with reduced vertical resolution - 15 levels - NWP atmospheric profiles and two days old analysis used as first guess SST) and delayed (full vertical resolution - 91 levels - and concurrent analysis used as first guess SST). Each BT adjustment has been evaluated by comparing the corresponding corrected AVHRR SST to the AATSR SST that we adopted as validation reference. We obtained an optimized result across all defined conditions and modes for a spatial smoothing of 15 deg and a temporal averaging between 3 and 5 days. Specifically, analyses based on 10 day averages showed that a standard deviation based criterion favors spatial smoothing above 10 deg for all temporal averaging, while a bias based criterion favors shorter temporal averaging during daytime (<5 days) and higher spatial smoothing (>10 deg) for nighttime. This study has shown also the impact of diurnal warming both in deriving BT adjustment and in validation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Four timely and broadly available remotely sensed datasets were assessed for inclusion into county-level corn and soybean yield forecasting efforts focused on the Corn Belt region of the central United States (US). Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite's MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R-2 = 0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans. The root-mean-square errors were 1.26 and 0.42 metric tons per hectare, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work aims at improving the mapping of major mineral variability at regional scale using scale-dependent spatial variability observed in remote sensing data. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and statistical methods were combined with laboratory-based mineral characterization of field samples to create maps of the distributions of clay, mica and carbonate minerals and their abundances. The Material Identification and Characterization Algorithm (MICA) was used to identify the spectrally-dominant minerals in field samples; these results were combined with ASTER data using multinomial logistic regression to map mineral distributions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to quantify mineral composition in field samples. XRD results were combined with ASTER data using multiple linear regression to map mineral abundances. We tested whether smoothing of the ASTER data to match the scale of variability of the target sample would improve model correlations. Smoothing was done with Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK) to represent the medium and long-range spatial variability in the ASTER data. Stronger correlations resulted using the smoothed data compared to results obtained with the original data. Highest model accuracies came from using both medium and long-range scaled ASTER data as input to the statistical models. High correlation coefficients were obtained for the abundances of calcite and mica (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.70, respectively). Moderately-high correlation coefficients were found for smectite and kaolinite (R-2 = 0.57 and 0.45, respectively). Maps of mineral distributions, obtained by relating ASTER data to MICA analysis of field samples, were found to characterize major soil mineral variability (overall accuracies for mica, smectite and kaolinite were 76%, 89% and 86% respectively). The results of this study suggest that the distributions of minerals and their abundances derived using FRK-smoothed ASTER data more closely match the spatial variability of soil and environmental properties at regional scale.

AB Surface energy balance is a major determinant of land surface temperature and the Earth's climate. To date, there is no approach that can produce effective, physically consistent, global and multi-decadal energy-water flux data over land. Net radiation (R-n) can be quantified regionally using satellite retrievals of surface reflectance and thermal emittance with errors <10%. However, consistent, useful retrieval of latent heat flux (lambda E) from remote sensing is not yet possible. In theory, lambda E could be inferred as a residual of R-n, ground heat (G) and sensible heat (H) fluxes (R-n-H-G). However, large uncertainties in remote sensing of both H and G result in low accuracies for lambda E. Where vegetation is the dominant surface cover, lambda E is largely driven by transpiration of intercellular water through leaf stomata during the photosynthetic uptake of carbon. In these areas, satellite retrievals of photosynthesis (GPP) could be used to quantify transpiration rates through stomatal conductance. Here, we demonstrate how remote sensing of GPP could be applied to obtain lambda E from passive optical measurements of vegetation leaf reflectance related to the photosynthetic rate independent of knowledge of H, R-n and G. We validate the algorithm using five structurally and physiologically diverse eddy flux sites in western and central Canada. Results show that transpiration and H were accurately predicted from optical data and highly significant relationships were found between the energy budget obtained from eddy flux measurements and remote sensing (0.64 <= r(2) <= 0.85). We conclude that spaceborne estimates of GPP could significantly improve not only estimates of the carbon balance but also the energy balance over land. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In response to high summer river temperatures, salmonids avoid heat stress by making use of discrete units of cold water termed thermal refuges. Although recent research has documented how their spatial arrangement within a river affects salmonid distribution and behaviour, no information is currently available concerning temporal variation in the abundance and types of thermal refuges. In this study, a FLIR SC660 thermal infrared imaging camera (640 x 480 pixels, NETD <30 mK, 7.5-13 mu m) mounted on a helicopter platform was used to acquire thermal imagery of an Atlantic salmon river in Quebec, Canada on six occasions between 2009 and 2011, with a view to characterising temporal variability in thermal refuges and broader scale water temperature complexity. Thermal refuges detected from TIR imagery were classified into a series of process-based categories, revealing notable inter-survey variability in the absolute counts of each refuge type. Downstream temperature complexity, quantified as the standard deviation of derivatives taken of temperature long profiles of each survey, was highly temporally variable, exposing the presence of several warm and cool reaches which varied in magnitude between surveys. Data from local meteorological and discharge logging stations was used to examine whether hydrometeorological conditions could account for observed temporal variability trends. Temporal variability in the absolute counts of lateral groundwater seeps, the most frequently observed thermal refuge class, was shown to correlate strongly with long duration hydrometeorological metrics such as seasonal mean discharge (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.01). Conversely, thermal refuges resulting from cold water tributaries were more temporally stable and exhibited a weaker correlation with hydrometeorological metrics. Downstream temperature complexity was shown to correlate best with short duration metrics such as cumulative precipitation depth within a 5-day period prior to each survey (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.01). This study is the first of its kind to link thermal refuge dynamics to hydrometeorological conditions and may offer valuable insights into how changing climatic regimes could influence these important cold water units in the future.

AB Long-term data archives such as Landsat offer the potential for understanding land cover dynamics over large areas, but limited progress has been made towards realizing this potential due to data availability and computational limitations. Those limitations are less relevant now, and there is renewed interest in developing reliable methods of automatically and consistently classifying time series of remotely sensed images. Our objective was to develop a method of automatically classifying temporally irregular time series (i.e., non-anniversary date images in consecutive years) of images with a minimum of parameterization and a priori information. In contrast to traditional signature extension methods, the automatic adaptive signature generalization procedure (AASG) adapts class spectral signatures to individual images and therefore requires no image correction procedure. Class signatures are derived from pixels with stable land cover through time. We tested the performance of AASG relative to traditional signature extension with various image corrections, and explored the sensitivity of AASG to a thresholding parameter (c) controlling stable site identification. AASG performed as well as signature extension with atmospheric correction (kappa = 0.68), and better than signature extension with relative (kappa = 0.65) and TOA reflectance (kappa = 0.56) image corrections for a summer summer image pair. Additionally, we demonstrated the unique ability of AASG to adapt class signatures to phenological differences by classifying a summer winter image pair with a modest reduction in overall accuracy (kappa = 0.66). Observed sensitivity to c supported the hypothesis of an optimum value yielding enough training sites to describe class spectral variability, but conservative enough to minimize contamination of signatures due to classification errors. AASG offers significant advantages over traditional signature extension, particularly for temporally irregular time series. Although we demonstrated a simple implementation, the AASG approach is flexible and we outline several refinements which stand to improve performance. This development represents significant progress towards realizing the potential of long-term data archives to gain long-term understandings of global land cover dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper describes near-surface horizontal salt flux in the Indian Ocean during 1960-2008 using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation Reanalysis version 2.2.4. The long term mean salt flux shows seasonal reversals that are more pronounced in the northern Indian Ocean than in the southern Indian Ocean. Mean zonal salt flux is of a higher magnitude than the mean meridional salt flux. Wyrtki jets influence zonal salt flux in the equatorial region. Meridional salt flux is northward along the northeast (NE) African coast and western Bay of Bengal (BOB) during the southwest monsoon season. The opposite holds during the NE monsoon season. Empirical orthogonal function analyses of salt flux show that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) primarily controls interannual variability with flux being westward during positive dipole events and eastward during negative dipole events. The co-occurrence of IOD with the El Nino Southern Ocean results in enhanced salt flux especially along the equatorial region. Spatially, the most variable regions are the NE African coast, eastern Arabian Sea, BoB and equatorial regions. This study will help interpret salinity data for the Indian Ocean from the recently launched Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity and Aquarius satellite salinity missions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The existing remote sensing drought indices were mainly derived from optical and infrared bands, and have been widely used in monitoring agricultural drought; however, their application in monitoring meteorological drought was limited. This study proposes a new multi-sensor microwave remote sensing drought index, the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), for monitoring short-term drought, especially the meteorological drought over semi-arid regions, by integrating three variables: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) derived precipitation, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture, and AMSR-E derived land surface temperature. Each variable was linearly scaled from 0 to 1 for each pixel based on absolute minimum and maximum values over time to relatively monitor drought. Pearson correlation analyses were performed between remote sensing drought indices and scale-dependent Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) during the growing season (April to October) from 2003 to 2010 to assess the capability of remotely sensed drought indices over three bioclimate regions in northern China. The results showed that MIDI with proper weights of three components outperformed individual remote sensing drought indices and other combined microwave drought indices in monitoring drought. It nearly possessed the best correlations with different time scale SPI; meanwhile it showed the highest correlation with 1-month SPI, and then decreased as SPI time scale increased, suggesting that the MIDI was a very reliable index in monitoring meteorological drought. Furthermore, similar spatial patterns and temporal changes were found between MIDI and 1- or 3-month SPI in monitoring drought. Therefore, the MIDI was recommended to be the optimum drought index, in monitoring short-term drought, especially for meteorological drought over cropland and grassland across northern China or similar regions globally with the ability to work in all weather conditions.

AB The Environment Canada's Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE) combines observations from several different satellite sensors to resolve heterogeneous components of a given footprint To validate the algorithm and demonstrate its applicability, results are presented from combining the enhanced AMSR-E 36.5 GHz passive microwave data with dual-polarization QuikSCAT active microwave scatterometer observations of Arctic ice during September to May; 2007/08. Validation is performed using comparison with results from other algorithms in addition to operational ice charts. Three ice types are resolved: young, first-year and multiyear. Total ice concentration from ECICE under cold Arctic winter conditions is in agreement with estimates from previous algorithms such as the enhanced NASA Team. Distribution of multiyear ice concentration from ECICE is presented along with evolution of daily concentration of each ice type. Events of melt-refreeze, which are common during seasonal transition periods, cause misidentification of multiyear ice as first-year ice in the fall. The reverse is observed in the spring. This is a limitation on ice type identification. ECICE is an optimal approach that minimizes the error between observations and predicted concentrations. It provides a confidence measure associated with each ice concentration estimate. It is a generic algorithm, i.e. its applications are not limited to AMSR-E and QuikSCAT.

AB Although over 40 years of satellite imagery has greatly helped in documenting the location and extent of human impact, especially deforestation, our ability to confidently detect current patterns of land change at broad spatial scales needs improvement. To address this challenge, we have developed a cost-effective mapping procedure based on 250-m MODIS imagery that produces annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This procedure uses annual spectral statistics, collection of references samples with a Web-based tool, and tree-based Random Forests classifiers stratified by biome map regions to produce wall-to-wall, annual LULC maps for 2001 to 2010 that cover all of LAC. Across 26 map regions, overall pixel-level accuracy averaged 80.2 +/- 8.1% for eight basic LULC classes, and 84.6 +/- 6.5% for a five-class scheme. Municipality-scale area change between 2001 and 2010 in the three dominant classes (woody vegetation, mixed woody/plantation, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation) was then estimated using regression models fit to 10 years of data, thus minimizing the impact of inter-annual class variation on change statistics. Closed-canopy forest area and change between 2001 and 2009 were well correlated with high-resolution maps of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES project). Our LAC-wide analysis of significant change revealed the recent extent and magnitude of deforestation hotspots, such as in the Amazon moist forests and the dry forests of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Our data also revealed biome-specific clusters of municipalities with increasing woody vegetation due to forest recovery, reforestation, or woody encroachment. Taken as a whole, our MODIS-based mapping and trend modeling methodology can provide reliable land change data, not just for the tropics or for forest cover, but for all biomes and municipalities in LAC and including multiple LULC classes. Because this information can be produced quickly on an annual time scale, with internally-consistent data sources, it is a very useful tool for resource managers, policy makers, scientists and conservationists interested in tracking recent land change across broad-scale, political and environmental gradients.

AB Many terrestrial biomes are experiencing intensifying human land use. However, reductions in the intensity of agricultural land use are also common and can lead to agricultural land abandonment Agricultural land abandonment has strong environmental and socio-economic consequences, but fine-scale and spatially explicit data on agricultural land abandonment are sparse, particularly in developing countries and countries with transition economies, such as the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Remote sensing can potentially fill this gap, but the satellite-based detection of fallow fields and shrub encroachment is difficult and requires the collection of multiple images during the growing season. The availability of such multi-seasonal cloud-free image dates is often limited. The goal of our study was to determine how much "missing" Landsat TM/ETM + images at key times in the growing season affect the accuracy of agricultural land abandonment classification. We selected a study area in temperate Eastern Europe where post-socialist agricultural land abandonment had become widespread and analyzed six near-anniversary cloud-free Landsat images from "Spring", "Summer" and "Fall" agriculturally defined seasons for a pre-abandonment-time I (1989) and post-abandonment-time 11 (1999/2000). Using a factorial experiment, we tested how the classification accuracy and spatial patterns of classified abandonment changed over all possible 49 image-date combinations when mapping both "abandoned arable land" and "abandoned managed grassland". The conditional Kappa of our best overall classification with support vector machines (SVM) was 90% for "abandoned arable land" and 72% for "abandoned managed grassland" when all six images were used for the classification. Classifications with fewer image dates resulted in a substantial decrease of the conditional Kappa (from 93 to 54% for "abandoned arable land" and from to 75 to 50% for "abandoned managed grassland"). We also observed substantial decrease in accurate detection of land abandonment patterns when we compared our best overall classification with the other 48 image date combinations (the Fuzzy Kappa, a measure of spatial similarity, ranged from 25.8 to 76.3% for "abandoned arable land" and from 30.4 to 79.5% for "abandoned managed grassland"). While the accuracy of the different abandonment classes was most sensitive to the number of image dates used for the classification, the seasons captured also mattered, and the importance of specific seasonal image dates varied between the pre- and post-abandonment dates. For "abandoned arable land" it was important to have at least one "Spring" or "Summer" image for pre-abandonment and as many images as possible for post-abandonment with a "Spring" image again being most important For "abandoned managed grassland" no specific seasonal image dates yielded statistically significantly more accurate classifications. The factor that influenced the accurate detection of "abandoned managed grassland" was the number of multi-seasonal image dates (the more the better), rather than their exact dates. We also tested whether SVM performed better than the maximum likelihood classifier. SVM outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier only for "abandoned arable land" and only in image-date-rich cases. Our results showed that limited image-date availability in the Landsat record placed substantial limits on the accuracy of agricultural abandonment classifications and accurately detected agricultural land abandonment patterns.
   Thus, we warn to use agricultural land abandonment maps produced with the suboptimal image dates with caution, especially when the accurate rates and the patterns of agricultural land abandonment are crucial (e.g.. for LULCC models). The abundance of agricultural abandonment in many parts of the world and its strong ecological and socio-economic consequences suggest that better monitoring of abandonment is necessary, and our results illustrated the image dates that were most important to accomplishing this task.

AB We predict stand basal area (BA) from small footprint LiDAR data in 129 one-ha tropical forest plots across four sites in French Guiana and encompassing a great diversity of forest structures resulting from natural (soil and geological substrate) and anthropogenic effects (unlogged and logged forests). We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A method for regional scale mapping of aboveground forest biomass with Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data is presented. A fully automated algorithm, exploiting the synergy of SAR and optical remote sensing for the calibration of a semi-empirical model (Santoro et al., 2011; Cartus et al., 2011), was adopted to map forest aboveground biomass with L-band HH and HV intensity in the northeastern United States. In the retrieval algorithm, a semi-empirical model is calibrated and inverted for each HH and HV image to estimate biomass at the pixel level. Where possible, biomass estimates for single images in a multi-temporal stack were combined in a weighted manner. A comparison with the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset, NBCD 2000 (Kellndorfer et al., in preparation), at different spatial scales indicated the feasibility of the automated biomass retrieval approach and confirmed previous findings that the retrieval accuracy for HV intensity is consistently better than that for HH intensity and depends on the imaging conditions. The weighted combination of the biomass estimates from each intensity image in a multi-temporal stack significantly improved the retrieval performance. Because of regional differences in the multi-temporal coverage with ALOS PALSAR dual polarization data (1-5 images for 2007/08) and the pronounced dependence of the retrieval for single images on the imaging conditions, the possibility of producing maps with consistent accuracy at high resolution was found to be limited. Accurate biomass estimates were obtained when aggregating the ALOS biomass maps at county scale and comparing the estimates to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) county statistics (RMSE = 12.9 t/ha, R-2 = 0.86).

AB Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for regional satellite ocean color applications have been developed and assessed using in situ data from various European seas. Considered MLP products are chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a), absorption by yellow substance at 412 nm (a(ys)(412)) and concentration of total suspended matter (TSM), all determined from spectral remote sensing reflectance R-RS. Investigated oceanographic regions comprise the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea, the Westem Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. The in situ measurements applied in the study were produced within the framework of the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (COASTS) and Rio-Optical Mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs contributing to a unique dataset that represents different water types including chlorophyll a, yellow substance and sediment dominated waters. Performance analysis of the proposed regional MLPs indicates that Chl-a can be quantified with the highest accuracy in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (with absolute percent difference of 14% with respect to in situ measurements). In the case of a(ys)(412), the most accurate determination is observed for the Baltic Sea waters (13%). Instead, TSM retrieval is the most accurate in the Black Sea (14%). The study demonstrated the limited generalization capability of regional algorithms. Within this context, saturation of MLP output occurring with input data not statistically represented in the training set has been investigated through cross-basin product analysis in view of proposing a practical solution to the problem.

Distributed water levels may be estimated indirectly along the flood extents in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by intersecting the extents with the floodplain topography. It is necessary to select a subset of levels for assimilation because adjacent levels along the flood extent will be strongly correlated. A method for selecting such a subset automatically and in near real-time is described, which would allow the SAR water levels to be used in a forecasting model. The method first selects candidate waterline points in flooded rural areas having low slope. The waterline levels and positions are corrected for the effects of double reflections between the water surface and emergent vegetation at the flood edge. Waterline points are also selected in flooded urban areas away from radar shadow and layover caused by buildings, with levels similar to those in adjacent rural areas. The resulting points are thinned to reduce spatial autocorrelation using a top-down clustering approach. The method was developed using a TerraSAR-X image from a particular case study involving urban and rural flooding. The waterline points extracted proved to be spatially uncorrelated, with levels reasonably similar to those determined manually from aerial photographs, and in good agreement with those of nearby gauges.

AB The impact of forest cover on passive microwave measurements is important but not well documented, particularly for dense boreal forests. The objective of this study was to evaluate a parameterization of the forest emissivity, for dense needleleaf forests at four Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) frequencies (37, 19, 10.7, and 6.9 GHz). The tau-omega radiative transfer model was used, but considering transmissivity (gamma) at an incidence angle of 55 degrees for the optical thickness (tau). The approch was as follows: 1) high resolution airborne data at 19 and 37 GHz were used to derive the equivalent or effective forest parameters (gamma-omega) knowing the contribution of the snow-soil emission from non-forested pixels, 2) these gamma-omega values were verified using winter radiometric in situ measurements from different forest sites where the brightness temperature (Tb) values above and under the canopy were considered, 3) these gamma-omega values were applied and the frequency was extended on a large AMSR-E summer dataset for dense boreal forest sites. The airborne-derived values were consistent with in situ measurements as well as with satellite-based observations. We found that at AMSR-E frequencies, transmissivity values spectrally decreased from 0.67 to 0.41 for frequencies from 6.9 to 37 GHz. The single scattering albedo (omega) can be considered frequency independent at omega approximate to 0.064 +/- 0.005. A soil parameterization (QH model) at different frequencies was also proposed for boreal forests. We discuss these new gamma-omega values and the soil parameterization within the context of the relevant literature. The results are of particular interest for various remote sensing applications based on passive microwave sensor observations over boreal forests, such as the retrieval of soil moisture and the monitoring of snow characteristics under the canopy.

AB Remote sensing technology can rapidly provide spatial information on crop growth status, which ideally could be used to invert radiative transfer models or ecophysiological models for estimating a variety of crop biophysical properties. However, the outcome of the model inversion procedure will be influenced by the timing and availability of remote sensing data, the spectral resolution of the data, the types of models implemented, and the choice of parameters to adjust. Our objective was to investigate these issues by inverting linked radiative transfer and ecophysiological models to estimate leaf area index (LAI), canopy weight, plant nitrogen content, and yield for a durum wheat (Triticum durum) study conducted in central Arizona over the winter of 2010-2011. Observations of crop canopy spectral reflectance between 268 and 1095 nm were obtained weekly using a GER 1500 spectroradiometer. Other field measurements were regularly collected to describe plant growth characteristics and plant nitrogen content. Linkages were developed between the DSSAT Cropping System Model (CSM) and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (CSM-PROSAIL) and between the DSSAT-CSM and an empirical model relating NDVI to LAI (CSM-Choudhury). The PEST parameter estimation algorithm was implemented to adjust the leaf area growth parameters of the CSM by minimizing error between measured and simulated NDVI or canopy spectral reflectance. A genetic algorithm was implemented to identify the optimum combination of remote sensing observations required to optimize simulations of LAI through model inversion. The relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) between measured and simulated LAI was 24.1% for the CSM-PROSAIL model, whereas the stand-alone PROSAIL and CSM models simulated LAI with RRMSEs of 40.7% and 27.8%, respectively. Wheat yield was simulated with RRMSEs of 12.8% and 10.0% for the lone CSM model and the CSM-PROSAIL model, respectively. Optimized leaf area growth parameters for CSM-PROSAIL were different among cultivars (p<0.05), while those for CSM-Choudhury were not. Only two observations, one at mid-vegetative growth and one at maximum vegetative growth, were required to optimize LAI simulations for CSM-PROSAIL, whereas CSM-Choudhury required four observations. Inverting CSM-PROSAIL using hyperspectral data offered several advantages as compared to the CSM-Choudhury inversion using a simple vegetation index, including better estimates of crop biophysical properties, different leaf area growth parameter estimates among cultivars (p<0.05), and fewer required remote sensing observations for optimum LAI simulation.

AB Semi-arid areas, defined as those areas of the world where water is an important limitation for plant growth, have become the subject of increased interest due to the impacts of current global changes and sustainability of human lifestyles. While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of semi-arid areas using AVHRR GIMMS from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in semi-arid areas across the globe. It is concluded that semi-arid areas, across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0.015 NDVI units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in semi-arid areas where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0.019 NDVI units) and in semi-arid areas where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0.013 NDVI units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in semi-arid areas worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness.

AB In 2010, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) performed several aerial surveys over the region affected by the oil spill caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore platform. The instrument was deployed on the NASA Langley 13200 aircraft together with the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), which provides information on the distribution of the aerosol layers beneath the aircraft, including an accurate estimate of aerosol optical depth.
   This work illustrates the merits of polarization measurements in detecting variations of ocean surface properties linked to the presence of an oil slick. In particular, we make use of the degree of linear polarization in the glint region, which is severely affected by variations in the refractive index but insensitive to the waviness of the water surface. Alterations in the surface optical properties are therefore expected to directly affect the polarization response of the RSP channel at 2264 nm, where both molecular and aerosol scattering are negligible and virtually all of the observed signal is generated via Fresnel reflection at the surface. The glint profile at this wavelength is fitted with a model which can optimally estimate refractive index, wind speed and direction, together with aircraft attitude variations affecting the viewing geometry. The retrieved refractive index markedly increases over oil-contaminated waters, while the apparent wind speed is significantly lower than in adjacent uncontaminated areas, suggesting that the slick dampens high-frequency components of the ocean wave spectrum.
   The constraint on surface reflectance provided by the short-wave infrared channels is a cornerstone of established procedures to retrieve atmospheric aerosol microphysical parameters based on the inversion of the RSP multispectral measurements. This retrieval, which benefits from the ancillary information provided by the HSRL, was in this specific case hampered by prohibitive variability in atmospheric conditions (very inhomogeneous aerosol distribution and cloud cover). Although the results presented for the surface are essentially unaffected, we discuss the results obtained by typing algorithms in sorting the complex mix of aerosol types, and show evidence of oriented ice in cirrus clouds present in the area. In this context, polarization measurements at 1880 nm were used to infer ice habit and cirrus optical depth, which was found in the subvisual/threshold-visible regime, confirming the utility of the aforementioned RSP channel for the remote sensing of even thin cold clouds.

AB We describe the state of the art of scientific research on the earthquake cycle based on the analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired from satellite platforms. We examine the achievements and the main limitations of present SAR systems for the measurement and analysis of crustal deformation, and envision the foreseeable advances that the Sentinel-1 data will generate in the fields of geophysics and tectonics. We also review the technological and scientific issues which have limited so far the operational use of satellite data in seismic hazard assessment and crisis management, and show the improvements expected from Sentinel-1 data.

AB Thermal inertia is a physical property of soil at the land surface related to water content. We developed a method for estimating soil thermal inertia using two daily measurements of surface temperature, to capture the diurnal range, and diurnal time series of net radiation and specific humidity. The method solves for soil thermal inertia assuming homogeneous 1-D diffusion of heat near the land surface. The solution uses a boundary condition taken as the maximum likelihood estimate of ground heat flux made by a probabilistic uncertainty model of the partitioning of net radiation based on the theory of maximum entropy production (MEP model). We showed that by coupling the 1-D diffusion and MEP models of energy transfer at the land surface, the number of free parameters in the MEP model can be reduced from two (P soil thermal inertia and I thermal inertia of convective heat transfer to the atmosphere) to one (P is defined by I). A sensitivity analysis suggested that, for the purpose of estimating thermal inertia, the coupled model should be parameterized by the ratio P/I. The coupled model was demonstrated at two semi-arid sites in the southwest United States to estimate thermal inertia and these thermal inertia values were used to estimate soil moisture. We found 1) parameterizing the MEP model with a constant annual P/I value resulted in surface flux estimates which were similar to those made when daily P and I parameters were derived directly from measurements of ground heat flux (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency>0.95): 2) estimates of P made using the coupled model were superior to those made using the diffusion model with a common linear approximation of the ground heat flux boundary condition: and 3) thermal inertia was a better predictor of soil moisture in moderately wet conditions than in dry conditions due to a lack of sensitivity of thermal inertia to changes in soil moisture at low moisture contents.

AB There is an increasing need to understand the dynamics in urbanization not only temporally but also spatially for the improvement of urban environments. In spite of an enormous number of previous studies in urban remote sensing applications, only a few studies have been conducted on the techniques in the quantification, qualification, and visualization of the changes in time-series urban land cover fractions (LCFs) derived through spectral unmixing. To examine the urbanization process in four major cities around the Poyang Lake area in Jiangxi Province, China - Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Yingtan, and Poyang - using a time-series Landsat-5 TM dataset in 1987, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2009, we investigated: (1) the approach to the derivation of LCFs in urban areas using multi-temporal remotely-sensed data set; and (2) the approach to the summarization and cartographic manipulation of the changes in time-series LCFs. To account for the complex spectral confusion among different land cover materials in built-up areas, the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was used for unmixing the pixels. The Land Cover Change Intensity (LCCI) was proposed to derive the average daily change rate in terms of the area within a pixel for the land cover classes of green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation and soil, and built-up areas between two consecutive TM observation dates. The dominant LCCI (DLCCI) was proposed to determine in which period the urban areas were developed most rapidly and how intense the urbanization process was in each pixel of the time-series LCCI maps. Our results showed that MESMA could accurately model the pixels in urban areas with complex spectral confusion of different land cover materials. The comparison of derived land cover fractions with socioeconomic statistics disclosed the strong positive correlation between built-up fractions and urban population as well as gross GDP and GDPs in secondary and tertiary industries. LCCI and DLCCI revealed two mechanisms of urbanization, which are new land developments and redevelopments of built-up areas. Consequently, we found that the four cities around the Poyang Lake were urbanized through different mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is estimated that Canada comprises approximately 28% of the world's wetlands (similar to 1.5 million km(2)) providing essential ecological services such as purifying water, nutrient cycling, reducing flooding, recharging ground water supplies, and protecting shorelines. In order to better understand how wetland type and area differ over a range of spatial and thematic scales, this paper introduces a multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach that incorporates new object-based texture measures (geotex) and a decision-tree classifier (See5), to assess wetland differences through five common spatial resolutions (5, 10, 15. 20 and 30 m) and two different thematic classification schemes. Themes are based on (i) a Ducks Unlimited (DU: 15 class) regional classification system for wetlands in the Boreal Plain Ecosystem and (ii) the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI: 5 classes). Results reveal that the highest overall accuracies (67.9% and 82.2%) were achieved at the 10 m spatial resolution for both the DU and CWI classification schemes respectively. It was also found that the DU wetland types experienced greater area differences through scale with the largest differences for both classification schemes occurring in classes with a large treed component. Results further show that the inclusion of geotex channels (generated from dynamically sized and shaped window that measures the spatial variability of the wetland components composing a scene, rather than of individual pixels within a fixed sized window) improved wetland classification.

AB Cyanobacteria represent a major harmful algal group in fresh to brackish water environments. Lac des Allemands, a freshwater lake of 49 km(2) southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana on the upper end of the Barataria Estuary, provides a natural laboratory for remote characterization of cyanobacterial blooms because of their seasonal occurrence. The Oceansat-1 satellite Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) provides measurements similar to SeaWiFS but with higher spatial resolution, and this work is the first attempt to use OCM measurements to quantify cyanobacterial pigments. The satellite signal was first vicariously calibrated using SeaWiFS as a reference, and then corrected to remove the atmospheric effects using a customized atmospheric correction procedure. Then, empirical inversion algorithms were developed to convert the OCM remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at bands 4 and 5 (centered at 510.6 and 556.4 nm, respectively) to concentrations of phycocyanin (PC), the primary cyanobacterial pigment. A holistic approach was used to minimize the influence of other optically active constituents on the PC algorithm. Similarly, empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were developed using OCM bands 5 and 6 (centered at 556.4 and 669 nm, respectively). The best PC algorithm (R-2 = 0.7450, p < 0.0001, n = 72) yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 36.92 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 10.27% (PC from 2.75 to 363.50 mu g/L, n = 48). The best algorithm for Chl a (R-2 = 0.7510, p < 0.0001, n = 72) produced an RMSE of 31.19 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 16.56% (Chl a from 9.46 to 212.76 mu g/L, n = 48). While more field data are required to further validate the long-term performance of these algorithms, currently they represent the best protocol for establishing a long time-series of cyanobacterial blooms in the Lac des Allemands using OCM data.

AB Current methods to assess soil moisture extremes rely primarily on point-based in situ meteorological stations which typically provide precipitation and temperature rather than direct measurements of soil moisture. Microwave remote sensing offers the possibility of quantifying surface soil moisture conditions over large spatial extents. Capturing soil moisture anomalies normally requires a long temporal record of data, which most operating satellites do not have. This research examines the use of surface soil moisture from the AMSR-E passive microwave satellite to derive surface soil moisture anomalies by exploiting spatial resolution to compensate for the shorter temporal record of the satellite sensor. Four methods were used to spatially aggregate information to develop a surface soil moisture anomaly (SMA). Two of these methods used soil survey and climatological zones to define regions of homogeneity, based on the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) and the EcoDistrict nested hierarchy. The second two methods (ObShp3 and ObShp5) used zones defined by a data driven segmentation of the satellite soil moisture data. The level of sensitivity of the calculated SMA decreased as the number of pixels used in the spatial aggregation increased, with the average error reducing to less than 5% when more than 15 pixels are used. All methods of spatial aggregation showed somewhat weak but consistent relationship to in situ soil moisture anomalies and meteorological drought indices. The size of the regions used for aggregation was more important than the method used to create the regions. Based on the error and the relationship to the in situ and ancillary data sets, the EcoDistrict or ObShp3 scale appears to provide the lowest error in calculating the SMA baseline. This research demonstrates that the use of spatial aggregation can provide useful information on soil moisture anomalies where satellite records of data are temporally short.

AB High-resolution digital canopy models derived from airborne lidar data have the ability to provide detailed information on the vertical structure of forests. However, compared to satellite data of similar spatial resolution and extent, the small footprint airborne lidar data required to produce such models remain expensive. In an effort to reduce these costs, the primary objective of this paper is to develop an airborne lidar sampling strategy to model full-scene forest canopy height from optical imagery, lidar transects and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). To achieve this goal, this research focuses on (i) determining appropriate lidar transect features (i.e., location, direction and extent) from an optical scene, (ii) developing a mechanism to model forest canopy height for the full-scene based on a minimum number of lidar transects, and (iii) defining an optimal mean object size (MOS) to accurately model the canopy composition and height distribution. Results show that (i) the transect locations derived from our optimal lidar transect selection algorithm accurately capture the canopy height variability of the entire study area; (ii) our canopy height estimation models have similar performance in two lidar transect directions (i.e., north-south and west-east); (iii) a small lidar extent (17.6% of total size) can achieve similar canopy height estimation accuracies as those modeled from the full lidar scene; and (iv) different MOS can lead to distinctly different canopy height results. By comparing the best canopy height estimate with the full lidar canopy height data, we obtained average estimation errors of 6.0 m and 6.8 m for conifer and deciduous forests at the individual tree crown/small tree cluster level, and an area weighted combined error of 6.2 m, which is lower than the provincial forest inventory height class interval (i.e., approximate to 9.0 m).

AB In using traditional digital classification algorithms, a researcher typically encounters serious issues in identifying urban land cover classes employing high resolution data. A normal approach is to use spectral information alone and ignore spatial information and a group of pixels that need to be considered together as an object We used QuickBird image data over a central region in the city of Phoenix, Arizona to examine if an object-based classifier can accurately identify urban classes. To demonstrate if spectral information alone is practical in urban classification, we used spectra of the selected classes from randomly selected points to examine if they can be effectively discriminated. The overall accuracy based on spectral information alone reached only about 63.33%. We employed five different classification procedures with the object-based paradigm that separates spatially and spectrally similar pixels at different scales. The classifiers to assign land covers to segmented objects used in the study include membership functions and the nearest neighbor classifier. The object-based classifier achieved a high overall accuracy (90.40%), whereas the most commonly used decision rule, namely maximum likelihood classifier, produced a lower overall accuracy (67.60%). This study demonstrates that the object-based classifier is a significantly better approach than the classical per-pixel classifiers. Further, this study reviews application of different parameters for segmentation and classification, combined use of composite and original bands, selection of different scale levels, and choice of classifiers. Strengths and weaknesses of the object-based prototype are presented and we provide suggestions to avoid or minimize uncertainties and limitations associated with the approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A severe drought occurred in southwestern Amazonia in the dry season (June-September) of 2005. We analyzed 10 years (7/99-10/09) of SeaWinds active microwave Ku-band backscatter data collected over the Amazon Basin, developing monthly means and anomalies from those means in an effort to detect landscape responses to this drought. We compared these to seasonal accumulating water deficit anomalies generated using Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data (1999-2009) and 100 mm mo(-1) evapotranspiration demand as a water deficit threshold. There was significant interannual variability in dry-season monthly mean backscatter only for morning (c. 06:00 LST) overpass data, and little interannual variability in dry-season monthly mean backscatter for afternoon (c. 18:00 LST) overpass data. Strong negative anomalies in both morning-overpass backscatter and accumulating water deficit developed during July-October 2005, centered on the southwestern Amazon Basin, with a strong spatial correlation between morning-overpass backscatter anomalies and water deficit anomalies in September. This is the first reporting of tropical forest seasonal drought detection by active microwave scatterometry. Based on the differences between early-morning and late-afternoon backscatter variability, we hypothesize that as the drought persisted over several months, the forest canopy was increasingly unable to recover full leaf moisture content over night, resulting in anomalously low early-morning overpass backscatter.

AB Traditional remote sensing techniques allow the assessment of green plant biomass, and therefore plant photosynthetic capacity. However, detecting how much of this capacity is actually realized is a more challenging goal. Is it possible to remotely assess actual carbon fluxes? Can this be done at leaf, canopy and ecosystem scales and at different temporal scales? Different approaches can be used to answer these questions. Among them, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) derived from narrow-band spectroradiometers is a spectral index increasingly being used as an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency. We examined and synthesized the scientific literature on the relationships between PRI and several ecophysiological variables across a range of plant functional types and ecosystems at the leaf, canopy and ecosystem levels and at the daily and seasonal time scales. Our analysis shows that although the strength of these relationships varied across vegetation types, levels of organization and temporal scales, in most reviewed articles PRI was a good predictor of photosynthetic efficiency or related variables with performances at least as good as the widely used NDVI as indicator of green biomass. There are possible confounding factors related to the intensity of the physiological processes linked to the PRI signals, to the structure of the canopies and to the illumination and viewing angles that warrant further studies, and it is expected that the utility of PRI will vary with the ecosystem in question due to contrasting environmental constraints, evolutionary strategies, and radiation use efficiency (RUE; the ratio between carbon uptake and light absorbed by vegetation) variability. Clearly, more research comparing ecosystem responses is warranted. Additionally, like any 2-band index that is affected by multiple factors, the interpretation of PRI can be readily confounded by multiple environmental variables, and further work is needed to understand and constrain these effects. Despite these limitations, this review shows an emerging consistency of the RUE-PRI relationship that suggests a surprising degree of functional convergence of biochemical, physiological and structural components affecting leaf, canopy and ecosystem carbon uptake efficiencies. PRI accounted for 42%, 59% and 62% of the variability of RUE at the leaf, canopy and ecosystem respective levels in unique exponential relationships for all the vegetation types studied. It seems thus that by complementing the estimations of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the vegetation (FPAR), estimated with NDVI-like indices, PRI enables improved assessment of carbon fluxes in leaves, canopies and many of the ecosystems of the world from ground, airborne and satellite sensors.

AB A method to generate high spatio-temporal resolution maps of landfast sea ice from cloud-free MODIS composite imagery is presented. Visible (summertime) and thermal infrared (wintertime) cloud-free 20-day MODIS composite images are used as the basis for these maps, augmented by AMSR-E ASI sea-ice concentration composite images (when MODIS composite image quality is insufficient). The success of this technique is dependent upon efficient cloud removal during the compositing process. Example wintertime maximum (-374,000 km(2)) and summertime minimum (similar to 112,000 km(2)) fast-ice maps for the entire East Antarctic coast are presented. The summertime minimum map provides the first high-resolution indication of multi-year fast-ice extent, which may be used to help assess changes in Antarctic sea-ice volume. The 2 sigma errors in fast-ice extent are estimated to be +/- 2.98% when >= 90% of the fast-ice pixels in a 20-day period are classified using the MODIS composite, or +/-8.76 otherwise (when augmenting AMSR-E or the previous/next MODIS composite image is used to classify >10% of the fast ice). Imperfect composite image quality, caused by persistent cloud, inaccurate cloud masking or a highly dynamic fast-ice edge, was the biggest impediment to automating the fast-ice detection procedure.

AB Reliable measurements of soil moisture at global scale might greatly improve many practical issues in hydrology, meteorology, climatology or agriculture such as water management, quantitative precipitation forecasting, irrigation scheduling, etc. Remote sensing offers the unique capability to monitor soil moisture over large areas but, nowadays, the spatio-temporal resolution and accuracy required for some hydrological applications (e.g., flood forecasting in medium to large basins) have still to be met. The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) onboard the Metop satellite (VV polarization, C-band at 5.255 GHz), based on a large extent on the heritage of the ERS scatterometer, provides a soil moisture product available at a coarse spatial resolution (25 km and 50 km) and at a nearly daily time step. This study evaluates the accuracy of the new 25 km ASCAT derived saturation degree product by using in situ observations and the outcomes of a soil water balance model for three sites located in an inland region of central Italy. The comparison is carried out for a 2-year period (2007-2008) and three products derived from ASCAT: the surface saturation degree, m(s), the exponentially filtered soil wetness index. SWI, and its linear transformation, SWI*, matching the range of variability of ground data. Overall, the performance of the three products is found to be quite good with correlation coefficients higher than 0.92 and 0.80 when the SWI is compared with in situ and simulated saturation degree, respectively. Considering SWI*, the root mean square error is less than 0.035 m(3)/m(3) and 0.042 m(3)/m(3) for in situ and simulated saturation degree, respectively. More notably, when the ms product is compared with modeled data at 3 cm depth, this index is found able to accurately reproduce the temporal pattern of the simulated saturation degree in terms of both timing and entity of its variations also at fine temporal scale. The daily temporal resolution and the reliability obtained with the ASCAT derived saturation degree products represent the preliminary step for its effective use in operational rainfall-runoff modeling.

AB Continuing, severe outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) across western North America have resulted in widespread mortality of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Multiple studies have used high spatial resolution satellite data to map areas of beetle kill; these studies have largely focused on mapping red canopy cover associated with recent tree mortality and have not examined mapping gray canopy cover that occurs after red needles have dropped. The work presented here examines the use of newly available GeoEye-1 data for mapping both red and gray canopy area in southeastern Wyoming lodgepole pine forest. A 0.5 m spatial resolution, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1 image was used to classify areas of green, red, and gray canopy cover. Reference data were collected at twelve 500 m(2) field plots. Shadow-normalized green, red, and gray canopy area from classified GeoEye-1 data closely agreed with field-estimated green, red, and gray canopy area. Mean absolute error in canopy cover for the twelve sample plots was 8.3% for the green class, 5.4% for the red class, and 7.2% for the gray class. When all twelve plots were aggregated, remotely sensed estimates of green, red, and gray cover were within 1.7% of the field-estimated cover. Our results demonstrate that high spatial resolution spaceborne multispectral data are a promising tool for mapping canopy mortality caused by mountain pine beetle outbreaks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new algorithm, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite reflectance and aerosol single scattering properties simulated from a chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem), is developed to retrieve aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over land in China during the spring dust season. The algorithm first uses a "dynamic lower envelope" approach to sample the MODIS dark-pixel reflectance data in low AOT conditions, to derive the local surface visible (0.65 mu m)/near infrared (NIR, 2.1 mu m) reflectance ratio. Joint retrievals of AOT at 0.65 mu m and surface reflectance at 2.1 mu m are then performed, based on the time, location, and spectral-dependent single scattering properties of the dusty atmosphere as simulated by the GEOS-Chem. A linearized vector radiative transfer model (VLIDORT) that simultaneously computes the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and its Jacobian with respect to AOT, is used in the forward component of the inversion of MODIS reflectance to AOT. Comparison of retrieved AOT results in April and May of 2008 with AERONET observations shows a strong correlation (R = 0.83), with small bias (0.01), and small RMSE (0.17); the figures are a substantial improvement over corresponding values obtained with the MODIS Collection 5 AOT algorithm for the same study region and time period. The small bias is partially due to the consideration of dust effect at 2.1 mu m channel, without which the bias is -0.05. The surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 mu m) concentrations derived using this improved AOT retrieval show better agreement with ground observations than those derived from GEOS-Chem simulations alone, or those inferred from the MODIS Collection 5 AOT. This study underscores the value of using satellite reflectance to improve the air quality modeling and monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For many studies of urbanization, particularly those covering broad spatial extents and thus requiring the perspective afforded by satellite remote sensing, the longest time series of impervious surface area (ISA) initiate with the availability of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in the mid 1980s. Earlier generation remote sensing data, such as Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) do not generally lead to robust representations of impervious surface area due to poor spectral differentiation between impervious and non-impervious surfaces lacking vegetation. In the 1970s, however, the USGS completed a comprehensive mapping of land cover based on aerial photography called the Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS). In this paper we describe a methodology for retrieving ISA estimates through the fusion of GIRAS land cover with historic and contemporary remote sensing data, resulting in a data set that is temporally comparable to more modern data sets (e.g. the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) ISA product). We calculate correlation coefficients between our data set and digitized aerial photography at 4 spatial resolutions, exhibiting a maximum correlation of 0.65 at 120-m and 240-rn pixel sizes. Our highest resolution product (30-m) exhibited 94% accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 36% in rural areas, and 90.7% accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 59.6% in suburban areas. Further, we show that trends in urban area through time derived from these data exhibit accelerating rates of development throughout the Potomac River basin 1975-2001, including increased development in riparian buffer zones and on steeper topography. These results are applicable wherever low-resolution vector-based data sets of urban area are available or could be generated for the pre-Landsat TM era. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Geothermal resources exist on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribal Lands (PLPTL) in northwestern Nevada. We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The primary aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of interferometric X-band SAR (InSAR) for inventory of boreal forest biomass. We investigated the relationship between SRTM X-band InSAR height and above-ground biomass in a study area in southern Norway. We generated biomass reference data for each SRTM pixel from a field inventory in combination with airborne laser scanning (ALS). One set of forest inventory plots served for calibrating ALS based biomass models, and another set of field plots was used to validate these models. The biomass values obtained in this way ranged up to 250 t/ha at the stand level. The relationship between biomass and InSAR height was linear, no apparent saturation effect was present, and the accuracy was high (RMSE = 19%). The relationship differed between Norway spruce and Scots pine, where an increase in InSAR height of 1 m corresponded to an increase in biomass of 9.9 and 7.0 t/ha. respectively. Using a high-quality terrain model from ALS enabled biomass to be estimated with a higher accuracy as compared to using a terrain model from topographic maps. Interferometric X-band SAR appears to be a promising method for forest biomass monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current wind erosion and dust emission models neglect the heterogeneous nature of surface roughness and its geometric anisotropic effect on aerodynamic resistance, and over-estimate the erodible area by assuming it is not covered by roughness elements. We address these shortfalls with a new model which estimates aerodynamic roughness length (z(0)) using angular reflectance of a rough surface. The new model is proportional to the frontal area index, directional, and represents the geometric anisotropy of z(0). The model explained most of the variation in two sets of wind tunnel measurements of aerodynamic roughness lengths (z(0)). Field estimates of z(0) for varying wind directions were similar to predictions made by the new model. The model was used to estimate the erodible area exposed to abrasion by saltating particles. Vertically integrated horizontal flux (F(h)) was calculated using the area not covered by non-erodible hemispheres; the approach embodied in dust emission models. Under the same model conditions, F(h) estimated using the new model was up to 85% smaller than that using the conventional area not covered. These F(h) simulations imply that wind erosion and dust emission models without geometric anisotropic sheltering of the surface, may considerably over-estimate F(h) and hence the amount of dust emission. The new model provides a straightforward method to estimate aerodynamic resistance with the potential to improve the accuracy of wind erosion and dust emission models, a measure that can be retrieved using bi-directional reflectance models from angular satellite sensors, and an alternative to notoriously unreliable field estimates of z(0) and their extrapolations across landform scales.

AB Ecologists and conservationists need accurate and replicable tools for monitoring wetland conditions in order to develop and implement adaptive management strategies efficiently. The Rhone Delta (Camargue) in southern France encloses 9200 ha of fragmented reed marshes actively managed for reed harvesting, waterfowl hunting or cattle grazing, and holding significant numbers of vulnerable European birds. We used multi-season SPOT-5 data in conjunction with ground survey to assess the predictive power of satellite imagery in modelling indicators of reed structure (height, diameter, density and cover of green/dry stems) relevant to ecosystem management and bird ecology. All indicators could be predicted accurately with a combination of bands (SWIR, NIR) and indices (SAVI, OSAVI, NDWI, DVI, DVW, MSI) issued from scenes of March, June, July, September or December and subtraction between these. All models were robust when validated with an independent set of satellite and field data. The high spatial resolution of SPOT-5 scenes (pixel of 10 x 10 m) permits the monitoring of detailed attributes characterizing the reed ecosystem across a large spatial extent, providing a scientifically-based, replicable tool for managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to follow wetland conditions in the short and long-term. Combined with models on the ecological requirements of vulnerable bird species, these tools can provide maps of potential species ranges at spatial extents that are relevant to ecosystem functioning and bird populations.

AB An approach to generate a 250-meter Canada wide Leaf Area Index (LAI) map using 250-meter MODIS data is described. The full processing chain is introduced. The approach is based on intercalibration of Landsat and MODIS vegetation indices (VI's) combined with LAI-VI's empirical relationships. Preliminary validation over two sites where field work was carried out shows promising results. Intercalibration of MODIS VI's before deriving LAI maps provides up to 65% improvement of the LAI overall accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A highly automated algorithm called vegetation change tracker (VCT) has been developed for reconstructing recent forest disturbance history using Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70% and 60% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with nochange classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations.

AB The variable spatio-temporal scales of Earth's surface deformation in potentially hazardous volcanic areas pose a challenge for observation and assessment. Here we used Envisat data acquired in Wide Swath Mode (WSM) and Image Mode (IM) from ascending and descending geometry, respectively, to study time-dependent ground uplift at the Lazufre volcanic system in Chile and Argentina. A least-squares adjustment was performed on 65 IM interferograms that covered the time period of 2003-2008. We obtained a clear trend of uplift reaching 15-16 cm in this 5-year interval. Using a joint inversion of ascending and descending interferograms. we evaluated the geometry and time-dependent progression of a horizontally extended pressurized source beneath the Lazufre volcanic system. Our results hence indicate that an extended magma body at a depth between 10 and 15 kin would account for most of the ground uplift The maximum inflation reached up to -40 cm during 2003-2008. The lateral propagation velocity of the intrusion was estimated to be nearly constant at 5-10 km/yr during the observation time, which has important implications for the physical understanding of magma intrusion processes.

AB A multi-resolution analysis (MRA) based on the wavelet transform (WT) has been implemented to study NDVI time series. These series, which are non-stationary and present short-term, seasonal and long-term variations, can be decomposed using this MRA as a sum of series associated with different temporal scales. The main focus of the paper is to check the potential of this MRA to capture and describe both intra- and inter-annual changes in the data, i.e., to discuss the ability of the proposed procedure to monitor vegetation dynamics at regional scale. Our approach concentrates on what wavelet analysis can tell us about a NDVI time series. On the one hand, the intro-annual series, linked to the seasonality, has been used to estimate different key features related to the vegetation phenology, which depend on the vegetation cover type. On the other hand, the inter-annual series has been used to identify the trend, which is related to land-cover changes, and a Mann-Kendall test has been applied to confirm the significance of the observed trends. NDVI images from the MEDOKADS (Mediterranean Extended Daily One-km AVHRR Data Set) imagery series over Spain are processed according to a per-pixel strategy for this study. Results show that the wavelet analysis provides relevant information about vegetation dynamics at regional scale, such as the mean and minimum NDVI value, the amplitude of the phenological cycle, the timing of the maximum NDVI and the magnitude of the land-cover change. The latter, in combination with precipitation data, has been used to interpret the observed land-cover changes and identify those subtle changes associated to land degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate monitoring of spatial and temporal variation in tree cover provides essential information for steering management practices in orchards. In this light, the present study investigates the potential of Hyperspectral Mixture Analysis. Specific focus lies on a thorough study of non-linear mixing effects caused by multiple photon scattering. In a series of experiments the importance of multiple scattering is demonstrated while a novel conceptual Nonlinear Spectral Mixture Analysis approach is presented and successfully tested on in situ measured mixed pixels in Citrus sinensis L. orchards. The rationale behind the approach is the redistribution of nonlinear fractions (i.e., virtual fractions) among the actual physical ground cover entities (e.g., tree, soil). These 'virtual' fractions, which account for the extent and nature of multiple photon scattering only have a physical meaning at the spectral level but cannot be interpreted as an actual physical part of the ground cover. Results illustrate that the effect of multiple scattering on Spectral Mixture Analysis is significant as the linear approach provides a mean relative root mean square error (RMSE) for tree cover fraction estimates of 27%. While traditional nonlinear approaches only slightly reduce this error (RMSE=23%), important improvements are obtained for the novel Nonlinear Spectral Mixture Analysis approach (RMSE=12%).

AB Quantitative estimation of fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)), non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) and bare soil (f(RS)) is critical for natural resource management and for modeling carbon dynamics. Accurate estimation of fractional cover is especially important for monitoring and modeling savanna systems, subject to highly seasonal rainfall and drought, grazing by domestic and native animals, and frequent burning. This paper describes a method for resolving f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) across the -2 million km(2) Australian tropical savanna zone with hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. A spectral library compiled from field campaigns in 2005 and 2006, together with three EO-1 Hyperion scenes acquired during the 2005 growing season were used to explore the spectral response space for f(PV,) f(NPV),f(NPV) and f(BS). A linear unmixing approach was developed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI). Transladon of this approach to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scale was assessed by comparing multiple linear regression models of NDVI and CAI with a range of indices based on the seven MODIS bands in the visible and shortwave infrared region (SWIR) using synthesized MODIS surface reflectance data on the same dates as the Hyperion acquisitions. The best resulting model, which used NDVI and the simple ratio of MODIS bands 7 and 6 (SWIR3/SWIR2), was used to generate a time series of fractional cover from 16 day MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data from 2000-2006. The results obtained with MODIS NBAR were validated against grass curing measurement at ten sites with good agreement at six sites, but some underestimation of f(NPV) proportions at four other sites due to substantial sub-pixel heterogeneity. The model was also compared with remote sensing measurements of fire scars and showed a good matching in the spatio-temporal patterns of grass senescence and posterior burning. The fractional cover profiles for major grassland cover types showed significant differences in relative proportions of f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS), as well as large intra-annual seasonal variation in response to monsoonal rainfall gradients and soil type. The methodology proposed here can be applied to other mixed tree-grass ecosystems across the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB By facilitating measurement of river channel morphology, remote sensing techniques could enable significant advances in our understanding of fluvial systems. To realize this potential, researchers must first gain confidence in image-derived river information, as well as an appreciation of its inherent limitations. This paper describes a forward image model (FIM) for examining the capabilities and constraints associated with passive optical remote sensing of liver bathymetry. Image data are simulated "from the streambed up" by first using information on depth and bottom reflectance to parameterize models of radiative transfer within the water column and atmosphere and then incorporating sensor technical specifications. This physics-based framework provides a means of assessing the potential for spectrally-based depth retrieval from a particular river of interest, given a sensor configuration. Forward image modeling of both a hypothetical meander bend and an actual gravel-bed river indicated that bathymetric accuracy and precision vary spatially as a function of channel morphology, with less reliable depth estimates in pools. A simpler, more computationally efficient analytical model highlighted additional controls on bathymetric uncertainty: optical depth and the ratio of the smallest detectable change in radiance to the bottom-reflected radiance. Application of the FIM to a complex, natural channel illustrated how the model can be used to quantify the effects of various sensor characteristics. Bathymetric accuracy was determined primarily by spatial resolution. due to mixed pixels along the banks and sub-pixel scale variations in depth, whereas depth retrieval precision depended oil the sensor's ability to resolve subtle changes in radiance. This flexible forward modeling approach thus allows the utility of image-derived river information to be evaluated in the context of specific investigations, leading to more efficient, more informed use of remote sensing methods across a range of fluvial environments.

AB To greatly increase the spatial and temporal resolution for studying carbon dynamics in the marine environment, we have developed remote-sensing algorithms for particulate organic carbon (POC) by matching in situ POC measurements in the Gulf of Mexico with matching SeaWiFS remote-sensing reflectance. Data on total particulate matter (PM) as well as POC collected during nine cruises in spring, summer and early winter from 1997-2000 as part of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) study were used to test algorithms across a range of environments from low %POC coastal waters to high %POC open-ocean waters. Finding that the remote-sensing reflectance clearly exhibited a peak shift from blue-to-green wavelengths with increasing POC concentration, we developed a Maximum Normalized Difference Carbon Index (MNDCI) algorithm which uses the maximum band ratio of all available blue-to-green wavelengths, and provides a very robust estimate over a wide range of POC and PM concentrations (R-2=0.99, N=58). The algorithm can be extrapolated throughout the region of shipboard sampling for more detailed coverage and analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We apply the Permanent Scatterers Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique to the Campania Region (Southern Italy), which includes the Southern Apennines chain and Plio-Quaternary structural depressions, with the aim to detect ground displacements at a regional scale. The study area, which extends for 13,600 km(2), is characterized by intense urbanization, active volcanoes (Phlegraean Fields, Vesuvius and Ischia), seismogenic structures, landslides, hydrogeological instability. PS-InSAR technique allows us to identify a set of radar benchmarks (PS) where accurate displacement measurements can be carried out. About 1.7.10(6) PS are identified by processing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in ascending and descending orbits from 1992 to 2001 by the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS). The PS-InSAR application at regional scale detected ground deformations ranging from +28 to -39 mm/yr. The calculated velocity values are consistent with the available GPS and levelling data from selected areas. We identify volcanic areas in which the deformation is mainly related to the depressurization of the local hydrothermal systems, and recognize deformations along seismogenic and aseismic NNW-SSE and NW-SE faults. The deformations localized along the Southern Apennines chain are mainly related to landslides while those occurring in the plains are due to subsidence processes induced by intensive drainage from wells, i.e. anthropic activity. The review of 9 years of SAR data shows that tectonic, volcanic/hydrothermal, gravity, and anthropic processes are responsible for the ground deformation of Campania. The proposed joint interpretation of deformation fields related to natural and anthopogenic factors provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the Earth's surface. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) is a noxious Eurasian weed invading riparian and wetland areas of the western US. Effective management of Lepidium requires detailed, accurate maps of its distribution, as may be provided by remote sensing, to contain existing infestations and eradicate incipient populations. We mapped Lepidium with 3 m spatial resolution, 128-band HyMap image data in three sites of California's San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Rush Ranch in Suisun Marsh and the Greater Jepson Prairie Ecosystem and the Cosumnes River Preserve in the Delta). These sites are markedly different in terms of hydrology, salinity, species composition, and structural and landscape diversity. Aggregated classification and regression tree models (CART), incorporating the results of mixture tuned matched filter (MTMF) analyses and spectral physiological indexes, were used to map Lepidium at the three sites. This approach was sufficiently flexible and robust to detect Lepidium with similar accuracies (similar to 90%) at both Rush Ranch and Jepson Prairie, but was unsuccessful at Cosumnes River Preserve. Comparisons of the behavior of the MTMFs and the CARTs between sites reveal the importance of environmental context in species mapping. Rush Ranch presents the simplest conditions for mapping Lepidium: it is the wettest and least diverse site and Lepidium is spectrally distinct from co-occurring species. At Jepson Prairie, several co-occurring species closely resemble Lepidium spectrally. Nevertheless, hyperspectral data provide sufficient spectral detail to resolve Lepidium even at this challenging site, which is facilitated by phenological separation from the matrix of annual grasses. At Cosumnes River Preserve, however, Lepidium is neither spectrally nor phenologically distinct, and consequently could not be mapped successfully. Evidence suggests that the success of a remote sensing analysis declines as site complexity increases (species, structural, and landscape diversity; spectral variability; etc.), although this relationship is complex, indirect, and may be phenology-dependent.

AB The Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA) is the first true-color, high-spatial-resolution image of the seventh continent. It is constructed from nearly 1100 individually selected Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes. Each image was orthorectified and adjusted for geometric, sensor and illumination variations to a standardized, almost seamless surface reflectance product. Mosaicing to avoid clouds produced a high quality, nearly cloud-free benchmark data set of Antarctica for the International Polar Year from images collected primarily during 1999-2003. Multiple color composites and enhancements were generated to illustrate additional characteristics of the multispectral data including: the true appearance of the surface: discrimination between snow and bare ice; reflectance variations within bright snow; recovered reflectance values in regions of sensor saturation; and subtle topographic variations associated with ice flow. LIMA is viewable and individual scenes or user defined portions of the mosaic are downloadable at http://Iima.usgs.gov.

AB Remote sensing is the most practical method available to managers of fire-prone forests for quantifying and mapping fire impacts. Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR) is among the most widely used spectral indices for the mapping of burn severity but is difficult to interpret in terms of fire-related changes in key biophysical attributes and processes. We propose to quantify burn severity as a change in the leaf area index (Delta LAI) of a stand. LAI is a key biophysical attribute of forests. and is central to understanding their water and carbon cycles. Previous studies have suggested that changes in canopy LAI may be a major contributor to Delta NBR and to the composite burn index (CBI) that is frequently used in combination with the NBR to assess burn severity on the ground. We applied remotely-sensed Delta LAI to map burn severity in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-western Australia burnt during the January 2005 Perth Hills wildfires. Ground-based digital photography was used to measure LAI in typical stands representing the full range of canopy densities present in the study area as well as variation in the time since the last fire. Regression models for the prediction of LAI were developed using NBR, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Simple Ratio (SR) as the independent variable. All three LAI models had equally high coefficients of determination (R-2: 0.87) and small root mean squared errors (RIVISE: 0.27-0.28). Delta LAI was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-fire LAI. predicted using imagery from January 2004 and February 2005, respectively. The area affected by the January 2005 fire and the burn severity patterns within that area were mapped using Delta LAI and Delta NBR. Landscape patterns of burn severity obtained from differencing pre- and post-fire LAI were similar to those mapped by Delta NBR. We conclude that fire-affected areas and burn severity patterns in the northern jarrah forest can be objectively mapped using remotely-sensed changes in LAI, while offering the important advantage over NBR of being readily interpretable in the wider context of ecological forest management.

AB This special issue features 15 papers focused on the use of remote sensing as applied to various aspects of freshwater, estuarine and near-shore benthic ecosystems. The work described herein is diverse, ranging across spatial and temporal scales, and making use of optical, radar and lidar technologies. The need for this applied research has become more crucial by the day, as resource managers are faced with issues ranging from non-point source pollution to wetland destruction, invasive species, climate change and more. Routine monitoring and mapping of the changes taking place in these ecosystems enable managers to focus their efforts in time and space, and to prioritize their responses to the most pressing issues. The most compelling aspect of much of the research reported within these pages is that the best advances emerge from the combined use of technologies across the spectrum (literally) and across a range of spatial and temporal scales. No single issue threatening the health of these ecosystems can be addressed using a single approach or with a single image acquired at a given point in time. Despite the additional resources and expense required to make use of multi-sensor, multi-temporal and multi-scale image data, the utility of such data becomes evident across a diverse range of ecosystems and a wide range of conditions. As such, we view this compilation as useful not only for applied resource management, but also as a compelling contribution to the advancement of both basic and applied research in this subject area.

   using normalized circular-pol correlation coefficients

ID COMPENSATION
AB Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter from man-made structures in urban areas is quite different than backscatter from predominantly natural areas. Backscatter from natural areas is often reflection symmetric; i.e., characterized by near zero values for covariance matrix off-diagonal terms of the form < SHVSHH*>, < SHVSVV*> and their conjugates. A new approach is proposed to detect scattering from non-reflection symmetric structures using circular-pol, RR-LL, correlation coefficients, vertical bar rho vertical bar. This method creates a normalization term, vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar, and then forms a ratio, vertical bar rho vertical bar/vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar. The normalization term, vertical bar rho(0)vertical bar, contains the same diagonal terms of the covariance matrix. The (SHVSHH*) and (SHVSVV*) off-diagonal terms and their conjugates are purposely set to zero. The ratio, vertical bar rho vertical bar/rho(0)vertical bar, is rewritten as a product of separable helicity (tau) and orientation angle (theta) dependencies. The mathematical form of the tau dependence is a resonant singularity, or pole, term. This pole significantly enhances returns from man-made, high helicity, non-reflection symmetric structures. These structures have values of tau near the resonance value at tau = +/- 1. Natural scatterers possess very strong RR/LL symmetry (tau approximate to 0) and the pole response for them is correspondingly weak. The dependence of vertical bar p vertical bar/vertical bar p(0)vertical bar on the orientation angle (theta) is known from previous studies to be useful for measuring urban building alignments (relative to the azimuth direction) and measuring surface topography. The ratio vertical bar p vertical bar/vertical bar p(0)vertical bar reduces much of the un-needed image detail of backscatter variations from natural areas of different surface roughness. This image simplification further facilitates detection of localized man-made targets. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A long-term (2000-2005) data set of aerosol optical properties obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is analyzed focusing on the Greater Athens Area in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The MODIS aerosol optical depth standard product (AOD at 550 nm) and its respective ratio attributed to fine-mode particles (FM) are employed to evaluate the inter-annual and seasonal variability of the aerosol properties over Athens. Based on AOD(550) and FM values three specific aerosol types are discriminated corresponding to different aerosol load and optical properties. The aerosol types considered correspond to urban/industrial aerosols, coarse-mode particles and clean maritime conditions. This study focuses on the seasonal and year-to-year fluctuation of the number of occurrences as well as the AOD(550) and FM values of each aerosol type. The coarse-mode particles are observed mainly in the summer, while spring is the most favorable season for the occurrence of urban/industrial aerosols. On the other hand, clean maritime conditions occur mainly in the winter. The AOD(550) values for the coarse-mode particles are higher in spring, while the urban/industrial and clean maritime aerosols exhibit slightly higher values in the summer. The seasonal distribution of the aerosol properties is related to anthropogenic and dust emissions in the spring/summer period, but is modified by atmospheric dispersion and precipitation in late autumn/winter. The main conclusion of the study is that the coarse-mode particles exhibit much stronger inter-annual and seasonal variability compared to the urban/industrial aerosols. Finally, three cases corresponding to each aerosol type are analyzed with the aid of synoptic weather maps, air mass trajectories and MODIS data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we evaluate the potential of spectral, temporal and angular aspect of remotely sensed data for quantitative extraction of forest structure information in tropical woodlands. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral data at 500-meter spatial resolution from different dates, multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) and normalized difference angular index (NDAI) derived from MISR data at 275-meter spatial resolution were used as input data. The number of trees per hectare bigger than 20cm in diameter at breast height was taken as variable of interest. Simple and multiple ordinary least square regressions and artificial neural networks (ANN) were tested to understand the relationships between the various sources of remotely sensed data and the output variable. An experimental design technique, followed by a classification of the input variables and a factor analysis were implemented in order to understand the structure, reduce the dimensionality of the data and avoid the overfitting of the neural network. The results show that there is a significant amount of independent information in the angular dimension, and this information is highly relevant to the estimation of tree densities in the study area. The MISR NDAI indexes improved the performance of the MISR BRF. The non-linear ANN outperformed the linear regressions. The best results were obtained with the ANN after selecting the input variables according to the results of the experimental design, the classification and the factor analysis, with a 0.71 correlation coefficient against the 0.58 of the best linear regression model.

AB In the recent years, the power of employing singularity analysis of scalar variables to perform pattern recognition in complex images has been evidenced. This approach is particularly useful when the image under study corresponds to a scalar variable submitted to a turbulent flow because, in that case, the arrangement of singularity manifolds corresponds to the multifractal hierarchy from the underlying turbulent flow. In this paper we will show how this intimate connection between Image Processing and Physics, when applied to Microwave Sea Surface Temperature images, allows to uncover global circulation patterns in the ocean at a daily basis with the resolution of 1/4 of degree. Using this technique, details not evidenced in the non-processed image are revealed. The emerging patterns provide a description of the global oceanic currents much richer than the usual global circulation scheme; in particular, instabilities, eddy generation and filamentation are distinctly identified. A pattern extraction of this kind is useful in order to measure and track mesoscale oceanic phenomena, opening the way to many operational and reanalysis applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

ID ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; MULTIPLE RESOLUTIONS; THEMATIC MAPS; VEGETATION
AB The prevailing concerns on ecological and environmental issues, occurring especially at regional to global scales, have prompted significant advances on the use of remote sensing data for the estimation of land cover information at sub-pixel level. However, the quality of such classification products, as well as the performance of the classification protocol employed, are difficult to quantify. This paper had the objectives of 1) reviewing the existing alternatives, while identifying major drawbacks and desirable properties, for sub-pixel accuracy assessment based on cross-comparison matrices, and 2) developing theoretical grounds, for a more general accuracy assessment of soft classifications, that account for the sub-pixel class distribution uncertainty. It was found that, for a sub-pixel confusion matrix to exhibit a diagonalization characteristic that allows identifying a perfect matching case, the agreement measure must be constrained at pixel level, whereas a disagreement measure can take into account the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty, leading to an underspecified problem termed the sub-pixel area allocation problem. It was demonstrated that the sub-pixel area allocation problem admits a unique solution if, and only if, no more than one class is either over- or underestimated at each pixel. In this case, the sub-pixel confusion can be uniquely determined. When no unique solution exists, the space of feasible solutions can be represented by confusion intervals. A new cross-comparison matrix that reports the confusion intervals in the form of a center value plus-minus maximum error was proposed to account for the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty. The new matrix is referred to as sub-pixel confusion-uneertainty matrix (SCM). Sub-pixel accuracy measures were also derived from this matrix. The practical use of the SCM and derived indices was demonstrated in assessing an invasive species detection method and a fuzzy classification of urban land use/land cover through remote sensing procedures.

AB The Integral Equation Model (IEM) is the most widely-used, physically based radar backscatter model for sparsely vegetated landscapes. In general, IEM quantifies the magnitude of backscattering as a function of moisture content and surface roughness, which are unknown, and the known radar configurations. Estimating surface roughness or soil moisture by solving the IEM with two unknowns is a classic example of underdetermination and is at the core of the problems associated with the use of radar imagery coupled with IEM-like models. This study offers a solution strategy to this problem by the use of multi-angle radar images, and thus provides estimates of roughness and soil moisture without the use of ancillary field data. Results showed that radar images can provide estimates of surface soil moisture at the watershed scale with good accuracy. Results at the field scale were less accurate, likely due to the influence of image speckle. Results also showed that subsurface roughness caused by rock fragments in the study sites caused error in conventional applications of IEM based on field measurements, but was minimized by using the multi-angle approach.

AB The surface-sensor-sun relations model (SUM) of Soux et al. [Soux, C.A., Voogt, J.A., & Oke, T.R. (2004). A model to calculate what a remote sensor 'sees' of an urban surface. Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 111, 109-132.] is modified to include a coupling of SUM with the actual building structure of a study area, thereby allowing variable building heights and shapes to be represented within SUM as well as the provision for an inter-building spacing that provides a more realistic urban block structure in the internal SUM urban surface representation. Model simulations using both modifications are performed and compared with airborne observations of surface temperature made over a Light Industrial area and a downtown area of Vancouver, BC. The results are generally good, although there is a general tendency to underestimate the overall thermal anisotropy. Use of mean facet temperatures in the validation limits validation statistics for one study area; improvements are made when facet temperatures are updated from individual flight lines. Performing a sensitivity analyses on the contributions to the thermal anisotropy suggests that surface structure and microscale temperature variability both make substantial contributions to the total anisotropy. This finding underscores the importance of including microscale temperature variability in assessments of urban thermal anisotropy. Full hemispheric plots of directional temperature and statistics for each study area are presented as an application of the model and show smooth variations in directional temperature when averaged over the study area.

AB The retrieval of tree and forest structural attributes from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data has focused largely on utilising canopy height models, but these have proved only partially useful for mapping and attributing stems in complex, multi-layered forests. As a complementary approach, this paper presents a new index, termed the Height-Scaled Crown Openness Index (HSCOI), which provides a quantitative measure of the relative penetration of LiDAR pulses into the canopy. The HSCOI was developed from small footprint discrete return LiDAR data acquired over mixed species woodlands and open forests near Injune, Queensland, Australia, and allowed individual trees to be located (including those in the sub-canopy) and attributed with height using relationships (r(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 1.85 m, n = 115; 4 outliers removed) established with field data. A threshold contour of the HSCOI surface that encompassed similar to 90% of LiDAR vegetation returns also facilitated mapping of forest areas, delineation of tree crowns and clusters, and estimation of canopy cover. At a stand level, tree density compared well with field measurements (r(2) = 0.82, RMSE = 133 stems ha(-1), n = 30), with the most consistent results observed for stem densities <= 700 stems ha(-1). By combining information extracted from both the HSCOI and the canopy height model, predominant stem height (r(2) = 0.91, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 30), crown cover (r(2) = 0.78, RMSE = 9.25%, n = 30), and Foliage & Branch Projective Cover (FBPC; r(2) = 0.89, RMSE = 5.49%, n = 30) were estimated to levels sufficient for inventory of woodland and open forest structural types. When the approach was applied to forests in north cast Victoria, stem density and crown cover were reliably estimated for forests with a structure similar to those observed in Queensland, but less so for forests of greater height and canopy closure.

AB In this paper, we present five-year (2000-2004) climatological statistics of Northern Hemisphere spectral white-sky albedo for the 16 International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) ecosystem classes when accompanied by the presence of snow on the ground. These statistics are obtained using validated, high quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo (MOD43B3) data flagged as snow in the associated Quality Assurance (QA) fields. Near Real-Time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) data are used as an additional discriminator of snow extent. Statistics are provided for the first seven MODIS bands, ranging from 0.47 to 2.1 mu m, and for three broadbands, 0.3-0.7, 0.3-5.0 and 0.7-5.0 mu m.
   The statistics demonstrate that each ecosystem classification has a discernible spectral albedo signature when accompanied by snow on the ground. This indicates that winter canopy and the underlying surface radiative properties are impacted by the presence of snow overlying these surfaces. For example, the 0.47 mu m albedo of winter snow-free evergreen needleleaf forests increases from 0.03 to 0.36 in the presence of snow, compared to an increase of 0.04 to 0.76 for croplands. In general, the albedo of snow-covered ecosystems with some winter canopy has lower albedos than ecosystems with little to no winter canopy; for example the 0.47 mu m albedo of snow-covered mixed forests is 0.39 compared to 0.87 for barren/deserts and 0.95 for permanent snow.
   These statistics can be used within land surface models in a stand-alone mode, to prescribe albedo values in atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs), or be incorporated into research and operational projects. They are intended to provide researchers with representative spectral albedo values of IGBP ecosystems in the presence of snow that are derived from validated satellite data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper focuses on different methods for estimating soil moisture in a Sahelian environment by comparing ENVISAT/ASAR and ground data at the same spatial scale. The analysis is restricted to Wide Swath data in order to take advantage of their high temporal repetitivity (about 3-4 days) corresponding to a moderate spatial resolution (150 m). On the one hand, emphasis is put on the characterization of Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) at a spatial scale compatible with the derivation of the backscattering coefficients, and a transfer function is developed for up-scaling local measurements to the 1 km scale. On the other hand, three different approaches are used to normalize the angular variation of the observed backscattering coefficients. The results show a strong linear relationship between the HH normalized backscattering coefficients and SSM. The best result is obtained when restricting the ASAR data to low incidence angles and by taking into account vegetation effects using multi-angular radar data. For this case, the rms error of the SSM retrieval is 2.8%. These results highlight the capabilities of the ASAR instrument to monitor SSM in a semiarid environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper evaluated the capacity of SPOT VEGETATION time-series to monitor herbaceous fuel moisture content (FMC) in order to improve fire risk assessment in the savanna ecosystem of Kruger National Park in South Africa. In situ herbaceous FMC data were used to assess the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Vegetation Dryness Index (VDI), Improved VDI (IVDI), and Accumulated Relative NDVI Decrement (ARND) during the dry season. The effect of increasing amounts of dead vegetation on the monitoring capacity of derived indices was studied by sampling mixed live and dead FMC. The IVDI was proposed as an improvement of the VDI to monitor herbaceous FMC during the dry season. The IVDI is derived by replacing NDVI with the integrated Relative Vegetation Index (iRVI), as an approximation of yearly herbaceous biomass, when analyzing the 2-dimensional space with NDWI. It was shown that the iRVI offered more information than the NDVI in combination with NDWI to monitor FMC. The VDI and IVDI exhibited a significant relation to FMC with R 2 of 0.25 and 0.73, respectively. The NDWI, however, correlated best with FMC (R-2 = 0.75), while the correlation of ARND and FMC was weaker (R-2 = 0.60) than that found for NDVI, NDWI, and IVDI. The use of in situ herbaceous FMC consequently indicated that NDWI is appropriate as spatio-temporal information source of herbaceous FMC variation which can be used to optimize fire risk and behavior assessment for fire management in savanna ecosystems.

AB We used a single-beam, first return profiling LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) measurements of canopy height, intensive biometric measurements in plots, and Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to quantify forest structure and ladder fuels (defined as vertical fuel continuity between the understory and canopy) in the New Jersey Pinelands. The LIDAR data were recorded at 400 Hz over three intensive areas of 1 km(2) where transects were spaced at 200 m, and along 64 transects spaced 1 km apart (total of ca. 2500 km(2)). LIDAR and field measurements of canopy height were similar in the three intensive study areas, with the 80th percentile of LIDAR returns explaining the greatest amount of variability (79%). Correlations between LIDAR data and aboveground tree biomass measured in the field were highly significant when all three 1 km(2) areas were analyzed collectively, with the 80th percentile again explaining the greatest amount of variability (74%). However, when intensive areas were analyzed separately, correlations were poor for Oak/Pine and Pine/Scrub Oak stands. Similar results were obtained using FIA data; at the landscape scale, mean canopy height was positively correlated with aboveground tree biomass, but when forest types were analyzed separately, correlations were significant only for some wetland forest (Pitch Pine lowlands and mixed hardwoods; r(2)=0.74 and 0.59, respectively), and correlations were poor for upland forests (Oak/Pine, Pine/Oak and Pine/Scrub Oak, r(2)=0.33, 0.11 and 0.21, respectively). When LIDAR data were binned into 1-m height classes, more LIDAR pulses were recorded from the lowest height classes in stands with greater shrub biomass, and significant differences were detected between stands where recent prescribed fire treatments had been conducted and unburned areas. Our research indicates that single-beam LIDAR can be used for regional-scale (forest biomass) estimates, but that relationships between height and biomass can be poorer at finer scales within individual forest types. Binned data are useful for estimating the presence of ladder fuels (vertical continuity of leaves and branches) and horizontal fuel continuity below the canopy. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product (MOD10) creates automated daily, 8-day composite and monthly regional and global snow cover maps. In this study, the MOD10 daily swath imagery (MOD10-L2) and the MODIS cloud mask (MOD35) were validated in the Lower Great Lakes Region, specifically the area to the east of Lake Michigan. Validation of the MOD10_L2 snow product, MOD35 cloud mask and the MOD10_L2 Liberal Cloud Mask was performed using field observations from K-12 student GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) and SATELLITES (Students And Teachers Evaluating Local Landscapes to Interpret The Earth from Space) programs. Student data consisted of field observations of snow depth, snow water equivalency, cloud type, and total cloud cover. In addition, observations from the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observing Stations were used. Student observations were taken during field campaigns in the winter of 2001-2002, a winter with very little snow in the Great Lakes region, and the winters of 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, which had significant snow cover. Validation of the MOD10_L2 version 4 snow product with student observations produced an accuracy of 92% while comparison with the NWS stations produced an accuracy of 86%. The higher NWS error appears to come from forested areas. Twenty-five and fifty percent of the errors observed by the students and NWS stations, respectively, occurred when there was only a trace of snow. In addition, 82% of the MODIS cloud masked pixels were identified as either overcast or broken by the student observers while 74% of the pixels the MODIS cloud mask identified as cloudless were identified as clear, isolated or scattered cloud cover by the student observers. The experimental Liberal Cloud Mask eliminated some common errors associated with the MOD35 cloud mask, however, it was found to omit significant cloud cover. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we present an improved procedure for collecting no or little atmosphere- and snow-contaminated observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The resultant time series of daily MODIS data of a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest (the Bartlett Experimental Forest) in 2004 show strong seasonal dynamics of surface reflectance of green, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and clearly delineate leaf phenology and length of plant growing season. We also estimate the fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegetation canopy (FAPAR(canopy)), leaf (FAPAR(leaf)), and chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)), respectively, using a coupled leaf-canopy radiative transfer model (PROSAIL-2) and daily MODIS data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (the Metropolis algorithm) is used for model inversion, which provides probability distributions of the retrieved variables. A two-step procedure is used to estimate the fractions of absorbed PAR: (1) to retrieve biophysical and biochemical variables from MODIS images using the PROSAIL-2 model; and (2) to calculate the fractions with the estimated model variables from the first step. Inversion and forward simulations of the PROSAIL-2 model are carried out for the temperate deciduous broadleaf forest during day of year (DOY) 184 to 201 in 2005. The reproduced reflectance values from the PROSAIL-2 model agree well with the observed MODIS reflectance for the five spectral bands (green, red, NIR1, NIR2, and SWIR1]). The estimated leaf area index, leaf dry matter, leaf chlorophyll content and FAPAR(canopy) values are close to field measurements at the site. The results also showed significant differences between FAPAR(canopy) and FAPAR(chl) at the site. Our results show that MODIS imagery provides important information on biophysical and biochemical variables at both leaf and canopy levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing data from both Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 systems were utilized to assess urban area thermal characteristics in Tampa Bay watershed of west-central Florida, and the Las Vegas valley of southern Nevada. To quantitatively determine urban land use extents and development densities, sub-pixel impervious surface areas were mapped for both areas. The urban-rural boundaries and urban development densities were defined by selecting certain imperviousness threshold values and Landsat thermal bands were used to investigate urban surface thermal patterns. Analysis results suggest that urban surface thermal characteristics and patterns can be identified through qualitatively based urban land use and development density data. Results show the urban area of the Tampa Bay watershed has a daytime heating effect (heat-source), whereas the urban surface in Las Vegas has a daytime cooling effect (heat-sink). These thermal effects strongly correlated with urban development densities where higher percent imperviousness is usually associated with higher surface temperature. Using vegetation canopy coverage information, the spatial and temporal distributions of urban impervious surface and associated thermal characteristics are demonstrated to be very useful sources in quantifying urban land use, development intensity, and urban thermal patterns.

AB The Reko Diq, Pakistan mineralized study area, approximately 10 km in diameter, is underlain by a central zone of hydrothermally altered rocks associated with Cu-Au mineralization. The surrounding country rocks are a variable mixture of unaltered volcanic rocks, fluvial deposits, and eolian quartz sand. Analysis of 15-band Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data of the study area, aided by laboratory spectral reflectance and spectral emittance measurements of field samples, shows that phyllically altered rocks are laterally extensive, and contain localized areas of argillically altered rocks.
   In the visible through shortwave-infrared (VNIR+SWIR) phyllically altered rocks are characterized by Al-OH absorption in ASTER band 6 because of molecular vibrations in muscovite, whereas argillically altered rocks have an absorption feature in band 5 resulting from alunite. Propylitically altered rocks form a peripheral zone and are present in scattered exposures within the main altered area. Chlorite and muscovite cause distinctive absorption features at 2.33 and 2.20 mu m, respectively, although less intense 2.33 mu m absorption is also present in image spectra of country rocks.
   Important complementary lithologic information was derived by analysis of the spectral emittance data in the 5 thermal-infrared (TIR) bands. Silicified rocks were not distinguished in the 9 VNIR+SWIR bands because of the lack of diagnostic spectral absorption features in quartz in this wavelength region. Quartz-bearing surficial deposits, as well as hydrothermally silicified rocks, were mapped in the TIR bands by using a band 13/band 12 ratio image, which is sensitive to the intensity of the quartz reststrahlen feature. Improved distinction between the quartzose surficial deposits and silicified bedrock was achieved by using matched-filter processing with TIR image spectra for reference. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Some form of the light use efficiency (LUE) model is used in most models of ecosystem carbon exchange based on remote sensing. The strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and light absorbed by green vegetation make models based on LUE attractive in the remote sensing context. However, estimation of LUE has proven problematic since it varies with vegetation type and environmental conditions. Here we propose that LUE may in fact be correlated with vegetation greenness (measured either as NDVI at constant solar elevation angle, or a red edge chlorophyll index), making separate estimates of LUE unnecessary, at least for some vegetation types. To test this, we installed an automated tram system for measurement of spectral reflectance in the footprint of an eddy covariance flux system in the Southern California chaparral. This allowed us to match the spatial and temporal scales of the reflectance and flux measurements and thus to make direct comparisons over time scales ranging from minutes to years. The 3-year period of this study included both "normal" precipitation years and an extreme drought in 2002. In this sparse chaparral vegetation, diurnal and seasonal changes in solar angle resulted in large variation in NDVI independent of the actual quantity of green vegetation. In fact, one would come to entirely different conclusions about seasonal changes in vegetation greenness depending on whether NDVI at noon or NDVI at constant solar elevation angle were used. Although chaparral vegetation is generally considered "evergreen", we found that the majority of the shrubs were actually semi-deciduous, leading to large seasonal changes in NDVI at constant solar elevation angle. LUE was correlated with both greenness indices at the seasonal timescale across all years. In contrast, the relationship between LUE and PRI was inconsistent. PRI was well correlated with LUE during the "normal" years but this relationship changed dramatically during the extreme drought. Contrary to expectations, none of the spectral reflectance indices showed consistent relationships with CO2 flux or LUE over the diurnal time-course, possibly because of confounding effects of sun angle and stand structure on reflectance. These results suggest that greenness indices can be used to directly estimate CO2 exchange at weekly timescales in this chaparral ecosystem, even in the face of changes in LUE. Greenness indices are unlikely to be as good predictors of CO2 exchange in dense evergreen vegetation as they were in the sparse, semi-deciduous chaparral. However, since relatively few ecosystems are entirely evergreen at large spatial scales or over long time spans due to disturbance, these relationships need to be examined across a wider range of vegetation types.

AB A two-source (soil + vegetation) energy balance model using microwave-derived near-surface soil moisture as a key boundary condition (TSMSM) and another scheme using thermal-infrared (radiometric) surface temperature (TSMTH) were applied to remote sensing data collected over a corn and soybean production region in central Iowa during the Soil Moisture Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX)/Soil Moisture Experiment of 2002 (SMEX02). The TSMSM was run using fields of near-surface soil moisture from microwave imagery collected by aircraft on six days during the experiment, yielding a root mean square difference (RMSD) between model estimates and tower measurements of net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) of approximately 20 W to m(-2), and 45 W m(-2) for sensible (H) and latent heating (LE). Similar results for H and LE were obtained at landscape/regional scales when comparing model output with transect-average aircraft flux measurements. Flux predictions from the TSMSM and TSMTH models were compared for two days when both airborne microwave-derived soil moisture and radiometric surface temperature (T-R) data from Landsat were available. These two days represented contrasting conditions of moderate crop cover/dry soil surface and dense crop cover/moist soil surface. Surface temperature diagnosed by the TSMSM was also compared directly to the remotely sensed T-R fields as an additional means of model validation. The TSMSM performed well under moderate crop cover/dry soil surface conditions, but yielded larger discrepancies with observed heat fluxes and T-R under the high crop cover/moist soil surface conditions. Flux predictions from the thermal-based two-source model typically showed biases of opposite sign, suggesting that an average of the flux output from both modeling schemes may improve overall accuracy in flux predictions, in effect incorporating multiple remote-sensing constraints on canopy and soil fluxes.

AB Variations in soil moisture strongly affect surface energy balances, regional runoff, land erosion and vegetation productivity (potential crop yield). Hence, the detection of soil moisture content (SMC) is very valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. A method to estimate SMC from optical and thermal spectral information of METEOSAT imagery based on thermal inertia (TI) is presented. Minimum and maximum TI values from time series are combined in the Soil Moisture Saturation Index (SMSI). To convert surface to soil profile values, a Markov type filter is used, based on a simple two layer water balance equation (the surface layer and the reservoir below) and an autocorrelation function. Ten-daily SMC values are compared with up-scaled (using AVHRR/NDVI) observations on 10 EUROFLUX sites in Europe for the 1997 growing season (March-October). Moreover, the thermal inertia approach is compared for 1997, with ERS Scatterometer data for eight EUROFLUX sites. METEOSAT pixels are up-scaled to accommodate the ERS Scatterometer spatial resolution. The regression coefficients (slope, intercept and R-2) of the thermal inertia approach versus the up-scaled soil moisture observations from EUROFLUX sites vary between 0.811-1.148, -0.0029-0.66 and 0.544-0.877, respectively, with a RRMSE range of 3.9% to 35.7%. The regression coefficients of the comparison of ERS Scatterometer derived Soil Water Index (SWI) versus the up-scaled Soil Moisture Saturation Index for the pooled case (binning the eight EUROFLUX sites) are 0.587, 0.105 and 0.441, respectively, with a RRMSE of 38%. A simple error propagation model applied for the thermal inertia approach reveals that the absolute and relative errors of the obtained soil moisture content is at least 0.010 m(3) m(-3) or 2.0% with a SMC of 0.203 m(3) m(-3). Recommendations are made to test and implement the TI methodology using NOAA/AVHRR imagery. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Infrared remotely sensed data can be used to estimate heat flux and thermal features of active volcanoes. The model proposed by Crisp and Baloga [Crisp, J., Baloga.. S., 1990. A model for lava flows with two thermal components, Journal of Geophysical Research, 95, 1255-1270.] for active lava flows considers the thermal flux a function of the fractional area of two thermally distinct radiant surfaces. The larger surface area corresponds to the cooler crust of the flow, the smaller one to fractures in the crust. In this model, the crust temperature T-c, the temperature of the cracks T-h, and the fractional area of the hottest component f(h) represent the three unknowns to work out. The simultaneous solution of the Planck equation ("dual-band" technique) for two distinct shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands allows to estimate any two of the parameters T-c, T-h, f(h), if the third is assumed [Dozier, J., 1981. A method for satellite identification of surface temperature fields of subpixel resolution. Remote Sensing Environment, 11, 221-229.]
   The airborne sensor MIVIS was flown on Mount Etna during the July-August 2001 eruption. This hyperspectral imaging spectrometer offers 72 bands in the SWIR range and 10 bands in thermal infrared (TIR) region of the spectrum, which can be used to solve the dual-band system without any assumptions. Therefore, we can combine three spectral MIVIS bands to obtain simultaneous solutions for the three unknowns. Here, the procedure for solving such a system is presented. It is then demonstrated that a TIR channel is required to better pinpoint solutions to the 2-components model.
   Finally, the spatial and statistical characteristic of the resultant MIVIS-derived temperature and flux distributions are introduced and statistics for each hot spot investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A non-conventional approach for the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD), based on the use of information contained in multiangular images and the inversion of a canopy ray tracing model, is proposed in this work. As an alternative to the use of overall image reflectance data, the image fraction components, i.e. sunlit and shaded leaves and soil, are obtained by supervised classification of ground-based multiangular images acquired using an inexpensive colour infrared camera, the Dycam ADC. These data are used for the inversion of a numerical model of a vegetation canopy in which the latter is described as composed of randomly distributed disks (leaves). The model was developed using the POV-ray ray tracer. Model inversion is carried out using the look-up-table approach. The proposed methodology was tested using an extensive data set gathered on the potato crop during experimental trials carried out at Viterbo (Italy) for 3 years. The results show that LAI was successfully estimated with a RMSE varying from 0.29 to 0.75 in the different years. The potential sources of error in both estimated and measured LAI values are extensively discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Application of remote sensing data has been made to differentiate between dry/wet snows in a glacierized basin. The present study has been carried out in the Gangotri glacier, Himalayas, using IRS-LISS-III multispectral data for the period March-November 2000 and the digital elevation model. The methodology involves conversion of satellite sensor data into reflectance values, computation of NDSI, determination of the boundary between dry/wet snows from spectral response data, and threshold slicing of the image data. The areas of dry snow cover and wet snow cover for different dates of satellite overpasses have been computed. The dry snow area has been compared with non-melting area obtained from the temperature lapse rate method, and the two are found to be in close mutual correspondence (< 15%). It is observed that there occur four water-bearing zones in the glacierized basin: dry snow zone, wet snow zone, exposed glacial ice and moraine-covered glacial ice, each of which possesses unique hydrological characteristics and can be distinguished and mapped from satellite sensor data. It is suggested that input of data on the position and extent of specifically wet snow and exposed glacial ice, which can be directly derived from remote sensing, should improve hydrological simulation of such basins.

AB The use of knowledge-based systems (KBSs) that use evidential reasoning for land-cover mapping derived from remotely sensed images is spreading widely. In recent years, KBSs utilizing the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (D-S ToE) have been found most successful in a wide range of remote sensing applications, partly because of their ability to combine diverse information sources. An important feature of the D-S ToE is that it provides a measure for the evidential support (belief) accumulated for each object class at each pixel. Despite the importance of cumulative belief values (CBVs) in representing the weighting of supportive versus conflicting evidence for each class, their analysis has received little attention in the literature. The objective of the present study was to assess the performance (represented by the kappa coefficient) of a KBS based on D-S ToE and of an unsupervised classification (ISODATA), with relation to the CBV distribution determined for each class. This was done for the task of crop recognition in a wide heterogeneous region in Israel. It was found that while KBS performs very well in cases of conflicts and moderate support, the US classification performed well only in cases of homogeneity and uniqueness. Crop recognition by means of KBS was applied to almost one-third of the country's agricultural areas, and it provided a high level of differentiation among seven crop types, orchards and natural vegetation types.

AB Ninety percent of projected global urbanization will be concentrated in low income countries. This will have considerable environmental, economic and public health implications for those populations. Objective and efficient methods of delineating urban extent are a cross-sectoral need complicated by a diversity of urban definition rubrics world-wide. Large-area maps of urban extents are becoming increasingly available in the public domain, as are a wide-range of medium spatial resolution satellite imagery. Here we describe the extension of a methodology based on Landsat ETM and Radarsat imagery to the production of a human settlement map of Kenya. This map was then compared with five satellite imagery-derived, global maps of urban extent at Kenya national-level, against an expert opinion coverage for accuracy assessment. The results showed the map produced using medium spatial resolution satellite imagery was of comparable accuracy to the expert opinion coverage. The five global urban maps exhibited a range of inaccuracies, emphasising that care should be taken with use of these maps at national and sub-national scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for the understanding of several eco-physiological processes within a vegetation canopy. The LAI could thus provide vital information for the management of the environment and agricultural practices when estimated continuously over time and space thanks to remote sensing sensors.
   This study proposed a method to estimate LAI spatial and temporal variation based on multi-temporal remote sensing observations processed using a simple semi-mechanistic canopy structure dynamic model (CSDM) coupled with a radiative transfer model (RTM). The CSDM described the temporal evolution of the LAI as function of the accumulated daily air temperature as measured from classical ground meteorological stations.
   The retrieval performances were evaluated for two different data sets: first, a data set simulated by the RTM but taking into account realistic measurement conditions and uncertainties resulting from different error sources; second, an experimental data set acquired over maize crops the Blue Earth City area (USA) in 1998. Results showed that the proposed approach improved significantly the retrieval performances for LAI mainly by smoothing the residual errors associated to each individual observation. In addition it provides a way to describe in a continuous manner the LAI time course from a limited number of observations during the growth cycle. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Most multi-source forest inventory (MSFI) applications have thus far been based on the use of medium resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat TM. The high plot and stand level estimation errors of these applications have, however, restricted their use in forest management planning. One reason suggested for the high estimation errors has been the coarse spatial resolution of the imagery employed. Therefore, very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery sources provide interesting data for stand-level inventory applications. However, digital interpretation of VHR imagery, such as aerial photographs, is more complicated than the use of traditional satellite imagery. Pixel-by-pixel analysis is not applicable to VHR imagery because a single pixel is small in relation to the object of interest, i.e. a forest stand, and therefore it does not adequately represent the spectral properties of a stand. Additionally in aerial photographs, the spectral properties of the objects are dependent on their location in the image. Therefore, MSF1 applications based on aerial imagery must employ features that are less sensitive to their location in the image and that have been derived using the spatial neighborhood of each pixel, e.g. a square-shaped window of pixels. In this experiment several spectral and textural features were extracted from color-infrared aerial photographs and employed in estimation of forest attributes. The features were extracted from original, normalized difference vegetation index and channel ratio images. The correlations between the extracted image features and forest attributes measured from sample plots were examined. Additionally, the spectral and textural features were used for estimating the forest attributes of sample plots, applying the k nearest neighbor estimation method. The results show that several spectral and textural image features that are moderately or well correlated with the forest attributes. Furthermore, the accuracy of forest attribute estimation can be significantly improved by a careful selection of image features. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On June 1, 2000, an oil spill accident occurred along transportation pipeline located in the Jornada Experimental Range (USDA), Jornada, New Mexico, a long-term ecological research (LTER). In order to detect potential vegetation stress caused by the accident, two AVIRIS data sets of the oil spill area, before and after the oil release, are analyzed and the reliability of several techniques in the detection of vegetation stress is examined.
   The polynomial fitting and Lagrangian interpolation, and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) are applied to the AVIRIS data sets. The first two methods are applied for the detection of the "red-edge" shift in vegetation reflectance spectra, and the last for the detection of change in vegetation fraction. The results indicate that the polynomial fitting and Lagrangian interpolation both are able to detect a red-shift of the vegetation "red-edge", but the latter's performance depends on the band combination used and is sensitive to data noise. The polynomial fitting results are inconsistent in detection of "the red-edge" shift, while Lagrangian interpolation is not. Within the oil spill area, the fraction estimates of vegetation resulting from SMA demonstrate a decrease (10-30%) of the vegetation fraction after the accident, indicating stressed vegetation and cover change. The result also indicates that areas of extremely large decrease (>40%) in plant cover outside of the oil spill area is due to the response of grasses due to the water stress in 2000, and that the integration of some auxiliary data on ecological and climatological data with the analysis of remotely sensed data is thus very important to the interpretation of the detection results. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the detected vegetation cover change is insensitive to the noise introduced by the radiometric normalization. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The timing of spring river-ice break-up, a major annual event for physical, biological, and human systems on Arctic rivers, has been used to infer regional climate variations over the past century or more. Most observations of ice break-up are recorded as point data taken from selected ground-based stations. It is unknown whether these point observations are fully representative of breakup patterns elsewhere along the course of a river. Here, daily time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images are used to remotely sense spatial and temporal patterns in ice breakup along 1600-3300 km lengths of the Lena, Ob', Yenisey, and Mackenzie Rivers. The first day of predominantly ice-free water is visually identified and mapped for ten years (1992-1993, 1995-1998, and 2000-2003), with a mean precision of +/-1.75 days. The derived breakup dates show high correlation with ground-based observations, although a slight trend towards earlier satellite-derived dates can be traced to differences in the way ice breakup date is defined. Large ice jams are often observed, particularly at confluences, although smaller ice jams may not be visible due to the limited spatial resolution of the imagery used. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns in breakup seem to be primarily governed by latitude, timing of the spring flood wave, and location of confluences with major tributaries. Interestingly, channel-scale factors such as slope, width, and radius of curvature, which are known to influence ice breakup at the reach scale, do not appear to be major factors at the scale observed here. The degree of similarity between interannual trends in breakup date at distant points along a river is generally high, which supports the use of point-scale data to infer regional climate variations. This similarity does not hold true for the Mackenzie River, where substantial spatial differences in breakup trends are observed. A new variable, spatially integrated breakup date (d(i)), uses weighted spatial averaging to provide a more encompassing measure of breakup timing. The Ob' and Yenisey Rivers show similar trends in spatially integrated break-up date from year to year. In contrast, the Mackenzie and Lena show a remarkably consistent negative correlation, here attributed to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index.

AB The retrieval of biophysical variables using canopy reflectance models is hampered by the fact that the inverse problem is ill-posed. This leads to unstable and often inaccurate inversion results. In order to regularize the model inversion, a novel approach has been developed and tested on synthetic Landsat TM reflectance data. The method takes into account the neighbouring radiometric information of the pixel of interest, named object signature. The neighbourhood data can either be extracted from gliding windows, already segmented images, or using digitized field boundaries. The extracted radiometric data of the neighbourhood pixels are used to calculate 42 descriptive statistical properties that comprehensively characterize the spectral (co)variance of the image object (e.g. mean and standard deviation of the distributions, intercorrelations between spectral bands, etc.). Together with the habitual spectral signature of the pixel being inverted (6 variables), this object signature (42 variables) is used as input in an artificial neural net to estimate simultaneously three important biophysical variables (i.e. leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll, and leaf water content). The use of neural nets for the model inversion avoids time-consuming iterative optimizations and provides a computational effective way to consider simultaneously pixel and object signatures.
   In order to "learn'' the relation between spectral signatures and biophysical variables, the neural nets were previously trained on large synthetic data sets. The data sets consist of pixel signatures and the corresponding signatures of image objects representing various agricultural fields. The signatures were simulated with the SAILH+PROSPECT canopy reflectance model, assuming largely varying intra-and interfield distributions of the model input parameters.
   To demonstrate the benefits of the object-based inversion, neural nets were also trained on the pixel signatures alone. For this purpose, the object signatures were simply replaced by randomly generated white noise-all other conditions being the same. The intercomparison based on 30,000 independent validation patterns showed that the proposed method significantly enhances the estimation accuracies: for example, the leaf area index (LAI) is estimated with a percental root mean square error (PRMSE) of 18.3% (object-based) compared to 25. 1 % (pixel based); the corresponding numbers for the leaf chlorophyll content are 12.6% compared to 15.9%; for the equivalent leaf water thickness, 10.6% and 13.9%, respectively.
   The benefit of the object signature was strongest for the LAI. Concerning this important biophysical variable, the novel concept accounted for almost one-half of the remaining unexplained variance of the traditional pixel-based approach. Increased accuracies were attributed to the fact that intrafield variations of biophysical canopy variables lead to object signatures that are modulated by the actual average leaf angle (ALA) of the canopy. Since ALA can be considered constant insight given an agricultural field, the concurrent use of pixel and object signatures significantly reduces confounding effects between LAI and ALA typical for traditional inversion approaches. Compared to competing approaches, the algorithm can also be applied to monotemporal imagery and does not require a priori information or the identification of crop type. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB An optimal deconvolution (ODC) technique has been developed to estimate microwave brightness temperatures of agricultural fields using microwave radiometer observations. The technique is applied to airborne measurements taken by the Passive and Active L and S band (PALS) sensor in Iowa during Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02). Agricultural fields in the study area were predominantly soybeans and corn. The brightness temperatures of corn and soybeans were observed to be significantly different because of large differences in vegetation biomass. PALS observations have significant over-sampling; observations were made about 100 in apart and the sensor footprint extends to about 400 in. Conventionally, observations of this type are averaged to produce smooth spatial data fields of brightness temperatures. However, the conventional approach is in contrast to reality in which the brightness temperatures are in fact strongly dependent on land cover, which is characterized by sharp boundaries. In this study, we mathematically deconvolve the observations into brightness temperature at the field scale (500-800 in) using the sensor antenna response function. The result is more accurate spatial representation of field-scale brightness temperatures, which may in turn lead to more accurate soil moisture retrieval. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a physical-based split-window Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm for retrieving the surface temperature from SEVIRI/MSG1 (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager/Meteosat Second Generation 1) data in two thermal infrared bands (IR 10.8 and IR 12.0). The proposed algorithm takes into account the SEVIRI angular dependence. The numerical values of the split-window coefficients have been obtained from a statistical regression method, using synthetic data. The look-up tables for atmospheric transmission, path radiance, and downward thermal irradiance are calculated with the MODTRAN3 code. The new LST algorithm has been tested with simulated SEVIRI/MSG1 data over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. Comprehensive sensitivity and error analyses have been undertaken to evaluate the performance of the proposed LST algorithm and its dependence on surface properties, the ranges of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures, and on the noise-equivalent temperature difference. The results show that the algorithm is capable of producing LST with a standard deviation lower than 1.5 K for viewing zenith angles lower than 50degrees. Since MSG1 is becoming fully operational in 2004, the proposed algorithm will allow MSG1 users to obtain surface temperatures immediately. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; CLASSIFICATIONS; AREA
AB During the last few years, the remote sensing community has been trying to address the need for global synthesis to support policy makers on issues such as deforestation or global climate change. Several global thematic products have been derived from large datasets of low-resolution remotely sensed data, the latter providing the best trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and cost. However, a standard procedure for the validation of such products has not been developed yet. This paper proposes a methodology, based on statistical indices derived from the widely used Error Matrix, to deal with the specific issue of the influence of the low spatial resolution of the dataset on the accuracy of the end-product, obtained with hard classification approaches. In order to analyse quantitatively the trade-off between omission and commission errors, we suggest the use of the 'Pareto Boundary', a method rooted in economics theory applied to decisions with multiple conflicting objectives. Starting from a high-resolution reference dataset, it is possible to determine the maximum user and producer's accuracy values (i.e. minimum omission and commission errors) that could be attained jointly by a low-resolution map. The method has been developed for the specific case of diebotomic classifications and it has been adopted in the evaluation of burned area maps derived from SPOT-VGT with Landsat ETM+ reference data. The use of the Pareto Boundary can help to understand whether the limited accuracy of a low spatial resolution map is given by poor performance of the classification algorithm or by the low resolution of the remotely sensed data, which had been classified.

AB Traditionally, the tropical zone is known as the "heat reservoir" of the ocean and the "firebox" of the atmosphere. The western equatorial Pacific has been identified as both the warmest portion of the heat reservoir, named "warm pool" (WP), and the hottest portion of the firebox where a huge amount of precipitation-induced latent-heat release is accumulated. The latter mirrors a fact that the western tropical Pacific is also the wettest area on the globe, termed "rain pool" (RP), where the maximum annual precipitation is observed. The accumulation of continuous satellite data has reached a point that decade-long simultaneous observations of many important geophysical parameters have become available in recent years. One such example is the availability of a concurrent dataset of sea surface temperature, oceanic precipitation. and sea surface wind field for 1993-2002 derived from NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), TOPEX/TMR (TOPEX Microwave Radiometer), and ERS-1,2/QuikSCAT, respectively. In the present study, this dataset is used to demonstrate and investigate the coupling and covarying effects of the Pacific WP and RP, leading to a number of interesting findings on their structural similarity, locational shift, phase lag, and evolutional coherency in association with the development of and the vacillation between El Nino and La Nina events.

AB The role of tropical forests in sustainable development mechanisms and payments for environmental services is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, there is a greater need for accurate and detailed information about their biophysical characteristics (e.g., Leaf area index-LAI) along different stages of ecological succession. Remote sensing offers the possibility of providing relatively accurate estimations of such biophysical characteristics at a reasonable cost for most regional projects. The objectives of this study are to (1) document the variability of LAI in different stages of secondary growth in a tropical moist forest, (2) estimate LAI from spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and (3) link LAI to the estimation of other canopy physiognomic characteristics. We found that segregation of LAI measurements by successional stage (early, intermediate, late) contributed to a better definition of the relationship between LAI and the SVIs. In addition, we conclude that the propagation of errors of precision through the SVI formulas must be taken into consideration along with intra-site and radiometric variability when uncertainty terms are calculated. From a linear regression analysis, we found that there is only a minimal difference between the nonparametric Theil-Sen and classical least-squares regressions. We also found that not only does the Lorentzian cumulative transition function describe the relationship between LAI and the SVIs, it also provides an estimate of the range of LAI values to which each index is sensitive.

AB This paper demonstrates that multitemporal satellite SAR images are most suitable for monitoring the rapid changes of cultivation systems in a subtropical region. A new method is proposed by applying case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to the classification of SAR images. Stratified sampling is carried out to collect the cases so that the variations of backscatters within a class can be appropriately captured. The use of discrete cases can conveniently represent the internal changes of a class under complicated situations, such as spatial changes in soil conditions and terrain features. These spatial variations are difficult to represent by using rules or mathematical equations. The proposed method has better classification performance than supervised classification methods in the study area. The case library is reusable for time-independent classification when the SAR images are acquired at the same time of the crop growth cycles for different years. The proposed method has been tested in the Pearl River Delta in South China. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lianas are an important component of the biological diversity in two tropical forests with contrasting moisture regimes in Panama. However, their presence in a tree crown may be a source of confusion in remotely sensed data collected for inventories or assessment of vegetation health. The structural growth form of lianas contrasts with trees in that their proportion of leafy biomass to woody biomass is much higher. In effect, they use trees for structural support and typically form a monolayer of leaves above the crown of the supporting tree. Here, we investigated possible differences between hyperspectral signatures of lianas and trees at the leaf level using pattern recognition techniques. Our method involves principal components analysis followed by training and classification using a selection of supervised parametric and nonparametric classifiers. At a tropical dry forest site (Parque Natural Metropolitano), lianas and trees are distinguishable as groups based on their leaf spectral reflectance characteristics in dry season conditions. Classification was improved using ancillary data on leaf chlorophyll content. Their distinction at this site may be related to drought stress and/or phenological differences between the two groups. At a tropical wet forest site (Fort Sherman), discrimination between the two groups was not as clear. Additional research is required to determine the physiological basis of possible differences as well as to determine if these differences are observable at the canopy level. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB An extensive bio-optical data set from field measurements was used to evaluate the performance of standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color (in-water) algorithms in the Baltic Sea, which represents an example of optically complex Case 2 waters with high concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The data set includes coincident measurements of radiometric quantities, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), and absorption coefficient of CDOM, which were taken on 25 cruises between 1993 and 2001. The data cover a wide range of variability with Chl a in surface waters from about 0.3 to 100 mg m(-3). All the MODIS pigment algorithms examined as well as the SeaWiFS OC4v4 algorithm showed a systematic and large overestimation in chlorophyll retrievals. The mean systematic and random errors based on our entire data set exceeded 150% or even 200% in some cases, making these standard algorithms inadequate for pigment determinations in the Baltic. Although new parameterization of the standard pigment algorithms based on our field measurements in the Baltic resulted in a significant reduction of errors, the overall performance of such regionally tuned algorithms remained unsatisfactory. For example, the mean normalized bias (MNB) for the regionally tuned MODIS chlor_a_2 algorithm was reduced to 26% (from over 200% for the standard algorithm), but the root mean square (RMS) error was still large (>100%). The MODIS K_490 algorithm for estimating the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance showed the best performance among all the algorithms examined. With the new coefficients based on our field data, the regional version of this algorithm showed an acceptable level of errors, MNB = 4% and RMS = 30%. In addition to the apparent problems of the standard in-water bio-optical algorithms, we found that the atmospheric correction currently in use for MODIS and SeaWiFS imagery usually fails to retrieve upwelling radiances emerging from the Baltic Sea. The match-up comparisons of the coincident in situ and satellite determinations of normalized water-leaving radiances showed generally poor agreement, especially in the blue spectral region. It appears that new approaches for ocean color algorithms are required in the Baltic Sea. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical relationships between sea surface carbon dioxide fugacity (fCO(2)(sw)) and sea surface temperature (SST) were applied to datasets of remotely sensed SST to create fCO(2)(sw) fields in the Caribbean Sea. SST datasets from different sensors were used, as well as the SST fields created by optimum interpolation of bias corrected AVHRR data. Empirical relationships were derived using shipboard fCO(2)(sw) data, in situ SST data, and SST data from the remote sensing platforms. The results show that the application of a relationship based on shipboard SST data, on fields of remotely sensed SST yields biased fCO(2)(sw) values. This bias is reduced if the fCO(2)(sw)-SST relationships are derived using the same SST data that are used to create the SST fields. The fCO(2)(sw) fields found to best reproduce observed fCO(2)(sw) are used in combination with wind speed data from QuikSCAT to create weekly maps of the sea-air CO2 flux in the Caribbean Sea in 2002. The region to the SW of Cuba was a source Of CO2 to the atmosphere throughout 2002, and the region to the NE was a sink during winter and spring and a source during summer and fall. The net uptake of CO2 in the region was doubled when potential skin layer effects on fCO(2)(sw) were taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing data from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the first spaceborne imaging spectrometer, Hyperion, show hydrothermally altered rocks mainly composed of natroalunite, kaolinite, cristobalite, and gypsum on both the Mount Shasta and Shastina cones. Field observations indicate that much of the visible altered rock consists of talus material derived from fractured rock zones within and adjacent to dacitic domes and nearby lava flows. Digital elevation data were utilized to distinguish steeply sloping altered bedrock from more gently sloping talus materials. Volume modeling based on the imagery and digital elevation data indicate that Mount Shasta drainage systems contain moderate volumes of altered rock, a result that is consistent with Mount Shasta's Holocene record of mostly small to moderate debris flows. Similar modeling for selected areas at Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, Washington, indicates larger altered rock volumes consistent with the occurrence of much larger Holocene debris flows at those volcanoes. The availability of digital elevation and spectral data from spaceborne sensors, such as Hyperion and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER), greatly expands opportunities for studying potential debris flow source characteristics at stratovolcanoes around the world.

AB For simulated ocean conditions, we estimate the magnitude of the Doppler velocity contributions produced by unresolved surface waves that typical spaceborne synthetic aperture radars (SAR) would measure. The mechanism for generating Doppler velocities is the correlation between wave phase and radar cross section. The contributions analyzed include those of linear gravity waves, second-order wave-wave interactions, Bragg-wave scatterers and breaking waves. For gravity waves, we consider both wave tilt and hydrodynamic modulation transfer functions (MTFs). We find that for nominal sea conditions, the Doppler velocity is significant, on the order of 1 m/s, and exhibits large variation as a function of incidence angle and look with respect to the sea direction. The most important contributors are gravity waves and the Bragg scatterers, followed by sea spikes. Effects produced by second-order wave solutions are argued to be inconsequential.

AB Russian boreal forests contain around 25% of all global terrestrial carbon, some of which is released to the atmosphere when the forests burn. Whilst it is well known that fire is widespread in the boreal environment, there is a lack of good quality quantitative data on the extent of fire activity in Russian forests and on its interannual variation. This study provides one of the first comprehensive monthly satellite-based studies of fires occurring across the entire Russian Federation using a single, standardised methodology designed to map burned areas down to a size of 2 km(2). Using data from SPOT VEGETATION (VGT), we detect newly burned pixels via a series of multi-temporal spectral reflectance differencing criteria. For the year 2001, the method is applied to 21 VGT 10-day syntheses (S10) scenes covering the Russian fire season. We map 2764 fires with a total area of 41,782 km(2), and our methodology successfully detects all fires present in a comparison Landsat ETM+ data set, although it underestimates their size by on average of 18%. Using frequency-size relations, we estimate that 3790 fires of 1-2-km(2) area are likely to have remained unobserved by our method across the entire Russian region. Taking these corrections into account, we calculate the total burned area for the Russian Federation in 2001 as 51,546 km 2, with 38,512 km(2) occurring in forest and 13,034 km 2 in other land use classes. Fire activity is strongest in August in Eastern Siberia and the northern part of the Russian Far East, and in May and October in the southern part of the Russian Far East. Using these data, we estimate direct carbon emissions from these Russian forest fires to be 39.3-55.4 Mt, five to eight times that from the 2001 North American boreal forest fires and around 11-17% of that year's Russian industrial carbon emissions. This methodology will, in the future, be applied to the full VGT archive to quantify burned area and direct carbon emissions over a 5-year period in order to better assess the interannual variation in burned area and emissions and the relation to local climate.

AB We report remote detections of physically buried specularly reflecting objects using microwave radar at two sites: Ashalim and Tseelim in the northern region of the Negev Desert, Israel. These detections provide confirmation that microwave subsurface remote sensing is a genuine phenomenon. At Ashalim, a scatterometer operating in the P-band (441 MHz, 68 cm) was mounted on a cherry picker truck at a height of 8 m and used to detect two triangular aluminum mesh reflectors (forming a 1-m square area reflector) buried down to a depth of 8 cm in dry sand. At Tseelim, the same scatterometer was mounted on an airplane flying at an altitude of 70 m and used to detect 1-m square aluminum reflectors (each one submerged at a different location along the airplane flight path) buried down to a depth of 20 cm. The experimental results compare favorably with a theoretical model that incorporates radar absorption effects arising in the sandy subsurface layer and radar interference effects arising from phase differences between reflections from the surface and buried reflector. The theoretical modeling also predicts the detection of a subsurface reflector down to a depth of about 4.4 m. This experiment and the associated modeling approach is the first of a series of planned experiments, which we outline for the detection and the theoretical evaluation of buried reflectors using remote microwave and VHF radar. We identify potential subject areas for environmental research. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) contains valuable information on canopy physiognomy for desert grassland and grass-shrub transition communities. This information maybe accessed by inverting a BRDF model against sets of observations, which encompass important variations in viewing and illumination angles. This paper shows that structural canopy attributes can be derived through inversion of the Simple Geometric Model (SGM) of the BRDF developed in this paper. It is difficult to sample BRDF features from the ground because of the discontinuous nature of the canopies and long intrinsic length scales in remotely sensed spectral measures (>10 m). A multispectral digital camera was therefore used to derive spatial multiangular reflectance data sets from the air and the SGM was validated against and inverted with these. It was also validated using 3-D radiosity simulations driven with maps of field-measured plant dimensions. The interpretation of the retrieved parameter maps (shrub density, shrub width and canopy height) reveals variations in canopy structure within desert grassland and grassland-shrubland transition communities, which are clearly related to structural and optical features in high resolution panchromatic and vegetation index images. To our knowledge, this paper reports on the first attempts to acquire structural canopy attributes of desert landscapes using multiple view angle data at scales less than 1 km. The results point to further opportunities to exploit multiangular data from spacebome sensors such as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) on the NASA Terra and European Space Agency's PROBA satellites, respectively.

AB Siberia's boreal forests represent an economically and ecologically precious resource, a significant part of which is not monitored on a regular basis. Synthetic aperture radars (SARs), with their sensitivity to forest biomass, offer mapping capabilities that could provide valuable up-to-date information, for example about fire damage or logging activity. The European Commission SIBERIA project had the aim of mapping an area of approximately 1 million km(2) in Siberia using SAR data from two satellite sources: the tandem mission of the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS-1/2 and the Japanese Earth Resource Satellite JERS-1. Mosaics of ERS tandem interferometric coherence and JERS backscattering coefficient show the wealth of information contained in these data but they also show large differences in radar response between neighbouring images. To create one homogeneous forest map, adaptive methods which are able to account for brightness changes due to environmental effects were required. In this paper an adaptive empirical model to determine growing stock volume classes using the ERS tandem coherence and the JERS backscatter data is described. For growing stock volume classes up to 80 m(3)/ha, accuracies of over 80% are achieved for over a hundred ERS frames at a spatial resolution of 50 m. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID ACCURACY
AB An assessment of four different remote sensing based methods for deriving digital elevation models (DEMs) was conducted in a flood-prone watershed in North Carolina. New airborne LIDAR (light detecting and ranging) and IFSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR)) data were collected and corresponding DEMs created. These new sources were compared to two methods: Gestalt Photomapper (GPM) and contour-to-grid, used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for creating DEMs. Survey-grade points (1470) for five different land cover classes were used as reference points. One unique aspect of this study was the LIDAR and IFSAR data were collected during leaf-on conditions. Analyses of absolute elevation accuracy and terrain slope were conducted. The LIDAR- and contour-to-grid derived DEMs exhibited the highest overall absolute elevation accuracies. Elevation accuracy was found to vary with land cover categories. Elevation accuracy also decreased with increasing slopes-but only for the scrub/shrub land cover category. Appreciable terrain slope errors for the reference points were found with all methods.

AB In this paper, we address some fundamental issues regarding the strategy of inversion of the class of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models known as kernel-based. We examine two main causes of uncertainty affecting the predicted reflectance values. They are a contribution of the random noise term in the measurements and the model residual after adjustment. For this purpose, we formulate notions of both the experimental design for angular sampling and the kernel response function for an arbitrary set of angular measurements. The Fisher informative matrix is considered to circumscribe the optimal design problem to search for the best angular sampling. Two approaches are presented and discussed: one relates to the random noise term of the BRDF model and is independent on the land cover type (LCT); the other is impacted by the residual term of the BRDF model and is determined by the reflectance peculiarities of the different LCTs. Additionally, we explore the residual terms as a function of the LCT and we analyze the sensitivity of the reflectance predicted by the various BRDF models to the kernel response function. This is achieved by segregating regions of the angular domain that are most responsive to the measurement noise. We further determined the optimal angular sampling distribution for ground-based multi-angular data sets over different LCT and known residual terms. Then, we extend it to the more general case, ignoring the residual term. It is shown that the functions that are associated with the chosen criteria saturate after the selection of five or six observing geometries. These inversion experiments in BRDF modeling confirm the efficiency of certain angular data sets as a solution to the optimal design problem in relation to the negative influence of the redundancy effect of observations. This effect arises from having an excessive number of angular measurements in relation to the number of retrieved parameters. Another manner to prove the optimal design validity is by statistical diagnosis. We carried out a diagnosis study based on the residual standard deviation, the Fisher and R-square statistics. A fast convergence rate is observed with angular measurements determined by the optimal design. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An algorithm based on the physics of radiative transfer in vegetation canopies for the retrieval of vegetation green leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) from surface reflectances was developed and implemented for operational processing prior to the launch of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the TERRA platform in December of 1999. The performance of the algorithm has been extensively tested in prototyping activities prior to operational production. Considerable attention was paid to characterizing the quality of the product and this information is available to the users as quality assessment (QA) accompanying the product. The MODIS LAI/FPAR product has been operationally produced from day one of science data processing from MODIS and is available free of charge to the users from the Earth Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center. Current and planned validation activities are aimed at evaluating the product at several field sites representative of the six structural biomes. Example results illustrating the physics and performance of the algorithm are presented together with initial QA and validation results. Potential users of the product are advised of the provisional nature of the product in view of changes to calibration, geolocation, cloud screening, atmospheric correction and ongoing validation activities.

ID REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; VEGETATION
AB Reflectance spectra of rock encrusting lichens were acquired to determine the influence that this vegetation type may have on the reflectance properties of rock exposures located in high latitude and subarctic environments. The samples investigated consist of crustose and foliose lichen species collected from exposures of the Gog quartzite formation in Alberta, Canada. Lichen transmittance was estimated to be <3% throughout the 350-2500-mn spectral region, using spectra measured from the foliose lichen, Umbilicaria torrefacta, as a representative sample of a broader class of lichens. These findings suggest that lichen prevents the transmission of light to the underlying rock substrate. Therefore, the subpixel influence of lichen and rock within a scene can be considered linearly weighted. Discrimination of lichen species is made possible using ratios of reflectance at 400/685 and 773/685 nm. An index using the band ratios 2132/2198 and 2232/ 2198 nm shows the similarity of lichen spectra in the infrared and a distinguishing feature between rocks with OH bearing minerals and lichen. Thus, spectral unmixing of rock and crustose/foliose lichens may be successfully accomplished using a single lichen end-member for this spectral range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI Radiometric normalization of multitemporal high-resolution satellite

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID MOSAICS
AB The radiometric normalization of multitemporal satellite optical images of the same terrain is often necessary for land cover change detection, e.g., relative differences. In previous studies, ground reference data or pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) were used in the radiometric rectification of multitemporal images. Ground reference data are costly and difficult to acquire for most satellite remotely sensed images and the selection of PIFs is generally subjective. In addition, previous research has been focused on radiometric normalization of two images acquired on different dates. The problem of conservation of radiometric resolution in the case of radiometric normalization between more than two images has not been addressed. This article reports on a new procedure for radiometric normalization between multitemporal images of the same area. The selection of PIFs is done statistically. With quality control, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find linear relationships between multitemporal images of the same area. The satellite images are normalized radiometrically to a common scale tied to the reference radiometric levels, The procedure ensures the conservation of radiometric resolution for the multitemporal images involved. The new procedure is applied to three Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from three different years (August 1986, 1987, and 199 1) and of the same area. Quality control measures show that the error in radiometric consistency between the multitemporal images is reduced effectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated using the radiometrically normalized multitemporal imagery and assessed in the context of land cover change analysis.

AB Much attention has been given to hyperspectral remote sensing of benthic habitat recently to quantity spectral signatures, examine linear mixing, map geomorphic zonation, or identify temporal change with varying degrees of confidence and success. Relatively less attention has been given to the effects of the water column on the hyperspectral signal given various water depths and bottom types. Hyperspectral in situ reflectance was measured at both the top and bottom of the water column to examine the effects of the intervening water layer. A radiative transfer model was used to predict the top-of-the-water column reflectance from a large number of close-range measured bottom spectra. The measured and modeled hyperspectral reflectance spectra were examined separately to compare the degree to which different substrate types can be discriminated once the water column is "added" to the spectra. The classification accuracy assessment indicated that the ability to discriminate benthic habitat based on hyperspectral characteristics is limited when the effects of the water column are included as the kappa statistic drops from 0.70 to 0.49.

AB Since neural networks have been widely applied to the nonlinear transfer function approximation, we present an empirical neural network algorithm to estimate major parameters in surface waters from combined optical data and microwave data in the Gulf of Finland. Concurrent in situ surface water quality measurements, optical (Landsat TM) data and microwave (ERS-2 SAR) data were obtained in selected locations in August 1997. The TM and ERS-2 SAR data from locations of water samples were extracted and digital data were examined in numerous transformations. Although significant correlations were observed between digital data and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), turbidity (Turb), and Secchi disk depth (SDD), application of neural networks appears to yield a superior performance in modeling transfer functions in this study area. Here, an empirical neural network algorithm is applied to estimate the transfer functions between the major characteristics of surface waters and the satellite optical and microwave data. The results show that the estimation accuracy for major characteristics of surface waters using the neural network is much better than those from regression analysis. The results also indicate that microwave data can assist to improve the estimation of these characteristics. Therefore, it may be possible to develop surface water quality algorithms in which microwave data are used as supplementary data to optical observations. However, this improvement of optical data retrieval algorithm is limited in this case study. The technique still needs to be refined in detail in order to detect differences within the typical range of these water quality parameters found in the area under study.

AB The documentation of the zonal pattern of global wind system can be traced back to centuries ago. The prevailing descriptions in most oceanography books, however, have been of little change during the past decades. The present work represents a new effort to update our knowledge on this issue using the newly available multi-year TOPEX altimeter data. As a result, the positions and intensities of major zonal features of the marine wind system are reexamined and more precisely defined. The seasonal, annual, and interannual variabilities of these features in terms of both amplitude and phase are analyzed in detail. Uncertainties associated with the estimated intensity and the peak/trough positions of the zonal wind belts are discussed. Meanwhile. a possible connection between the meridional shift of the Pacific doldrums and the occurrence of an El Ni (n) over tildeo event is observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The effect of vertical accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) on hydrologic prediction accuracy was evaluated by comparing three DEMs and associated stream-flow simulations for the 7.2 km(2) USDA-ARS watershed at Mahantango Creek, PA. The DEMs were the standard 30 m USG 7.5' DEM, a 5 m product derived from low altitude aerial photography, and a 30 m product derived from interferometric processing of Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C). Statistical analysis of the DEMs showed that the USGS DEM had the typical stipling errors resulting from processing of the source digital contour maps, and a vertical error structure related to the topographic attributes of the watershed. The SIR-C DEM had a vertical offset of about 50 m from the high resolution and USGS DEMs, as well as error features that were somewhat related to topographic features. Inaccuracies in both the USGS and SIR-C DEMs were apparent in the drainage network, as well as in spatial images of elevation, slope, and contributing area. Comparisons of runoff predicted using a hydrologic model based on the three DEMs showed that mean annual predicted runoff volumes were 0.3% and 7.0% larger for the USGS and SIR-C DEMs, respectively, as compared to the reference DEM. Much larger differences were apparent in individual hydrographs; and the USGS and SIR-C DEMs predicted lower peaks, and higher base flows, than did the reference. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Changes in vegetation distribution and condition commonly occur in arid ecosystems clue to land use and climate variability. Most arid land remote sensing efforts have focused on detecting vegetation change using spectral: indices, such as the normalized vegetation index, with limited success. Less attention has focused on using the continuous shortwave spectrum (0.4 mu m to 2.5 mu m) for studying vegetation in arid environments. Using field measurements and a photon transport model, we quantified the absolute and relative importance of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive pixel-level shortwave reflectance variation along a land-cover gradient in the Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico. Green foliage, wood standing litter, and bare soil had distinctive spectral properties, often via specific, narrow absorption features and through overall differences in the shape of their shortwave spect ra. While the amount of each plant material varied significantly along the land-cover gradient, foliar optical properties remained relatively stable, supporting the hypothesis that resource variation (e.g., water and nutrients) is more strongly resolved at the scale of whole plant canopies (e.g., via allocation and production) than at the leaf level. Significant variation in vegetation type and condition along the gradient resulted in only subtle changes in pixel-level reflectance variability, which could be determined in, high spectral resolution Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data. Most important, the relative impact of tissue, canopy and landscape factors on pixel-level reflectance shifted with plant composition and phenology. Mie compared the ability to resolve these vegetation and soil factors using Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, and Landsat Thematic Mapper optical channels and found that feu; factors could be accounted for unless most of the spectral range was adequately sampled.

AB One of the main wetland areas for migratory bird breeding in Mexico is Laguna Madre, at State of Tamaulipas. If is imperative to have an adequate mapping of these ecosystems for management and protection. The objective of this work is to determine the most effective spatial filter treatment applied to a two-angle RADARSAT data set to reduce speckle effects and improve marsh classification performance of Tamaulipas wetlands. Eighteen spatial filter treatments were applied to the data based on four al,algorithms: Maximum a Posteriori, Lee-Sigma, Local Region, and Median. A supervised classification was applied to the filtered images with five resulting general classes. Overall classification performances were compared to determine statistical differences between filter treatments. An edge/boundary retention analysis and a visual assessment study Ic ere also applied to the data. It was determined that the Lee-Sigma algorithm with three iterations and square window sizes of three, five, and seven pixels, respectively, produced the best overall results with the 8-m pixel RADARSAT data.

AB ERS INSAR data have proved to be of interest for forest applications. The interferometric coherence was found to be related to various land uses and forest types, while in some special cases (e.g., flat terrain) the interferometric phase has been linked to the forest height. This paper reports an investigation on the information content oft he interferometric coherence over a hilly terrain supporting various land use types and large pine plantations. The approach includes the rise of a Geographic Information System and multitemporal data to analyze the coherence behavior as a function of forest-type forest parameters and environmental factors such as meteorological and topographic effects. Coherence appears to be efficient to discriminate between forest types. However, topography and environmental conditions strongly affect the coherence and its estimation, pointing out the need for rejection of strong slopes areas (>15 degrees) and the sensitivity to local meteorological/seasonal effects. Based on these observations, forest classification results are presented. Forest/nonforest discrimination is very efficient (accuracy >90%) using one-clay interval acquisition. More detailed classification with discrimination between forest themes gives also good results. Then, we investigate the indirect link between coherence and forest parameters. The coherence is sensitive to the forest growth stage, making forest parameter retrieval possible using a simple straight-line model. Finally, the importance of wind upon temporal decorrelation is addressed and a semiempirical correction is proposed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Imaging spectroscopy from space is a potentially powerful tool for assessing vegetation chemistry with approaches that rely either on empirical relationships or on the inversion of reflectance models. However, this assessment can be erroneous if the 3-D spatial distribution of the vegetation is neglected. Sophisticated radiative transfer models are often required to account for the 3-D canopy architecture. Due to long computation times, however, these models are not well adapted to sensitivity analyses and numerical inversions that require hundred of calls of the merit function. This paper presents a methodology developed to stimulate vegetation reflectance spectra quickly and accurately (i.e., without neglecting the 3-D canopy architecture). Canopy reflectance spectra are calculated by linearly interpolating spectra pre-computed with a coupled model: a 3-D canopy model (DART) and a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT). This approach was successfully tested by studying the influence of forest architecture on the determination of leaf chlorophyll concentration was characterized by the position of the inflection point of the red edge (lambda(1)). Apart from Chl(f), we considered four other influential factors on lambda(1): the LAI (leaf area index), the viewing direction, the understory reflectance, and the canopy architecture (i.e., a theoretical turbid medium, a pole stand, and a mature stand). Results demonstrated the strong influence of canopy architecture. For example, the lambda(1) has larger values for mature stands for pole stands (delta lambda(1)>10 nm), whatever the LAI and the viewing directions. Thus, errors on Chl(f) can be larger than 23 mu g/cm(2) if canopy architecture is neglected. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This article presents the findings of a laboratory experiment using stacks of leaves obtained from four species of deciduous tree at various stages of senescence. This methodology generated a wide variation in pigment concentrations (per unit leaf area and per unit ground area) and leaf area index, as may be expected at the plant canopy scale, and provided independent variation between the chlorophylls and carotenoids and leaf area index. Spectral reflectance was measured for each leaf increment of each stack using a spectroradiometer and these data were used to evaluate the nature and strength of relationships between a number of existing and novel spectral transformations and the concentrations of pigments (per unit ground area) within the leaf stacks. Reflectance in narrow wavebands within the visible region was moderately related to chlorophyll concentrations, while ratio indices, employing wavebands in the near-infrared and visible, particularly the green, were more successful. While the wavelength position of the red edge was related to chlorophyll concentration, characteristics of the amplitude of the first and second derivatives of reflectance and pseudo absorbance were more strongly correlated with chlorophyll. No transformation of spectral reflectance that was tested was strongly related to the concentration of carotenoids but two ratio indices were highly correlated with the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll a. Interestingly, leaf area index (LAI) was unrelated to all spectral ratio indices including the broad-band normalized-difference and the simple ratio vegetation indices. This indicates that spectral indices may have limited applicability for estimating the LAI of vegetation canopies when the leaves that comprise these canopies have differing chlorophyll concentrations (per unit leaf area).

AB Blue-green fluorescence and the red/far-red chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence emission spectra of green tobacco leaves and of aurea leaves in different stages of senescence were measured using excitation at 355 nm in order to test the suitability of the fluorescence ratios green/red and green/far-red together with other ratios as stress and pigment indicators. Young yellowish-green leaves of the aurea mutant tobacco showed a much higher blue-green fluorescence emission and lower chlorophyll fluorescence as compared to the green wild type tobacco. As a consequence, the fluorescence intensity ratios blue/green (F440/F520), blue/red (F440/F690), blue/far-red (F440/F740), green/far-red (F520/F690) and green/far-red (F520/F740), as determined from the measured fluorescence emission spectra of he adaxial and abaxial leaf sides, were quite different for both leaf types and were functions of the content of chlorophylls and carotenoids. As chlorophyll levels decreased in senescing leaves of the aurea tobacco plant, the Chl db ratio remained high at 3.3 to 4.0, while the ratio of chlorophylls to carotenoids declined slightly. In cont-ast, the Chl fluorescence ratios (R-fd 690-values, F-v/F-m and F-v/F-0) as physiological indicators continuously declined indicating a successive loss of photosynthetic activity. Values of the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F690/F740 for adaxial and abaxial leaf-sides increased with yellowing, whereas F440/F520 tended to decrease with the senescence-induced decline in Chi content. F440/F690 and F520/F690 were found to increase after an initial decrease, with leaf age and senescence The same trend was found for F440/F740 and F520/F740, which exhibited maximum sensitivity with respect to Chl breakdown. Whereas the F690/F740 ratio for ab-axial versus adaxial leaf surfaces correlated linearly, with the abaxial leaf-side values always being higher than the adaxial leaf-side, values for both sides corresponded in a curvilinear fashion with leaf Chl content. Changes during early stages of leaf development were seen not only in the most commonly used red/far-red ratio, F690/F740, but to some extent also in F440/F520. The results indicate that changes in photosynthetic activity due to senescence and Chl breakdown can easily be detected and qualified via fluorescence ratios that are based on the UV-A excited fluorescence bands F440, F520, F690 anf F740. These ratios provide a solid basis for the laser-induced remote sensing of the state of health and chi content of vegetation The fluorescence ratios green/red and green/far-red were found to be very suitable complementary indicators of early stress events in plants.

AB This article investigates the effects of bark soil contamination and nitrogen application on the red edge-chlorophyll concentration relationship for a vegetation canopy. Field based canopy reflectance and chlorophyll concentration data were collected at a grassland field site affected by soil contamination and a winter wheat field; site affected by different levels of nitrogen fertilisation. The correlation between;een red edge position (REP) and canopy chlorophyll concentration tc;as r=0.84 and 0.80 for the grassland and winter;inter wheat; field sites, respectively. Ai rborne imaging spectrometry tc;ns used to generate REP images (units, nm) of the grassland and winter wheat;heat field sites. Strong correlations were;ere observed between REP and canopy chlorophyll concentration at both field sites. Predictive regression equations were developed to map canopy chlorophyll concentration across the field sites. The mts error of estimated chlorophyll concentration. was 0.42 ing g(-1) (+/-12.69% of mean) and 2.09 mg g(-1)(16.4% of mean) at the grassland and winter; wheat field sites respectively. Results demonstrated the use of remotely sensed estimates of the REP from both field and airborne spectrometers for estimating chlorophyll concentration and indicated the potential of this technique for inferring both land contamination and grain yield.

AB The aim is to investigate how well hold Landsat data can be calibrated and utilized for monitoring past changes in forest cover status. The material consists of three MSS images and a TM image covering a period of 19 years. The classes of interest were 1) no change, 2) deforestation, and 3) reforestation. Various relative calibration methods are first compared and their effects on the results of interpreting the "change image" are then studied. As it is sometimes impossible to locate unchanged areas for calibration, the use of both unchanged and changed training areas for calibration purposes is tested here. The change detection method is fixed to parametric supervised change image classification. The longest time difference between image pairs was 19 years and R-2 with a time span of this order was around 40%. R-2 for the models increased about 10% when time span was reduced from 11 years to 3 years. Smoothing methods can predict band-by-band regression very well, and R-2 values are 10-15% higher than with the robust regression technique used. RMSE was slightly larger when multiple band models were used than with smoothing methods. When general calibration models were applied to unchanged data, the differences between the calibration errors were not statistically significant. Thus it was satisfactory to use an entire target area for image calibration and include changed areas in the training data for calibration models. Models created from multiple occasions did not perform well in classification. A fair agreement with estimates and the ground truth was possible using four images. The best result was obtained when using three image pairs and multiple band robust regression calibration. Classification with calibration was only slightly better than without calibration, the difference not being statistically significant. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

TI Crop reflectance estimate errors from the SAIL model due to spatial and

ID SCATTERING
AB Radiative transfer models must be combined with crop growth model for the latter to be recalibrated on each point of a regional domain using remote sensing data. However, radiative transfer model have parameters depending on vegetation and soil characteristics which vary spatially and temporally at a regional scale, but are gene:ally unknown;. Their estimaition leads to reflectance simulation errors. These errors are analyzed in this article for the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum using the SAIL model for sugar beets. Two ways for estimating SAIL parameters were compared: One does not require any knowledge of magnitude and variability. The other one is based on rules developed from parameter distribution analysis and extra knowledge on soils and climate. The reflectance estimation error was very high for LAI<2.0 when no previous knowledge was assumed. Defining parameter values from soil, climate, and crop development knowledge considerably reduced errors and would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. The use of vegetation indices reduced the effects of parameter value uncertainty, but still benefited from improved parameter estimation. It was found that simple classification of crop and notably soil parameter values would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. Future work will deal with quantifying consequences when reflectance models are coupled to crop growth models for regional yield estimation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB By definition, the color of an object such a soil is highly dependent on its reflectance properties in the visible spectrum. In this study, the relationships between soil color and simulated reflectance values for the Landsat TM and SPOT HRV satellites are examined from a laboratory standpoint. Visible reflectance spectra were acquired for 124 soil samples originated from an arid environment, and selected radiometric indices were worked out for both sensors. All the earlier studies relative to soil color and remote sensing have considered the widely known Munsell method as a reference for soil color quantification. Some characteristics of this system based on a visual comparison of a soil sample with painted color chips may complicate the establishment of simple relationships be between reflectance data and soil color. We have applied the CIE 1931 standard method of color measurement which consists in computing color parameters directly from reflectance spectra using colorimetric equations. Color data are expressed according to two polar coordinates called Helmholtz coordinates (dominant wavelength and purity of excitation) and a luminance variable having a similar meaning to the Munsell hue, chroma, and value, respec tively. The Munsell system is also employed to estimate soil color. Linens regression analysis between soil color and radiometric indices show a systematic improvement of correlations (r) from about 0.7 to more than 0.9 using Munsell data and Helmoltz data, respectively. Simple radiometric indices (band combinations) calculated from broad blue, green, and red bands are found to be good predictors of each of the soil color components. The increasing availability of spectroradiometers, including in the field, should stimulate the use of Helmholtz coordinates, as a beneficial alternative to the Munsell chart to obtain a precise and reproducible color quantification which may be useful for remote sensing applications. The radiometric indices utilized in this study are potentially helpful to contribute to soil resource and soil degradation cartography using visible satellite data in vast arid regions where soil data are not readily available.

AB We present computerized recognition of relief patterns on an airborne SAR image, band X (3.2 cm), using a syntax analysis. The test-site is the Montagne Sainte-Victoire (Provence, France). The pixel size is 2mx2m. Severe filtering to eliminate the speckle has reduced ground resolution, but geologic and geomorphologic objects to extract-thalwegs, structural escarpments, lithologic boundaries, and landslides-have large dimensions (tens of meters). Far-range correction was necessary to compensate weakening of radar signal with aircraft distance. Significant retrodiffusion values are for horizontal surfaces, projected shadows, surfaces whose normal is subperpendicular to radar beam, steep radiometric gradients. Elements of the topographic profiles have been correlated with the elementary signals of radar image, permitting a codification for syntactic analysis. The radar image has been transformed into an image of elementary topographic symbols, from which crests and thalwegs can be directly extracted. Recognition of structural escarpments and landslides involves search for typical sequences of symbols in different profile orientations, and determination of a specific grammar (syntax). Assessment of the results was made by comparison with similar syntactic methods of pattern recognition applied to a digital elevation model of the same area, and field knowledge. The radar image classifications have produced results close to reality. Imperfections are mainly due to the filtering process, radar distance correction, and difficulty in measuring significant retrodiffusion values, for example, retrodiffusion of horizontal surfaces. Artifacts inherent to radar acquisition also introduced confusions. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1988.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB A knowledge of the potential volume of water present in snowpacks is vital for estimates of the global water balance. It is estimated that about three quarters of the world's terrestrial water reserves are locked in snow and ice. The principal objective of this study is to analyze the degree to which passive microwave radiation can be used to interpret snow water equivalent (SWE). The methodology reflects the importance of isolating phenomena other than SWE that may influence the microwave signal. These factors include: snow wetness, depth hoar, complex mountainous terrain, and dense forest cover. Applying these four variables, 16 land-cover categories were identified, and relationships between SWE and brightness temperature were derived for each category. Results show that, for the "simplest" of these categories, a nonforested, nonmountainous terrain, with no depth hoar or melting snow, the SWE can be estimated with 95% confidence within +/-44 mm. The confidence limits increase as the complexity of the snowpack, land form, and land cover increases. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID RADAR
AB This study describes the development of a semiempirical model for the retrieval of above-ground biomass density of regenerating tropical forest using JERS-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The magnitude and variability of the response of the L-band SAR to above-ground biomass density was quantified using field data collected at Tapajos in central Amazonia and imagery from a series of dates. A simple backscatter model was fitted to this response and validated using image and field data acquired independently at Manaus, 500 km to the west of Tapajos. The sources of variability in biomass density and SAR back-scatter were investigated so as to determine confidence limits for the subsequent retrieval of biomass density using the model. This analysis suggested that only three broad classes of regenerating forest biomass density may be positively distinguished. While the backscatter appears to saturate at around 60 tonnes per hectare, the biomass limit for retrieval purposes which is tolerant to both speckle and image texture is only 31 tonnes per hectare. The spatial distribution of biomass density in central Amazonia was estimated by applying the model to a mosaic of 90 JERS-1 images. A favorable comparison of this distribution to a map of regeneration derived from NOAA AVHRR imagery suggested that L-band SAR will provide a useful method of monitoring tropical forests on a regional scale.

TI A technique for monitoring ecological disturbance in tallgrass prairie
   using seasonal NDVI trajectories and a discriminant function mixture
   model
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural and anthropogenic disturbance in tallgrass prairie communities can induce changes in plant species composition, including shifts in the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 lifeforms. The asynchronous seasonality in greenness exhibited by C-3 and C-4 species enables monitoring of their relative abundance using temporal trajectories of sensor-derived vegetation indices, such as NDVI. We else close-range measurements made over 22 experimental plots at the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) to evaluate seasonal trajectories in NDVI as a function of C-3/C-4 ratio. The NDVI data were collected from each plot at approximately 10-day intervals throughout the 1995 growing season. Metrics for summarizing the temporal behavior of NDVI trajectories were derived from two transformations of the data: 1) a conventional approach plotting NDVI against day of year and 2) an alternative approach plotting normalized cumulative integrated NDVI against growing degree clay. Discriminant function mixture models derived from each set of metrics were used together with species composition data from the experimental plots to derive relative C-3/C-4 abundances. Results show that both methods can classify the majority of cases into their correct C-3/C-4 abundance category; however, the transformation using normalized integrated NDVI against growing degree day was a significantly better discriminator (p=0.0102). The techniques presented are effective for monitoring relative C-3/C-4 abundance in tallgrass prairie; however, more investigation is needed to assess their performance at different spatial resolutions and in different geographic setting.

AB This paper focuses on the estimation and analysis of surface thermal parameters (emissivities and surface temperatures) in a nordic environment (Quebec, Canada). The land cover in this region varies from boreal forest in the south to tundra in the north. The thermal parameters are estimated from two variants of a new model that combines the radiances of the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral band [advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) channel 3: 3.55-3.93 mu m] and the thermal bands (AVHRR channel 4: 10.5-11.5 mu m; and AVHRR channel 5: 11.5-12.5 mu m). The study, carried out for images acquired on different dates, reveals that, in most situations, the two approaches allow the separation of emissivities and surface temperatures. Analysis of the variations of the estimated emissivities in relation to surface patterns shows that they are slightly variable in spectral bands 4, and 5, with values generally greater than 0.95. Variations are more important in the SWIR channel, where values less than 0.90 appear, especially in urban areas. In general, surface emissivities increase with the density of the vegetation cover. Moreover, for densely vegetated areas, SWIR surface reflectivities, which can be derived from emissivities, appear to be well correlated with the reflectivities of the AVHRR visible channel. As with emissivities, variations of the estimated land surface temperatures (LST) in relation to vegetation density, characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were considered. The relations between the two parameters (LST and NDVI) show essentially two opposite directions of linear variations (positive and negative correlations). In the light of the main results obtained the synergistic use of the different spectral regions (visible, near mid-, and thermal infrareds) could be very useful in the parameterization of boreal ecosystems.

AB We are interested in aerosol mass loading estimation from optical thickness measurements. Therefore, the goal is to determine the correlation between the mass loading M and the aerosol extinction tau(a)(lambda) at a given wavelength and the improvement resulting from the use of the spectral dependence. Methods using the simple ratio M/tau(a) = cte are obviously dependent on the aerosol size distribution model and show a strong dependence on the aerosol size distribution parameters. Ground-based sun photometer measurements under variable atmospheric conditions were taken during two campaigns in April and May in both 1986 and 1967 at M'bour (80 km south of Dakar, Senegal) and are used to derive the desert aerosol columnar size distribution by a nonlinear least squares fitting ''inversion'' technique, using the lognormal function (the Junge function was used in his study only as an academic reference), the mass loading, and hence the M-tau(a) relation. Our results are also compared with those given by current desert aerosol models. Several M-tau(a) relations are proposed to estimate desert aerosol mass content with an accuracy greater than the simple ratio approach. The differences of these estimates of M are between +/-8% and +/-15%, as deduced from our experimental data, when the simple ratio method reaches uncertainty tip to +/-40%. (C) Elsevier Science Inc.

AB In 1994, the Spaceborne Imaging Radar experiment C (SIR-C) acquired five data takes with different acquisition parameters over the Virunga volcanic chain, Zaire. Changes in incidence angle (20.0-48.1 degrees), look direction (west- and east-looking), and pulse bandwidth (10 MHz, 20 MHz, and 40 MHz) affect the geologic interpretations drawn from these data. We examine differences in spatial distortion of features near the summit of Nyiragongo volcano, finding that opposite look direction data are helpful in interpreting volcanic features, such as the shape of small craters, in areas of high relief The relative brightness of lava flows and vegetation change (and actually reverse) for different wavelengths and polarizations. Although L-band data are best for mapping the outline of the flows, C- and X-band cross-polarization data show differences in backscatter intensity between and within flows. In addition, our ability to discriminate lava flows and vents from surrounding vegetation is strongly influenced by pulse bandwidth (resolution) and angle of incidence. Pulse bandwidth is the most important parameter in mapping small topographic features such as volcanic cones and a set of particularly thick flows on the flanks of Karisimbi volcano. These examples illustrate important considerations of the tradeoffs and priorities in acquisition parameters for future missions such as ENVISAT, as well ns potential pitfalls for interpretation of existing data.

AB The potential of remote sensing to aid in the forecast of insect defoliation and the associated impact on forest stands was tested by examining the relationships between i) preoutbreak forest structure and growth characteristics, ii) multispectral values recorded by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor, and iii) subsequent patterns of defoliation and volume loss in the balsam for (Abies balsamea L. Mill) forests of Western Newfoundland. Forest structure and growth characteristics were measured in the field in 1992-1993 and reconstructed to represent conditions 3 years prior to an infestation of black-headed budworm, Acleris variana (Fern.), which began in 1988. Preoutbreak Landsat TM data were acquired on 8 August 1985. Spectral values were converted to approximate reflectances using PCI atmospheric correction routines and related to the field measurements. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models for predicting forest susceptibility (probability of attack) and vulnerability (response to attack) and to assess the accuracy of the susceptibility and vulnerability forecasts. In general, susceptible stands were younger and had lower basal area and tree density, but higher leaf area index than stands that were not attacked. Vulnerable stands were older, had lower vigor and growth efficiency indices (stemwood growth per unit of leaf area), and also displayed the highest near infrared spectral values. The best predictions combined selected spectral measurements with provincial forest inventory data. These models produced classifications with accuracies of 81%, 67%, and 78% for predicting susceptibility and pre- and postoutbreak vulnerability, respectively. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997

AB A three-dimensional reflection model has been developed for calculating the reflection functions of inhomogeneous and orographically structured natural land surfaces. The site of an area whose reflection properties are to be modeled can be freely chosen; the task is limited, however, by its allocated CPU time. The surface structure of such an area is taken from a digital terrain model. The known anisotropic reflection properties of various flat surface types, for example, coniferous forest, hardwood forest, grassland, and agricultural cover types, are taken into account. The effects of multiple reflection in the subscale orographic structure of an area are calculated up to the second order of reflection. For the test sites, a typical difference of 25% in the reflection factors of a vertically structured surface and a corresponding flat surface was found, with the higher values for a flat surface. The model is validated by comparing simulated radiances with measured radiances in the solar channels of the AVHRR onboard NOAA-11 and NOAA-12 for several test sites in the German alpine region. The simulated radiances are calculated with an angular-dependent radiative transfer model with the modeled reflection functions as the lower boundary layer of the coupled Earth-atmosphere system. The results show good agreement between measured and simulated satellite data, especially in Channel 2, if the vertical structure of the surface is considered. A statistically significant influence of the orographic structure was found in the simulated radiances as compared with radiances calculated for a corresponding flat surface with the same cover types. It is concluded that the developed reflection model is able to simulate correctly the anisotropic reflection properties of vertically structured natural landscape as it can be found in mountainous terrain terrain.

TI Potential of simultaneous dual-frequency radar altimeter measurements

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID SATELLITE
AB TOPEX/Poseidon - a joint U.S. (NASA) and French (CNES) mission called Ocean Topography Experiment-carries onboard a dual frequency (5.3 GHz and 13.6 GHz) radar altimeter providing simultaneous measurements of radar backscatter coefficient over the global oceans since August 1992. In the present work, Lee have used the concept of differential attenuation of the radar signal due to rain at two widely separated frequencies to estimate rainfall. Simultaneously available passive microwave radiometric measurements from TOPEX/Poseidon itself have also been used to delineate and quantify rain over oceanic regions surrounding India. Based on a reasonably good correlation between rainfall inferred from radiometric measurements and the difference delta sigma degrees between radar backscatter coefficients at 5 GHz and 13 GHz, significant rain events are isolated during the course of the 1993 South-West (SW) monsoon season over the Indian region. Monthly maps of these rain events from altimeter based analysis clearly bring out the nature of rainfall activity associated with SUI monsoon. The results from delta sigma degrees also compare very well with the operational quantitative precipitation estimates available from INSAT-VHRR analyses. The advantages and limitations of radar altimeter data are discussed in terms of those of the other current and future rain measurement systems. Synergistic application of the present technique with visible / IR and microwave techniques hold promise for more precise rainfall measurements from space.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SPECTROSCOPY; CHEMISTRY
AB This study examined the use of stepwise multiple linear regression to quantify leaf carbon, nitrogen, lignin, cellulose, lose, dry weight, and water compositions from leaf level reflectance (R). Two fresh leaf and one dry leaf datasets containing a broad range of native and cultivated plant species were examined using unconstrained stepwise multiple linear regression and constrained regression with wavelengths reported from other leaf level studies and wavelengths derived from chemical spectroscopy. Although stepwise multiple linear regression explained large amounts of the variation in the chemical data, the bands selected were not related to known absorption bands, varied among datasets and expression bases for the chemical [concentration (g g(-1)) or content (g m(-2))], did not correspond to bands selected in other studies, and were sensitive to the samples entered into the regression. Stepwise multiple regression using artificially constructed datasets that randomized the association between nitrogen concentration and reflectance spectra produced coefficients of determination (R(2)'s) between 0.41 and 0.82 for first and second derivative log(1/R) spectra. The R(2)'s for correctly-paired nitrogen data and first and second derivative log(1/R) only exceeded the average randomized R(2)'s by 0.02-0.42. Replication of this randomization experiment on a larger dry ground leaf data set from the Harvard Forest showed the same trends but lower R(2)'s.

AB Estimates of increases in future agricultural production in response to increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere are often based on the beneficial physiological effect of CO2 enrichment on plant growth, especially in C-3 plants. However, these estimates fail to consider the negative impact of ozone (O-3) air pollution on crop production. Increases in tropospheric concentrations of both gases, CO2 and O-3, have been observed over the past century, and both are predicted to continue to increase at even higher rates in the near future to levels when they may have a significant impact on agricultural production. Field studies with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1991 and 1992, and corn (Zea mays L.) in 1991 were conducted using open-top chambers to mimic atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (similar to 500 mu L(-1) CO2) and O-3 (similar to 40 nL L(-1) O-3 above ambient air [O-3] during 7h day(-1) 5 days week(-1)) that are predicted to occur at the Earth surface during the first half of the 21st century. Wheat and corn (C-3 vs. C-4) produced clearly different responses to CO2 enrichment, but similar responses to O-3 exposure. In wheat, O-3 exposure led to reduced grain yield, biomass, and radiation use efficiency (RUE, phytomass production per unit of energy received); in both years; but reduction in accumulated absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (AAPAR) was observed only in 1991. Conversely, CO2 enrichment produced greater grain yield, dry biomass, and RUE. With CO2 enrichment, the O-3-induced stress to wheat plants was apparently ameliorated since responses were equivalent to the control group (low O-3 and ambient CO2) for all variables. In contrast, corn demonstrated no benefit to CO2 enrichment for measured variables, and corn grain yield was the only parameter negatively influenced by O-3 exposure that is attributed to O-3-induced damage during the flowering process. Additionally, no treatment differences were observed for leaf area index (LAI) as determined nondestructively using the LICOR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Also, treatment differences for normalized difference vegetation index (ND) were only observed for wheat plants from the high-O-3 and ambient-CO2 treatment, at some growing stages. Otherwise, ND were not helpful for identifying damage due to O-3 fumigation or benefits due to CO2 enrichment. Significant interactive effects of CO2 vs. O-3 were observed only for wheat grain yield in 1991 (p < 0.10), indicated that the detrimental effect of O-3 air pollution was more than overcome under the CO2-enriched environment.

TI IMPROVED CLOUD DETECTION IN GOES SCENES OVER THE OCEANS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; ALGORITHM; SURFACE; IMAGERY
AB Accurate cloud detection in GOES data over the ocean is a difficult task complicated by poor spatial resolution (4 km) in the GOES IR data, relatively coarse quantization (6 bits) for GOES VIS data, a visible sensing region of the spectrum not ideally suited for cloud versus ocean segmentation, and relative small oceanic signal dynamic range compared to that of either cloud or land structures found in a typical GOES scene. The GOES Adapted LDTNLR Ocean Cloud Mask (GALOCM) algorithm for cloud detection in GOES scenes over the oceans provides a computationally efficient, scene-specific way to circumvent these difficulties. The algorithm consists of four steps: 1) generate a cloud mask using the Local Dynamic Threshold Non-Linear Rayleigh (LDTNLR) algorithm of Simpson and Humphrey (1990); 2) generate a second cloud mask using an adaptive threshold: 3) divide the pixels in the scene into three groups (both methods agree that pixel is ocean, pixel is cloud, or the pixel is in contention); and 4) iteratively apply an adaptive threshold to the contested pixels. Convergence occurs when pixels are no longer in contention based on statistical criteria. Results show that the GALOCM method produces accurate cloud masks over the oceans which are neither regionally dependent nor temporally specific. GOES scenes containing ocean, cloud, and land are best cloud screened using a combination of the GOES Split-and-Merge Clustering (Simpson and Gobat, 1995) and the GALOCM algorithms.

AB Remote sensing applications used for resource assessment often lack the capacity to test image data against predictions.  This article describes remote environment and management assessment (REMA), a new method for the interpretation of rangeland plant cover change, which uses Landsat MSS data and neutral predictions.  REMA has been designed to provide a generalized and testable method to assess herbivore impact on potential forage productiveness, even when a plant cover is heterogeneously distributed.  In this article, models are constructed to interpret patterns and processes of cover change within paddocks exposed to alternating periods of plant cover increase and decline.  Relative cover changes along distance from water point axes are derived to standardize and reveal gradients of cover change and cover resistance to drought.  By testing cover changes against neutral predictions, insights are gained into the association between grazing processes, geomorphology, and climatic conditions.  Four MSS images of two sheep-grazed paddocks from wooded rangelands in eastern Australia are used to demonstrate that increasing and decreasing linear cover change gradients, and contrasting forage resistances to drought, can be found and assessed.  The patterns and levels of cover change due to grazing were found to be different and to have nominally high and low levels of drought resistance that were related to paddock management, geomorphology, and climate.

AB The biogeographical distribution of different vegetation types and the physiological status of vegetation are significant controls of energy, water, and CO2 exchanges between, land surfaces and the atmosphere. These exchanges affect local, regional, and global climates, which feedback to affect the biogeography and physiology of the vegetation. Consequently, there is interest in developing a comprehensive land surface scheme that integrates biophysical, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamical processes. Land surface process models of energy and moisture exchanges, ecosystem biogeochemistry models, and ecosystem dynamics models share many features. However, these models have been developed independently by groups interested in their respective field not in the integration across fields. Thus, there are important discrepancies among models that will have to be reconciled if an integrative land-atmosphere interaction package is to be developed. In particular, the temporal resolution and biophysical rigor of land surface process models and the links among energy, water, and CO2 exchange make these models the logical model to calculate land-atmosphere CO2 exchange at diurnal to annual time scales. Longer-term exchanges can be simulated by including plant demography and nutrient cycling. Models that combine the biophysical and biogeochemical controls of CO2 exchange help define remote sensing applications important to modeling the seasonal and annual carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Sensitivity analyses with such a model show that the annual production of biomass and the seasonal cycle of CO2 exchange in boreal forests are well approximated merely by knowing the beginning and end of the growing season, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, foliage nitrogen concentration, and vegetation type.

AB Thermal infrared remote sensing offers the possibility of monitoring the surface energy budget on regional and global scales. However, thermal observations have had limited utility because of difficulties associated with unknown surface emissivities, challenging atmospheric corrections, and the presence of numerous variables that affect the relationship between thermal radiance and the partitioning of energy fluxes at the surface. The importance of distinguishing between aerodynamic and radiative temperatures is discussed and definitions for each are proposed. Considerable progress is being made with atmospheric corrections and measurement of surface emissivity so that accuracies of 1 degrees to 2 degrees C in surface infrared temperature and 0.01 to 0.02 in surface emissivity may be within reach. Five methods are described for extracting information about the surface energy budget from a combination of satellite thermal observations and various amounts of ancillary data. Although no single method appears to work under all conditions, uncertainties in daily fluxes of surface sensible and latent heat appear to be 1 to 2 MJm(-2) based on past studies. Thermal infrared observations will continue to play an essential role in partitioning available surface energy into sensible and latent heat components.

ID PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; INDEXES
AB Coordinate scores of appropriately rotated multitemporal TM pixel vectors directly measure scene change. A successful transformation requires initial identification of a subset of multispectral space containing all unchanged pixel vectors, and subsequent definition of axes which measure the displacement of pixel vectors from this space. Carefully selected pixel vectors guide the Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalization process to produce such a transformation. A Gramm-Schmidt analysis of a multitemporal Thematic Mapper image of the Lake Tahoe Basin produces components which correspond to identifiable scene characteristics, are easily interpretable, and correlate highly with field measurements of conifer mortality.

TI ON THE HOTSPOT EFFECT OF LEAF CANOPIES - MODELING STUDY AND INFLUENCE OF
   LEAF SHAPE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; VEGETATION CANOPIES; SCATTERING; WOODLANDS
AB Hotspot is a prominent feature of the reflectance distribution of a vegetation canopy consisting of finite size foliage. It depends on the geometric dimension and spatial organization of vegetation elements, and therefore has a potential for diagnosing canopy geometric structure. In the context of this study, we first reconcile different notations used by previous workers. This leads to geometrically quantifying the cross-correlation function, which is essential for the hotspot modeling. A comprehensive formulation for the hotspot effect at both leaf and canopy levels is then developed, by generally parameterizing some basic parameters such as mean area of shadows and overlap between shadows cast by scatterers. A rectangle model is proposed to account for the influence of noncircular shape of scatterers on the hotspot effect, and explicit expressions for both the cross-correlation function and the hotspot width are obtained. It is shown that for a leaflike object, the angular hotspot width progressively broadens with an increase of m, the ratio of mean leaf width to the length. For the whole canopy, the relative distribution of the hotspot intensity mainly depends on this ratio. That is, the cross-correlation function decreases more rapidly for smaller m as the viewing direction diverges from the illumination direction. As a result, canopy reflectance increases with m, particularly in the region around the hotspot point where the reflectance distribution strongly relies on the ratio m. For m = pi/4, the rectangle model produces nearly same result as the disk model. This indicates this rectangle model is more realistic and flexible than those based on circle-shaped scatterers (leaves) or their shadows, which is the common assumption underlying in most existing hotspot models.

TI RULE-BASED GEOBOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION OF TOPOGRAPHIC, AEROMAGNETIC, AND
   REMOTELY-SENSED VEGETATION COMMUNITY DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUPERIOR PROVINCE; CANADA; FOREST
AB Classifications of rock-type in areas with closed-canopy forests using remotely sensed data must rely on geobotanical associations. However, the influence of substrate on vegetation communities is generally rather limited, and therefore classifications that are based on geobotanical associations can be improved greatly by including geomorphological and community spatial relationships, particularly those derived from digital elevation data. In a remote sensing study of Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada, digital topographic data was used to divide the landscape into four microclimate and drainage classes. The Landsat Thematic Mapper data were transformed into the nPDF Deciduous Forest Index, which is an estimate of the deciduous-coniferous mixture in each pixel. This was supplemented by digital aeromagnetic data and geological field mapping. Associations of the vegetation communities with geology, microclimate, and drainage classes were identified from these data, and then used in a rule-based geobotanical classification called TOPOVEG. TOPOVEG achieved an 85% accuracy in a classification of the 10 km x 13 km primary test site. A standard maximum likelihood classification of the same area had an accuracy of only 71%, and produces an output that has a distinctive noisy texture compared to the large, homogeneous classes of TOPOVEG. In a neighboring test site to the north, TOPOVEG accuracy was similarly high (86%). A neighboring southern test site, however, showed changing vegetation associations and consequently a lower accuracy. This suggests that the classification can be extended to neighboring unknown areas, except to the south where the classification rules should be modified to take into account the changing vegetation associations. Although TOPOVEG was developed for geobotanical exploration, the procedure has potential for investigating ecological community associations, and the patterns of those associations.

AB Three methods for converting Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) radiance data to apparent surface reflectance were compared using data collected over the Lunar Crater Volcanic Field in Nevada and the Pavant Butte tuff cone in Utah. The methods examined were the empirical line method, radiative transfer modeling (using LOWTRAN 7), and spectral mixture analysis using reference endmembers. Of the three, the empirical line and spectral mixture methods both provided good results. The approach utilizing LOWTRAN 7 accentuates noise inherent in AVIRIS data and requires a very accurate estimate of atmospheric water.

AB Reflectance spectra of green vegetation in the 1.4-2.5 mum region are dominated by liquid water absorptions. In this article, we describe the analysis of a set of reflectance spectra of green vegetation, dry vegetation, and liquid water measured in a laboratory using a nonlinear least squares spectral matching technique. We conclude that both the liquid water and the dry materials contribute to the reflectance spectra of green vegetation in the 1.0-2.5 mum region. Our matching of data acquired with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over two vegetated areas in Oregon Transect with a pure water spectrum also shows a residual absorption feature near 1.72 mum.

ID RED EDGE; FLUORESCENCE; INDEX
AB We studied the reflectance spectra of the aquatic vegetation of Searsville Lake in coastal central California using a high spectral resolution hand-held spectroradiometer. The three aquatic types-submerged, floating, and emergent-exhibited clear differences in their spectral reflectance and can be distinguished on the basis of discriminant analysis using reflectance parameters. This technique can be used in large-area mapping of aquatic plants. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR) were well correlated with chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and biomass in the emergent species.  New, narrow-bandwidth indices and reflectance indices calculated from first and second derivative spectra were strongly correlated with the ratio of secondary and protective pigments to chlorophyll a and with epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments, and therefore, with photosynthetic efficiency. These new indices may be useful in the remote sensing of plant physiological status.

ID CANOPY
AB Ground data from the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeast Colorado and Landsat satellite images of that area acquired in August 1989, June 1990, and September 1990 were used to evaluate the level of association that can be expected from a univariate model relating spectrally derived vegetation indices (difference, ratio, and normalized difference vegetation indices) and dried green vegetation biomass. The vegetation indices were related to the ground sample estimates using a sample point, spectral class, and greenness strata approach. No strong relationships were found between the vegetation indices and sample estimates of dried green biomass using the sample point approach. The spectral class approach produced significant results only for the June 1990 sample period (r2=0.96). Significant relationships were found for the August 1989, June 1990, and September 1990 samples periods (r2=0.95, 0.71, and 0.95, respectively) when the data were aggregated by greenness strata. The high degree of association between green biomass and the NDVI, obtained when the data were combined into greenness strata, indicated that it is possible to predict green biomass levels on semiarid rangelands using univariate regression models.

AB A review Of recent progress in thefield of imaging spectrometry is presented based on the 14 articles comprising the special issue of this journal. The results presented were achieved through research done with data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), the first imaging spectronwter to cover the full solar reflected portion of the spectrum. The majority of the early work in imaging spectrometry prior to AVIRIS focused largely on geological applications and specifically surface mineral identification. In the past 5 years, the range of applications has expanded into the scientific disciplines of ecology, hydrology, oceanography, and atmospheric science. Significant progress has also been made in sensor design and calibration, and information extraction. NASA plans to place high spectral resolution sensors in earth orbit within the next few years; two have been flown already on recent planetary missions and have proven to be of great value to the study of planetary surfaces and atmospheres. The work presented in this issue will lead directly to more effective utilization of imaging spectrometry in the study of the earth. We present a discussion of future trends in imaging spectrometry at the conclusion of this article.

ID COLOR
AB Remote sensing has not been used extensively in southeast Asia for resource development, partly for reasons of perennial cloud cover and low image availability. However, the low level of awareness of remote sensing among planning and environmental agencies is unjustified in view of the capabilities of high spatial and spectral resolution sensors such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), coupled with a general lack of physical resources data throughout the region. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of Landsat MT imagery to the survey and monitoring of water quality in coastal regions affected by land drainage from peat swamp catchments, which are common in southeast Asia, thus where dissolved organic matter (yellow substance) dominates the volume reflectance of coastal water. The Thematic mapper 0.45-0.52 mum waveband was found to be capable of differentiating water with high concentration of yellow substance from nonplume water, but the addition of the 0.63-0.69 mum waveband was required for differentiating lower concentrations of yellow substance. The higher temperature of yellow substance dominated river plumes observed on the 10.5-12.5 mum waveband confirmed field observations. These findings have implications for water resource management in the region, since image derived classes of water quality can be related to environmental standards for the main types of water use.

AB A method, using the concept of local means and local standard deviations of small imaging blocks and using a box counting procedure, has been developed for unsupervised estimation of the average signal to noise ratios of images in which the noise is additive. The method has been applied to simulated images with Gaussian noise, to images acquired with the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and with the Geophysical and Environmental Research Imaging Spectrometer. The method is compared with other techniques for estimating signal to noise ratios from imaging data. It is believed that the method is generally applicable to images having many small homogeneous blocks. Because the method does not take into account interband effects, it is not appropriate to use the method to estimate signal to noise ratios from images having nonnegligible interband radiometric calibration errors at spatial scales less than or equal to the size of the small imaging blocks used in the noise estimation.

ID SPECTRAL INDEXES
AB The surface temperature and emissivity of natural media are very useful to know for many applications. in this article, we show that the scheme proposed in our previous work to retrieve both the spectral emissivities and land surface temperature from AVHRR data is feasible. From the concept of the temperature independent spectral index (TISI) in thermal infrared bands, we recall how the emissivities in Channels 3, 4, and 5 are obtained by combining day and night data, assuming that the TISI for Channels 3, 4, and 5 of AVHRR does not vary substantially between day and night, which has been checked for a particular data acquired in situ over the La Crau test site in Southeastern France. Once the emissivities in Channels 4 and 5 are known, the surface temperature can be determined using the local split-window method proposed in our previous work. In order to test the applicability of the method when atmospheric radiosoundings are not available, we discuss the effects of the errors generated by an approximate knowledge of the atmosphere on the retrieval of both emissivity and surface temperature. It is shown that if a radiosounding or a satellite sounding (from TOVS for instance) of the atmosphere is not available, the use of a climatic atmosphere leads to satisfactory results because the retrieval of emissivity is less sensitive to atmospheric uncertainties than the temperature itself, The method is applied to one AVHRR image over La Crau and results fit with in situ measurements. The problems raised by this method and errors are then discussed, and further work to improve the method is suggested.

AB Directional reflectance measurements were made over a semidesert gramma (Bouteloua spp.) grassland at various times of the growing season. Azimuthal strings of view angle measurements from + 40-degrees to - 40-degrees were made for various solar zenith angles and soil moisture conditions. The sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to these bidirectional measurements was assessed for purposes of improving remote temporal monitoring of vegetation activity. The NDVI response from the grassland canopy was strongly anisotropic about nadir view angles while the SAVI response was symmetric about nadir. This occurred for all sun angles, soil moisture condition, and grass densities. This enabled variations in SAVI-view angle response to be minimized with a cosine function. It is expected that this study will aid in improving the characterization of vegetation temporal activity from Landsat TM, SPOT, AVHRR, and the Earth Observing System MODIS sensor.

AB Canopy chlorophyll fluorescence depends on the variation of individual leaf response inside the canopy, the attenuation of incident exciting radiation, and the scattering of emitted radiation toward the sensor. A simple model is presented which takes into account leaf fluorescence profile inside the canopy, structural variations of the canopy, and background reflection. Analysis shows that canopy fluorescence is strongly affected by these parameters. However, the use of the fluorescence ratio F690/F730 can limit these effects.

AB The maximum likelihood classifier is by far the most widespread among supervised classification methods. This procedure offers numerous advantages, but it has considerable shortcomings in the presence of strongly irregular spectral distributions, mainly related to bias in area estimates. Since these cases are quite common, some methods have already been proposed to correct biased area estimates from maximum likelihood classifications, but they are often not generally applicable or statistically stable. In this article a method is put forward to correct maximum likelihood assignment probabilities by means of a transition matrix; this matrix is derived through a simple mathematical algorithm from a contingency table of a previous classification compared to reference pixels. The purpose is clearly to attain a diagonalization of the final error sources to better estimate area extents and, above all, to achieve higher global discrimination accuracy. As different environmental situations may cause wide variability in the results of such a procedure, this was tested in three case studies using TM data acquired over areas with different landscapes. The results, evaluated by means of suitable statistics, significantly support that the method has general validity and applicability.

AB This article describes remote sensing measurements of the distribution of phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay during 1989. The goal of this study was to show that remote sensing from light aircraft can complement and extend measurements made from traditional platforms and provide data of improved temporal and spatial resolution, leading to a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics in the estuary. We followed the developments of the winter-spring diatom bloom in the polyhaline to mesohaline regions of the estuary and of the late-spring and summer dinoflagellate blooms in oligohaline and mesohaline regions. The instrument we used is an aircraft-borne, visible band radiometer system, NASA's Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS). The ODAS instrument package has three radiometers in the blue to blue-green part of the visible spectrum (460 nm, 490 nm, and 520 nm), an infrared temperature sensor, a broad-band (400-700 nm) downwelling irradiance sensor, Loran-C navigation, and a PC for data acquisition. During 1989, 14 flights were conducted in a 19-week period. Two additional missions were flown in conjunction with local shipboard operations for obtaining concurrent radiance measurements and in situ chlorophyll data. The main sources of in situ data used in algorithm development were semi-monthly to monthly cruises conducted by the Mainstem Water Quality Monitoring Program of the states of Maryland and Virginia as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's (CBP) activities. Data for algorithm development were also obtained from shipboard measurements made in an experiment with ODAS and NASA's Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) to study the suitability of various waveband combinations for recovering chlorophyll concentrations. This article presents the local chlorophyll algorithm we developed using ODAS data and in situ chlorophyll data, interpolated maps of chlorophyll concentration generated by applying the algorithm to aircraft radiance data, ancillary in situ data on nutrients, turbidity, streamflow, and light availability, and an interpretation of phytoplankton dynamics in terms of the chlorophyll distribution in the Chesapeake Bay during 1989.

AB Previous methods to segment clouds from ocean in AVHRR imagery have shown varying degrees of success, with nighttime approaches being the most limited.  An improved method of automatic image segmentation, the principal component transformation split-and-merge clustering (PCTSMC) algorithm, is presented and applied to cloud screening of both nighttime and daytime AVHRR data.  The method combines spectral differencing, the principal component transformation, and split-and-merge clustering to sample objectively the natural classes in the data.  This segmentation method is then augmented by supervised classification techniques to screen clouds from the imagery.  Comparisons with other nighttime methods demonstrate its improved capability in this application.  The sensitivity of the method to clustering parameters is presented; the results show that the method is insensitive to the split-and-merge thresholds.

DT Article
AB The results obtained in the estimation of crop areas in the south of Navarra (Spain) are presented. These estimations were carried out using two similar but differential methodologies: one of them based in the area frame sampling procedures developed by the Institute for Remote Sensing Applications (IRSA) of the EEC in Ispra, and the other inspired in the scheme of area frame sampling used by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in the United States. Both methods also incorporate spectral information from a landsat TM image. The statistical precision of the estimations made by direct expansion and by regression are quite similar in both cases, obtaining higher values of weighted relative efficiency in the case of square segments (IRSA methodology). The values of the relative efficiency at the individual crop level are good in general, and are similar to those obtained in the experiments carried out by the Institute for Remote Sensing Applications of the EEC.

AB Principles of geometric optics and Boolean models for random sets in a three-dimensional space provide the mathematical basis for a model of the bidirectional radiance or reflectance of a forest or woodland as remotely sensed by radiometric instruments. The model may be defined at two levels: whole-canopy and individual-leaf. At the whole-canopy level, the forest scene is treated as a collection of discrete canopy envelopes with simple geometric shapes that are arranged on a contrasting background. The scene includes four components: sunlit canopy, shadowed canopy, sunlit background, and shadowed background. The radiance or reflectance of the scene as a whole is modeled as the sum of the radiances or reflectances of the individual components as weighted by their areal proportions. The areal proportions of the components are determined by 1) principles of geometric optics as applied to the shapes of the canopy envelopes and 2) Boolean models for random set overlap. These yield the expected proportions of the components as a function of angles of irradiance and exitance. At the leaf level, the canopy envelope can be treated as containing an assemblage of leaves, and thus the radiance or reflectance is a function of the areal proportions of sunlit leaf, shadowed leaf, sunlit background, and shadowed background. Because the proportions of scene components are dependent upon the directions of irradiance and exitance, the model accounts for the "hotspot" that is well known in leaf and tree canopies. Because both whole-canopy and individual-leaf models are driven by the same principles of geometric optics and Boolean modeling, they may easily be combined together in a single, two-stage model. Moreover, through further application of the mathematics of random sets, the averaging and variance that occurs when a scene is imaged by a sensor with a finite field of view may be accommodated. In addition, the models are capable of inversion, yielding estimates of size, shape, and spacing of crowns and/or leaves from directional and spatial statistics of remotely sensed radiances.

AB Systematic Sentinel-1 acquisitions provide an unprecedented stream of SAR data which allows to describe forest temporal dynamics in detail, a powerful tool for phenological studies and forest type classification. Several studies have explored the temporal variation of backscatter intensity in this context, but none considered that scattering directionality of canopies may vary. Said directionality is related to target-sensor geometry (incidence angle), forest height, and optical depth, associated with leaf dynamics. This study explicitly models backscatter dependance on incidence angle by fitting a regression model for each Sentinel-1 image and forest type. Residuals are accumulated across the time series and used to classify pixels into the most likely forest type using the smallest accumulated residual. This modelling and classification strategy has been applied over a North-South transect across the Carpathian Mountains, including forests with different physiognomies, from deciduous broadleaf forest, to mixed broadleaf-needleleaf and pure perennial needleleaf forests. These forests were classified with increasing detail, assessing the results against in-situ forest stand data and satellite-based land cover classification products (Copernicus Forest type layer). The accuracy of our classification was K > 0.8, OA > 90% when separating broadleaf from needleleaf forest types. The accuracy decreased (K > 0.6, OA > 79%) when also separating mixed forest types. Our results suggest that incorporating directional effects into classification models can improve SAR-based forest classification of temperate forest over mountainous terrain. Furthermore, models fitted between backscatter and incidence angle provide an estimate of n, a parameter related to optical depth that has been shown to vary with leaf dynamics. n could be used to improve image normalization in studies aiming at the estimation of biomass, or to aid the estimation of fast-changing parameters such as leaf area index or leaf moisture content.

AB Spatio-temporal image fusion aims to increase the frequency and resolution of multispectral satellite sensor im-ages in a cost-effective manner. However, practical constraints on input data requirements and computational cost prevent a wider adoption of these methods in real case-studies. We propose an ensemble of strategies to eliminate the need for cloud-free matching pairs of satellite sensor images. The new methodology called Unpaired Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) is tested in situations where classical requirements are progressively difficult to meet. Overall, the study shows that USTFIP reduces the root mean square error by 2-to-13% relative to the state-of-the-art Fit-FC fusion method, due to an efficient use of the available information. Implementation of USTFIP through parallel computing saves up to 40% of the computational time required for Fit-FC.

AB Pan-Arctic observations of summer sea ice thickness have been a challenging problem despite their global significance in weather/climate analysis and prediction. To solve this problem, this study developed a method for estimating the pan-Arctic ice draft (depth of sea ice below sea surface level) using spaceborne passive microwavemeasured brightness temperatures (TBs). This study found that the time series of TBs is highly correlated with the corresponding time series of ice draft (D)s measured by three upward-looking sonar (ULS) sites over the Beaufort Sea during the ice melting season. Based on this finding, a D estimation equation was derived by relating satellite-measured TBs at microwave frequencies to Ds. Pan-Arctic D distributions from June to August obtained from this study describe well the general thinning process of Arctic sea ice during the summer of 2021. The validation of estimated Ds with other ULS measurements, which were not used for training data, showed good agreement between them suggesting the robustness of the developed estimation method over the Arctic basin. In addition, validation was made against ice mass balance buoy-measured sea ice thickness, and result shows a good agreement between buoy-measured ice thickness and estimated ice thickness converted from the D. Meanwhile, relatively high uncertainty in D estimation above 2 m shown in the result and validation suggests the potential for future improvement of D estimation in the early melting period. As the proposed method can provide summer pan-Arctic D distributions on a daily basis, the D from this study can be applied for generating the initial field for the sea ice and global climate models through data assimilation.

AB Urban land surface temperature (LST) from satellite earth observation (EO) varies with sensor view angle. Where these variations are not accounted for, urban LST products are inconsistent through time, limiting their use in urban weather and climate model evaluations and process studies (e.g. urban heat island, building energy bal-ance, human thermal comfort). Obstacle-resolving numerical models (ORM) of urban form and radiation ex-changes are being used to: (a) understand relations between EO view angle, the 3-dimensional urban surface, and the surface temperatures from urban land surface models, and (b) evaluate parameterisations (parametric models) that aim to account for LST angular effects for the next operational satellite products. Most ORM are limited to simplified buildings (e.g. cuboids) and surface temperatures by lack of datasets. Novelly, we use both a realistic urban form model and observed surface temperatures to assess the impact of simplifying the urban form and temperature on the modelled LST anisotropy. We test various sets of assumptions in central London by combining ground-based thermal camera observations and the state-of-the-art Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The high resolution realistic model (< 1 m) includes thermal (surface temperatures varying by sun-surface geometry, shadow history and materials every 30 min) and geometry (sloped roofs, chimneys and vegetation) data. These data are used to simulate brightness temperatures of EO pixels to quantify LST view angle variations.During daytime, a change of view angle of 47<degrees> off-nadir corresponds to a difference in LST of up to 5.1 K for the realistic building model. The intermediate-complexity landscape (easily obtainable building geometry/ footprints and more idealised surface temperature distributions driven only by shadow patterns) gives the best agreement in simulated LST to the realistic landscape. The directional variations are still captured in total (daytime mean absolute error 0.44 K) when using an idealised ORM representation of the same landscape (cuboid buildings, simplified surface temperature) except for roofs which are near-isotropic. Results suggest that geometry assumptions used in current ORM are suited for evaluation of parametric models used to develop and verify operational LST sensor view angle corrections. Future work should consider more realistic materials and scattering processes including low emissivity glass and metals with challenging specular properties.

AB Stereoscopic images are getting attentions in the forest remote sensing. It is essential to clarify environmental effects on detecting forest spatial structures using stereoscopic images in addition to data processing algorithms. The seasonal effects in mountainous deciduous forests is systematically explored in this study from mid-summer to late winter using 8 dates of ZY-3 stereoscopic images. This study reveals that the acquisition season is an important factor affecting the detection of forest spatial structures. In the leaf-on season, for closed forest stands, the forest canopy tops are easily to be detected; for open forest stands, the ground surface can be detected through between-canopy gaps in mid-summer, but be missed in late summer or early fall. In the leaf-off season, the stereoscopic imagery acquired in late winter or early spring was preferred for the detection of ground surfaces, while the mountain shadows limit those acquired in early and middle winter. The ratio of sunlit ground visible in stereoscopic images as the season change is the factor controlling these findings. The images with the smaller ratio are preferred for the detection of forest canopy tops, while the opposite is proper for the detection of ground surfaces. The combination of ZY-3 stereoscopic imagery acquired in mid-summer and late winter gave the best estimation accuracy of forest AGB among possible combinations.

AB Spatially explicit uncertainties in forest above-ground biomass predictions for population units are under-estimated if spatial structure in the form of residual spatial autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity is ignored. Methods that consider the spatial structure of biomass model residuals are needed to comprehensively estimate, as well as to effectively reduce, the uncertainty in biomass predictions, for pursuing higher levels of precision for measurement, reporting and verification of forest carbon stocks. The objectives of the study were threefold: (1) to demonstrate a spatial data assimilation (DA) procedure that harnesses small-footprint airborne LiDAR, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) and the spatial structure of biomass model residuals to reduce prediction variances of individual tree biomass and plot-level biomass density; (2) to derive a variance estimator that de-composes the variance into components associated with corresponding error sources; and (3) to compare pre-diction variances for three methods used to calibrate a height-based allometric model for tree biomass: ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares (GLS), and spatial DA using the BLUP. Five major conclusions are drawn. First, for individual tree biomass predictions, spatial DA decreased prediction variance by 40% and 20% relative to OLS and GLS. Because the decrease in residual variability accounted for 98% of the decrease in prediction variance in total, the assimilation effect was the largest for reducing residual variability. Second, for biomass density predictions, DA decreased prediction variance by 3% and 49% relative to OLS and GLS, with the largest decrease in residual covariance. Accumulated gain in precision for individual tree predictions in the DA procedure was offset by precision loss caused by residual covariance and the variance associated with omission and commission errors while predicting individual tree biomass from the LiDAR data. Third, OLS, which assumed no spatial structure, underestimated prediction variance for LiDAR-predicted biomass density by 48%. Fourth, from the perspective of prediction accuracy, DA reduced the RMSE for individual tree biomass predictions by 11% and 14% and reduced the RMSE for biomass density predictions by 28% and 33% relative to OLS and GLS. Fifth, the omission/commission difference model was effective for correcting the systematic prediction error in the LiDAR-predicted biomass density. Overall, the proposed spatial DA procedure demonstrated great potential for reducing the uncertainty in forest biomass predictions, thereby facilitating more efficient biomass inventories. The procedure can be generalized to other dependent variables of interest given their correlations with new information from LiDAR.

AB Tropical convective clouds are a crucial component of the Earth's weather and climate system. However, there are still large uncertainties in model simulations of tropical convective clouds and precipitation. In this study, CloudSat/CALIPSO and MODIS measurements are combined to provide vertical convective cloud structures under horizontal storm context and structures of convective cores. Convective cells are identified with MODIS brightness temperature at 11 mu m (BT11) and convective centers are determined for each cell by finding the minimum BT11 (BT11min). The difference between BT11 and BT11min is calculated to provide the distance to the convective center as in brightness temperature. Therefore, detailed convective cloud structures from centers to the stratiform regions could be shown as in the contoured frequency by temperature diagram (CFTD) of radar reflectivity factor (Ze). A group of strongly attenuated Ze profiles is identified near the convective center in Africa during daytime, and the occurrence of this group of profiles is much smaller in the west Pacific during daytime. The out-of-phase day/night variations of convective system structures over ocean and over land are also analyzed. It is shown that over ocean regions, rather than land regions, nighttime convective clouds have larger Ze than daytime ones between 210 K to 260 K, but they have smaller Ze at temperatures colder than 210 K near the cloud top. The convective cores are analyzed by separating and classifying those strongly attenuated Ze profiles as group one convective cores representing the developing stage, and the rest regular profiles as group two convective cores representing the later stage. As BT11min decreases for group one, the cores grow stronger with the maximum Ze shifts into lower temperature; and as BT11min decreases for group two, the CFTD for the cores gradually shifts to larger Ze for temperatures colder than 273.15 K and smaller Ze for temperatures warmer than 273.15 K. These observed composite structures of convective clouds and land/ocean and day/night vari-ations provide crucial information for model evaluations.

AB In order to provide urban residents with suitable living conditions, it is essential to keep track of the liveability of neighbourhoods. This is traditionally done through surveys and by predictive modelling. However, surveying on a large scale is expensive and hard to repeat. Recent research has shown that deep learning models trained on remote sensing images may be used to predict liveability. In this paper we study how well a model can predict liveability from aerial images by first predicting a set of intermediate domain scores. Our results suggest that our semantic bottleneck model performs equally well to a model that is trained only to predict liveability. Secondly, our model extrapolates well to unseen regions (R-2 between 0.45 and 0.75, Kendall's tau between 0.39 and 0.57), even to regions with an urban developmental context that is different from areas seen during training. Our results also suggest that domains which are directly visible within the aerial image patches (physical environment, buildings) are easier to generalize than domains which can only be predicted through proxies (population, safety, amenities). We also test our model's perception of different neighbourhood typologies, from which we conclude that our model is able to predict the liveability of neighbourhood typologies though with a varying accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that remote sensing can be used to extrapolate liveability surveys and their related domains to new and unseen regions within the same cultural and policy context.

AB The rapid growth of coastal aquaculture has strongly supported global food security and economic development of coastal areas in the past few decades but has also caused remarkable impacts on coastal ecosystems. Accurate delineation of coastal aquaculture extent and changes is thus significant for improving coastal zone management toward sustainability. Here, by means of Sentinel-2 images, we propose an effective and rapid approach that combines simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) with hierarchical decision trees (HDT), so-called SNIC-HDT, to generate fine-resolution coastal aquaculture pond data at the national scale of China. The SNIC-HDT fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of coastal aquaculture ponds and performs accurate segmentation by determining the optimal segmentation scale for coastal aquaculture ponds with different sizes and shapes. In addition, the SNIC-HDT incorporates temporal features into the establishment of HDT and thus effectively distinguishes coastal aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. In support of the Google Earth Engine platform, we employed 85,501 scenes of Sentinel-2 images and generated the first annual 10-m spatial resolution national coastal aquaculture pond dataset of China between 2016 and 2021 (China_CAP), with an overall classification accuracy of more than 90%. This dataset reveals that total area of China's coastal aquaculture ponds experienced a substantial loss of 13.21% from 9769 km2 in 2016 to 8629 km2 in 2021. The most remarkable areal reduction occurred in Zhejiang Province, with a decrease rate of 38.24%, followed by Guangdong (27.93%), and these reductions were mostly related to the policy of retuning aquaculture ponds to natural wetlands. Coastal aquaculture ponds in Fujian and Tianjin provinces experienced slight areal gains (7.24% and 2.13%). The results generated in this study could provide a basis for the conservation of habitats of migratory water birds on the East Asia-Australia Flyway and are of great scientific and practical importance to support the evaluation of Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Modeling forest attributes using lidar data has been a useful tool for forest management but the need to correlate lidar to ground-based measurements creates challenges to modeling in diverse forest landscapes. Many lidar models have been based on metrics derived from summarizations of individual lidar returns over sample plot areas, but more recently, metrics based on summarization by volumetric pixel (voxel) have shown promise to better characterize forest structure and distinguish between diverse forest types. Voxel-based metrics may improve characterization of leaf area distribution and horizontal forest structure, which could help create general models of forest attributes applicable in complex landscapes composed of many distinct forest types. We modeled wood volume in longleaf pine woodlands and associated forests to compare how area- and voxel- based lidar metrics predicted wood volume in forest type specific and general predictive models. We created four area-based and six voxel-based metrics to fit models of wood volume using a multiplicative power function. We selected models and compared metric importance using AIC and evaluated model performance using cross-validated mean prediction error. We found that one area-based metric and four voxel-based metrics consistently improved model predictions We suggest that area-based metrics alone may have limitations for characterizing complex forest structure. Area-based summarizes of lidar returns are more heavily influenced by upper canopy returns because lidar returns attenuate below the canopy. By contrast, summarizing lidar returns into a single value per voxel prior to summarization over plots homogenizes point density, giving added weight to sub-canopy returns. Thus voxel-based metrics may be more sensitive to structural variation that may not be adequately captured by area-based metrics alone. This study highlights the potential of voxel-based metrics for characterizing complex forest structure and model generalization capable of accurate forest attribute prediction across diverse forest types.

AB Artemia (brine shrimp) are a widely distributed zooplankton in inland salt lakes and artificial ponds throughout the tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones. Notably, they are of great importance to fishery production and salt lake ecosystem health. Recently, Artemia resources have been threatened by habitat deterioration and overfishing, which mandate adequate monitoring; however, advanced methods for detecting Artemia from remote sensing images have rarely been discussed. Accordingly, this study explored the possibility of detecting the adult Artemia (Artemia) slicks using multispectral optical sensors by analyzing their unique aggregation patterns and consistent optical properties. After measuring Artemia spectra in the field, reflectance troughs were observed at-431 nm and -560 nm, which were deemed likely related to the absorption of beta-carotene and heme, respectively, resulting in their reddish color. These characteristics could also be used to differentiate Artemia from other confounding features, including clean water and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-or suspended par-ticulate matter (SPM)-dominated water. Based on these spectral signatures, a brine shrimp index (BSI) was developed using the difference between the reflectance at NIR band and a linear baseline between green and SWIR1 bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Further, a BSI-based Artemia slick pixel extraction method was proposed. Using observation geometry information in conjunction with the BSI value of entire lakes, the BSI thresholds for the Artemia-containing pixels were automatically determined, and > 80% overall accuracy was achieved. The index performance was affected by the presence of residual cloud shadows, high water turbidity, and mixed pixels with low Artemia density. Moreover, BSI values were found to be rela-tively insensitive to atmospheric signals. It was shown here that the BSI detection limit was >0.53% Artemia subpixel coverage under clean water conditions; whereas a higher coverage was required to separate Artemia from Chl-a-or SPM-dominated water. The mean absolute percentage difference of BSI values calculated from Rayleigh-corrected and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance was <4% compared with surface reflectance derived BSI, and the relative difference in coverage area was < +/- 10%. Lastly, time series analyses of Lake Aibi in northwest China and the Great Salt Lake in North America revealed that the annual areal coverage estimation of Artemia slicks based on BSI was a positive indicator of Artemia harvesting, which can facilitate the Artemia resource management.

AB Florida's Big Bend region is home to the second largest contiguous seagrass bed in the continental United States, but the extent and integrity of this seagrass bed is declining as a result of degraded water clarity. Seagrass beds provide important ecological services and support high levels of biodiversity, thus monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of water clarity in the Big Bend region, particularly during the seagrass growth season (April to October), is of vital importance. Satellite remote sensing of coastal water clarity is often challenging due to the optical complexity and heterogeneity of coastal regions as well as frequent clouds and sun glint in the satellite imagery. As such, we developed machine learning (ML) approaches to derive the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [Kd(490)] from satellite data with partial atmospheric correction. Traditionally, such algorithms would be developed to capture the full range and variation of the parameter of interest. Here, we demonstrate deficiencies in this method, and instead advocate for an alternate approach which leverages seagrass light re-quirements to improve the algorithm design. Specifically, we developed and implemented a 2-stage ML approach, which first classifies the coastal water into two types, then retrieves Kd(490) for the water type within which measurable changes in water clarity may impact seagrass health. We developed and compared the traditional ML approach and the proposed 2-stage ML approach based on data from MODIS/Aqua, OLCI/ Sentinel-3A, and VIIRS/SNPP. Given the outperformance of the 2-stage ML approach, we applied it to the MODIS/Aqua data archive (2003-2020) to generate time-series Kd(490) maps and analyzed how often different areas across the Northern Big Bend region are suitable for seagrass growth each year. The derived information is important toward understanding how the spatial and temporal variation in light availability impacts seagrass growth and distribution in the study region, while the 2-stage ML approach appears applicable to other coastal regions with similar optical complexity.

AB Detailed maps of forest structure attributes are crucial for sustainable forest management, conservation, and forest ecosystem science at the landscape level. Mapping the structure of broad heterogeneous forests is chal-lenging, but the integration of extensive field inventory plots with wall-to-wall metrics derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing offers a potential solution. Our goal was to map forest structure attributes (diameter at breast height, basal area, mean height, dominant height, wood volume and canopy cover) at 30-m resolution across the diverse 463,000 km2 of native forests of Argentina based on SAR Sentinel-1, vegetation metrics from Sentinel-2 and geographic coordinates. We modelled the forest structure attributes based on the latest national forest inventory, generated uncertainty maps, quantified the contribution of the predictors, and compared our height predictions with those from GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investiga-tion) and GFCH (Global Forest Canopy Height). We analyzed 3788 forest inventory plots (1000 m2 each) from Argentina's Second Native Forest Inventory (2015-2020) to develop predictive random forest regression models. From Sentinel-1, we included both VV (vertical transmitted and received) and VH (vertical transmitted and horizontal received) polarizations and calculated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels to match the size of the inventory plots. For Sentinel-2, we derived EVI (enhanced vegetation index), calculated DHIs (dynamic habitat indices (annual cumulative, minimum and variation) and the EVI median, then generated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels of these variables. Our models including metrics from Sentinel-1 and 2, plus latitude and longitude predicted forest structure attributes well with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 23.8% to 70.3%. Mean and dominant height models had notably good performance presenting relatively low RMSE (24.5% and 23.8%, respectively). Metrics from VH polarization and longitude were overall the most important predictors, but optimal predictors differed among the different forest structure attributes. Height predictions (r = 0.89 and 0.85) outperformed those from GEDI (r = 0.81) and the GFCH (r = 0.66), suggesting that SAR Sentinel-1, DHIs from Sentinel-2 plus geographic coordinates provide great opportunities to map multiple forest structure attributes for large areas. Based on our models, we generated spatially-explicit maps of multiple forest structure attributes as well as uncertainty maps at 30-m spatial resolution for all Argentina's native forest areas in support of forest management and conservation planning across the country.

Accurate detection of RB occurrence with a universal metric is crucial to facilitate early disease prevention and curtailing the disease expansion but has not been addressed to date. This study aimed to design a rice blast index (RIBI) for quantifying the disease index (DI) and tracking the smallholder rice blast dispersal over multiple spatial scales. To achieve this goal, a large dataset including leaf-and canopy-scale reflectance spectra and satellite imagery was acquired within the framework of seven independent campaigns over four years (2018-2021). Specifically, an extensive collection of Magnaporthe oryzae infected samples were analyzed to examine the specific spectral response to pathogen infection in paddy rice from leaf to near-ground canopy scales. Two variants of the RIBI were devel-oped, which were RIBInir = (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) and RIBIred= (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) based on the single-band separability and exhaustive search of band combinations. They were subsequently evaluated for quantifying the RB occurrence from ground to space. Spatial cluster analysis was then integrated with the su-perior RIBI adjusted for Sentinel-2 imagery to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen infection, and to reveal the within-field hotspots of potential rice blast dispersal in smallholder farms.The results demonstrated that both RIBInir and RIBIredexhibited high overall accuracies for the classification of infected and healthy samples at the leaf scale under greenhouse in 2018 (RIBInir: 81.41%; RIBIred: 84.62%) and 2019 (RIBInir: 81.30%; RIBIred: 90.37%) and field conditions in 2020 (RIBInir: 86.36%; RIBIred: 89.39%). Compared with traditional VIs (Near-ground: R2 < 0.47, satellite: R2 < 0.54), the RIBInir yielded improved R2 in quantifying the DI from in situ spectra to satellite imagery (Near-ground: R2 = 0.73, satellite: R2 = 0.78). The strongest DI-RIBInir relationship was attributed to the use of two near-infrared (NIR) bands that helped enhance the unique spectral responses in the NIR region induced by pathogen infection, in contrast to the extensively studied visible region. Multi-temporal analysis of Sentinel-2A derived RIBInir successfully captured the temporal dynamics of RB infection and recovery and yielded compelling maps showing the spatial propagation and attenuation of disease over time. This research opens new opportunities towards quantifying field disease occurrence and detecting the within-field hotspots of potential disease dispersal in a timely manner from publicly available satellite imagery.

AB Remote sensing enhances large-scale biodiversity monitoring by overcoming temporal and spatial limitations of ground-based measurements and allows assessment of multiple plant traits simultaneously. The total set of traits and their variation over time is specific for each individual and can reveal information about the genetic composition of forest communities. Measuring trait variation among individuals of one species continuously across space and time is a key component in monitoring genetic diversity but difficult to achieve with ground-based methods. Remote sensing approaches using imaging spectroscopy can provide high spectral, spatial, and temporal coverage to advance the monitoring of genetic diversity, if sufficient relation between spectral and genetic information can be established.
   We assessed reflectance spectra from individual Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) trees acquired across eleven years from 69 flights of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) above the same temperate forest in Switzerland. We derived reflectance spectra of 68 canopy trees and correlated differences in these spectra with genetic differences derived from microsatellite markers among the 68 individuals. We calculated these correlations for different points in time, wavelength regions and relative differences between wavelength regions. High correlations indicate high spectral-genetic similarities. We then tested the influence of environmental variables obtained at temporal scales from days to years on spectral-genetic similarities. We performed an uncertainty propagation of radiance measurements to provide a quality indicator for these correlations.
   We observed that genetically similar individuals had more similar reflectance spectra, but this varied between wavelength regions and across environmental variables. The short-wave infrared regions of the spectrum, influenced by water absorption, seemed to provide information on the population genetic structure at high temperatures, whereas the visible part of the spectrum, and the near-infrared region affected by scattering properties of tree canopies, showed more consistent patterns with genetic structure across longer time scales. Correlations of genetic similarity with reflectance spectra similarity were easier to detect when investigating relative differences between spectral bands (maximum correlation: 0.40) than reflectance data (maximum correlation: 0.33). Incorporating uncertainties of spectral measurements yielded improvements of spectral-genetic similarities of 36% and 20% for analyses based on single spectral bands, and relative differences between spectral bands, respectively.
   This study highlights the potential of dense multi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy data to detect the genetic structure of forest communities. We suggest that the observed temporal trajectories of reflectance spectra indicate physiological and possibly genetic constraints on plant responses to environmental change.

AB The collection of various long-term reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) datasets derived at a range of spatio-temporal scales provides new opportunities for modelling vegetation dynamics, in particular, gross pri-mary productivity (GPP). Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007-2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees), namely - CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) -at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope -GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices - NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation-ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari-abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.

AB Statistically rigorous inferences in the form of confidence intervals for map-based estimates require model-based inferential methods. Model-based mean square errors (MSE) incorporate estimates of both residual variability and sampling variability, of which the latter includes population unit variance estimates and pairwise population unit covariance estimates. Bootstrapping, which can be used with any prediction technique, provides a means of estimating the required variances and covariances. The objectives of the study were to to demonstrate a method for estimating the sampling variability, (Var) over cirucumflex(sam)((mu) over cirucumflex) that can be used with all prediction techniques, to develop an efficient method that map makers can use to disseminate metadata that facilitates calculation of (Var) over cirucumflex(sam)((mu) over cirucumflex) for arbitrary subregions of maps, and to estimate the individual contributions of sampling variability and residual variability to the overall standard error of the prediction of the population mean. The primary results were fourfold: (i) map makers must provide metadata that facilitate estimation of population unit variances and covariances for arbitrary map subregions, (ii) bootstrapping was demonstrated as an effective means of estimating the variances and covariances, (iii) the very large matrix of pairwise population unit covariances can be aggregated into a much smaller matrix that can be readily communicated by map makers to map users, and (iv) MSEs that include only estimates of residual variability and/or estimates of population unit variances, but not estimates of the pairwise population unit covariances, grossly under-estimate the actual MSEs.

AB Thermal infrared imagery from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) R-series presents an opportunity to observe mountain surface temperatures at high temporal resolution. These observations are needed to better understand the transient surface energy balance, influenced by near-surface air temperatures and water fluxes ranging from evapotranspiration to snowmelt. From geostationary orbit, the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument views the Earth from a fixed longitude above the equator. ABI images therefore have increasingly off-nadir view angles and increasingly larger pixel dimensions the further a point on the Earth's surface is from the sub-satellite point. In thermal infrared imagery from ABI, these 2+ km pixels blur together the different surface temperatures of heterogeneous mountain landscapes. We compared GOES-16 ABI band 14 (11.2 mu m) brightness temperatures to 90 m spatial resolution ASTER band 14 (11.3 mu m) and 1 km spatial resolution MODIS band 31 (11.03 mu m) brightness temperatures and investigated how differences change over space and time for a study region in the central Sierra Nevada of California for the 2017-2020 snow seasons. We demonstrated the necessity of orthorectifying ABI imagery of mountain terrain to correct for the parallax effect in off-nadir imagery. This reduced the mean difference between ABI and ASTER similar to 11 mu m brightness temperatures from 1.6 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C and increased the r-squared value between ABI and ASTER thermal infrared brightness temperatures from 0.43 to 0.93. The ABI brightness temperatures were found to more closely match those of forest canopy temperatures than snow surface (with RMS differences of 1.2 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C respectively), and those of sunlit slopes as opposed to slopes facing away from the sun (with RMS differences of 1.6 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C respectively), in coincident ASTER imagery. This work demonstrates the use of GOES ABI, and associated challenges, for observing surface temperatures of forested mountain environments with seasonal snow.

AB The rapid replacement of upland forest by encroaching marshland is a striking manifestation of global sea-level rise (SLR). Timely and high-resolution information on the location and extent of transition forest (the ecotone between upland forest and marsh where tree mortality due to seawater intrusion begins) is fundamental to understanding the processes and patterns of SLR-driven landscape reorganization. Despite its significance, accurate characterization of salt-impacted transition forest remains challenging due to the complexity of coastal environments, scarcity of ground-truth data, and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. Here we use the full archive of Landsat images between 1984 and 2021 to investigate the spectral, temporal, and phenological characteristics of transition forest, and develop a robust framework for monitoring coastal vegetation shifts in the mid-Atlantic U.S., a global SLR hotspot. We found that transition forest exhibits strong negative NDVI trends and a deviation of land surface phenology from marsh and upland forest that distinguishes itself from surrounding vegetation. By integrating temporal trends and land surface phenology, our results demonstrate superior discrimination between marsh and coastal forests to existing map products (e.g. NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, National Land Cover Database) that allows a reliable identification of the coastal treeline. We applied the approach to map regional land cover in 1985, 2000 and 2020 (overall classification accuracy > 92%) and found that the area of coastal forest decreased by 22.0% from 1985 to 2020, the majority of which transitioned to marshland (92.3%, 5.3 x 10(3) ha). Based upon fine-scale patterns of coastal transgression, we created a practical workflow for spatially explicit quantification of forest retreat rates. Concurrent with rising sea level, coastal forests migrated upslope from 0.63 (+/- 0.27) m above sea level in 1985 to 0.78 (+/- 0.32) m above sea level in 2020, and horizontal forest retreat rates accelerated from 3.1 (range of 0-36) m yr(-1) during 1985-2000 to 4.7 (0-55) m yr(-1) during 2001-2020. As SLR continues to accelerate, our study may serve as a scalable solution for consistent tracking of coastal landscape evolution that is urgently needed for sustainable forest and wetland management.

AB Biological soil crusts (BSCs) covering drylands worldwide are an important functional vegetation unit and play an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycling of dryland ecosystems. However, there is a lack of accurate data on the spatial distribution and change of BSCs. Here, two indices were developed to enhance BSC mapping, including the sandy land ratio crust index (SRCI) for sandy land with moss-dominated BSCs and the desert ratio crust index (DRCI) for desert with lichen-dominated BSCs. The SRCI combines the near infrared band in which moss-dominated BSCs and other surface components have significant spectral differences, and red edge bands in which such differences can be enhanced. Another index, the DRCI, highlights different spectral characteristics of lichen-dominated BSCs, gravel and sand in the shortwave infrared and red-edge bands. A random forest (RF) machine learning framework was developed to map the large-scale BSC distribution with 10 m resolution using Sentinel 2 satellite data. The results show that the BSC area in the Mu Us Sandy Land and Gurbantunggut Desert of China covers 10,647 km2 and 14,036 km2, accounting for 5.7% and 29.4% of the total area, respectively, indicating that BSC is one of the dominant land cover types in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Validations and comparisons demonstrate that the overall accuracy of BSC detection is 90% and 94% with kappa coefficients of 0.80 and 0.86 in sandy land and desert, respectively, and the proposed SRCI and DRCI increase the overall mapping accuracy by 6% for sandy land and desert compared to the non-index scheme. Therefore, indices can enhance the BSC mapping accuracy for sandy land and desert. Moreover, this work provides basic data for exploring the ecological effects of BSCs in arid areas.

AB Coastal tidal wetlands are highly altered ecosystems exposed to substantial risk due to widespread and frequent land-use change coupled with sea-level rise, leading to disrupted hydrologic and ecologic functions and ultimately, significant reduction in climate resiliency. Knowing where and when the changes have occurred, and the nature of those changes, is important for coastal communities and natural resource management. Large-scale mapping of coastal tidal wetland changes is extremely difficult due to their inherent dynamic nature. To bridge this gap, we developed an automated algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using dense Landsat time series. DECODE consists of three elements, including spectral break detection, land cover classification and change characterization. DECODE assembles all available Landsat observations and introduces a water level regressor for each pixel to flag the spectral breaks and estimate harmonic time-series models for the divided temporal segments. Each temporal segment is classified (e.g., vegetated wetlands, open water, and others - including unvegetated areas and uplands) based on the phenological characteristics and the synthetic surface reflectance values calculated from the harmonic model coefficients, as well as a generic rule-based classification system. This harmonic model-based approach has the advantage of not needing the acquisition of satellite images at optimal conditions (i.e., low tide status) to avoid underestimating coastal vegetation caused by the tidal fluctuation. At the same time, DECODE can also characterize different kinds of changes including land cover change and condition change (i.e., land cover modification without conversion). We used DECODE to track status of coastal tidal wetlands in the northeastern United States from 1986 to 2020. The overall accuracy of land cover classification and change detection is approximately 95.8% and 99.8%, respectively. The vegetated wetlands and open water were mapped with user's accuracy of 94.6% and 99.0%, and producer's accuracy of 98.1% and 93.5%, respectively. The cover change and condition change were mapped with user's accuracy of 68.0% and 80.0%, and producer's accuracy of 80.5% and 97.1%, respectively. Approximately 3283 km(2) of the coastal landscape within our study area in the northeastern United States changed at least once (12% of the study area), and condition changes were the dominant change type (84.3%). Vegetated coastal tidal wetland decreased consistently (similar to 2.6 km(2) per year) in the past 35 years, largely due to conversion to open water in the context of sea-level rise.

AB Surface Urban heat island (SUHI) is a major adverse environmental consequence of urbanization. Many algo-rithms measuring SUHI across varying spatial or temporal scales are developed rapidly with the availability of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data from satellites. However, the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of TIR sensors limits the study of SUHI on both spatial and temporal domains. Therefore, this study aims to improve the characterization of SUHI using spatiotemporally enhanced land surface temperature (LST) derived from the synergistic use of coarse-and fine-spatial-resolution TIR data. Combining the spatial downscaling and temporal interpolation techniques, we generated daily 100 m-resolution LST in both daytime and nighttime to analyze the SUHI in different local climate zones (LCZs) in Beijing. LCZ is a manifestation of the urban form on the thermal environment, covering hundreds of meters to several kilometers in horizontal scale. The results indicate the spatiotemporally enhanced LST is reliable in capturing the LCZ-based SUHI magnitude compared with original observations, and providing a more accurate time range when the SUHI reaches to its maximum compared with those time-discontinuous original observations. Compared with temporally interpo-lated coarse-resolution LST, the spatiotemporally enhanced LST shows a larger annual variation of SUHI (especially in LCZ 2 with a mean absolute SUHI difference of 0.8 K and 1.3 K for daytime and nighttime, respectively) and provides larger SUHI difference between compact building and open building (especially when there is a significant SUHI effect). The superiority of the spatiotemporally enhanced LSTs in analyzing LCZ-based SUHI is more evident in daily and monthly SUHI analysis than in single-day analysis or annual analysis, espe-cially in compact building types (LCZ 1 and 2). These findings are valuable information for better and healthier urban planning for SUHI mitigation and public health care.

AB Multifractal analysis was applied to evidence spatial properties, in particular scaling behaviour, of Sentinel-2 surface reflectances and optical indexes acquired over the Southwest region of France. Considering the significant impact of clouds on the spatial properties of optical products, no study to our knowledge has focused on the multifractal analysis of a series of images. Images with minimal cloud cover were identified for the whole year 2016 based on the MACCS-ATCOR Joint Algorithm (MAJA) cloud and shadow detection process. This allowed us to access the dynamics of the scaling properties of surface reflectances, contributing to demonstrate the potential of multifractals for spatial characterization. Different scaling regimes, separated by significant scale breaks, were evident in these data. Through simulations from the Universal Multifractal model, we could explain the scaling properties and especially the position of scale breaks observed in the images studied by two types of phenomena. First, a transition scale located between hundreds of meters and one kilometre was detected on power spectra, structure functions and statistical moments. This specific scale was related to the average size of the agricultural plots of the studied region, revealing the direct link between the scaling behaviour observed and the physical properties of the surface. Second, an instrumental phenomenon was detected on the power spectra, resulting in a systematic transition scale observed near the resolution of the sensor and revealing the impact of the acquisition system on the high frequencies of optical images. In this research work, theoretical and/or empirical validation arguments were provided as to the origin of the scales detected, contributing to demonstrate the value of multifractals to extract image texture from surface reflectance products.

AB Estimation of carbon stocks in forests and tracking their dynamics over time requires repeated and spatially dense observations. Sweden is one of the major forested countries on Earth with a carbon pool of approximately 1 PgC. Statistics on forest resources are regularly quantified by data collected at field inventory plots by the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). Nonetheless, the sampling by the inventory does not provide detailed spatial knowledge of carbon stored in forests. Thanks to one of the worldwide densest datasets of L-band satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected over the years, we assessed the estimation of carbon density on two years, i.e., 2010 and 2015, at pixel (25 m), landscape, county and national level, and investigated the reliability of changes over five years. While the maps of carbon density were obtained with a well-established approach, the uncertainty of the estimates were obtained with a novel procedure that accounted for observational variances and co-variances. The high spatial resolution of the maps revealed the small-scale patterns of carbon density in Swedish forests. However, the substantial uncertainties at the pixel level (25%-62% of the estimated value) prevented from a reliable estimate of carbon density difference at the pixel level. Average values at landscape and county scale were instead unbiased and in strong agreement with corresponding numbers from the Swedish NFI. The uncertainty at county level was between 3% and 12% of the reference mean value. Overall, the net carbon balance for Sweden was positive, with a magnitude comparable to estimates derived from data collected by the NFI. Between 2010 and 2015, Swedish forests acted as a carbon sink, with a net increase of carbon stocks by 2.5%. The high level of confidence in our results indicate that satellite L-band observations are potentially suitable for tracking large-scale forest carbon dynamics in boreal forests provided that multiple observations are available per year and that they are acquired with the same viewing geometry.

AB Seasonal changes of temperature and precipitation cause inland open surface water and ice cover extents to vary dramatically through the year from local to global scales. These dynamics of land, water, and ice have a significant impact on climate and often are critical to natural ecosystem functioning. However, global seasonal dynamics of both water and ice extent have not been well quantified. Here, we present the quantification of monthly surface water and ice areas for 2019 with associated uncertainties. Time-series reference data were created for a probability sample of 10 m grid cells by interpreting the entire 2019 time-series of 10 m Sentinel-2 data and a subset of 3 m PlanetScope data in selected places with a mix of land and water. From the probability sample reference data, we estimate that 4.86 +/- 0.16 million km(2) had inland water presence at some point during the year. Globally, only 23% of the total area with water was permanent water that remained open year-round (1.13 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). Permanent water with seasonal ice cover extended 1.97 +/- 0.21 million km(2), comprising 41% of the total area with water. Seasonal water-land transitions (both with and without ice/snow cover) covered the remaining 36% of the total area with water (1.76 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). February had the maximum extent of ice over areas of inland permanent and seasonal water, totaling 2.49 +/- 0.25 million km(2), and January - March had a larger global extent of ice cover than of open water. To investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of ice cover and the suitability of Landsat, prototype maps of surface water ice cover phenology were created by integrating the ice/snow and no data labels from the quality assurance layer of the GLAD ARD of Potapov et al. (2020) with the monthly surface water layers of Pickens et al. (2020), both of which are Landsat- based. While limited by data availability, these maps reveal the high spatiotemporal variability of ice phenology. The near-daily observations near the poles and the 10 m resolution bands of Sentinel-2 provide unprecedented potential to examine surface water and ice dynamics for 2016 forward and to investigate the drivers and impacts of this variability.

AB Internal waves (IW) are characterized by a large-amplitude, long-wave crest, and long-propagation distance. They are widespread in the global ocean. Amplitude is an essential IW parameter and is difficult to derive from the IW surface signatures in satellite images. A laboratory experiment and combined satellite/in-situ measurements were carried out to build two internal wave datasets (888 pairs of lab data and 121 pairs of synchronous in-situ data and satellite images). To efficiently use the lab data, we implemented a transfer learning model to retrieve IW amplitude from satellite images. The model is a purely data-driven model pre-trained with lab data and re-trained with satellite/in-situ data. A short connection was incorporated into the transfer learning framework to reduce information loss. Bias correction was adopted to improve the model performance. After the correction, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated IW amplitude decreased from 12.09 m (17.84 m) to 9.59 m (11.59 m), the mean relative error decreased from 21% (27%) to 18% (16%), and the correlation coefficients improved from 0.81 (0.72) to 0.89 (0.90) on the test (training) dataset. For IWs with amplitude exceeding 100 m, the model can be expected to get an absolute error of 10 m. The mean relative error decreased with the increase in IW amplitudes. Comparisons with other algorithms demonstrate that the proposed model is efficient for IW studies. We applied the model to 156 satellite images containing IW signatures in the Andaman Sea, finding that large-amplitude IWs were mainly located at the water depth between 200 m and 1000 m on the continental slope. When considering one-pixel input errors for the peak-to-peak (PP) distance, the model shows large tolerance with the errors. Compared with the KdV equation-based method, the developed model was more accurate.

AB A fully physically-based algorithm is presented and used to retrieve nighttime sea-surface (skin) temperatures (SSTs) from spectra recorded by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI). The main advantage of the proposed approach, based on radiative transfer calculations, is to provide a dataset totally independent of any in-situ measurement or model. The SSTs are retrieved at the IASI spot resolution (clear sky) for the three Metop platforms, today leading to a continuous record over more than 13 years, which is planned to be extended for at least another decade. Five atmospheric transparency windows centered at 3.8, 4.0, 4.7, 9.0 and 11 mu m have been used in the retrieval. Results are compared with in-situ temperatures provided by the buoys network as well as with other satellite datasets. This first analysis enables to draw the following three main conclusions. First, we confirm the interest of using short wavelengths around 4 mu m which enables accurate estimates characterized by a reduced bias with respect to those around 9 and 11 mu m, thanks to significantly weaker sensitivities to errors in the modeling of the water vapor contribution to the atmospheric absorption and emission. Second, we show that the observed dependences of the skin-depth temperature difference on various observed-scene parameters (wind speed, air-sea temperature difference, humidity) are consistent with predictions of theoretical and empirical models, as well as with those from other SST products. Finally, the overall averaged bias between our retrieved values converted to depth temperatures and those provided by in-situ measurements is -0.04 K (median: -0.024 K), with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.38 K (Robust SD = 0.25 K). The bias is thus well below the 0.1 K required for a SST product usable for climate studies and extremely stable over more than a decade. Then, we investigate the consistency between the three generations of IASI on-board Metop-A, -B, and -C over their overlap periods (2013-2020 for Metop-A and Metop-B, and 2019-2020 for Metop-C) by comparing the associated retrieved monthly-averaged SSTs over 1 degrees x1 degrees grids. The mean differences obtained are lower than 0.02 K, with a SD of 0.3 K consistent with the natural variation of the SST within a month. This demonstrates the high stability of the SSTs retrieved using spectra recorded from the IASI suite and opens the possibility to generate long time series for climate studies. This is tested in a preliminary investigation of the SST anomalies between 2008 and 2020, with the successful detection of short-term (El Nin similar to o and La Nin similar to a) changes as well as of a global warming trend of about +0.3 K/decade quantitatively consistent with other observations.

AB Water-leaving albedo (alpha w), defined as the ratio of water-leaving irradiance to downwelling irradiance just above the surface, is a major component of ocean surface albedo (alpha) but has long been ignored or underrepresented. A semi-analytical scheme based on inherent optical properties (IOPs), termed IOPs-alpha w, is proposed in this study to estimate spectral alpha w(lambda) from ocean color measurements. Evaluations with numerical simulations of radiative transfer show that IOPs-alpha w outperforms the conventional scheme based on chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration. The median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of derived alpha w(lambda) from IOPs-alpha w is generally less than 3% in the blue-green spectral domain, in comparison to MAPD of over 40% for estimated alpha w(lambda) from the Chl-based scheme. IOPs-alpha w is later implemented to monthly composite data of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), where reasonable spatial distributions and seasonal patterns of alpha w(lambda) are obtained. In particular, broadband alpha w in the visible domain, termed alpha w_VIS, obtained via IOPs-alpha w is over 50% higher than the previous estimation by the Chl-based scheme in most oceanic waters. Furthermore, this study concludes that alpha w_VIS could contribute up to 20% to alpha in oceanic waters under low solar-zenith angles. Thus, we suggest that neither the spatial variability of alpha w_VIS nor the contribution of alpha w_VIS to alpha shall be neglected, and it is necessary to incorporate IOPs-alpha w into current parameterizations of alpha in coupled ocean-atmosphere and climate models.

AB Ozone (O3) is an important trace and greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health at the ground level. Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited direct ground and satellite measurements. This study offers a new perspective to estimate ground-level O3 from solar radiation intensity and surface temperature by employing an extended ensemble learning of the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, together with ground-based observations, remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and an emission inventory. A full-coverage (100%), high-resolution (10 km) and high-quality daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ground-level O3 dataset covering China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 was generated. Our MDA8 O3 estimates (predictions) are reliable, with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error of 17.10 (21.10) mu g/m3 in China. The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49 mu g/m3/yr (p < 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3 = 160 mu g/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the "2 + 26" cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects. This carefully vetted and smoothed dataset is valuable for studies on air pollution and environmental health in China.

AB Deriving burn severity from multispectral satellite data is a widely adopted approach to infer the degree of environmental change caused by fire. Burn severity maps obtained by thresholding bi-temporal indices based on pre- and post-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) can vary substantially depending on temporal constraints such as matched acquisition and optimal seasonal timing. Satisfying temporal requirements is crucial to effectively disentangle fire and non-fire induced spectral changes and can be particularly challenging when only a few cloud-free images are available. Our study focuses on 10 wildfires that occurred in mountainous areas of the Piedmont Region (Italy) during autumn 2017 following a severe and prolonged drought period. Our objectives were to: (i) generate reflectance composites using Sentinel-2 imagery that were optimised for seasonal timing by embedding spatial patterns of long-term land surface phenology (LSP); (ii) produce and validate burn severity maps based on the modelled relationship between bi-temporal indices and field data; (iii) compare burn severity maps obtained using either a pair of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, i.e. paired images, or reflectance composites. We proposed a pixel-based compositing algorithm coupling the weighted geometric median and thematic spatial information, e.g. long-term LSP metrics derived from the MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover Dynamics Product, to rank all the clear observations available in the growing season. Composite Burn Index data and bi-temporal indices exhibited a strong nonlinear relationship (R-2 > 0.85) using paired images or reflectance composites. Burn severity maps attained overall classification accuracy ranging from 76.9% to 83.7% (Kappa between 0.61 and 0.72) and the Relative differenced NBR (RdNBR) achieved the best results compared to other bi-temporal indices (differenced NBR and Relativized Burn Ratio). Improvements in overall classification accuracy offered by the calibration of bi-temporal indices with the dNBR offset were limited to burn severity maps derived from paired images. Reflectance composites provided the highest overall classification accuracy and differences with paired images were significant using uncalibrated bi-temporal indices (4.4% to 5.2%) while they decreased (2.8% to 3.2%) when we calibrated bi-temporal indices derived from paired images. The extent of the high severity category increased by similar to 19% in burn severity maps derived from reflectance composites (uncalibrated RdNBR) compared to those from paired images (calibrated RdNBR). The reduced contrast between healthy and burnt conditions associated with suboptimal seasonal timing caused an underestimation of burnt areas. By embedding spatial patterns of long-term LSP metrics, our approach provided consistent reflectance composites targeted at a specific phenological stage and minimising non-fire induced inter-annual changes. Being independent from the multispectral dataset employed, the proposed pixel-based compositing approach offers new opportunities for operational change detection applications in geographic areas characterised by persistent cloud cover.

AB High-throughput mapping of latent heat flux (MET) is critical to efforts to optimize water resources management and to accelerate forest tree breeding for improved drought tolerance. Ideally, investigation of the energy response at the tree level may promote tailored irrigation strategies and, thus, maximize crop biomass productivity. However, data availability is limited and planning experimental campaigns in the field can be highly operationally complex. To this end, a multi-platform multi-sensor observational approach is herein developed to dissect the MET signature of a black poplar (Populus nigra) breeding population ("POP6") at the canopy level. POP6 comprised more than 4600 trees representing 503 replicated genotypes, whose parents were derived from contrasting environmental conditions. Trees were trialed in two adjacent plots where different irrigation treatments (moderate drought [mDr] and well-watered [WW]) were applied. Data collected from satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remote sensing as well as from ground-based proximal sensors were integrated at consistent spatial aggregation and combined to compute the surface energy balance of the trees through a modified Priestley-Taylor method. Here, we demonstrated that MET response was significantly different between WW and mDr trees, whereby genotypes in mDr conditions exhibited larger standard deviations. Importantly, genotypes classified as drought tolerant based on the stress susceptibility index (SSI) presented MET values significantly higher than the rest of the population. This study confirmed that water limitation in mDr settings led to reduced soil moisture in the tree root zone and, thus, to lower MET. These results pave the way to breeding poplar and other bioenergy crops with this underexploited trait for higher MET. Most notably, the illustrated work demonstrates a multi-platform multi-sensor data fusion approach to tackle the global challenge of monitoring landscape-scale ecosystem processes at fine resolution.

AB Anthropogenic methane emissions from urban centers are important and addressable, yet remain poorly characterized, and the representativeness of studies from individual cities is unknown. A satellite-based approach provides a pathway to tackle this challenge on a national or global scale. Here we present a space-based method that uses the simultaneous, daily observation of methane and carbon monoxide from the TROPOMI satellite to estimate urban methane emissions. We assess and validate the method and demonstrate that using these simultaneous observations enables robust assessment of methane emissions from urban centers without relying on atmospheric transport models. Initial assessments with this approach in eight United States cities suggest emission inventory underestimates previously discovered in older East Coast cities are more broadly representative, with aggregated emissions totaling 1.47 (0.56, 3.19, 95% confidence interval) Tg CH4/year, compared to the Environmental Protection Agency estimate of 0.52 Tg CH4/year. We show this data driven approach provides a pathway to study urban methane emissions across the globe and track how emissions respond if urban mitigation measures are implemented by investigating three additional megacities outside the United States.

AB Glaciers in polar regions are sensitive to climate and ocean changes and can thin rapidly as a consequence of global warming. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from remote sensing observations have been widely used to detect changes in polar glaciers. DEMs from Terrestrial Radar Interferometer (TRI) have recently been used for high frequency glacier change and glacier-ocean interaction studies. However, it is unclear whether TRI DEM over a large study area can be combined directly with remote sensing observations to investigate glacier changes as well as the accuracy of TRI DEM at far range. In this study, we deployed a TRI close to Helheim Glacier, East Greenland and generated DEMs using TRI and satellite laser altimetry. We analyzed the accuracy of the TRI DEM using theoretical calculations, comparisons based on repeat observations, and comparisons with a high accurate ArcticDEM. The validation results suggest that for stable ground surfaces, the uncertainty (standard deviation) is <5 m at range < 9.8 km. Averaging across time (e.g. one hour) decreases the uncertainty almost linearly with range, over 0.5 m to 1.2 m when the range increases from 7.0 km to 10.0 km. Increasing the correlation coefficient threshold for phase unwrapping does not significantly reduce uncertainty. TRI DEMs are influenced by systematic error at far range primarily due to coarse azimuth resolution and phase unwrapping difficulties in discontinuous interferograms. As the absolute accuracy of TRI DEMs is not uniformly distributed in the range direction (farther points have worse uncertainty), our findings indicate that TRI DEMs within range of 10 km can reach <5 m uncertainty, which can be compared with DEMs obtained from remote sensing satellites to detect glacier thinning.

AB Drought can have pervasive and wide-spread impacts to forest health, as evidenced in several severe events occurring over the recent decades. Extensive forest die-off due to drought can impair the ecological functioning of forests, impacting habitat, water yield and quality from forested lands, and altering forest fire dynamics and intensity. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for detecting and monitoring spatial patterns of forest mortality over large areas, exploiting free and open long-term image archives available at a range in spatial and temporal resolutions. While remotely sensed surface reflectances and vegetation indices have been widely used to study optical response of forest canopies to drought events, retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from thermal satellite imagery - particularly at resolutions approaching crown scale can provide insights into cumulative tree stresses that can incite disease and trigger mortality. In this study, we applied a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to estimate daily 30-m resolution ET and an associated Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) to study drought-induced mortality in a temperate forest at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, located in the central United States. The study covered the period from 2010 to 2014, including an exceptional drought year of 2012. Modeled ET agreed well with eddy flux measurements from the MOFLUX tower, with average monthly relative errors of 15%. Plot-scale ESI, describing temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET, was used as an index of relative forest health to investigate relationships between forest mortality and drought severity. ESI showed good agreement with observed predawn leaf water potential, especially during the drought year. Furthermore, plot scale ESI was also correlated with the subsequent year's tree mortality, suggesting the importance of considering the forest health condition prior to drought when studying drought-induced forest impacts. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-year ET remote sensing data at the stand or plot scale as an indicator of forest health and as a predictor of future mortality due to drought.

AB The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation is providing unprecedented global coverage, visible to near infrared, atmospherically corrected, 3 m imagery. The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as "standard" or as "test" quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as "standard" at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively.
   The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December-February) and spring (March-May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution.

AB In satellite-based and airborne imagery, the observed radiances reflected by a certain pixel at the surface are additionally influenced by reflections from the neighboring surface pixels and multiple scatterings due to atmospheric components (mainly cloud and aerosol particles) into the observational solid angle of the imaging camera. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the atmospheric adjacency effect. This three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effect is caused by spatial inhomogeneities of the surface reflectivity and the atmospheric properties. Based on the recently published 3D radiative transfer code LEIPSIC (Light Estimator Including Polarization, Surface Inhomogeneities, and Clouds), a new atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm is proposed to consider for the atmospheric adjacency effect when estimating the surface reflectivity from satellite or airborne imagery. The effectiveness of the new AC algorithm is quantified and compared to the results based on the independent pixel approximation (IPA) radiative transfer approach. It is shown that the image blurring caused by the atmospheric adjacency effect and the error of reflectivity retrievals are reduced by 80% using the new AC algorithm. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that the vertical profile of the atmospheric properties is crucial in determining the quality of the AC.

AB Excessive heat in urban areas affects the overall livability of cities and harms the health of urban dwellers. Understanding the spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) and the thermal impacts of heterogeneous urban forms is crucial for informing mitigation strategies to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the diurnal thermal dynamics over urban areas has been rarely studied due to the polarorbiting nature of conventional satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat Series, Terra, Aqua). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) latest Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides LST observations at a 70 m resolution for different times of day and night, and thereby offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring the LST diurnal dynamics. We used ECOSTRESS data to explore the diurnal cycling of LST and variations among local climate zones (LCZs) in Xi'an, a megacity in Northwest China. The urban area was segmented into 2733 community units that were classified into seven LCZs. We examined the intra-LCZ variation of LST at different times of day and night to investigate the thermal impact of urban landscapes. Distinct thermal patterns across LCZs were observed during the day: urban landscapes of compact buildings tended to heat up faster than open buildings, and low-rise zones generally had higher LST than high-rise LCZs in both compact and open urban forms. At night, compact buildings had higher LST than the open buildings, but the LST difference was insignificant. Meanwhile, building heights had little effects on LST at night. We also found that vegetation cover, percentage of impervious surface, and population size were related to LST, while the strength of the relationship varied for different times of day and night. Our study demonstrates the great potential of the new ECOSTRESS LST observations in studying the diurnal variations of urban thermal environments with fine spatial resolution. Our findings can provide insight into the impacts of urban form on local climate and can inform municipalities on the development of targeted heat mitigation strategies.

AB Urban functional zones (UFZs) are essential for characterizing both urban spatial configurations and socioeconomic properties and monitoring urbanization process, thus UFZs are fundamental to urban planning, management and renewal. Although many efforts in remote sensing field have been made to map UFZs, largescale and fine-grained UFZ maps required by a broad range of urban applications are still unavailable. Existing methods generally rely on pre-determined mapping units, such as image tiles and road blocks, which significantly limit the mapping quality and the automation degree of mapping UFZs. Given that UFZs are composed of diverse geographic objects, this study proposes a novel object-based UFZ mapping method using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, a multi-scale semantic segmentation network that achieves pixel-wised predictions is proposed to predict urban-functions for geographic objects by capturing multi-scale contextual information. Afterwards, a conditional random field (CRF) framework is designed to regroup objects into UFZs to produce the final UFZ map, wherein road vectors are incorporated to restrict the procedure. The presented object-as-analysis-unit scheme conquers the drawbacks of mapping-unit pre-determination and the semantic segmentation model provides accurate function information for objects, thus they can be applied for producing large-scale and fine-grained UFZ maps. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by producing UFZ maps for Beijing and Shanghai, China, and competitive results with overall accuracy of 91.6% and 89.1% are achieved, respectively. Finally, the generated UFZ maps are utilized to analyze the urbanfunction structures of the two cities. The proposed method can be regarded as a significant development that appears to be promising and practical for mapping UFZ maps for real-world urban applications.

AB Two decades of global annual fractional vegetation cover products have been derived using daily surface reflectance and land surface temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite. These MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) products are unique and a distinct advance over discrete (ordinal) land cover characterizations. VCF consists of three continuous fractional cover layers at 250 m resolution summing to 100%: tree cover, non-tree vegetation and non-vegetated surface plus surface water. This paper describes the fully-automated machine learning algorithm used to create MODIS VCF and details recent algorithm improvements. Comparisons of the latest VCF products in the MOD44B collection 6, with field-based fractional tree cover and other remote sensing fractional cover products demonstrate improved agreement: the mot mean square (RMS) deviations range from 9 to 23%. A comparison of MODIS canopy cover values with those from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) gives an R-2 value of 0.53. Automation of the algorithm provides flexibility for readily porting the method to derive fractional cover products from additional instruments with similar radiometric characteristics such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) payload aboard Suomi NPP and JPSS platforms, and successors.

AB Landsat time series (LTS) and associated change detection algorithms are useful for monitoring the effects of global change on Earth's ecosystems. Because LTS algorithms can be easily applied across broad areas, they are commonly used to map changes in forest structure due to wildfire, insect attack, and other important drivers of tree mortality. But factors such as initial forest density, tree mortality agent, and disturbance severity (i.e., percent tree mortality) influence patterns of surface reflectance and may influence the accuracy of LTS algorithms. And while LTS algorithms are widely used in areas with a history of multiple disturbance events during the Landsat record, the effectiveness of LTS algorithms in these conditions is not well understood. We compared products from the LTS algorithm LandTrendr (Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) with a unique field dataset from a landscape heavily influenced by both wildfire and spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) since c. 2000. We also compared LandTrendr to other common methods of mapping fire- and spruce beetle-affected areas. We found that LandTrendr more accurately detected wildfire than spruce beetle-induced tree mortality, and both mortality agents were more easily detected when they occurred at high severity. Surprisingly, prior spruce beetle outbreaks did not influence the detectability of subsequent wildfire. Compared to alternative disturbance mapping approaches, LandTrendr predicted a c. 40% lower area affected by wildfire or spruce beetle outbreaks. Our findings indicate that disturbance type- and severity-specific differences in omission error may have broad implications for disturbance mapping efforts that utilize Landsat data. Gradual, low-severity disturbances (e.g., background tree mortality and non-stand replacing disturbance) are pervasive in forest ecosystems, yet they can be difficult to detect using automated LTS algorithms. Whenever possible, methods to account for these biases should be incorporated in LTS-based mapping efforts, including the use of multispectral ensembles and ancillary spatial data to refine predictions. However, our findings also indicate that LTS algorithms appear to be robust in areas with multiple disturbance events, which is important because these areas will increase as new acquisitions extend the length of the Landsat record.

AB The performance of different atmospheric correction algorithms for the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board of Sentinel-3 (S3) is evaluated for retrieval of water-leaving radiance reflectance, and derived parameters chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in turbid coastal waters in the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ). This is performed using in situ measurements from an autonomous pan-and-tilt hyperspectral radiometer system (PANTHYR). The PANTHYR provides validation data for any satellite band between 400 and 900 nm, with the deployment in the BCZ of particular interest due to the wide range of observed Near-InfraRed (NIR) reflectance. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction algorithm is adapted for S3/OLCI processing in ACO-LITE, and its performance and that of 5 other processing algorithms (L2-WFR, POLYMER, C2RCC, SeaDAS, and SeaDAS-ALT) is compared to the in situ measured reflectances. Water turbidities across the matchups in the Belgian Coastal Zone are about 20?100 FNU, and the overall performance is best for ACOLITE and L2-WFR, with the former providing lowest relative (Mean Absolute Relative Difference, MARD 7?27%) and absolute errors (Mean Average Difference, MAD-0.002, Root Mean Squared Difference, RMSD 0.01?0.016) in the bands between 442 and 681 nm. L2-WFR provides the lowest errors at longer NIR wavelengths (754?885 nm). The algorithms that assume a water reflectance model, i.e. POLYMER and C2RCC, are at present not very suitable for processing imagery over the turbid Belgian coastal waters, with especially the latter introducing problems in the 665 and 709 nm bands, and hence the chlorophyll-a and turbidity retrievals. This may be caused by their internal model and/or training dataset not being well adapted to the waters encountered in the BCZ. The 1020 nm band is used most frequently by ACOLITE/DSF for the estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance (67% of matchups), indicating its usefulness for turbid water atmospheric correction. Turbidity retrieval using a single band algo-rithm showed good performance for L2-WFR and ACOLITE compared to PANTHYR for e.g. the 709 nm band (MARD 15 and 17%), where their reflectances were also very close to the in situ observations (MARD 11%). For the retrieval of chlorophyll-a, all methods except C2RCC gave similar performance, due to the RedEdge band-ratio algorithm being robust to typical spectrally flat atmospheric correction errors. C2RCC does not retain the spectral relationship in the Red and RedEdge bands, and hence its chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval is not at all reliable in Belgian coastal waters. L2-WFR and ACOLITE show similar performance compared to in situ radiometry, but due to the assumption of spatially consistent aerosols, ACOLITE provides less noisy products. With the superior performance of ACOLITE in the 490?681 nm wavelength range, and smoother output products, it can be recommended for processing of S3/OLCI data in turbid waters similar to those encountered in the BCZ. The ACOLITE processor for OLCI and the in situ matchup dataset used here are made available under an open source license.

AB Addressing global declines in biodiversity requires accurate assessments of key environmental attributes determining patterns of species diversity. Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation strongly affects species diversity patterns, and measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar and satellite image texture analysis correlate well with species richness. Our goal here was to gain a better understanding of why image texture explains bird richness, by linking field-based measures of vegetation structure directly with both image texture and bird richness. In addition, we asked how image texture compares with lidar-based canopy height variability, and how sensor resolution affects the explanatory power of image texture. We generated texture metrics from 30 m (Landsat 8) and 10 m (Sentinel-2) resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery from 2017 to 2019. We compared textures with vegetation metrics and bird richness data from 27 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial field sites across the continental US. Both 30 and 10 m resolution texture metrics were strongly correlated with lidar-based canopy height variability (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.64 and 0.80, respectively). Texture was moderately correlated with field-based metrics, including variability of vegetation height and tree stem diameter, and foliage height diversity (range vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.31-0.52). Generally, 10 m resolution texture had stronger correlations with lidar and field-based metrics than 30 m resolution texture. In univariate linear models of total bird richness, 10 m resolution texture metrics also had higher explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 0.45), than 30 m texture metrics (up to R-adj(2) = 0.31). Among all metrics evaluated, the 10 m homogeneity texture was the best univariate predictor of total bird richness. In multivariate bird richness models that combined texture with lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based metrics, both 30 m and 10 m resolution texture metrics were selected in top-ranked models and independently contributed explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 46%). Lidar-based canopy height variability was also selected in a top-ranked model of total bird richness, but independently contributed only 15% of the variance explained. Our results show satellite image texture characterized multiple features of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity, complemented more commonly used metrics in models of bird richness and for some guilds outperformed both lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based vegetation measurements. Ours is the first study to directly link image texture both to specific components of vegetation heterogeneity and to bird richness across multiple ecoregions and spatial resolutions, thereby shedding light on habitat features underlying the strong correlation between image texture and biodiversity.

AB This study; i) investigates the suitability of two frequently employed machine learning algorithms in remote sensing, namely, random forests (RFs) and support vector regression (SVR) for fractional snow cover (FSC) estimation from MODIS Terra data, and ii) compares them with the previously proposed artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) methods over an heterogeneous and complex alpine terrain. The dataset comprises 20 Landsat 8 - MODIS image pairs that belong to European Alps acquired from Apr 2013 to Dec 2016. The fifteen image pairs are used to generate the training dataset necessary to build the models, whereas the remaining five are employed as a separate test dataset. The reference FSC maps are derived from the binary classified Landsat 8 snow/no snow maps at 30 m resolution. In order to assess the effect of sampling type and sample size, nine different training datasets are generated. The RF and SVR models are trained accordingly by using various settings of model tuning parameters. During the training of the models, MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, NDSI, NDVI and land cover class are input as independent variables (i.e., predictors) to estimate the dependent variable (i.e., response), i.e., FSC value. The resolution of the generated FSC maps is 500 m. The results indicate that the ANN, MARS, RF and SVR models exhibit high consistency with reference FSC values as indicated by low RMSE (similar to 0.14) and high R (similar to 0.93) values. In order to analyze the effect of using three auxiliary variables, i.e., NDSI, NDVI and land cover class, to the predictive ability of the models; ANN, MARS, RF and SVR models are also trained without these predictor variables, i.e., by only using MODIS bands 1-7. The models trained without three auxiliary variables slightly differ from the ones trained with the full set of predictors by only resulting in a mean decrease in R <0.012 and a mean increase in RMSE <0.009, showing that they perform well in solving the complex functional dependencies by only using MODIS reflectance data. In terms of computational efficiencies of the proposed algorithms measured by the CPU times spent during model training, MARS and RF algorithms outperform ANN and SVR methods.

AB Accurate segmentation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data remains a challenge for forest inventories. Although many ITC segmentation methods have been developed to derive tree crown information from airborne LiDAR data, these algorithms contain uncertainty in processing false treetops because of foliage clumps and lateral branches, overlapping canopies without clear valley-shape areas, and sub-canopy crowns with neighbouring trees that obscure their shapes from an aerial perspective. Here, we propose an approach to crown segmentation using computer vision theories applied in different forest types. First, a dual Gaussian filter was designed with automated adaptive parameter assignment and a screening strategy for false treetops. This preserved the geometric characteristics of sub-canopy trees while eliminating false treetops. Second, anisotropic water expansion controlled by the energy function was applied for accurate crown segmentation. This utilized gradient information from the digital surface model and explored the morphological structures of tree crown boundaries as analogous to the maximal valley height difference from surrounding treetops. We demonstrate the generality of our approach in the subtropical forests within China. Our approach enhanced the detection rate of treetops and ITC segmentation relative to the marker-controlled watershed method, especially in complicated intersections of multiple crowns. A high performance was demonstrated for three pure Eucalyptus plots (a treetop detection rate r = 0.95 and crown width estimation R-2 = 0.90 for canopy trees; r = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.88 for sub-canopy trees) and three plots dominated by Chinese fir (r = 0.95 and R-2 = 0.87 for canopy trees; r = 0.79 and R-2 = 0.83 for sub-canopy trees). Finally, in a relatively complex forest park containing a wide range of tree species and sizes, a high performance was also achieved (r = 0.93 and R-2 = 0.85 for canopy trees; r = 0.70 and R-2 = 0.80 for sub-canopy trees). Our method demonstrates that methods inspired by the computer vision theory can improve on existing approaches, providing the potential for accurate crown segmentation even in mixed forests with complex structures

AB Satellite radar altimetry is nowadays a powerful and attractive Earth Observation technique of major importance in several applications such as the study of mean sea level change (a crucial climate change indicator), the observation of continental ice sheets' melting or the management of highly sensitive coastal zones and continental water resources. This paper aims at presenting an overview of the effects of the troposphere in satellite radar altimetry range observations, i.e. the tropospheric path delays (PD), and the corresponding corrections required to account for these effects, including those due to neutral gases, the DTC (dry tropospheric correction) and those related with water vapour and cloud liquid water content, the WTC (wet tropospheric correction). Starting with a summary of satellite altimeter missions since 1991 and corresponding relevant characteristics for DTC and WTC estimation, the tropospheric PD are discussed in the more general context of the atmospheric corrections. Then, for each of the tropospheric PD, the following topics are inspected and discussed: relevant background theory required to estimate each of the PD; methods used in the PD retrievals either from observations or from atmospheric models; specific problems encountered in the retrieval of each PD in coastal and inland water regions; errors still present in some altimeter products and proposed approaches to mitigate them. Most relevant conclusions are highlighted, including the future challenges and trends in DTC and WTC estimation.

AB Functional diversity (FD) provides a link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, summarizing inter and intra-specific variation of functional traits. However, quantifying plant traits and FD consistently and costeffectively across large and heterogeneous forest areas is challenging with traditional field sampling. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imaging spectroscopy provide spatially explicit data, which allow mapping of selected forest traits and FD at different spatial scales. We develop an individual tree-based method to measure forest FD from tree neighborhoods to whole forests, and demonstrate the approach by mapping functional traits of over one million trees in a subtropical forest in China. We retrieved canopy morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index and foliage height diversity) and physiological traits (proxies of nitrogen, carotenoids and specific leaf area) for each individual canopy tree crown from LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy data, respectively. Based on the multivariate trait space spanned by the six trait axes and filled by measured tree individuals, we mapped forest FD as richness, divergence and evenness, and explored spatial patterns of FD as well as FD-area and FD-tree number relationships. The results show that LiDAR-derived morphological traits and spectral indices of physiological traits are consistent with field measurements and show weak correlations between each other at individual tree level. Morphological functional richness follows a hump-shaped pattern along the elevational gradient of 984-1805 m, with maximum values at elevations around 1450 m, while high physiological functional richness occurs at medium and high elevations. At an ecosystem scale of 30 x 30 m, morphological richness increases continuously with tree density, but physiological richness decreases again at very high densities. Moreover, functional richness shows a logarithmic relationship with increasing area or number of individual trees, and local trait convergence is predominant in our study area. We demonstrate the ability to quantify FD using morphological and physiological traits by remote sensing, which provides a pathway to conduct individual-level trait-based ecology with wall-to-wall data.

AB Landsat imagery is an unparalleled freely available data source that allows reconstructing land-cover and landuse change, including urban form. This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30 m spatial resolution, for monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss, the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel-wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping. We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open, sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map ten other European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the classification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time. Between the two semantic segmentation models, DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the ten other European cities with training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage points over RF for both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The resulting maps across the years 1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images that is effective in areas experiencing a slow pace of urban growth or with small-scale changes.

AB Evaluating the efficacy of air pollution control policies is an essential part of the decision-making process to develop new policies and improve existing measures. Since 2005, Fujian Province of Mainland China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait have both implemented aggressive air pollution control policies designed based on different principles, but a comprehensive evaluation of these control policies on PM(2.5)pollution levels is still lacking. In the current study, we assessed the effects of these policies in the Taiwan Strait Region from 2005 to 2018 using full-coverage, high-resolution PM(2.5)generated by a satellite-driven machine learning model. A ten-fold cross-validation for our prediction model showed an R(2)value of 0.89, demonstrating that these predictions can be used for policy evaluation. During the 14-year period, PM(2.5)levels in all areas of Fujian and Taiwan underwent a significant decrease. Separate regression models for policy evaluation in Taiwan and Fujian showed that all considered policies have mitigated PM(2.5)pollution to various degrees. The Clean Air Action Plans (CAAP) is the most effective control policy in Taiwan, while the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) and Three-year Action Plan for Blue Skies (3YAP-BS) as well as their provincial implementation plans are the most successful in Fujian. The effectiveness of control policies, however, varies by land-use types especially for Taiwan.

AB Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provides an opportunity to map chlorophyll-a (Chla) in lake waters at spatial scales not feasible with ocean color missions. Although state-of-the-art algorithms to estimate Chla in lakes from satellite-borne sensors have improved, there are no robust and reliable algorithms to generate Chla time series from OLI imageries in turbid lakes due to the absence of a red-edge band and issues with atmospheric correction. Here, a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) was employed to develop an algorithm for Chla estimation from OLI in turbid lakes. This model was developed and validated by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to near-synchronous in situ Chla data available from eight lakes in eastern China (N = 225) and three coastal and inland waters in SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (N = 97). The BST model performed well on a subset of data (N = 102, R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared difference = 7.1 mu g L-1, mean absolute percentage error = 24%, mean absolute error = 1.4, Bias = 0.9), and had better Chla retrievals than several band-ratio algorithms and a random forest approach. The performance of BST model was judged as appropriate only for the range of conditions in the training data. Given these limitations, spatial and temporal variations of Chla in hundreds of lakes larger than 1 km(2) in eastern China for the period of 2013-2018 were mapped using the BST model. OLI-derived Chla indicated that small lakes (<50 km(2)) had greater Chla than the larger lakes. This research suggests that machine-learning models provide practical approaches to estimate Chla in turbid lakes via broadband instruments like OLI and that extending to other regions requires training with a representative dataset.Landsat-8

AB The phenological dynamics of crops reflect the response and feedback of agricultural systems to climate and environmental constraints, and have significant controls on carbon and nutrient cycling across the globe. Remote monitoring of crop phenological dynamics in a consistent and systematic manner is vitally crucial for optimizing the farm management activities and evaluating the agricultural resilience to extreme weather conditions and future climate change. Yet our ability to retrieve crop growing stages with satellite time series is limited. The remotely sensed phenological transition dates may not be characteristic of crop physiological growing stages. The objective of this study is to develop a remote sensing phenological monitoring framework that can reconcile satellite-based phenological measures with ground-based crop growing observations, with corn and soybean in Illinois as a case study. The framework comprises three key components: time series phenological pre-processing, time series phenological modeling, and time series phenological characterization. As an exploratory prototype, the framework retrieved a total of 56 phenological transition dates that were subsequently evaluated with the district-level ground phenological observations. The results indicated that the devised framework can adequately retrieve a wide range of physiological growing stages for corn and soybean in Illinois, with R square greater than 0.6 and RMSE less than 1 week for most stages. The devised framework largely extends the limited satellite phenological measures to a range of phenological transition dates that are characteristic of essential crop growing stages. It paves the way for formulating standard crop phenological monitoring protocols via remote sensing. The wealth of retrieved phenological characteristics open up unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the crop growth in response to varying environmental stresses, and to make more adaptive farm management strategies towards sustained agricultural development.

AB Spatiotemporal fusion is a feasible solution to resolve the tradeoff between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. However, the development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing methods still face many challenges, e.g., accurately retrieving land cover changes and improving the robustness of fusion algorithms. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method proposed by Zhu a al. in 2016 solved the abovementioned problems to some extent. However, FSDAF has two shortcomings that can be further improved: (1) FSDAF is prone to losing spatial details and predicting a "blurrier" image due to the input of coarse pixels containing type change information and a large amount of boundary information for unmixing calculation, and (2) FSDAF does not optimize the areas of land cover change. In this paper, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) was proposed to improve the aforementioned problems. Based on the existing FSDAF algorithm, FSDAF 2.0 excludes changed pixels and boundary pixels for unmixing calculation, and establishes a model to optimize the changed pixels. Its performance was compared with that of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF). Two sites consisting of landscapes with heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes were employed for testing. The results of the experiments demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 effectively improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy than that of the other three methods at two different sites, and strengthens the robustness of the fusion algorithm. More importantly, FSDAF 2.0 has a powerful ability to retrieve land cover changes and provides a feasible way to improve the performance of retrieving land cover changes. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 has great potential for monitoring complex dynamic changes in the Earth's surface.

AB Reliable information on salt marsh extent and condition is crucial to promote effective management strategies towards their maintenance and recovery. Most of previous studies on salt marsh extent assessment used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), being limited the current knowledge about the performance of other Vegetation Indices (VI). Based on Landsat imagery this study proposes a new methodology to map salt marsh extent in estuarine systems by combining Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and VI, exploring their performance when using different VI. Moreover, it aims to assess the extent and condition changes between 1984 and 2018 in two salt marshes (Pancas and Corroios) located within Tagus Estuary. The VI best-performing salt marsh extent was determined and the methodology applied to assess salt marsh extent changes. Condition change was investigated by statistically analyzing spatially averaged VI over salt marsh extent change regions. Results demonstrated that NDWI and VI combined can be used to efficiently map the marsh extent and NDVI was the VI with the best performance. Corroios revealed mostly stable without noticeable changes in its extent and condition. Oppositely, Pancas registered a continuous seaward progression at a mean rate of 3 ha/year since 1984, while restricted upper regions dieback after 2004-2005, likely due to high soil salinity conditions. In general, NDVI performs better salt marsh extent, but others VI corrected to minimize soil effects perform better when tidal flats are entirely, or almost entirely, exposed, opening perspectives to the development of new methods combining the use of different VI to optimize salt marsh extent detection.

AB Indicators of landscape condition should be sensitive and specific to environmental change and provide early warning detection of ncipient changes. We assessed a suite of five spectral metrics derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery spanning a decade (1996-2007) to quantify ecosystem condition in the ridge-slough mosaic of the Everglades (South Florida, USA). These included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the same index using green instead of red band as the visible reference (NDVIg), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the simple ratio of NIR and red bands (SR) and the moisture stress index (MSI). Mean and variance from pure ridge or slough pixels (i.e., those >30 m from a mapped patch edge) were quantified for twentyfour 2 x 5 km blocks across a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition. Metrics were compared with field measures of landscape condition from block-scale soil elevation surveys, which capture dramatic spatial gradients between conserved and degraded locations. Elevationbased measures of landscape condition, validated as diagnostic in previous work, included soil elevation bi-modality (BISE), a binary measure of ecosystem condition, and the soil elevation standard deviation (SDSE), a continuous measure of condition. Spectral metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs.lagging) of the relationship with elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 3 metrics (mean ridge NDVI and NDVIg, mean ridge SR). In prediction of variance SDSE, the standard deviation of our VIs was more informative than the mean, and measures from sloughs more informative than ridges. The strongest predictions are variance in slough NDVIg and SR, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in slough biomass is most informative for predicting the status of soil elevation variance. None of the vegetation metrics were leading indicators of change; a multivariate model using three VIs selected based on consistent performance across years (variance in Slough SR, slough NDVIg, and ridge NDWI) substantially improve predictions of SDSE and yielded more plausible prediction maps. These findings suggest that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede visible changes in vegetation reflectance. While this constrains predictions of incipient ecosystem change, the reasonable performance of spectral metrics indicates that efficient monitoring of ridge-slough landscape health is possible as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.

AB Mass balance measurements in the Canadian Arctic are limited, particularly for smaller glaciers, which introduces significant uncertainties in regional mass balance assessment. Here we report on the correlations between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra albedo measurements (Version 6) and net annual mass balance for five glaciers in the Canadian Arctic over the period 2002-2016. Three glacier albedo aggregation methods are tested for the melt season (June, July and August): minimum, raw average, and interpolated average. These are evaluated in terms of a 53-71% reduction in observations due to cloud cover in the raw albedo time series. For the minimum method, the whole glacier albedo is calculated from the average of the minimum melt season albedo of each grid cell, irrespective of the day on which they occurred, resulting in R-2 values between 0.20 and 0.87. In the raw average method, averaging all albedo values within a glacier outline over the melt season improves the correlation to mass balance to a range of 0.61-0.95. In the interpolated average method, linear interpolation of the raw average albedo values to fill cloud gaps, then averaging them, improves the raw average correlations for all ice masses by similar to 5% (R-2 range 0.68-0.97). Overall, the interpolated average albedo method performs substantially better for the smallest glacier than the minimum or the raw average methods. The most negative net mass balance occurs at Grise Fiord Glacier, which is the smallest (<4.0 km(2)), but not the lowest elevation, glacier analysed. For this glacier, the interpolated average albedo improves the correlation with mass balance to an R-2 = 0.68 (p-value < .05), compared to an R-2 = 0.17 for the minimum albedo method (p-value > .05). When the five glaciers' interpolated average albedo is correlated to their ensemble mass balance, an R-2 = 0.82 is achieved. These results show that interpolated MODIS Terra melt season albedo measurements can realistically approximate net annual glacier mass balance for Arctic glaciers and ice caps, without additional information about precipitation or temperature, and in the absence of a melt model.

AB Crop lodging assessment is essential for evaluating yield damage and informing crop management decisions for sustainable agricultural production. While a few studies have demonstrated the potential of optical and SAR data for crop lodging assessment, large-scale crop lodging assessment has been hampered by the unavailability of dense satellite time series data. The unprecedented availability of free Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data may provide a basis for operational detection and monitoring of crop lodging. In this context, this study aims to understand the effect of lodging on backscatter/coherence and spectral reflectance derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and to detect lodging incidence in wheat using time-series analysis. Crop biophysical parameters were measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara, Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were further categorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles of backscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severity classes throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukey tests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed that red edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularly healthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarily of 1/V and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging in wheat. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has contributed to this application.

AB Underground coal mining with high groundwater levels causes many environmental problems, one of the main ones being subsidence waterlogging. After the subsidence waterlogging, the land faces many problems, such as insufficient land development and difficult and costly land restoration. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the spatial range and temporal trajectory pattern of surface subsidence in a timely manner. When information about underground mining is lacking, it is difficult by using remote sensing alone to identify and distinguish (i) natural water, (ii) engineering water, and (iii) subsidence waterlogging. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to develop a method to detect subsidence waterlogging area and the disturbance year. The method includes pixel-based trajectory extraction and object-based water type recognition. First, LandTrendr is used to extract the change water (engineering water and subsidence waterlogging) pixels and its disturbance year. Then, the morphological method to further eliminate engineering water patches, so as to extract subsidence waterlogging. We selected the Panxie mining area in Huainan, China as the study area. Using 33 years of Landsat timeseries data to generate values of the annual water frequency index, maps of the year of water accumulation caused by underground coal mining and the year of restoration during 1989-2016 are drawn with accuracies of 86.5% and 80.7%, respectively. The results show that from 1989 to 2016, the accumulated area of subsidence waterlogging was 7715.25 ha, accounting for 14.5% of the total area of the study area, of which 75.8% occurred from 2008 to 2016. Furthermore, the accumulated area of restoration was 207.18 ha, which occurred after 2007 and accounts for 2.7% of the total area of subsidence waterlogging. Based on the analysis results of the changes of waterlogging types, the best time window for restoration of the waterlogging area is 3y after water accumulation. The main innovation of this paper is to make use of the temporal heterogeneity (Number of year in patches, Y_num) and morphological index (Landscape shape index in patches, LSI) of the change water to distinguish engineering water and subsidence waterlogging.

AB Landfast ice is an important component of the Antarctic sea ice regime. It affects the Antarctic climate and ecological system. In this study, the first high-resolution, long time series of the landfast ice edge from 2006 to 2011 and 2016 to 2017 is presented. The dataset was produced based on the improved net gradient difference algorithm using 2470 SAR scenes from ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A/B as well as manual analysis of MODIS imagery to fill in SAR data gaps. The study results show that the landfast ice area in November for all studied years was approximately 49.49 +/- 3.25 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for about 3%-4% of the total Antarctic sea ice area. The maximum area was 55.70 x 10(4) km(2) in November 2007, compared to the minimum area 44.01x10(4) km(2) in 2011. The area in West Antarctica was about 40% of that in East Antarctica. The distribution of landfast ice in Antarctica has significant regional differences. The extent in the Indian Ocean sector is the maximum with a mean value of 16.49 +/- 1.1x 10(4) km(2); however, the ratio of the landfast ice area to the sea ice area in the Pacific Ocean sector is the highest. Twenty-four landfast ice zones with groups of small, grounded icebergs were identified, most of which were located in East Antarctica, particularly along the Wilkes Land and Oates Land. Two cases are presented to illustrate how giant, grounded icebergs affected landfast ice. Results from this study are well suited to underpin the Antarctic climate or ecological system studies.

AB The impacts of climate change such as extreme heat waves are exacerbated in cities where most of the world's population live. Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10-30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 degrees C (R-2 = 0.5), 1.85 degrees C (R-2 = 0.05) and 1.46 degrees C (R-2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with < 250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km(-2)) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 degrees C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners.

AB Satellite remote sensing data are critical for assessing ecosystem state and evaluating long-term trends and shifts in ecosystem components. Many operational tools rely on continuous streams of remote sensing data, and when a satellite sensor reaches the end of its designed lifespan, these tools must be transferred to a more reliable data stream. Transferring between data streams can produce discontinuities in tool products, and it is important to quantify these downstream impacts and understand the mechanisms that cause discontinuity. To illustrate the complexities of tool transfer, we compare five products for ocean chlorophyll-a, which is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and an important input for tools that monitor marine biophysical processes. The five chlorophyll-a products included three blended products and two single sensor products from MODIS and VIIRS. We explored the downstream impacts of tool transfer using EcoCast: an operational dynamic ocean management tool that combines real-time predictions from target and bycatch species distribution models to produce integrated surfaces of fishing suitability. EcoCast was operationalized using MODIS chlorophyll-a, and we quantify the impacts of transferring to the intended replacement of MODIS, VIIRS, and test if impacts can be minimized by using a blended chlorophyll-a product instead. Differences between chlorophyll products did not linearly propagate through to the species model predictions and the integrated fishing suitability surfaces. Instead, differences in species model predictions were determined by the shape of chlorophyll-a response curves in the species models relative to chlorophyll-a differences between sensors. However, differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were reduced by canceling of differences from individual species model predictions. Differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were not reduced by transferring to a blended product, highlighting the complexity of transferring operational tools between different remote sensing data products. These results contribute to our general understanding of the mechanisms by which transferring between data streams impacts downstream products. To aid decision-making regarding tool transfer, we developed an interactive web application that allows end-users to explore differences in chlorophyll products within times period and regions of interest.

AB The quantification of leaf area index (LAI) is essential for modeling the interaction between atmosphere and biosphere. The airborne LiDAR has emerged as an effective tool for mapping plant area index (PAI) in a landscape consisting of both woody and leaf materials. However, the discrimination between woody and leaf materials and the estimation of effective LAI (eLAI) have, to date, rarely been studied at landscape scale. We applied a voxel matching algorithm to estimate eLAI of deciduous forests using simulated and field LiDAR data under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. We classified LiDAR points as either a leaf or a woody hit on leaf-on LiDAR data by matching the point with leaf-off data. We compared the eLAI result of our voxel matching algorithm against the subtraction method, where the leaf-off effective woody area index (eWAI) is subtracted from the effective leaf-on PAI (ePAI). Our results, which were validated against terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI, showed that the voxel matching method, with an optimal voxel size of 0.1 m, produced an unbiased estimation of terrestrial LiDAR derived eLAI with an R-2 of 0.70 and an RMSE of 0.41 (RRMSE: 20.1%). The subtraction method, however, yielded an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 1.02 (RRMSE: 50.1%) with a significant underestimation of 0.94. Reassuringly, the same outcome was observed using a simulated dataset. In addition, we evaluated the performance of 96 LiDAR metrics under leaf-on conditions for eLAI prediction using a statistical model. Based on the importance scores derived from the random forest regression, nine of the 96 leaf-on LiDAR metrics were selected. Cross-validation showed that eLAI could be predicted using these metrics under leaf-on conditions with an R-2 of 0.73 and an RMSE of 0.27 (RRMSE: 17.4%). The voxel matching method yielded a slightly lower accuracy (R-2: 0.70, RMSE:0.41, RRMSE: 20.1%) than the statistical model. We, therefore, suggest that the voxel matching method offers a new opportunity for the estimating eLAI and other ecological applications that require the classification between leaf and woody materials using airborne LiDAR data. It potentially allows transferability to different sites and flight campaigns.

AB Coral reefs are the foundation of productive ecosystems in the global, tropical oceans and are under threat from a variety of local to global scale stressors. Satellite imagery provides a tool to identify and understand the processes that control coral reef degradation, however due to the dynamic nature of seawater constituents, current spaceborne multispectral sensors cannot reliably discriminate between the many coral reef benthic classes necessary to detect change. Hyperspectral imagers may provide sufficient spectral resolution to estimate water column properties and differentiate benthic classes, however, the effects of depth, seawater constituents, and classification algorithm on the accuracy of benthic classifications have not been systematically assessed. Here, we simulate the ability of a spaceborne hyperspectral imager to accurately map fractional cover of coral reef benthic classes under a variety of conditions. Benthic reflectance is simulated by combining pure reflectance spectra of coral, algae, and sand and projecting these mixed spectra through a fully crossed set of water columns. We then use a semi-analytical optimization procedure to estimate the water column properties and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to estimate the fractional cover of the benthic classes using many independent endmember spectra. We compare our estimated benthic class fractions to the original, actual fractions used to produce the mixed coral reef spectra to quantify several measures of error. We found that multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis decreases fractional retrieval error, which is also reduced when the first derivative of the mixed and endmember spectra is used prior to unmixing. The estimation of fractional benthic class cover is most accurate for depths <= 3 m for most water conditions. Depths >= 5 m should be classified only if chlorophyll and sediment concentration are <0.1 mg m(-3) and <0.1 g m(-3), respectively. Our results indicate that the fractional cover of coral and algae should be at least 25% for accurate benthic class estimates (mean relative error < 50%), however there will be many ways to leverage the repeat measurements of a hyperspectral satellite sensor, such as a stable depth retrievals and benthic cover estimates, to produce more accurate and useful fractional cover data. We show how this simulation analysis can be used to generate maps of predicted benthic cover fractional retrieval uncertainty across a coral reef system using aerial hyperspectral imagery acquired over Hawaii, USA, although reef-specific, within pixel variations in depth and benthic class complexity should be considered.

AB The increased availability of systematically acquired high spatial and temporal resolution optical imagery improves the characterization of dynamic land surface processes such as agriculture. The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.

AB Satellite observations of sea ice along marginal ice zones suggest a strong coupling between sea ice transport and the underlying ocean turbulent eddy field. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 in provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean.

AB Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide finely-resolved (meters-scale) images of ocean surface roughness day-or-night in nearly all weather conditions. This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Initially designed for the measurement of directional ocean wave spectra, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes are small 20 km scenes that have been collected globally since 2014. Recent WV data exploration reveals that many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are also well captured, but not yet employed by the scientific community. However, expanding applications of this whole massive dataset beyond ocean waves requires a strategy to automatically identify these geophysical phenomena. In this study, we propose to apply the emerging deep learning approach in ocean SAR scenes classification. The training is performed using a hand-curated dataset that describes ten commonly-occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. Our model evaluation relies on an independent assessment dataset and shows satisfactory and robust classification results. To further illustrate the model performance, regional patterns of rain and sea ice are qualitatively analyzed and found to be very consistent with independent remote sensing datasets. In addition, these high-resolution WV SAR data can resolve fine, sub-km scale, spatial structure of rain events and sea ice that complement other satellite measurements. Overall, such automated SAR vignettes classification may open paths for broader geophysical application of maritime Sentinel-1 acquisitions.

AB Plant water use strategy is one of the key factors to predict drought impact on vegetation and land-atmosphere fluxes. Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave radiative transfer inversion has recently been used to assess plant water use strategy. However, VOD is sensitive to both total aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf water content, with only the latter being a proxy of leaf water potential whose diurnal variation can be used to characterize vegetation iso/anisohydricity. In this study, by using a network of soil water measurements (used as a proxy for predawn leaf water potential), satellite retrieved normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, as a proxy for AGB), and two satellite VOD products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor, we compare three linear models and one machine learning model to investigate to what extent can VOD be used to represent leaf water potential changes during soil moisture dry-down periods. Linear models with both NDVI and leaf water potential, on average, can explain 33% and 51% of VOD variations of each product respectively. Models using only NDVI explain 27% and 46% of the VOD variance, compared to less than 10% by models using leaf water potential only. With the NDVI and leaf water potential (full) model, leaf water potential contributes around 17% of the VOD variance, which is smaller than NDVI (33%). The machine learning model has overall better performance than the linear models, and also highlight the dominant contribution of AGB to VOD signals. After the AGB contribution to VOD is eliminated by normalizing daytime VOD with nighttime VOD, the residuals carry the information of diurnal variations of leaf water potential and calculations from both VOD datasets are consistent with each other (r = 0.42 +/- 0.17, P < 0.01 for 88 out of 94 sites). The response of VODdaytime/VODnighttime to soil water potential can also be used as a new metric for ecosystem iso/anisohydricity. Our study demonstrates that a large proportion of variations in VOD are caused by AGB for temperate ecosystems, and higher accuracy VOD products with additional root-zone soil water potential are needed for ecosystem iso/anisohydricity estimations.

AB Volcanoes with rugged terrain remain a challenging target for generating high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), especially in tropical areas with frequent cloud cover. Using Nevado del Ruiz volcano as an example, we combined DEMs from the TanDEM-X (TDX) satellite mission, terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI), and Structure from Motion (SfM), to generate a new DEM with 10-m spatial resolution. This is the first study combining satellite radar, ground-based radar, photography, and freely available global DEMs to generate a high-resolution DEM without data gaps. TDX data from ascending and descending orbits were combined to generate the base DEM. Instead of using a raster format to fuse DEMs generated from different data sets with different resolutions, we developed a methodology based on 3-D point clouds: 1) re-georeference the 5-m TRI and similar to 1-m SfM DEMs to the 10-m TDX DEM using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to minimize the horizontal and vertical discrepancy between DEMs; then 2) merge the multiple point clouds to generate a final DEM without data gaps using an adaptive algorithm that uses two search distances to smooth the transition at the edges of different data sets. We assess the new 10-m DEM by comparing simulated inundation zones obtained with two volcano flow models, LaharZ (for lahars) and VolcFlow (for pyroclastic flows), and find significant differences with respect to the 30-m SRTM DEM. Our LaharZ simulation over the new DEM shows a longer lahar run-out distance. For pyroclastic flows, the VolcFlow simulation over the new DEM produces highly channelized flows over the steep portions of a river channel and gives a larger extent of thicker deposits compared to those obtained with the 30-m SRTM DEM. Quantitative and qualitative geomorphic analysis suggests that up-to-date DEMs with high spatial resolution (similar to 10 m or even better) need to be generated to improve volcano hazard assessment for active volcanoes.

AB Freely available Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) are essential for many scientific and humanitarian applications. Recently, TanDEM-X 90 has been released with a global coverage at 3?arc sec resolution. Its release is sure to generate keen interest as it provides an alternative to the widely used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, especially for flood risk management as for low slope floodplains height errors can become particularly significant. Here, we provide a first accuracy assessment of TanDEM-X 90 for selected floodplain sites and compare it to other popular global DEMs - the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the error-reduced version of SRTM called Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM. We characterize vertical height errors by comparing against high resolution LiDAR DEMs for 32 floodplain locations in 6 continents. Results indicate that the average vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X 90 and MERIT are similar and are both a significant improvement on SRTM. We further our analysis by assessing vertical accuracy by landcover, with our results suggesting that TanDEM-X 90 is the most accurate global DEM in all landcover categories tested except short vegetation and tree-covered areas where MERIT is demonstrably more accurate. Lastly, we present the first characterization of the spatial error structure of any TanDEM-X DEM product, and find the spatial error structure is similar to MERIT, with MERIT generally having lower sill values and larger ranges than TanDEM-X 90 and SRTM. Our findings suggest that TanDEM-X 90 has the potential to become the benchmark global DEM in floodplains with careful removal of errors from vegetation, and at this stage should be used alongside MERIT in any flood risk application.

AB Accurate estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) are essential for assessing global carbon balances. ESA's Sentinel-2 (S2) mission with its decametric resolution enables to derive fAPAR information at single forest stand. Validation studies on previously existing satellite-derived fAPAR products have found considerable discrepancies, especially in forest ecosystems that exceed relative discrepancies of 10% (i.e. 0.05 for absolute values) set as target accuracy by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).
   This study presents the validation of S2 fAPAR products using direct radiation measurements of 2017 at three different forests, located in Central Europe (mixed-coniferous forest in temperate mid-latitude), North America (boreal-deciduous forest) and Central America (tropical dry forest, TDF). We measured incoming and transmitted PAR every 10 min synchronously using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and calculated a two-flux fAPAR estimate. We validated the S2 fAPAR product with different instantaneous ground fAPAR estimates (e.g. instantaneous fAPAR at 10:00 and 14:00 local solar time) and daily average fAPAR. We considered uncertainties of ground data, i.e. bias related to the presence of colored autumn leaves and influences of solar zenith angle.
   Overall, we found high discrepancies between the S2 fAPAR product and ground measurements, indicating that the S2 fAPAR product systematically underestimated (negative values for bias in percent) the ground observations. The highest agreement was observed at the boreal-deciduous forest stand with a bias of -13% (R-2 = 0.67). The Central American and European sites reported deviations of -20% (R-2 = 0.68) and -25% (R-2 = 0.26), respectively. At all sites, we found evidence that particularly the influence of colored leaves during the senescence periods lead to bias of the ground data. Further, the choice of temporal fAPAR estimate, i.e. daily average fAPAR or a certain instantaneous fAPAR estimate, lead to partly different results in the correlation analysis with the S2 fAPAR product. However, considering sources of uncertainties of ground data, we emphasize that only the boreal-deciduous site in Canada fulfilled the accuracy requirements set by the GCOS.
   In contrast to absolute values, we found strong agreement on phenological changes at all three sites. Specifically, the influence of species composition on seasonal variability of fAPAR across the European mixed coniferous site was well-represented in the S2 fAPAR product. As for the representation of spatial variability, we found highest agreement at the boreal-deciduous forest stand (BIAS = -22%, R-2 = 0.93), whereas spatial variability was least represented at the TDF site (BIAS = 125%, R-2 = 0.97). We conclude that the S2 fAPAR product has strong capabilities for assessing temporal variability of fAPAR, but due to low accuracy of absolute values currently limited options to feed global production efficiency models and assess global carbon balances.

AB Knowledge of crop phenology assists in making agricultural decisions such as appropriate irrigation and fertilization applications in order to optimize crop yield. The objective of this study is to monitor crop phenology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric decompositions and a random forest algorithm applied to a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset, acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB). The model-based and eigen-based polarimetric parameters are used to separate the vegetation and soil scattering contributions in the total radar signal. As the crop morphological shape and structure vary with phenological growth, our study assumes that the polarimetric parameters related to the volume scattering mechanism have the potential to track the crop phenology. The sensitivity of the polarimetric parameters to the ground identified crop phenology is analyzed for different crop types. For canola, a single polarimetric parameter is sufficient to characterize the crop phenology, due to the high volume scattering power and large temporal dynamic. For corn, soybean and wheat, combinations of multiple polarimetric parameters are required. For each crop type, the Random Forest algorithm trained using 60% of the data is used to retrieve the, crop phenology. Performances are compared to Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression and k-Nearest neighborhood algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm provides the best phenology retrieval with significant (p-value < 0.01) spearman correlation coefficients (between the retrieved and ground identified phenology) of 0.93, 0.90, 0.85 and 0.91 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. While a single polarimetric parameter demonstrates limited sensitivity to corn phenology, the retrieved phenology from the Random Forest algorithm using multiple polarimetric parameters agrees well with the ground measurements. Furthermore, the importance of different polarimetric parameters for phenology retrieval using the Random Forest algorithm is quantified for different crop types. These findings will be of interest in developing future analytical retrieval models.

AB Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST), due to its synoptic coverage, has been widely used for understanding surface energy and carbon fluxes at local, regional, and global scales. Despite great achievements in developing practical algorithms to estimate LSTs from thermal infrared (TIR) data, the retrieval of LSTs for overcast conditions has received much less attention. Existing techniques, such as passive microwave (PMW) approaches, surface energy balance (SEB) models, and reconstruction algorithms relying on spatial/temporal information, for estimating LSTs under cloudy skies cannot fulfill the need for a spatially and temporally consistent LST dataset. Inspired by recent advancements in physically-based urban canopy models (UCMs), this study synergistically used the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)/UCM system and the random forest (RF) regression technique (hereafter named as WRFF) to effectively estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Taking the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan region as a test site, the WRF/UCM simulations (LSTs) were performed from April 28 to May 20, 2011. The MODIS LST images of the same period were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method introduced in this study. LSTs under cloudy conditions for a partially cloudy image were retrieved using the RF model calibrated by clear-sky pixels from the same image. For a fully cloud-contaminated image, clear-sky pixels from its temporally adjacent images were used to calibrate the RF model to estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Results showed that the modeling system could well capture diurnal air temperature variations but tended to underestimate temperature values. The correlation coefficient between MODIS LSTs and simulated LSTs exhibited a wide range from 0.5 to 0.9 with the RMSE (root mean square error) value varying from 1.0 to 9.0 K across different land covers. The utilization of the RF regression technique for estimating LSTs under cloudy conditions from a partially cloud-contaminated LST image greatly reduced the RMSE to similar to 1.8 K with an improved correlation coefficient. For fully cloud-contaminated LST images, LSTs were estimated with the correlation coefficient and RMSE values of similar to 0.75 and similar to 2.0 K, respectively. Overall, the WRFF method has potential to generate a consistent and reliable LST dataset for various applications such as quantification of urban heat island intensity and vulnerability analysis of humans to vector-borne diseases. Further research should be made to examine the impact of the temporal distance between the target image and its temporally adjacent images on the performance of the proposed method.

AB This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against SAR-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice-open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.
   With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.

AB Future SAR missions will provide three-dimensional images of semi-transparent media, such as vegetation and ice, through SAR tomography. Access to information on the internal structure of these volume scatterers is a key factor for a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics and climate change. Because of this, several concepts are nowadays examined to implement SAR tomography in a spaceborne framework.
   In order to do that, it is necessary to gather different observations of the area of interest. Unfortunately, a consequence of the time that elapses between acquisitions is that the electromagnetic properties of the medium may vary. This implies that, there may be inconsistencies in the acquired data, leading to errors in the final inversion. A solution to partially cope with this temporal decorrelation, is to acquire data employing two or more sensors operating with a reduced (or even absent) temporal gap and then to collect several acquisitions at different time instants. By means of this imaging concept, the required line-of-sight diversity is granted and the desired resolution in the height direction ensured. In this way, sets of temporal decorrelation-free interferometric coherences can be built and the vertical scattering profile can be retrieved via coherence-based tomography.
   This contribution analyzes a two-sensor system like TanDEM-X (Krieger et al., 2007), Tandem-L (Moreira et al., 2015), or SAOCOM-CS (Davidson et al., 2014). In particular, the potential of coherence-based tomography are shown with data acquired with the TanDEM-X sensors for boreal and Amazon forest. In addition, a technique to partially cope with temporal decorrelation through covariance matrix filtering is also presented in the paper.

AB Digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from remote sensing data provide a valuable and consistent data source for mapping coastal flooding at local and global scales. Mapping of flood risk requires quantification of the error in DEM elevations and its effect on delineation of flood zones. The ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X (TDX) DEMs for the island of Hispaniola were examined by comparing them with GPS and LiDAR measurements. The comparisons were based on a series of error measures including root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute error at 90% quantile (LE90). When compared with > 2000 GPS measurements with elevations below 7 m, RMSE and LE90 values for ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, TDX DEMs were 8.44 and 14.29, 3.82 and 5.85, 2.08 and 3.64, and 1.74 and 3.20 m, respectively. In contrast, RMSE and LE90 values for the same DEMs were 4.24 and 6.70, 4.81 and 7.16, 4.91 and 6.82, and 2.27 and 3.66 m when compared to DEMs from 150 km 2 LiDAR data, which included elevations as high as 20 m. The expanded area with LiDAR coverage included additional types of land surface, resulting in differences in error measures. Comparison of RMSEs indicated that the filtering of TDX DEMs using four methods improved the accuracy of the estimates of ground elevation by 20-43%. DTMs generated by interpolating the ground pixels from a progressive morphological filter, using an empirical Bayesian kriging method, produced an RMSE of 1.06 m and LE90 of 1.73 m when compared to GPS measurements, and an RMSE of 1.30 m and LE90 of 2.02 m when compared to LiDAR data. Differences in inundation areas based on TDX and LiDAR DTMs were between - 13% and - 4% for scenarios of 3, 5, 10, and 15 m water level rise, a much narrower range than inundation differences between ASTER, SRTM, ALOS and LiDAR. The TDX DEMs deliver high resolution global DEMs with unprecedented elevation accuracy, hence, it is recommended for mapping coastal flood risk zones on a global scale, as well as at a local scale in developing countries where data with higher accuracy are unavailable.

AB This study is a preliminary contribution to the European Space Agency's efforts aimed at establishing reference in situ networks specifically targeted to validate coastal altimetry. For this purpose, we processed and cross-compared conjointly improved altimetry data and in situ measurements acquired over the Ligurian Sea - a coastal region of the Mediterranean characterised by complex, fine-scale and rapidly evolving oceanic features. We made use of several kinds of multi-sensor in situ observations located along SARAL and Jason-2 tracks. The main objectives of the study were to assess improved coastal oriented validation strategies, including the usage of a new in situ platform (Moving Vessel Profiler), while better understanding potential differences owing to physical content inconsistency and instrumental or data processing limitations. The results show remarkable agreements over spatial scales of few tens of kilometres, paving the way for the deployment of future in situ networks and the definition of science-oriented diagnostics targeted to assess the capability of present and future high-resolution altimetric missions in resolving small-scale physical features.

TI Gradients in urban material composition: A new concept to map cities
   with spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data

AB To understand processes in urban environments, such as urban energy fluxes or surface temperature patterns, it is important to map urban surface materials. Airborne imaging spectroscopy data have been successfully used to identify urban surface materials mainly based on unmixing algorithms. Upcoming spaceborne Imaging Spectrometers (IS), such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), will reduce the time and cost-critical limitations of airborne systems for Earth Observation (EO). However, the spatial resolution of all operated and planned IS in space will not be higher than 20 to 30 m and, thus, the detection of pure Endmember (EM) candidates in urban areas, a requirement for spectral unmixing, is very limited. Gradient analysis could be an alternative method for retrieving urban surface material compositions in pixels from spaceborne IS. The gradient concept is well known in ecology to identify plant species assemblages formed by similar environmental conditions but has never been tested for urban materials. However, urban areas also contain neighbourhoods with similar physical, compositional and structural characteristics. Based on this assumption, this study investigated (1) whether cover fractions of surface materials change gradually in urban areas and (2) whether these gradients can be adequately mapped and interpreted using imaging spectroscopy data (e.g. EnMAP) with 30 m spatial resolution.
   Similarities of material compositions were analysed on the basis of 153 systematically distributed samples on a detailed surface material map using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Determined gradient scores for the first two gradients were regressed against the corresponding mean reflectance of simulated EnMAP spectra using Partial Least Square regression models. Results show strong correlations with R-2 = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.24 and 0.21 for the first and second axis, respectively. The subsequent mapping of the first gradient reveals patterns that correspond to the transition from predominantly vegetation classes to the dominance of artificial materials. Patterns resulting from the second gradient are associated with surface material compositions that are related to finer structural differences in urban structures. The composite gradient map shows patterns of common surface material compositions that can be related to urban land use classes such as Urban Structure Types (UST). By linking the knowledge of typical material compositions with urban structures, gradient analysis seems to be a powerful tool to map characteristic material compositions in 30 m imaging spectroscopy data of urban areas.

AB Satellite retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) have become necessary for many applications. Satellite infrared imaging radiometers passively measure the radiance emitted and reflected by the surface of the Earth and atmosphere. Tropospheric aerosols increase the signal attenuation at the satellite height, degrading the accuracy of SST retrievals. In this study to assess the infrared radiative effects of aerosols on satellite-derived skin SSTs (SSTskin), MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) SSTskin retrievals are compared with quality-controlled, collocated SSTskin, measurements from the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) deployed on research cruises during the Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE), and sub-surface temperatures measured by thermistors on drifting buoys. In this region, SSTskin retrievals from the MODIS on the Aqua satellite are generally much cooler than the in-situ measurements. In the Saharan outflow area between 90 W to 90 degrees E and 20 degrees S to 35 degrees N where aerosol optical depths may be > 0.5, satellite SSTskin are often > 1 K cooler than the in situ data. The goal of this research is to determine the characteristics of aerosol effects on satellite retrieved infrared SST, and to derive formulae for improving accuracies of infrared-derived SSTs in aerosol-contaminated regions. A new method to derive a night-time Dust-induced SST Difference Index (DSDI) algorithm based on simulated brightness temperatures and Principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) at infrared wavelengths of 3.8, 8.9, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, was developed using radiative transfer simulations. The satellite SSTskin biases and standard deviations, derive by comparisons with coincident and collocated surface and in situ measurements, are reduced by 0.263 K and 0.166 K after the DSDI correction. This method can also improve the fraction of useful data available compared to the usual approach of discarding measurements identified as being contaminated by the effects of aerosols.

TI Estimation of the nearshore bathymetry from high temporal resolution
   Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data - A case study

ID MARINE RADAR IMAGES; COASTAL BATHYMETRY; ZONE
AB The study of the changes in swell properties in the nearshore domain due to interaction with the sea-bottom to infer the bathymetry has deserved some attention in the last few years. Satellite Remote Sensing images, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), have been used to produce a directional wave spectrum by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), from which the wavelength and wave direction of the ocean surface waves can be retrieved. These wave properties can be directly used in the linear dispersion relation to estimate the water depth.
   The present work takes advantages from the very short revisit times of the Sentinel-1A with C-band (5.405 GHz) SAR images with 10 m of spatial resolution to study the repeatability of this methodology for deriving the nearshore sea-bottom morphology, using a case study in the Aveiro region, located in the Portuguese West Coast. This site is exposed to high energetic wave climate of the North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, a set of four images were selected for the analysis.
   The robustness of the FFT methodology to calculate the wavelength and wave direction from SAR images was analysed through calculating their standard deviations. The errors of estimating the local bathymetry from these quantities was accessed which allowed to quantify the water depth limits of application of this methodology.
   The set of images was used to establish a bathymetric estimation that merges the derived bathymetry of each image. The computed bathymetry was quantitatively compared with the measurements made in 2013 and available at RATA Observatory. The relative error of the water depth ranges between 6% and 10%, but increases for the higher depths and depends on the accuracy of the computed wavelength at deep-waters. The merged derived bathymetry also provides a better approximation for the measured bathymetry than those derived from the individual images.

AB Oklahoma experienced three earthquakes of M(w)5.0 or greater in 2016: the 13-Feb. Fairview earthquake (M(w)5.1), the 03-Sep. Pawnee earthquake (M(w)5.8), and the 07-Nov. Cushing earthquake (M(w)5.0). These events are the first earthquakes in the state exceeding M(w)5.0 since the 2011 M(w)5.7 Prague earthquake and likely result from wide scale deep fluid-injection. We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to quantify the magnitude and location of surface deformation associated with these three events, determine the depth ranges of fault slip, and assess the spatial relationship between fault slip and well-calibrated mainshock and aftershock locations. We also include newly reported, calibrated event locations for the Cushing earthquake. We find that the Pawnee earthquake ruptured within the crystalline basement with the shallowest slip occurring at depths of 3.1-4.3 km. We find a similar, though shallower, crystalline basement source for the Cushing earthquake with a minimum depth to slip of 1.6-2.3 km. Despite the smaller magnitude of the Cushing earthquake, it generated anomalously high ground motions and damage compared to the larger Pawnee and Fairview earthquakes. We postulate that the shallow source of the Cushing earthquakes provides one explanation for the higher than expected ground motions. The Fairview earthquake generated no detectable co-seismic displacements, which is consistent with a relatively deep earthquake source (similar to 8.5 km). We do, however, identify a 16 km stretch of floodplain where widespread liquefaction occurred in response to the Fairview earthquake, and where 30 gas production wells were exposed to surface displacements exceeding 5 cm. Consequently, the depth to crystalline basement, which limits the depth of injection-induced earthquakes in Oklahoma, and the potential for liquefaction are important factors in assessing shaking risk in the central United States.

AB The Linfen-Yuncheng Basin (LYB) in China is a region possessing severe geo-hazards, including active tectonic fault movement, land subsidence and ground fissures among others. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique is applied to map surface deformation associated with various geo-hazards in this basin. The poly-interferogram rate and time-series estimator algorithm (Pi-RATE) is used over forty-nine scenes of SAR data to generate the deformation maps over the entire LYB. The precision of InSAR results is around 3 mm/yr. Some active faults and ground fissures are successfully detected. The spatiotemporal characteristics of tableland uplift, faults displacement and basin subsidence are quantitatively monitored with InSAR technique ranging from 2 mm/yr to 142 mm/yr. Finally, the mechanisms of surface deformation regarding large scale Zhongtiaoshan fault, middle scale basin land subsidence and small scale ground fissures are discussed in terms of interseismic movement, underground water level changes and hydrostratigraphic heterogeneity.

AB In this study, we assess the accuracy of a combined geostrophic and Ekman current product (GlobCurrent) that estimates ocean currents at 15 m depth, by coupling it to a synthetic particle tracking tool and comparing the virtual trajectories to those of surface drifting buoys drogued at 15 m in the Greater Agulhas Current Region. The velocities from a total of 1041 drifters are compared and evaluated to the synthetic particle-derived velocities for the period 1993-2015. On average the GlobCurrent underestimates the velocity in the Greater Agulhas Current by approximately 27%. The underestimation ranges from 4 to 64% in different regions, with the smallest error found in the Agulhas retroflection region, and the highest in the Benguela Upwelling System. Furthermore, we compare the time taken for the separation between the virtual and real drifters to reach 35 km. The mean separation time was found to be 78 h, with the shortest time (35 h) found in the Agulhas Current and the longest time (116 h) located in the Agulhas Return Current. Deploying 10,000 virtual drifters in a 1 degrees x 1 degrees box within the southern Agulhas Current shows a convergence of trajectories towards the core of the current, while higher divergence is evident in the Agulhas retroflection. To evaluate the utility of this synthetic particle tracking tool coupled with GlobCurrent in open ocean search and rescue operations, two test cases are examined: (1) a capsized catamaran spotted south of Cape Recife and recovered 5 days later south of Cape Agulhas; and (2) a drifter trajectory in the same region. The comparison suggests that the GlobCurrent forced synthetic particle tracking tool is not appropriate for predicting the trajectory of a capsized catamaran that does not have the same drift characteristics as a surface drifting buoy drogued to 15 m.

AB The information of urban dynamics at fine spatiotemporal resolutions is crucial to urban growth modeling and sustainable urban development. However, there are still challenges in deriving the change information of urbanization in timing and location over a long period. In this study, we developed a framework to map urban expansion at an annual interval from 1985 to 2015 by using the time series of Landsat data. First, the time series of Landsat data (1985-2015) were grouped into three periods, i.e., 1985-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2015, according to the available National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Then, a temporal segmentation approach was implemented for each period using three indicators representing changes from vegetation, water, and bare land to urban. Turning years of the start and end of change were identified. Three temporal segments representing phases of prior change, change, and post change, were generated accordingly. Thereafter, urban extents before 2001 and after 2011 were classified using a change vector analysis (CVA) based approach aided by the NLCD and identified temporal segments. Finally, urbanized pixels in each period were determined according to the identified turning years. Our approach of temporal segmentation is reliable for detecting changes caused by urban growth, with an overall accuracy of 90% in identifying turning years (+/- 1 year). Using an independent validation sample set, the CVA based approach reaches an overall accuracy of 87%. The derived product of urban dynamics shows a relatively stable increment of urban growth in Des Moines and Ames, Iowa, US, and most urbanized areas were converted from vegetated lands within 2-3 years. The proposed framework is capable of mapping long-term dynamics of urban extents at an annual interval and the outcome is useful in effectively updating current products of urban extents and improving urban growth modeling.

AB Rugged terrain distorts optical remote sensing signals, and land-cover classification and biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions must account for topographic effects. Therefore, topographic correction is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. In this study, we proposed a semi-physically based and simple topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction (PLC). The PLC method was derived from the solution to the classic radiative transfer equation, and the influence of terrain on the radiative transfer process within the canopy is explicitly considered, making PLC physically sound. The radiative transfer equation was simplified to make PLC mathematically simple. Near-nadir observations derived from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image covering a mountainous region and wide field-of-view observations derived from simulation using a canopy reflectance model were combined to test the PLC correction method. Multi-criteria were used to provide objective evaluation results. The performances were compared to that of five other methods: CC, SCS + C, and SE, which are empirical parameter-based methods, and SCS and DS, which are semi-physical methods without empirical parameter. All the six methods could significantly reduce the topographic effects. However, SCS showed obvious overcorrection for near-nadir observations. The correction results from D-S showed an obvious positive bias. For near-nadir observations, the performance of PLC was comparable to the well-validated parameter-based methods. For wide field-of-view observations, PLC obviously outperformed all other methods. Because of the physical soundness and mathematical simplicity, PLC provides an efficient approach to correct the terrain-induced canopy BRDF distortion and will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular information for biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions.

AB Near-surface specific humidity (q(a)) and air temperature (T-a) over the global ocean are important meteorological variables, but they cannot be retrieved directly from remote sensing. Many efforts have been made to develop algorithms that derive q(a) and T-a from multisensor microwave and/or infrared observations using in situ measurements as training datasets. However, uncertainty remains large in the resultant q(a) and T-a retrievals. In this study, 147 moored surface buoys are used to examine how buoy measured q(a) and T-a are related to satellite microwave brightness temperature (Tb) on the spatial scale from the warm/humid tropics to the cold/dry high latitudes. It is found that the Tb - q(a) and Tb - T-a relations are structured along two distinct, near-linear bands, with the primary band in the warm/humid regime and a secondary (weaker) band in the cold/dry regime. The step-like transition (or separation) between the two regimes occurs at 8-10 g kg(-1) for q(a) and 14-17 degrees C for T-a. The evidence suggests that one algorithm may not be sufficient to extract q(a) and T-a from Tb in all regimes. Therefore, a high-latitude enhancement is added to the global algorithm so that the q(a) and T-a retrievals in the dry/cold regime can be specifically addressed. The new algorithms are applied to 11 microwave sensors, including SSM/I, SSMIS, and AMSU-A, from 1988 to 2016. Based on the 475,717 buoy collocations during the 29-year period, the retrieved q(a) and T-a have root-mean-square differences of 0.82 g kg(-1) and 0.51 degrees C, respectively.

AB Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Models (ASTER GDEM), or Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM (SRTM) are widely used in remote areas and non-industrial countries because of their availability rather than their accuracy. Although a global DEM can be considerably enhanced using additional reference information such as higher resolution DEMs or ground truth points, improving accuracy in areas without reference data remains a challenge. This paper develops an approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated topography by combining two complementary DEMs (ASTER GDEM 1 arc-second and SRTM DEM 1 arc-second) in regions missing reference data. The combination approach is based on formulating relationships between slopes and weights in sites with reference data. Then the developed relationships are applied to sites with similar geomorphology to determine the combination weight for each DEM without using reference data. The results indicate that combined DEMs offer significant improvements of 47% and 20% in mean bias over a mountainous site, and 16% and 58% at a low-relief site when compared with the SRTM and ASTER GDEM products, respectively. DEM-derived drainages were also found to be more accurate for the combined DEMs than the near-global DEMs in areas where reference data is not available.

AB Hyperspectral seafloor surveys using airborne or spaceborne sensors are generally limited to shallow coastal areas, due to the requirement for target illumination by sunlight. Deeper marine environments devoid of sunlight cannot be imaged by conventional hyperspectral imagers. Instead, a close-range, sunlight-independent hyper spectral survey approach is required. In this study, we present the first hyperspectral image data from the deep seafloor. The data were acquired in approximately 4200 m water depth using a new Underwater Hyperspectral Imager (UHI) mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). UHI data were recorded for 112 spectral bands between 378 nm and 805 nm, with a high spectral (4 nm) and spatial resolution (1 mm per image pixel). The study area was located in a manganese nodule field in the Peru Basin (SE Pacific), close to the DISCOL (DISturbance and reCOLonization) experimental area. To test whether underwater hyperspectral imaging can be used for detection and mapping of mineral deposits in potential deep-sea mining areas, we compared two supervised classification methods, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The results show that SVM is superior to SAM and is able to accurately detect nodule surfaces. The UHI therefore represents a promising tool for high-resolution seafloor exploration and characterisation prior to resource exploitation.

AB Late-winter lake ice regimes are controlled by water depth relative to maximum ice thickness (MIT). When MIT exceeds maximum water depth, lakes freeze to the bottom with bedfast ice (BI) and when MIT is less than maximum water depth lakes have floating ice (El). Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or El regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992-2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93% accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3% of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.

AB Through band unification and inter-calibration this paper develops and presents a method to construct virtual dual-view sensors from compatible geostationary and low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) sensors such that spectrally unified and radiometrically consistent observations from two different angles can be acquired using these virtual sensors. Results for three virtual dual-view sensors constructed from Himawari-8/AHI (one of the next generation of geostationary sensors) paired with MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS are reported. Over 1270 representative Hyperion passes were used to reproduce, by spectral band integration, "simultaneous" observations by the three pairs of sensors, and linear relationships between AHI-MODIS and AHI-VIIRS were established, allowing the conversion of MODIS bands and VIIRS bands to AHI bands. For 95% of the sample pixels, a maximum reflectance conversion error < 0.004 was achieved. Following band conversion, inter-calibration was conducted using a ray-matching technique, involving up to 2100 matchup areas from 20 months of imagery. Overall the final calibration accuracy is high as indicated by high correlation r(2) (similar to 0.98), small estimated parameter errors, small regression errors and negligible regression biases. The temporal drifting of the paired sensors over a 20 month period was also analysed. It shows that all the involved sensors are very stable. Accurate inter-calibration not only provides an economical solution for the calibration an Fd validation of remote sensors, it is also essential for synergetic multi-sensor applications. Lack of sufficient information from single-view sensors has been a common bottleneck in many remote sensing applications. Constructing virtual dual-view sensors using the presented method provides an effective way to overcome the limitations of single-view sensors, without incurring extra costs. The method can be applied to other next generation geostationary sensors leading to near global coverage and enhanced products. Inter-calibration between geostationary sensors, such as Himawari AHI - and GOES-R ABI, may be conducted using the LEO sensors as bridges.

AB The study elucidate upon the evaluation of satellite retrievals with ground based aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements, their utilization in LiDAR ratio (LR) estimation, boundary layer (BL) height determination and the case studies on aerosol transport over Himalayan region. The AOD retrievals from the latest level-2 data collections (C5.1 and C6.0) of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra satellites and Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) versions (4.10 and 3) are subjected for quantitative analysis to assess the level of agreement with the quality assured level-2 ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements over Manora peak (29.36 degrees N, 79.46 E), a high altitude site in the Himalayas. Analysis revealed that the AOD from the latest MODIS Terra C6.0 deep blue (DB) 30 km x 30 km and CALIPSO ver. 4.10 (overpass within similar to 100 km distance) are in a very good agreement (R >= 0.9) with that from coincident AERONET measurements averaged over the span of 30 min. About 77% of the AOD retrieved using MODIS and similar to 87% from CALIPSO were found to be within the expected error (EE) limits. The AOD comparison between MODIS Terra C6.0 DB and CALIPSO ver. 4.10, suggested their synergic use for aerosol characterization over Himalayas. In comparison to the ver. 3, CALIPSO ver. 4.10 is found to have undergone substantial changes, and their long term inter-comparison in the grid 28.86 degrees-29.86 degrees N and 78.96 degrees-79.96 degrees E revealed that their vertical feature and aerosol sub-types are in agreement of similar to 94.6% and similar to 68.6%, respectively. Utilizing the AOD retrievals from AERONET and MODIS collections, the iteratively computed LR for three LiDAR systems was found to be lower (< 16) during winter and higher (> 43) during summer. Study on the BL height estimations suggested that the wavelet covariance transform (WCT) method for CALIPSO could be the best choice as compared to the threshold method, and complements well with the specific humidity gradient method used with the radiosonde observation. Case studies on the continental transport of smoke plumes emanating from crop-residue burning in post-monsoon, and long range transport of aerosols and dust over the region in summer are also discussed using the collocated measurements from ground-based AERONET and LiDAR, in conjunction with MODIS, CALIPSO, reanalysis data and trajectory modeling.

AB This paper explores for the first time the possibilities to use two land surface temperature (LST) time series of different origins (geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellite data and Noah land surface modelling, LSM), to detect geothermal anomalies and extract the geothermal component of LST, the LSTgt. We hypothesize that in geothermal areas the LSM time series will underestimate the LST as compared to the remote sensing data, since the former does not account for the geothermal component in its model.
   In order to extract LSTgt, two approaches of different nature (physical based and data mining) were developed and tested in an area of about 560 x 560 km(2) centered at the Kenyan Rift. Pre-dawn data in the study area during the first 45 days of 2012 were analyzed.
   The results show consistent spatial and temporal LSTgt patterns between the two approaches, and systematic differences of about 2 K. A geothermal area map from surface studies was used to assess LSTgt inside and outside the geothermal boundaries. Spatial means were found to be higher inside the geothermal limits, as well as the relative frequency of occurrence of high LSTgt. Results further show that areas with strong topography can result in anomalously high LSTgt values (false positives), which suggests the need for a slope and aspect correction in the inputs to achieve realistic results in those areas. The uncertainty analysis indicates that large uncertainties of the input parameters may limit detection of LSTgt anomalies. To validate the approaches, higher spatial resolution images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data over the Olkaria geothermal field were used. An established method to estimate radiant geothermal flux was applied providing values between 9 and 24 W/m(2) in the geothermal area, which coincides with the LSTgt flux rates obtained with the proposed approaches.
   The proposed approaches are a first step in estimating LSTgt at large spatial coverage from remote sensing and LSM data series, and provide an innovative framework for future improvements.

AB The only observations of marine biogeochemistry with routine global coverage are satellite ocean colour, which provide measurements of ocean bio-optical properties, with coverage still incomplete and limited to the sea surface. Models are therefore required to provide full spatial coverage, and through data assimilation can be combined with observations to create a reanalysis. This can then be used to investigate both observed and non observed variables, including those relating to the carbon cycle. As part of the Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG) within the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, two global marine biogeochemical reanalyses have been produced by assimilating ocean colour-derived chlorophyll data into a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model over the period September 1997 to July 2012. One reanalysis assimilated CCI products, the other assimilated GlobColour products, with a non-assimilative hindcast run for comparison. Each has been validated against independent in situ observations of chlorophyll, nutrients and carbon cycle variables. The assimilation of either source of ocean colour data was found to improve the model's representation of chlorophyll concentration throughout the water column, including the frequency and positioning of deep chlorophyll maxima. The assimilation also resulted in a slight improvement in nutrient concentrations and surface fugacity of carbon dioxide compared with in situ observations, although the overall impact on mean fields was small. This was found to be due in part to cancelling errors within the model, with the assimilation providing information on model biases, which can be used to inform future climate model development. The reanalyses were also able to reproduce expected seasonal cycles, as well as inter-annual variability related to major climate drivers. This study concludes that both CCI and GlobColour products are suitable for assimilation purposes, and that assimilating ocean colour data is of clear benefit.

AB Satellite data provide a large range of information on glacier dynamics and changes. Results are often reported, provided and used without consideration of measurement accuracy (difference to a true value) and precision (variability of independent assessments). Whereas accuracy might be difficult to determine due to the limited availability of appropriate reference data and the complimentary nature of satellite measurements, precision can be obtained from a large range of measures with a variable effort for determination. This study provides a systematic overview on the factors influencing accuracy and precision of glacier area, elevation change (from altimetry and DEM differencing), and velocity products derived from satellite data, along with measures for calculating them. A tiered list of recommendations is provided (sorted for effort from Level 0 to 3) as a guide for analysts to apply what is possible given the datasets used and available to them. The more simple measures to describe product quality (Levels 0 and 1) can often easily be applied and should thus always be reported. Medium efforts (Level 2) require additional work but provide a more realistic assessment of product precision. Real accuracy assessment (Level 3) requires independent and coincidently acquired reference data with high accuracy. However, these are rarely available and their transformation into an unbiased source of information is challenging. This overview is based on the experiences and lessons learned in the ESA project Glaciers_cci rather than a review of the literature.

AB Monitoring vegetation dynamics in hyper-arid zones is important because any decrease in the already sparse vegetation cover in these areas could considerably affect the entire ecosystem. The new generation of high spatial resolution satellite (HSR) sensors is suitable for monitoring trees in arid regions because of the distinct and separate objects that trees represent in these environments. The main limitation of modern HSR sensors is the lack of a historical archive that would Otherwise enable meaningful landscape change detection, especially in arid regions where tree population dynamics are naturally very slow. This study uses spatial analysis to gain information regarding the long- and short-term dynamic processes affecting the acacia tree population in Wadi Ktora, in the southern Arava Valley, Israel. The data is extracted from a single HSR aerial photograph composed of three spectral bands in the visible and infrared spectrum (green, red, and near infrared).
   A map of individual acacia trees that is extracted from a colour infrared aerial photograph of Wadi Ktora from 2010 enables the examination of spatial distribution patterns for both tree size and foliage health. Tree size distribution is used as an indicator of long-term (decades) hydrologic spatial processes affecting the acacia population. The tree health distribution is used as an indicator for short-term (months to a few years) hydrologic spatial processes, such as the paths of recent flash floods events. Comparing the distributions of tree size and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) enables differentiation between the long-term and short-term processes that brought the population to its present state.
   Using spatial statistic grouping, the distribution of the trees in the wadi (ephemeral stream) is divided into three distinct categories: (1) large trees with high NDVI values, (2) large trees with low NDVI values, and (3) small trees with medium NDVI values. Using the resulting classification, we divided the wadi into three sections, each representing a unique combination of long- and short-term hydrologic processes affecting the acacia trees. We suggest that the lack of spatial correlation between tree size and health status is a result of spatio-temporal changes in the water supply. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over land the vegetation canopy affects the microwave brightness temperature by emission, scattering and attenuation of surface soil emission. Attenuation, as represented by vegetation optical depth (VOD), is a potentially useful ecological indicator. The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission carries significant potential for VOD estimates because of its radio frequency interference mitigation efforts and because the L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. In this study, we apply the multi-temporal dual-channel retrieval algorithm (MT-DCA) to derive global VOD, soil moisture, and effective scattering albedo estimates from SMAP Backus-Gilbert enhanced brightness temperatures posted on a 9 km grid and with three day revisit time. SMAP VOD values from the MT-DCA follow expected global distributions and are shown to be highly correlated with canopy height. They are also broadly similar in magnitude (though not always in seasonal amplitude) to European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) VOD. The SMOS VOD values are based on angular brightness temperature information while the SMAP measurements are at a constant incidence angle, requiring an alternate approach to VOD retrieval presented in this study.
   Globally, albedo values tend to be high over regions with heterogeneous land cover types. The estimated effective scattering albedo values are generally higher than those used in previous soil moisture estimation algorithms and linked to biome classifications. MT-DCA retrievals of soil moisture show only small random differences with soil moisture retrievals from the Baseline SMAP algorithm, which uses a prior estimate of VOD based on land cover and optical data. However, significant biases exist between the two datasets. The soil moisture biases follow the pattern of differences between the MT-DCA retrieved and Baseline-assigned VOD values.

AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced evident warming in recent decades, but the exact reasons for this warming remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the possible effect of the three-dimensional (3D) variations of cloud during daytime on climate warming over the TP from 2007 to 2015 based on CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations. We found that the 3D changes occur mostly to low clouds, whose fraction and geometrical depth decrease by approximately 4.2% and 130 m, respectively. These changes result in the increase of the surface shortwave radiation (SSR) by approximately 29.7 W/m(2), which is one magnitude larger than that of anthropogenic CO2. The increase in SSR leads to the increase in direct solar radiation absorption in the surface, which significantly enhances the warming of the TP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional high-resolution maps of total surface current vectors obtained for the first time with an airborne demonstrator of the innovative Wavemill instrument concept are validated against HF radar data and compared with output from the POLCOMS high-resolution coastal ocean circulation model. Wavemill is a squinted along-track interferometric SAR system optimized for ocean surface current vector retrieval that operates at moderate incidence angles (similar to 30 degrees) and is compatible with spaceborne implementation. This paper represents the first comprehensive validation of the current retrieval capabilities of squinted along-track SAR interferometry in support of its development as a future European Space Agency Earth Explorer mission.
   Wavemill airborne data were acquired in October 2011 in Liverpool Bay off the west coast of Great Britain in light southerly wind (5.5 m/s) and maximum tidal ebbing flow (0.7 m/s) conditions. Contributions to the measured SAR interferometric phase by surface gravity waves, known as the Wind-wave induced Artefact Surface Velocity (WASV), were removed using our best estimate of wind conditions and the (Mouche et al., 2012) empirical correction derived from Envisat ASAR. Validation of the 1.5 km resolution Wavemill current vectors against independent current measurements from HF radar gives very encouraging results, with Wavemill biases and precisions typically better than 0.05 m/s and 0.1 m/s for surface current speed, and better than 10 degrees and 7 degrees for current direction.
   The sensitivity of the current retrieval to the wind vector used to compute the WASV is estimated. A +/- 1 m/s error (bias) in wind speed has minimal impact on the quality of the retrieved currents. In contrast, the choice of wind direction is critical: a bias of +/- 15 degrees in the direction of the wind vector degrades the accuracy of the airborne current speed against the HF radar by about +/- 0.2 m/s. This highlights the need for future instruments to provide calibrated SAR Normalised Radar Cross Section data to support retrieval of wind and current vectors simultaneously.
   Comparisons of POLCOMS surface currents with HF radar data indicate that the model reproduces well the overall temporal evolution of the tidal current (correlation of spatial fields against HF radar over two tidal cycles of 0.9) but that the model features a systematic 1-h delay in the timing of the maximum ebbing flow in eastern parts of the domain near the Mersey Bar Light buoy. At the maximum ebb flow, the model underestimates the current speed (bias of -0.2m/s) with respect to the HF radar and Wavemill data at the time of the flights. Both the HF radar and Wavemill data reflect much greater snapshot spatial variability of the ocean surface current field than is present in the model, resulting in poor correlation of instantaneous spatial fields (< 0.5) between POLCOMS and the HF radar data. The Wavemill data reveal high spatial variability of ocean surface currents at fine scales, which are not visible in the 4km resolution HF radar data. Wavemill detects several strong (1-1.5m/s) localized current jets associated with deeper bathymetry channels in shallow waters (< 10 m) that are too narrow or too close to land to be observed by the HF radar. The study confirms the value of synoptic wide-swath maps of high-resolution ocean surface current vectors for coastal applications and to validate and develop high-resolution ocean circulation models.

AB The NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission conducted the SMAP Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15) in order to support the calibration and validation activities of SMAP soil moisture data products. The main goals of the experiment were to address issues regarding the spatial disaggregation methodologies for improvement of soil moisture products and validation of the in situ measurement upscaling techniques. To support these objectives high-resolution soil moisture maps were acquired with the airborne PALS (Passive Active L-band Sensor) instrument over an area in southeast Arizona that includes the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW), and intensive ground sampling was carried out to augment the permanent in situ instrumentation. The objective of the paper was to establish the correspondence and relationship between the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of soil moisture on the ground and the coarse resolution radiometer-based soil moisture retrievals of SMAP. The high-resolution mapping conducted with PALS provided the required connection between the in situ measurements and SMAP retrievals. The in situ measurements were used to validate the PALS soil moisture acquired at 1-km resolution. Based on the information from a dense network of rain gauges in the study area, the in situ soil moisture measurements did not capture all the precipitation events accurately. That is, the PALS and SMAP soil moisture estimates responded to precipitation events detected by rain gauges, which were in some cases not detected by the in situ soil moisture sensors. It was also concluded that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture resulted from the relatively small spatial extents of the typical convective storms in this region was not completely captured with the in situ stations. After removing those cases (approximately 10% of the observations) the following metrics were obtained: RMSD (root mean square difference) of 0.016 m(3)/m(3) and correlation of 0.83. The PALS soil moisture was also compared to SMAP and in situ soil moisture at the 36-km scale, which is the SMAP grid size for the standard product. PALS and SMAP soil moistures were found to be very similar owing to the close match of the brightness temperature measurements and the use of a common soil moisture retrieval algorithm. Spatial heterogeneity, which was identified using the high-resolution PALS soilmoisture and the intensive ground sampling, also contributed to differences between the soilmoisture estimates. In general, discrepancies found between the L-band soilmoisture estimates and the 5-cm depth in situ measurements require methodologies to mitigate the impact on their interpretations in soilmoisture validation and algorithm development. Specifically, the metrics computed for the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture product over WGEW will include errors resulting from rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season when the spatial distribution of soil moisture is especially heterogeneous.

AB Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world and its forecast is essential in flood risk reduction and disaster response decision. The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting.
   In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2.
   The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

AB We studied whether the physical snow evolution model SNOWPACK could be used together with the HUT snow emission model to simulate microwave brightness temperatures (TB) of snow cover and to parameterize key a priori variables in the retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE). We used the extensive in situ measurement data set collected in Sodankyla, Finland, during the Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx) campaign in 2009-2013 to model the evolution of snow with SNOWPACK. Resulting snow profiles were validated with manual in situ measurements. Mean agreement scores (for a winter) were 0.85-0.91 for traditional grain size, 0.74-0.75 for optical grain size, 0.65-0.80 for density, and 0.71-0.83 for temperature. Grain sizes modeled with SNOW-PACK were compared to effective grain size retrieved from tower-based microwave radiometer measurements. The bias and RMS error of SNOWPACK optical grain size were -0.03 mm and 0.20 mm, respectively, and those of SNOWPACK traditional grain size were 0.30 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively. SNOWPACK snow profiles were used as input to the HUT snow emission model for calculation of TB, which was compared to microwave radiometer measurements. TB calculated with SNOWPACK optical grain size exhibited lower biases (from -12.5 k to 16.2 K, depending on year and frequency) and RMS errors (from 33 K to 18.5 K) than TB calculated with SNOW-PACK traditional grain size (bias from -42.2 K to -9.9 K, RMS error from 12.0 K to 44.7 K). Grain sizes, temperature, and density modeled with SNOWPACK were used as a priori snow data in the retrieval of SWE from tower based microwave radiometer observations. The lowest overall bias and RMS error were reached when traditional grain size from SNOW-PACK was used, either directly with modelled snow density and temperature ( 33 mm and 58 mm, respectively) or with an effective grain size correction and static snow density and temperature applied (22 mm and 59 mm, respectively).

AB National parks are established to reduce human influence on nature and contribute to species conservation, biodiversity and ecological services. Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely "common" (i.e. community-owned) and "not-common" (privately or governmentally owned) land.
   In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area.
   The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s. Our approach shows that combining information on recent land cover with change detection allows to study the, temporal development of protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The forest above-ground biomass (AGB) and spatial distribution of vegetation elements have profound effects on the productivity and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from UAVSAR data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m x 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the R-2 and RMSE of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric UAVSAR data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from PRISM as additional independent variable, R-2 increased to 0.76 and RMSE decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the RMSE of biomass estimation based on UAVSAR data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a R-2 of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, R-2 increased to 0.86 and RMSE decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using UAVSAR data alone underestimated biomass at levels above similar to 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from PRISM stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, R-2 increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and RMSE reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of UAVSAR data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA's LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant.

AB Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'etudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40 degrees incidence angle, over the 2013-2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against in situ soil moisture measurements from >400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The in situ observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with in situ observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the in situ observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and in situ measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R = 0.51 and R = 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The study of agriculture and agricultural production is an important part of societal planning for allocation of resources and economic forecasting. The prediction of crop output requires collecting accurate crop data throughout the growing season, in locations with a wide range of climatic conditions. Repeat observations from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have been shown to be a reliable way of gathering frequent crop measurements, even in perpetually cloudy regions.
   In this work, repeat coverage of an area in California's San Joaquin Valley, with images taken by NASA's L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) system approximately once a month during 2010 and 2012, was used to examine a time-history of backscatter signatures and polarimetric H/A/alpha (Entropy, Anisotropy, and Polarization angle) decomposition values of alfalfa, corn, and winter wheat with the objective of improving classification of individual crops. Distinguishable signatures were observed for all three crops. The signature was dominated by the growth stage and physical structure of the crops during the mature part of the growing season, and by weather events, planting practices, and harvesting procedures during other parts of the year. These data support previous findings that multiple images throughout the year capture the full growth pattern, allowing for more accurate identification of agricultural crops than what can be determined by a single image. The overall accuracies for this time-series classification were 75% using HV-polarized backscatter, 79% using the alpha decomposition, and 83% using the entropy decomposition, which were the three polarizations or decompositions with greatest separability between crops. It is shown that the full-year time series of images builds a more comprehensive model for crop backscatter than previous works. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB River discharge is a critical component for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable management of water resources. The importance of discharge observation has increased due to its potential extreme variation resulting from the projected climate change and stronger variability of precipitation and temperature in some large basins. However, inherent difficulties in ground-based observations and decreasing number of gauge stations hinder accurate measurement of global river discharge and its spatio-temporal variations. Various remote sensing methods have been examined as alternatives, however, they require ground measurements to convert their proxy measurements into the actual river discharge. In this study, we estimate the discharge at the Obidos station and the mouth of the Amazon basin using the water storage variations derived from GRACE gravity data without relying on any auxiliary ground observations. We extract the water mass signal along the main stem of the river by applying the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) for water storage variations over the basin. The relative water storage variations along the main stem derived from the EOF decomposition are highly correlated with in-situ discharge at the Obidos. However, in high water season, the GRACE-based discharge is estimated larger than the in-situ observations, and the difference is particularly significant during the 2009 extreme flood season. We argue that the in-situ river discharge in 2009 was underestimated due to the missed water volume for the flow detouring around the Obidos gauge station during the high-flow event. Net river discharge of the Amazon Basin to Atlantic Ocean is also estimated, and its annual discharge is about 23% larger than that of the Obidos. In particular, 2009 river discharge to Atlantic Oceans is estimated as 1050 Gton. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT) in East Antarctica has been studied since 1911. Early expeditions produced maps using ground or ship-based observations followed later by vertical and/or oblique aerial photography from aircraft. In the modern era, extensive digital satellite imagery is available which has also been supplemented by the resurrection and scanning of some historic U.S., now 'declassified', film-based satellite images. Much of the MGT became detached and drifted away following the collision by the B-9B iceberg in February 2010 and a similar sequence, or extension-detachment cycle, must have occurred some-time after Mawson's 1911-1914 observations. All the available information on the position, shape or appearance of the MGT has been re-examined in an attempt to comprehensively study its past, present and possible future motion. Feature tracking cross correlation methods have been applied for suitably detailed image pairs to accurately measure the MGT advance velocity. The derived mean rate for 1947-2010 is 1180 +/- 14 m y(-1) with an accompanying ice-front loss rate of similar to 190 m y(-1). A simple model for the MGT exhibits a similar to 73 year quasi-periodic cycle of rebirth, growth and demise which will affect the volume of bottom water produced in the nearby polynya. Some evidence for this cyclic oceanographic change has recently been reported from regional sediment data. Somewhat speculatively, the model suggests a date of similar to 1937 for the previous MGT break-off and around or before similar to 2083 for the next. With the MGT being primed to brealc-off every similar to 73 years, the precise date being governed by unpredictable external events such as collisions by large icebergs, such cycles have probably occurred for many thousands of years.

AB System Vicarious Calibration (SVC) is the fundamental process commonly implemented to meet uncertainty requirements in satellite ocean color data. It is performed by applying gain factors, g-factors, to the pre-launch calibration coefficients of the space sensor already corrected for sensitivity decay with time. Mission specific g-factors are determined from top-of-the-atmosphere data computed by propagating highly accurate in situ values of the water-leaving radiance, L-W, to the satellite sensor. Values of L-W from marine regions characterized by oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters and maritime aerosols, high environmental stability and spatial homogeneity, low cloudiness and absence of any source of land contamination, are essential to determine g-factors applicable to the creation of Climate Data Records (CDRs) from multiple ocean color missions. Accounting for the location of existing and potential new SVC fixed sites, marine regions satisfying SVC requirements for the generation of CDRs have been identified through the analysis of satellite data from recent ocean color missions.

AB Persistence of oil floating in the ocean is an important factor for evaluating hydrocarbon fluxes from natural seeps and anthropogenic releases into the environment. The objective of this work is to estimate the surface residence time of the oil slick and to determine the importance of wind and surface currents on the trajectory and fate of the released oil. Oil slicks released from natural hydrocarbon seeps located in Green Canyon 600 lease block and its surrounding region in the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed. A Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm was used to delineate georectified polygons for oil slicks from 41 synthetic aperture radar images. Trajectories of the oil slicks were investigated by employing a Lagrangian particle-tracking surface oil drift model. A set of numerical simulations was performed by increasing hindcast interval in reverse time order from the image collection time in order to obtain the closest resemblance between the simulated oil pathways and the length and shape of the oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar images. The average surface residence-time predicted from the hindcast modeling was 6.4 h (+/- 5.7 h). Analysis of a linear regression model, including observed oil slick lengths and variables of wind, surface current, and their relative direction, indicated a statistically significant negative effect of wind speed on the surface oil drift. Higher wind speed (>7 m s(-1)) reduced length of the oil slicks. When wind and surface currents were driving forces of the surface oil drift model, a good agreement between simulated trajectories and subsequent satellite observations (R-2 = 0.9) suggested that a wind scaling coefficient of 0.035 and a wind deflection angle of 20 to the right of the wind direction were acceptable approximations for modeling wind effects in this study. Results from the numerical experimentation were supported by in situ observations conducted by a wind-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SailDrone). Results indicated that the surface currents are, indeed, responsible for stretching oil slicks and that surface winds are largely responsible for the disappearance of the oil slicks from the sea surface. Under conditions of low wind and strong current, natural seeps can produce oil slicks that are longer than 20 km and persist for up to 48 h. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Phnom Kulen National Park (PKNP), Cambodia is faced with increasing environmental pressures and disturbances to vegetation. Changes in satellite vegetation indices (VIs) over time can be used to understand historical changes to vegetation in the PKNP provided images are calibrated to surface reflectance. Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) is one method to achieve this while the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) surface reflectance product provides an alternative. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the magnitude of differences between VIs produced using the CDR product and RRN images; (2) determine whether any differences in the VIs produced using the RRN and CDR images will impact on the areal extent of change in vegetation detected; and (3) determine the spatial and temporal extent of historical changes to vegetation in the PKNP. The choice of RRN or CDR had subtle but important impacts on the areal extent of detected changes to vegetation. The RRN images reduced inter-annual variations in vegetation response. The EVI was more resilient to residual atmospheric effects in the RRN and CDR images. Two relatively large regions of the PKNP were found to be relatively undisturbed. Recent changes to vegetation were found in areas that were previously undisturbed, and the proportion of the PKNP where changes were detected was increasing. Future work will include images from other sensors to reduce spatial and temporal gaps, and improve the temporal range of the methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the retrieval of agricultural crop height from space by using multipolarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Coherent and incoherent crop height estimation methods are discussed for the first time with a unique TanDEM-X dataset acquired over rice cultivation areas. Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of crop height through interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PoIInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PoIInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low RMSEs (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having RMSE of 18 cm.
   The spatial baseline, i.e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PoIInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101.7m and 932m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient crop height accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PoIInSAR approach provides reliable crop height estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the crop height estimation is evident for both methods. However, PoIInSAR is more cost-efficient, e.g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only crop height but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of crop height with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PoIInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing has mainly relied on measurements of scalar radiance and its spectral and angular features to retrieve micro- and macro-physical properties of aerosols/hydrosols. However, it is recognized that measurements that include the polarimetric characteristics of light provide more intrinsic information about particulate scattering. To take advantage of this, we used vector radiative transfer (VRT) simulations and developed an analytical relationship to retrieve the macro and micro-physical properties of the oceanic hydrosols. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between the observed degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and the ratio of attenuation to-absorption coefficients (c/a) in water, from which the scattering coefficient can be readily computed (b = c - a), after retrieving a. This relationship was parameterized for various scattering geometries, including sensor zenith/azimuth angles relative to the Sun's principal plane, and for varying Sun zenith angles. An inversion method was also developed for the retrieval of the microphysical properties of hydrosols, such as the bulk refractive index and the particle size distribution. The DoLP vs c/a relationship was tested and validated against in-situ measurements of underwater light polarization obtained by a custom-built polarimeter and measurements of the coefficients a and c, obtained using an in-water WET Labs ac-s instrument package. These measurements confirmed the validity of the approach, with retrievals of attenuation coefficients showing a high coefficient of determination depending on the wavelength. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the DoLP at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) over coastal waters showing the possibility of polarimetric remote sensing application for ocean color.

AB Debris-covered glaciers in the Himalaya may have spatially-averaged rates of surface height change that are similar to those observed on bare-ice glaciers, despite the insulating effects of thick debris. Spatially heterogeneous melt patterns caused by the development and evolution of ice cliffs and supraglacial pond systems result in substantial mass losses over time. However, mechanisms controlling the formation and survival of cliffs and ponds remain largely unknown. To study the distribution and characteristics of these surface features we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a stretch of the debris-covered Langtang Glacier, Nepal. Acquired images are processed into high-resolution orthomosaics and elevation models with the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry algorithm. Ice cliffs and ponds are classified using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and their morphology and spatial distribution are analysed and evaluated using object, pixel and point cloud approaches. Results show that ice cliffs are predominantly north-facing, and larger ice cliffs are generally coupled with supraglacial ponds, which may affect their evolution considerably. The spatial distribution of ice cliffs indicates that they are more likely to form in areas where high strain rates are expected. The spatial configuration of ponds over the entire tongue reveals high pond density near confluences, possibly due to closure of conduits via transverse compression. We conclude that the combination of OBIA and UAV imagery is a valuable tool in the semi-automatic and objective analysis of surface features on debris-covered glaciers. The technique may also have potential for upscaling to the use of spaceborne imagery, and the use of UAV-derived point clouds to analyse ice cliff undercuts is promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation traits provide critical information on ecosystem function that can be used to assess the effects of disturbance, land use, and climate change. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of spectroscopy to predict vegetation traits accurately and efficiently. To date, most spectroscopic studies have utilized data from the Visible Short Wave Infrared spectrum (VSWIR) or, occasionally, the Thermal Infrared spectrum (TIR), but not in combination. This study focuses on VSWIR and TIR synergy to evaluate the ability to predict leaf level cellulose, lignin, leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen, and water content across seasons. We used fresh leaves from sixteen common California shrub and tree species collected in the 2013 spring, summer, and fall seasons. The 284 samples exhibited a wide range of leaf traits as determined by standard analytical procedures: 4.2-27.3% for cellulose, 2.6-22.5% for lignin, 34.7-388.9 g/m(2) for LMA, 0.45-3.81% for nitrogen, and 20.2-76.9% for water content. For each leaf trait, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were fit using different portions of the spectrum: VSWIR (0.35-2.5 mu m), TIR (2.5-15.4 mu m), and Full spectrum (0.35-15.4 mu m). We also fit PLSR models using spectra resampled to simulate three airborne sensors: the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS; 0.4-2.5 mu m), the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES; 7.5-12 mu m), and the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRl; 0.4-12 mu m). The majority of best performing models used the Full spectrum, demonstrating the value of combining TIR and VSWIR spectra for leaf trait prediction. Sensor simulated PLSR models created with the entire data set yielded validation R-2 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values as follows: R-2 = 0.70 and RMSEP = 13.1% for cellulose, R-2 = 0.50 and RMSEP = 17.7% for lignin, R-2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.3% for LMA, R-2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.1% for nitrogen, and R-2 = 0.89 and RMSEP = 5.7% for water content. General models successfully captured the variability among all seasons and leaf forms for cellulose and water content, while the other leaf traits were better modeled with season or leaf form -specific models. This study successfully captured the large seasonal and geographical variation in leaf traits across California's diverse ecosystems, supporting the possibility of using HyspIRl's imagery for global mapping efforts of these traits.

AB Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Photoacclimation is a cellular process that allows phytoplankton to change the intracellular chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) in relation to environmental factors such as light and nutrients. This process is currently overlooked by standard operational ocean colour algorithms used to retrieve information about both the phytoplankton standing stock and production. Here, we describe the photoacclimation effect on the phytoplankton seasonal cycle through the chlorophyll to carbon ratio (Chl:C) over the Mediterranean Sea, using SeaWiFS (1998-2007) monthly data. Chlorophyll was calculated through a regionalized empirical algorithm and Carbon was estimated from the particle backscattering, after subtraction of the non-algal contribution (b(bpNAP)). Historically, b(bpNAP) has been neglected or assumed constant, and only recently its space-time variability started to be taken into account. Here, bootstrapping simulations are used to compute the monthly b(bpNAP)s over a former bio-regionalization map of the Mediterranean Sea, all highlighting significant space-time variability. Resulting Chl:C varies within a factor of three, demonstrating the important role that photoacclimation plays at seasonal and basin scales. Lowest Chl:C values (similar to 0.0013) are observed during summer; this is due to the combined effect of high irradiation, shallow mixing and low nutrient concentration. Maximum values (similar to 0.031) are observed in winter and spring dominated by both low solar radiation, deeper mixing and high nutrient availability. It emerges that a better view of the phytoplankton space and time variability can be achieved through the joint use of Chl and C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With increasing demands for ocean color (OC) products with improved accuracy and well characterizdd, per retrieval uncertainty budgets, it is vital to decompose overall estimated errors into their primary components. Amongst various contributing elements (e.g., instrument calibration, atmospheric correction, inversion algorithms) in the uncertainty of an OC observation, less attention has been paid to uncertainties associated with spatial sampling. In this paper, we simulate MODIS (aboard both Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS OC products using 30 m resolution OC products derived from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat-8, to examine impacts of spatial sampling on both cross-sensor product intercomparisons and in-situ validations of R-rs products in coastal waters. Various OLI OC products representing different productivity levels and in-water spatial features were scanned for one full orbital-repeat cycle of each ocean color satellite. While some view-angle dependent differences in simulated Aqua-MODIS and VIIRS were observed, the average uncertainties (absolute) in product intercomparisons (due to differences in spatial sampling) at regional scales are found to be 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.4%, 4.3%, 2.7%, 1.8%, and 4% for the R-rs(443), R-rs(482), R-rs(561), R-rs(655), Chla, K-d (482), and b(bp)(655) products, respectively. It is also found that, depending on in-water spatial variability and the sensor's footprint size, the errors for an in-situ validation station in coastal areas can reach as high as +/- 18%. We conclude that a) expected biases induced by the spatial sampling in product intercomparisons are mitigated when products are averaged over at least 7 km x 7 km areas, b) VIIRS observations, with improved consistency in cross-track spatial sampling, yield more precise calibration/validation statistics than that of MODIS, and c) use of a single pixel centered on in situ coastal stations provides an optimal sampling size for validation efforts. These findings will have implications for enhancing our understanding of uncertainties in ocean color retrievals and for planning of future ocean color missions and the associated calibration/validation exercises.

AB ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched 2-Nov-2009, has been in orbit for over 6 years, and its Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) in two dimensions keeps working well. The calibration strategy remains overall as established after the commissioning phase, with a few improvements. The data for this whole period has been reprocessed with a new fully polarimetric version of the Level-1 processor which includes a refined calibration schema for the antenna losses. This reprocessing has allowed the assessment of an improved performance benchmark. An overview of the results and the progress achieved in both calibration and image reconstruction is presented in this contribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The thermal infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has considerable potential for mineral and lithological mapping of the most abundant rock-forming silicates that do not display diagnostic features at visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths. Lithological mapping using visible and shortwave infrared hyperspectral data is well developed and established processing chains are available, however there is a paucity of such methodologies for hyperspectral thermal infrared data. Here we present a new fully automated processing chain for deriving lithological maps from hyperspectral thermal infrared data and test its applicability using the first ever airborne hyperspectral thermal data collected in the Antarctic. A combined airborne hyperspectral survey, targeted geological field mapping campaign and detailed mineralogical and geochemical datasets are applied to small test site in West Antarctica where the geological relationships are representative of continental margin arcs. The challenging environmental conditions and cold temperatures in the Antarctic meant that the data have a significantly lower signal to noise ratio than is usually attained from airborne hyperspectral sensors. We applied preprocessing techniques to improve the signal to noise ratio and convert the radiance images to ground leaving emissivity. Following preprocessing we developed and applied a fully automated processing chain to the hyperspectral imagery, which consists of the following six steps: (1) superpixel segmentation, (2) determine the number of endmembers, (3) extract endmembers from superpixels, (4) apply fully constrained linear unmixing, (5) generate a predictive classification map, and (6) automatically label the predictive classes to generate a lithological map. The results show that the image processing chain was successful, despite the low signal to noise ratio of the imagery; reconstruction of the hyperspectral image from the endmembers and their fractional abundances yielded a root mean square error of 0.58%. The results are encouraging with the thermal imagery allowing clear distinction between granitoid types. However, the distinction of fine grained, intermediate composition dykes is not possible due to the close geochemical similarity with the country rock. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To assess the North American high-latitude vegetation response to the rising temperature, we derived NDVI trend for 91.2% of the non-water, non-snow land area of Canada and Alaska using the peak-summer Landsat surface reflectance data of 1984-2012. Our analysis indicated that 29.4% and 2.9% of the land area of Canada and Alaska showed statistically significant positive (greening) and negative (browning) trends respectively, at significance level p < 0.01, after burned forest areas were masked out. The area with greening trend dominated over that with browning trend for all land cover types. The greening occurred primarily in the tundra of western Alaska, along the north coast of Canada and in northeastern Canada; the most intensive and extensive greening occurred in Quebec and Labrador. The browning occurred mostly in the boreal forests of eastern Alaska. The Landsat-based greenness trend is broadly similar to the 8-km GIMMS AVHRR-based trend for all vegetation zones. However, for tundra, the Landsat data indicated much less extensive greening in Alaska North Slope and much more extensive greening in Quebec and Labrador, and substantially less extensive browning trend in the boreal forests that were free of fire disturbances. These differences call for further validation of the Landsat reflectance and the AVHRR NDVI datasets. Correlation study with local environmental factors, such as topography, glacial history and soil condition, will be needed to understand the heterogeneous greenness change at the Landsat scale.

AB This paper is focused on the presentation and discussion of an object oriented approach, applied to the Hierapolis (Turkey) site, to automatically detect the subtle features linked to buried archaeological remains. The data processing is applied twice: (i) first, globally at the whole image and, (ii) second, at the significant subsets identified by global analysis, in order to refine the previously obtained categorization. Object oriented approaches are usually based on two main steps: i) first the segmentation, ii) then the classification. Herein, we first performed the unsupervised classification step and, then, the segmentation. This choice is given by the specificity of archaeological issue, in particular: (i) the subtle features/targets to be identified are partially or totally unknown and characterized by a very small spectral separability from the background, and therefore (ii) the discrimination between archaeological class and substrates likely suffers significant confusion. To cope with these issues, the first step is based on an unsupervised classification, which provides a first 'rough' categorization of pixels; the second step, based on the segmentation, enables us to extract the geometric shape, and, in turn, to only categorize as archaeological class those pixels belonging to geometrically (rectangular and linear) shaped clusters. Outputs from this classification identify rectangular and linear features of archaeological interest whose size suggested that they may be a farm and some sectors of an aqueduct, respectively. Results from satellite based analysis were successfully evaluated by georadar and geomagnetic prospection along with field survey. From georadar and geomagnetic prospection we were able i) to confirm the presence of buried remains and ii) to detail and characterize these archaeological features at the subsoil level as well as to define the local stratigraphy. From field survey we dated the detected buried remains to a period spanning from Imperial Roman to early Byzantine historical times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieved from ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) with the output of the ORCHIDEE (ORganising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEm) land surface model forced with two distinct atmospheric data sets for the period 2010 to 2012. The comparison methodology is first established over the REMEDHUS (Red de Estaciones de MEDicion de la Humedad def Suelo) soil moisture measurement network, a 30 by 40 km catchment located in the central part of the Duero basin, then extended to the whole Iberian Peninsula (IP). The temporal correlation between the in-situ, remotely sensed and modelled SSM are satisfactory (r>0.8). The correlation between remotely sensed and modelled SSM also holds when computed over the IP. Still, by using spectral analysis techniques, important disagreements in the effective inertia of the corresponding moisture reservoir are found. This is reflected in the spatial correlation over the IP between SMOS and ORCHIDEE SSM estimates, which is poor (p similar to 0.3). A single value decomposition (SVD) analysis of rainfall and SSM shows that the co-varying patterns of these variables are in reasonable agreement between both products. Moreover the first three SVD soil moisture patterns explain over 80% of the SSM variance simulated by the model while the explained fraction is only 52% of the remotely sensed values. These results suggest that the rainfall-driven soil moisture variability may not account for the poor spatial correlation between SMOS and ORCHIDEE products. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Mapping the global distribution of forest canopy height is important for estimating forest biomass and terrestrial carbon flux. In this study, we present a global map of mean forest canopy height at 500 m spatial resolution obtained by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data acquired from 2005 to 2006 and 13 ancillary variables, including seven climatic variables and six remote sensing variables (nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance at red and NIR bands, tree cover, anisotropic factor, accumulated Enhanced Vegetation Index, and elevation). The original contributions of this study include the following: (1) The wavelet method was applied to complement the GLA14 product to identify the ground peak and the top-canopy peak. We found that it was useful for dealing with waveforms with low reconstruction accuracy. (2) GLAS data from the leafless season were not used for non evergreen forest because the height retrieval results exhibited underestimation and strong variations. (3) The an isotropic factor (ANIF), an indicator related to surface structure, was included as an ancillary variable for the first time and was determined to be important for height modeling in the Asian and North American regions. (4) The balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm was applied to register GLAS mean forest canopy height to a 500 m grid considering the small proportion of extreme height classes (tall and short trees), and it achieved good performance in terms of modeling accuracy (RMSE = 2.75 to 4.45 m) and preserving data variation.
   An inter-comparison among three global forest height maps [the present study, Lefsky (2010), and Simard et al. (2011)] was implemented in a pixel-by-pixel manner. High agreement (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.49 m) was determined between the present study and Simard et al., whereas the result from Lefsky was notably different from the other two results (R-2 = 0.14, RMSE = 8.92 m, compared with the present study; R-2 = 0.11, RMSE 11.19 m, compared with Simard et al.). Large disparities were generally associated with evergreen broadleaf forests in South America, deciduous needleleaf forests in Europe and Russian North Asia, and evergreen needleleaf forests on the West Coast of North America. Differences in the height metric were a main factor affecting the disparities among the three results. Validation against field survey data acquired from the Distributed Active Archive Center indicated the accuracy of our mean forest canopy height map (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 4.68 m, n = 59).

AB Programs which intend to maintain or enhance carbon (C) stocks in natural ecosystems are promising, but require detailed and spatially explicit C distribution models to monitor the effectiveness of management interventions. Savanna ecosystems are significant components of the global C cycle, covering about one fifth of the global land mass, but they have received less attention in C monitoring protocols. Our goal was to estimate C storage across a broad savanna ecosystem using field surveys and freely available satellite images. We first mapped tree canopies at 2.5 m resolution with a spatial subset of high resolution panchromatic images to then predict regional wall-to-wall tree percent cover using 30-m Landsat imagery and the Random Forests algorithms. We found that a model with summer and winter spectral indices from Landsat, climate and topography performed best. Using a linear relationship between C and % tree cover, we then predicted tree C stocks across the gradient of tree cover, explaining 87% of the variability. The spatially explicit validation of the tree C model with field-measured C-stocks revealed an RMSE of 8.2 tC/ha which represented similar to 30% of the mean C stock for areas with tree cover, comparable with studies based on more advanced remote sensing methods, such as LiDAR and RADAR. Sample spatial distribution highly affected the performance of the RF models in predicting tree cover, raising concerns regarding the predictive capabilities of the model in areas for which training data is not present. The 50,000 km(2) has similar to 41 Tg C, which could be released to the atmosphere if agricultural pressure intensifies in this semiarid savanna. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of using high resolution imagery for regional tree cover and C analysis, increasing available training data when there is paucity of field data.

AB Avocado (Persea americana) is a crop that is second in importance in Florida behind citrus with a wholesale value of $35 million and represents approximately 60% of the tropical fruit crop acreage. Laurel wilt (LW) is a lethal disease that has spread rapidly along the southeastern seaboard of the United States affecting commercial avocado production. This article evaluates the spatial and spectral requirements for quick and accurate detection of LW. Spectral data from healthy (H), Phytophthora root rot (PPR) and LW leaves were analyzed using ANOVA and two neural networks, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). The most effective wavelengths were identified and the filters were updated to a MCA-6 Tetracam camera (580-10 nm, 650-10 nm, 740-10 nm, 750-10 nm, 760-10 nm and 850-40 nm). Then, the MCA camera was used to take multispectral aerial images from a helicopter at three altitudes (180,250 and 300 m) in an avocado field with trees at different stages of LW development, early, intermediate and late. The analyses were conducted based upon 2-class and 4-class systems. The 2-class system was designed to differentiate H and LW trees sufficient to identify trees for removal and the 4-class system was used to differentiate H plants and the three stages of LW development. Aerial image analysis proved the utility of the selected filters for successful identification of LW, even for trees in early stage of disease development with minimal symptoms. The ideal flight altitude of 250 m (153 cm pixel size) was selected according to the M-values and biological parameters such as canopy size and orchard size. The optimum VIs determined by higher M-values were TCARI(760-650) as well as GNDVI, NIR/G, Redge/G and VIGreen using any of the bands related to Redge (740 and 750 nm) or NIR regions (760 and 850 nm). Results reported on the utility of the 2-class and 4-class systems using the above Vls to discriminate LW; however it would be more convenient to develop the algorithm based on the 4-class system (H, early, intermediate and late). The early detection of LW through the methodology proposed in this research could allow farmers to control the movement of this disease through proper management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Surface waters are fundamental resources for terrestrial life, yet they are not free of both natural and anthropogenic influences at global-scale. An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Among the wide array of terrestrial habitats, forest and wooded lands are the richest from both biological and genetic points of view because of their inherent structural and compositional complexity and diversity. Although species composition is an important biodiversity feature, forest structure may be even more relevant for biodiversity assessments because a diversified structure is likely to have more niches, which in turn, host more species and contribute to a more efficient use of available resources. Structure plays a major role as a diversity indicator for management purposes where maps of forest structural diversity are of great utility when planning conservation strategies. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid source of information for describing the three-dimensional structure of forests. Using ALS metrics as predictor variables, we developed regression models for predicting indices of forest structural diversity for a study area in Molise, Italy. The study had two primary objectives: (i) to estimate indices of structural diversity for the entire study area, and (ii) to construct maps depicting the spatial pattern of the structural diversity indices. Our results demonstrate the utility of simple linear models using ALS data for improving areal estimates of mean structural diversity, and the resulting maps capture the patterns of structural diversity in the study area.

ID SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE
AB Optical methods to study soil moisture content (SMC) are often based on empirically or physically based models that relate changes in reflectance intensity to SMC. The effects of SMC on the reflectance anisotropy, however, have not received much attention. In this paper the effects of SMC on the anisotropic reflectance behaviour of soils were studied. Biconical reflectance factors (BCRFs) of five different soil samples were acquired at 60 positions covering the full hemisphere in the optical domain at different SMC levels using Wageningen University's laboratory goniometer facility. In addition, we inverted the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model against the measured BCRFs in the principal plane. The results show that the anisotropic reflectance behaviour of soils is strongly influenced by the SMC. Dry soils displayed strong backward scattering behaviour, with a maximum reflectance close to the hotspot position. An increase of the SMC level up to the soil's saturation point caused the soils to scatter more in the forward direction and induced a weakening of the hotspot effect. Oversaturated soils displayed a strong sun-glint-like reflectance peak in the anti-solar direction. The RPV model fitted the measured BCRFs in the principal plane up to saturated SMC levels in general with an R-2>0.9. It was not possible to fit the model through observations of oversaturated soils, since the RPV model is not capable of simulating specular reflectance. The asymmetry parameter (0) of the RPV model, which controls the proportion of forward and backward scattering, showed a strong correlation to SMC for individual samples. This correlation remained significant when we considered all samples together with a maximum R-2 of 0.797 at 2123 nm, indicating that reflectance anisotropy contained information on the water content of soils. The amplitude parameter (rho(0)), which is closely related to the reflectance intensity, only had a maximum R-2 of 0.622 at 1921 nm. This indicated that reflectance anisotropy contained more information on SMC than the level of spectral reflectance as such. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many studies and production inventory systems have shown the utility of coupling covariates derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with forest variables measured on georeferenced inventory plots through regression models. The objective of this study was to propose and assess the use of a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that accommodates both residual spatial dependence and non-stationarity of model covariates through the introduction of spatial random effects. We explored this objective using four forest inventory datasets that are part of the North American Carbon Program, each comprising point-referenced measures of above-ground forest biomass and discrete LiDAR. For each dataset, we considered at least five regression model specifications of varying complexity. Models were assessed based on goodness of fit criteria and predictive performance using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Results showed that the addition of spatial random effects to the regression model intercept improved fit and predictive performance in the presence of substantial residual spatial dependence. Additionally, in some cases, allowing either some or all regression slope parameters to vary spatially, via the addition of spatial random effects, further improved model fit and predictive performance. In other instances, models showed improved fit but decreased predictive performance indicating over-fitting and underscoring the need for cross-validation to assess predictive ability. The proposed Bayesian modeling framework provided access to pixel-level posterior predictive distributions that were useful for uncertainty mapping, diagnosing spatial extrapolation issues, revealing missing model covariates, and discovering locally significant parameters.

AB This paper presents a long-term (2005-2013) analysis of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and surface ozone using the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations (CAMS) sites in large cities of Texas. Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5-15%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (-0.06 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.21 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.16 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.14 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.07 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.01 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.04 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.06 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (+0.01 +/- 0.03 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10 +/- 0.04 yr(-1)), Dallas (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.07 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Houston (0.06 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)) and investigate the 1-2 pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (0.62 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.59 +/- 0.40 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (0.56 +/- 0.55 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.64 +/- 0.54 ppbv yr(-1)) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NO titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as Well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (-0.27 +/- 0.17 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.41 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.55 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (-0.53 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.03 +/- 0.16 ppbv yr(-1)). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone.
   While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O-3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3%) and Forth Worth (0.5%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7%, 0.8%, and 7%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NO in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The investigation of high-temperature natural phenomena, such as wildland fires and active lava flows, is a primary science objective for the proposed Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission. Current planning for HyspIRI includes a mid-infrared (MIR) channel centered at 4 mu m that will allow measurement of radiance emitted from high-temperature targets. In this paper we present the results of a study to specify the saturation temperature for the MIR channel. This study was based on reviews of the literature, together with case studies of airborne and satellite-based data acquired over high-temperature targets. The spatial resolution of MIR radiance measurements is an important consideration in the remote sensing of high-temperature phenomena, due to the presence of materials at different temperatures within the area covered by an image pixel. The HyspIRI MIR channel will provide a spatial resolution of 60 m, which is similar to 40 times finer (in terms of area) than the finest spatial resolution provided by heritage instruments (370 m). This fine spatial resolution will increase the probability that high-temperature targets fill an image pixel and, therefore, the HyspIRI MIR channel will require a saturation temperature 2 to 4 times higher than the saturation limits of heritage instruments. Based on our study, we recommend a saturation temperature of 1200 K (927 degrees C). This recommendation accounts for the high temperatures expected for natural phenomena, expected performance of the MIR channel, and overlap in sensitivity between the MIR and thermal infrared (7.5-12 mu m) HyspIRI channels.

AB The Red Sea is a semi-enclosed tropical marine ecosystem that stretches from the Gulf of Suez and Gulf of Aqaba in the north, to the Gulf of Aden in the south. Despite its ecological and economic importance, its biological environment is relatively unexplored. Satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration (an index of phytoplankton biomass) offer an observational platform to monitor the health of the Red Sea. However, little is known about the optical properties of the region. In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of the Red Sea in the context of satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Making use of a new merged ocean-colour product, from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative, and in situ data in the region, we test the performance of a series of ocean-colour chlorophyll algorithms. We find that standard algorithms systematically overestimate chlorophyll when compared with the in situ data. To investigate this bias we develop an ocean-colour model for the Red Sea, parameterised to data collected during the Tara Oceans expedition, that estimates remote-sensing reflectance as a function of chlorophyll concentration. We used the Red Sea model to tune the standard chlorophyll algorithms and the overestimation in chlorophyll originally observed was corrected. Results suggest that the overestimation was likely due to an excess of CDOM absorption per unit chlorophyll in the Red Sea when compared with average global conditions. However, we recognise that additional information is required to test the influence of other potential sources of the overestimation, such as aeolian dust, and we discuss uncertainties in the datasets used. We present a series of regional chlorophyll algorithms for the Red Sea, designed for a suite of ocean-colour sensors, that may be used for further testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The localization and reconstruction of individual trees as well as the extraction of their geometrical parameters is an important field of research in both forestry and remote sensing. While the current state-of-the-art mostly focuses on the exploitation of optical imagery and airborne LiDAR data, modern SAR sensors have not yet met the interest of the research community in that regard. This paper presents a prototypical processing chain for the reconstruction of individual deciduous trees: First, single-pass multi-baseline InSAR data acquired from multiple aspect angles are used for the generation of a layover- and shadow-free 3D point cloud by tomographic SAR processing. The resulting point cloud is then segmented by unsupervised mean shift clustering, before ellipsoid models are fitted to the points of each cluster. From these 3D ellipsoids the relevant geometrical tree parameters are extracted. Evaluation with respect to a manually derived reference dataset prove that almost 74% of all trees are successfully segmented and reconstructed, thus providing a promising perspective for further research toward individual tree recognition from SAR data.

AB Regular land development detection on a short-term basis (monthly or multi-month) has grown in importance with increasing concern over the impact of rapid urbanization on the environment. Unauthorized urban land developments have caused considerable damage to the environment in many developing countries because they are difficult to be controlled using conventional long-term (annual or multi-year) monitoring with optical remote sensing images. This paper presents the results of a novel study that detects land developments monthly using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) data. A sequence of seven RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images acquired at intervals of 24 days was obtained for this study. Land cover classification of each image was performed independently to investigate the ability of RADARSAT-2 PoISAR data in classifying land cover types under the influence of environmental change and vegetation growth. On the basis of the investigation, land cover types that are easily confused with each other were aggregated into the same category to form a new classification system that leads to the categorization of land cover changes induced by land development into types which can be accurately detected by RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images. Wishart maximum likelihood ratio (MLR) was combined with post-classification comparison (PCC) to detect land developments from each pair of successive images based on object-oriented image analysis (OOIA). The combination of Wishart MLR and PCC attempted to detect different change types and decrease the effect of classification errors on the change detection. OOIA was used to reduce the effect of speckle noise in PoISAR images, as well as extract textural and spatial features to support PoISAR image classification. The average detection accuracy and false alarm rate for monthly land development detection were 85.20% and 0.39%, respectively. The errors were mainly caused by the seasonal paddy growth, which resulted in changes that were easily confused with land developments. The results show that land developments can be effectively detected from RADARSAT-2 PoISAR images on a monthly time step. Land development is typically a gradual expansion process. By the time that it is detected using long-term detection methods, the small development may have already been developed into a large site, causing irreversible damage to the environment. Monthly short-term detection of land developments can enable the authorities to locate the sites which just start the development. This can allow the government to prevent unauthorized land developments and stop their resulting damage to the environment at an early stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB A new algorithm to retrieve characteristics (albedo and melt pond fraction) of summer ice in the Arctic from optical satellite data is described. In contrast to other algorithms this algorithm does not use a priori values of the spectral albedo of the sea-ice constituents (such as melt ponds, white ice etc.). Instead, it is based on an analytical solution for the reflection from sea ice surface. The algorithm includes the correction of the sought-for ice and ponds characteristics with the iterative procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method. Also, it accounts for the bi-directional reflection from the ice/snow surface, which is particularly important for Arctic regions where the sun is low. The algorithm includes an original procedure for the atmospheric correction, as well. This algorithm is implemented as computer code called Melt Pond Detector (MPD). The input to the current version of the MPD algorithm is the MERIS Level 1B data, including the radiance coefficients at ten wavelengths and the solar and observation angles (zenith and azimuth). Also, specific parameters describing surface and atmospheric state can be set in a configuration input file. The software output is the map of the melt ponds area fraction and the spectral albedo of sea-ice in HDF5 format. The numerical verification shows that the MPD algorithm provides more accurate results for the light ponds than for the dark ones. The spectral albedo is retrieved with high accuracy for any type of ice and ponds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative intends to provide a long-term time series of ocean colour data and investigate the detectable climate impact. A reliable and stable atmospheric correction procedure is the basis for ocean colour products of the necessary high quality. In order to guarantee an objective selection from a set of four atmospheric correction processors, the common validation strategy of comparisons between in-situ and satellite-derived water leaving reflectance spectra, is extended by a ranking system. In principle, the statistical parameters such as root mean square error, bias, etc. and measures of goodness of fit, are transformed into relative scores, which evaluate the relationship of quality dependent on the algorithms under study. The sensitivity of these scores to the selected database has been assessed by a bootstrapping exercise, which allows identification of the uncertainty in the scoring results. Although the presented methodology is intended to be used in an algorithm selection process, this paper focusses on the scope of the methodology rather than the properties of the individual processors.

AB A new algorithm for generating synthetic Landsat images is developed based on all available Landsat data. This algorithm is capable of predicting Landsat surface reflectance for any desired date. It first excludes cloud, cloud shadow, and snow observations, and then uses the remaining clear observations to estimate time series models for each Landsat pixel. Three time series models (a simple model, advanced model, and full model) are used for estimating surface reflectance for each pixel, and the selection of a time series model is dependent on the number of clear observations available: the more clear observations, the more complex the model will be that is used. For each time series model there are three components (seasonality, trend, and breaks), that are used for modeling intra-annual and inter-annual differences and abrupt surface change. Abrupt surface changes are detected by differencing predicted and observed Landsat observations, and if the difference is larger than twice the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for six consecutive observations, it will be detected as a "break" in the time series model. The RMSE values are temporally adjusted to provide better threshold range. For each "synthetic" image, a Quality Assessment (QA) Band is provided that contains information on how the time series model was estimated and used for generating the synthetic data. We have applied this approach to six Landsat scenes within the United States. We visually compared the synthetic images with real Landsat images for different kinds of environments and they are similar for all image pairs. We also quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the synthetic data by calculating the RMSE value for all clear Landsat observations. The RMSE values for the three visible bands are the lowest (approximately 0.01), and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are slightly higher in magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.02). The Near Infrared (NIR) band has the highest RMSE values (between 0.02 and 0.03). The goal of this paper is to provide Landsat images that are free of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off gaps that can be used to derive land cover and bio-physical products.

AB Vegetation fractional cover is a key metric for monitoring land management, both in pastoral and agricultural settings. Monitoring vegetation fractional cover continuously across large areas needs good remote sensing techniques underpinned by high quality field data to calibrate and validate algorithms. Here Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance data together with 1171 field observations across Australia were used to estimate vegetation fractional cover using a linear unmixing technique. The aim was to estimate the fractions of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV and NPV, respectively) and the remaining fraction of bare soil (BS). Landsat surface reflectance was averaged over a 3 x 3 pixel window representing the field area measured and also "degraded" using a 17 x 17 pixel window (similar to 0.26 km(2)) to approximate the coarser MODIS sensor's response. These two Landsat surface reflectances were used to calculate a site heterogeneity metric. Data from two MODIS-derived surface reflectance products with a pixel size of similar to 0.25 km(2) were used: (i) the 16-day nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4); and (ii) the MODIS 8-day surface reflectance (MODO9A1). Log transforms and band interaction terms were added to account for non-linearities in the spectral mixing. A cross-validation step was also included to select the optimal number of singular values to avoid over-fitting. For each surface reflectance source we investigated the residuals' correlation with site heterogeneity, soil colour and soil moisture. The best model was obtained when Landsat data for a small region around each observation were used. Root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.112, 0.162 and 0.130 for PV, NPV and BS, respectively, were obtained. As expected, degrading the Landsat data to similar to 0.26 km2 around each site decreased model goodness of fit to RMSE of 0.119, 0.174 and 0.150, respectively, for the three fractions. Using MODIS surface reflectance data gave worse results than the "degraded" Landsat surface reflectance, with MODO9A1 performing slightly better than MCD43A4. No strong evidence of soil colour or soil moisture influence on model performance was found, suggesting that the unmixing models are insensitive to soil colour and/or that the soil moisture in the top few millimetres of soil, which influence surface reflectance in optical sensors, is decoupled from the soil moisture in the top layer (Le., a few centimetres) as measured by passive microwave sensors or estimated by models. This study outlines an operational combined Landsat/MODIS product to benefit users with varying requirements of spatial resolution and temporal frequency and latency that could be applied to other regions in the world.

AB Satellite radar observations above sea are dedicated to small scale and mesoscale phenomena in the ocean and the marine boundary layer. What the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors see on the ocean surface is primarily the variation of the Bragg resonant waves providing signatures of local wind changes and imprints of atmospheric phenomena, and the areas of enhanced wave breaking associated with wave-current interaction for oceanographic processes like currents, fronts and eddies. SAR images contain information about the processes in the marine-atmosphere boundary layer (MABL), in particular when variation of wind speed and direction is significant. Several publications are available in the literature modeling and explaining each phenomenon separately. However, only a few focus on the identification of each phenomenon in an automatic or semi-automatic way. The objective of the present paper is to detect and to classify five atmospheric phenomena in SAR images: low wind areas; katabatic wind, island wakes, atmospheric gravity waves and atmospheric convective cells. An object-based environment was used to identify the phenomena and fuzzy logic used to classify them. Several features extracted for each phenomenon were used for feeding the classifier. The proposed method used 16 SAR images and accuracy was examined in another 16 SAR images using 457 object samples. The method proved to be successful with an overall accuracy of 80% and Kappa index of 0.75. The class of low wind areas negatively affected the overall accuracy due to overlapping feature values with the rest of the categories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB System Vicarious Calibration (SVC) ensures a relative radiometric calibration to satellite ocean color sensors that minimizes uncertainties in the water-leaving radiance L-w derived from the top of atmosphere radiance L-T. This is achieved through the application of gain-factors, g-factors, to pre-launch absolute radiometric calibration coefficients of the satellite sensor corrected for temporal changes in radiometric sensitivity. The g-factors are determined by the ratio of simulated to measured spectral L-T values where the former are computed using: i. highly accurate in situ Lw reference measurements; and ii. the same atmospheric models and algorithms applied for the atmospheric correction of satellite data. By analyzing basic relations between relative uncertainties of L-w and L-T, and g-factors consistently determined for the same satellite mission using different in situ data sources, this work suggests that the creation of ocean color Climate Data Records (CDRs) should ideally rely on: i. one main long-term in situ calibration system (site and radiometry) established and sustained with the objective to maximize accuracy and precision over time of g-factors and thus minimize possible biases among satellite data products from different missions; and additionally ii. unique (i.e., standardized) atmospheric model and algorithms for atmospheric correction to maximize cross-mission consistency of data products at locations different from that supporting SVC Finally, accounting for results from the study and elements already provided in literature, requirements and recommendations for SVC sites and field radiometric measurements are streamlined.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIP) at leaf level is emitted in both upward and downward directions in the red and far-red part of the spectrum (650-850 nm) when a leaf is illuminated from the upper leaf surface. Hence, total SIP is represented by the sum of the upward and downward emission components. Nevertheless, the downward component of leaf SIF is often not considered despite that downward fluorescence yield (down arrow FY) can amount up to 40% of the total fluorescence yield (FYtot). Downward SIF is mainly emitted in the far-red, since this part of fluoresced light is highly scattered within leaves, unlike red Chl fluorescence, which is mostly reabsorbed. While total FY can be quite different among distinct species, the relative partitioning between upward and downward fluorescence shows more similarities among different leaf types, especially in the far-red. It is shown that bidirectional SIF emission properties in the far-red can be attributed to the scattering properties of the leaf, whereby an equifadal leaf follows a different trend compared to bifacial leaves. This was done by comparing SIF data with simultaneously measured reflectance, transmittance and fluorescence data by means of the FluoWat leaf dip coupled with an ASD hyperspectral spectroradiometer. These results could further improve Chl fluorescence modeling at leaf level, and help to advance the interpretation of SIF at the canopy level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing can be considered a suitable approach to monitor the extent of cyanobacterial blooms compared with conventional ship surveys because of the patchiness and high spatial and temporal variability of the blooms. However, most of the existing algorithms are not capable of distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes due to their similar spectral characteristics in the red and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this study, we conducted in situ spectral measurements and satellite data analyses for cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes to find an effective method to distinguish them using medium-resolution Landsat satellite images. The reflectance spectra were measured for lake waters and cyanobacterial blooms with 13 different chlorophyll-a concentration levels (from 54 to 21,736 mu g L-1) and four types of aquatic macrophytes (two emerged and two floating-leaved macrophytes) in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. In addition, seven Landsat images were collected for nine lakes in Japan or Indonesia. We calculated several selected indices, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), five types of normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the floating algal index (FAI) to find an appropriate index for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes.
   The results showed that the spectral characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms were significantly different from those of aquatic macrophytes in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region, indicating that the SWIR bands are important for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the combination of FAI and NDWI4,5 was an effective method for classifying lake areas. We first used the FAI for extracting lake waters, and we then used the NDWI4,5 to classify the remaining areas as cyanobacterial blooms or aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the threshold of NDWI4,5 was less sensitive to the effects of both the atmosphere and mixed pixels compared to the other indices. Our application of the FAI threshold of 0.05 and the NDWI4,5 threshold of 0.63 to six lakes in Japan and Indonesia showed that the proposed method could successfully distinguish lake water, cyanobacterial blooms, and aquatic macrophytes.

AB Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, is well known for its ecological importance as a dynamic wetland system. However, due to the significant seasonality of the lake's inundation area, no systematic study has assessed the wetland changes over the past few decades. We addressed this challenge by using four decades of Landsat observations ranging from 1973 to 2013. The images were acquired in the same season to ensure similar phenological and hydrological conditions during each year. Extensive training and validation samples were collected from high-resolution Quickbird imagery to develop a Support Vector Machines (SVM) method for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. To obtain consistent results from different Landsat instruments, an empirical line correction approach was introduced to adjust the sensor-associated differences in band configurations and spectral responses. Significant changes in the major wetland cover types in Poyang Lake were revealed from long-term classification maps. The vegetation coverage of Poyang wetland showed a statistically significant increasing trend during the overall period (15.9 km(2) year(-1)), and the vegetation tended to spread into the lake center in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in recent years. At the same time, out-of-phase variability was observed for the mudflats since 1984, with a significant shrinking trend of -12.1 km(2) year(-1) (p < 0.05). Although sand coverage experienced a rapid decrease from 1973 to 1990 (from 544.3 km(2) to 62.9 km(2)), it remained at a relative stable low level (<100 km(2)) in the following period. The two national reserves in Poyang Lake shared change patterns similar to those of the entire lake. Although -70% of the long-term changes in the wetland vegetation area appeared to be explained by local temperature, there was rapid increase after 2002 possibly could be due to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The large sand area in 1973 was potentially linked to previous human activities in China between the 1950s and the 1970s. The method used in this study could be easily extended to other places in the world to assess the decadal wetland changes, and the information provided in this work is critical for future restoration efforts of the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem.

AB The offshore wind climatology in the Northern European seas is analysed from ten years of Envisat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a total of 9256 scenes, ten years of QuikSCAT and two years of ASCAT gridded ocean surface vector wind products and high-quality wind observations from four meteorological masts in the North Sea. The traditional method for assessment of the wind resource for wind energy application is through analysis of wind speed and wind direction observed during one or more years at a meteorological mast equipped with well-calibrated anemometers at several levels. The cost of such measurements is very high and therefore they are only sparsely available. An alternative method is the application of satellite remote sensing. Comparison of wind resource statistics from satellite products is presented and discussed including the uncertainty on the wind resource. The diurnal wind variability is found to be negligible at some location but up to 0.5 m s(-1) at two sites. Synergetic use of observations from multiple satellites in different orbits provides wind observations at six times in the diurnal cycle and increases the number of observations. At Horns Rev M2, FINO1 and Greater Gabbard satellite and in situ collocated samples show differences in mean wind speed of -2%, -1% and 3%, respectively. At Egmond aan Zee the difference is 10%. It is most likely due to scatterometer data sampled further offshore than at the meteorological mast. Comparing energy density with all samples at Horns Rev M2 shows overestimation 7-19% and at FINO1 underestimation 2-5% but no clear conclusion can be drawn as the comparison data are not collocated. At eight new offshore wind farm areas in Denmark, the variability in mean energy density observed by SAR ranges from 347 W m(-2) in Sejerobugten to 514 W m(-2) at Horns Rev 3. The spatial variability in the near-shore areas is much higher than at areas located further offshore. (C) 2014 DTU Wind Energy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Local, high-resolution, accurate data sets are needed to support restoration and other management initiatives in coastal salt marshes, yet field collections of site-specific vegetation data is often impractical. In this study, a novel combination of full-waveform light detection and ranging (lidar) and field techniques for assessing the distribution of aboveground biomass throughout its height and its light blocking properties were investigated. Using new field methods, strong correlations were observed (r > 0.9) between subsamples' vertical biomass (VB), the distribution of vegetation biomass by height, and vertical obscuration (VO), the measure of the vertical distribution of the ratio of vegetation to airspace, for Spartina alterniflora. Also, it was found that simple metrics derived from the lidar waveforms, such as waveform width, can provide new information to estimate salt marsh vegetation parameters. The strong correlations between field-collected biophysical parameters and metrics derived from lidar data suggest that remote sensing methods can be used to estimate some vegetation biophysical parameters such as plant height and proportion of vegetation area (PVA) using smaller, more targeted field surveys.

AB Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery have recently been used to identify broad-scale floristic units in Neotropical rain forests, corresponding to geological formations and their edaphic properties. Little is known about the structural and functional variation between these floristic units, however, and Landsat and SRTM data lack the spectral and spatial resolution needed to provide this information. Imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) have been used to measure canopy structure and function in a variety of ecosystems, but the ability of these technologies to measure differences between compositionally-distinct but otherwise uniform tropical forest types remains unknown. We combined 16 tree inventories from central Panama with imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR elevation data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to test our ability to identify patterns in plant species composition, and to measure the spectral and structural differences between adjacent closed-canopy tropical forest types. We found that variations in spectroscopic imagery and LiDAR data were strong predictors of spatial turnover in plant species composition. We also found that these compositional, chemical, and structural patterns corresponded to underlying geological formations and their geomorphological properties. We conclude that imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR data can be used to interpret patterns identified in lower resolution sensors, to provide new information on forest function and structure, and to identify underlying determinants of these patterns.

AB The objective of this study was to compare several approaches to soil moisture (SM) retrieval using L-band microwave radiometry. The comparison was based on a brightness temperature (T-B) data set acquired since 2010 by the L-band radiometer ELBARA-II over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site. ELBARA-II, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the scientific program of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission, measures multiangular T-B data at horizontal and vertical polarization for a range of incidence angles (30 degrees-60 degrees). Based on a three year data set (2010-2012), several SM retrieval approaches developed for spaceborne missions including AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS), SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS were compared. The approaches include: the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) for horizontal (SCA-H) and vertical (SCA-V) polarizations, the Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and two simplified approaches based on statistical regressions (referred to as 'Mattar' and 'Saleh'). Time series of vegetation indices required for three of the algorithms (SCA-H, SCA-V and 'Mattar') were obtained from MODIS observations. The SM retrievals were evaluated against reference SM values estimated from a multiangular 2-Parameter inversion approach. As no in situ SM data was used, the evaluation made here is relative to the use of this specific reference data set. The results obtained with the current base line algorithms developed for SMAP (SCA-H and -V) are in very good agreement with the 'reference' SM data set derived from the multi-angular observations (R-2 approximate to 0.90, RMSE varying between 0.035 and 0.056 m(3)/m(3) for several retrieval configurations). This result showed that provided the relationship between vegetation optical depth and a remotely-sensed vegetation index can be calibrated, the SCA algorithms can provide results very close to those obtained from multi-angular observations in this study area. The approaches based on statistical regressions provided similar results and the best accuracy was obtained with the 'Saleh' methods based on either bi-angular or bipolarization observations (R-2 approximate to 0.93, RMSE 0.035 m(3)/m(3)). The LPRM and DCA algorithms were found to be slightly less successful in retrieving the 'reference' SM time series (R-2 approximate to 0.75, RMSE 0.055 m(3)/m(3)). However, the two above approaches have the great advantage of not requiring any model calibrations previous to the SM retrievals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maps of nearshore marine habitat are fundamental tools for the management and conservation of coastal ecosystems. While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this paper is to better isolate the snow signature in microwave signals to be able to explore the ability of satellite microwave measurements to determine snowpack properties. The surface microwave effective emissivities used in this study are derived from SSM/I passive microwave observations by removing the contributions of the cloud and atmosphere and then separating out the surface temperature variations using ancillary atmospheric, cloud and surface data. The sensitivity of the effective emissivity to the presence/absence of snow is evaluated for the Northern Hemisphere. The effect of the presence of snow, the variation of land types, and temperature on the emissivities have been examined by observing the temporal and spatial variability of these measurements between 19 and 85 GHz over the Northern Hemisphere. The time-anomaly of differences between effective emissivity at 19 V and 85 V enabled the constant effects of land surface vegetation properties to be removed to isolate the snow signature. The resulting 12-year snow signal combined with skin temperature data can detect the existence of snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere on daily basis. The results of this method compared with the operational NOAA weekly snow cover maps agree at 90% of locations and times. Most of the disagreements could be explained by rapid evolution of snow emissivities associated with freeze-melt-refreeze cydes and precipitation (snowfall), and some of them by the space-time resolution differences of the microwave and operational snow cover determinations. These results compared with the NISE, NOAA IMS, CMC, and MODIS, and snow products agree within 78% to 92%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pinon juniper (PJ) woodlands have recently undergone dramatic drought-induced mortality, triggering broad scale structural changes in this extensive Southwestern US biome. Given that climate projections for the region suggest widespread conifer mortality is likely to continue into the next century, it is critical to better understand how this climate-induced change in vegetation structure alters ecosystem function (e.g., productivity, biogeochemical cycling, energy partitioning) in PJ woodlands. Data from satellite remote sensing could potentially help to gain some of this understanding. However, relatively little is known about the suitability of satellite remote sensing for monitoring mortality induced structural and functional changes in PJ woodlands, a semi-arid biome characterized by sparse vegetation that complicates remote sensing of vegetation properties. Here we examined the potential role of satellite remote sensing to better understand structural and functional changes that take place in PJ woodlands as they respond to and recover from climate induced mortality events. We used time series medium (30 x 30 m) and high (<= 5 x 5 m) spatial resolution satellite data in concert with eddy covariance-based gross primary productivity (GPP) data collected in a PJ woodland mortality manipulation near Mountainair, NM. Our results showed that both high and medium resolution satellite remote sensing data can provide ecosystem level assessments of overall canopy mortality and subsequent regrowth in these semiarid woodlands. However, high spatial resolution data allowed detecting the disturbance almost a full year earlier and enabled us to describe the spatially heterogeneous patterns of recovery typical for such complex. The ability of satellite remote sensing to be used to provide information about changes in ecosystem function was conditional on the presence of sufficient soil moisture; when soil moisture was present the strength of the linear relationship between GPP and spectral vegetation indices improved at the manipulated site (e.g. for high resolution NDVI data R-2 = 0.13 during drought conditions, R-2 = 0.46 when wet, P < .05) and less so at a nearby control site (R-2 = 0.09 during drought conditions, compared to R-2 = 0.22 during growing conditions, P < .05). Thus, although satellite time series can be used to monitor and improve our understanding of canopy function in both disturbed and undisturbed semi-arid coniferous biomes, combining in situ eddy covariance data with satellite time series demonstrated that the utility of these datasets is highest during periods of peak growing conditions. This study therefore provides a benchmark for understanding how spatial and temporal variation in vegetation structure and function can be best studied as semi-arid coniferous biomes respond to future climate variability.

AB In the search for a better method of estimating the light-use efficiency (LUE) of evergreen tropical rainforests, we employed remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices (VIs) to monitor both CO2 flux and canopy spectral reflectance over 3 years in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Peninsular Malaysia. We investigated the sensitivity of five VIs calculated from spectral reflectance: the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the canopy chlorophyll index (CCI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the water index (WI).
   During the monitoring period, clear seasonal variations were not found in LUE, the observed Vls or the phenological timing (particularly new leaf flush) of dominant dipterocarp trees. Although leaf phenology tended to correlate with variations in the CCI, the highest correlation coefficient among the relationships between WE and the VIs was observed in PRI (R = 0.341, n = 699). Among the relationships between LUE and meteorological factors, the strongest correlation was found between LUE and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; R = -0580). These results suggest that unseasonal variation in LUE would be more affected by water conditions than leaf phenology or green leaf mass, and that the PRI has lower sensitivity for direct estimation of LUE compared to VPD in this evergreen tropical rainforest.
   To improve the accuracy in estimating LUE, we examined the potential of combinational use of Vls and meteorological factors. Variable selection by stepwise multiple regression showed that the best variable combination for LUE estimation was the PR! and VPD (R = 0.612). The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) in the simple regression models using PR!, VPD and PRI x VPD, and the multiple regression model using PR! and VPD, was 22.5%, 19.4%, 19.0% and 18.7%, respectively. Based on these results, we concluded that (1) the estimation method solely based on the PRI as in the case of other temperate deciduous forests is not suitable in the tropical evergreen rainforest, and (2) the combinational use of the PRI and VPD offers one of the better models for estimating LUE in tropical evergreen rainforests.

AB Monitoring and quantifying changes in vegetation cover over large areas using remote sensing can potentially detect broad-scale, slow changes (e.g., climate change over decades), as well as more local and rapid changes (e.g., fire, land development over weeks and years). A widely used indicator for detecting change in land cover is a measure of greenness, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Detecting change in the NDVI, however, can be confounded by time-dependent patterns (e.g., seasonal effects) and variation associated with climate factors. In the present study we provide a method to address these confounding factors by evaluating the NDVI change using autoregression techniques that compare results from univariate (i.e., the NDVI vs. time) and multivariate analyses (the NDVI vs. time and climate variables) for similar to 314,000 1-km(2) pixels comprising the state of New Mexico over an 18-year period (1989-2006).
   The ability to detect NDVI trend was greatly improved by including climate variables in the multivariate analyses of the NDVI over time. Specifically, the fraction of pixels with a significant NDVI trend (mostly increasing) doubled from 5.2% of the pixels for the univariate autoregression analyses to 11.9% for the multivariate autoregression analyses. The comparisons of univariate and multivariate analyses also revealed that for most of the pixels with a significant NDVI trend in either analysis, the trend was consistent with changes in local factors rather than to broad-scale, slow changes (e.g., climate change); only 0.8% of the pixels had a significant NDVI trend associated with change in the climate variables. This latter finding is somewhat surprising given that several climate variables changed significantly over much of the state during the 18-year period, and the NDVI was significantly related to these variables in the multivariate autoregressions for much of the area. Close examination of several areas suggested that NDVI change in these areas was attributable to wildfires, agriculture, habitat restoration, and tree mortality associated with insect infestation.

AB Remote sensing can quantify past and present fire activity at spatial scales useful for a range of fire and vegetation management applications. In this study, we present a new automated approach to classifying burnt areas across the state of Queensland, Australia. The method is applied to complete time series of Landsat TM/ETM + imagery rather than single images and considers spectral (band 4, B4, and bands 4 + 5, B45), thermal, temporal and contextual information within a hierarchical framework. To maximise the available observations and the burnt area detected, we used imagery containing up to 60% cloud that was screened during pre-processing. Median filters were applied to smooth the time series and multi-date change detection used to locate negative outliers (large declines in reflectance relative to the median-smoothed time series). Watershed region growing was used to segment and map a larger spatial extent of the change while minimising commission errors. These segmented change objects were attributed as either burnt or unburnt using their thermal, reflective and contextual characteristics in a classification tree. Thermal information was found to be more important than reflective indices in the change attribution. Algorithm calibration used training data from ten Path/Rows located strategically across Queensland with four images sampled per path row (n = 40). Thresholds were optimised to maximise the burnt area detected while limiting under/over-growing of burnt area. Validation data covered a range of burnt areas from ten independent Path/Rows with ten images sampled across a range of burnt area fractions per Path/Row (n = 100). The results for burnt area mapping demonstrated an average producer's accuracy of 85% (range of 28 to 100% for individual images) and average user's accuracy of 71% (range of 4 to 99% for individual images). A morphological dilation of one pixel restricted to locations exhibiting a decline in B45 over time, increased the producer's accuracy by 4% but reduced the user's accuracy by 8%. The total accuracy for the burnt area classification was greater than 99%, however this is more a reflection of the small fraction of landscape represented by burnt area rather than the ability to detect burnt area. Areas frequently misdassified were related to areas of high spectral/land use change which included areas of cropping, frequently inundated land, and moisture/ground cover variations over dark soils. In this study, we applied a crop and water mask to minimise commission errors. Significantly, the results of this study demonstrate that an automated time series method for mapping burnt areas can be successfully applied across a diversity of land cover types. The method may be applied in similar savanna dominated environments but is likely to require modification to be applicable in other landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using the information of an ocean variable of a given kind to improve another variable of a different kind may be a challenging task, especially when they undergo different physical processes. Statistical methods and assimilation in numerical models had been so far the main ways to perform this type of blending, but these are relatively complicated methods that usually introduce other sources of error and uncertainty. In this paper, the existence of a multifractal hierarchy pervading the structure of all ocean scalars is exploited to introduce a new blending method. This method is not parametric and requires no knowledge about the physics governing the evolution of the scalars, provided that both scalars have the same multifractal structure. We have applied this methodology to SMOS SSS maps, using OI SST maps as template variables, observing not only a qualitative but also a significant quantitative improvement.

AB The leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most critical structural parameters of the vegetation canopy in regional and global biogeochemical, ecological, and meteorological applications. Data gaps and spatial and temporal inconsistencies exist in most of the existing global LAI products derived from single-satellite data because of their limited information content. Furthermore, the accuracy of current LAI products may not meet the requirements of certain applications. Therefore, LAI retrieval from multiple satellite data is becoming popular. An existing LAI inversion scheme using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique is further extended in this study to integrate temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The recursive update of LAI climatology with the retrieved LAI and the coupling of a canopy radiative-transfer model and a dynamic process model using the EnKF technique can fill in missing data and produce a consistent accurate time-series LA! product. During each iteration, we defined a 5 * 1 sliding window and compared the RMSEs in the selected window to determine the minimum. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from MISR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of LAI than previously available.

AB Photochemical processes driven by high-energy ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in inshore, estuarine, and coastal waters play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles and biological systems. A key to modeling photochemical processes in these optically complex waters is an accurate description of the vertical distribution of UVR in the water column which can be obtained using the diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance (K-d(lambda)). The SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms (Fichot et al., 2008) can accurately retrieve K-d (lambda = 320, 340, 380, 412, 443 and 490 nm) in oceanic and coastal waters using multispectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs(lambda), SeaWiFS bands). However, SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms are currently not optimized for use in optically complex, inshore waters, where they tend to severely underestimate K-d(lambda). Here, a new training data set of optical properties collected in optically complex, inshore waters was used to re-parameterize the original SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, resulting in improved K-d(lambda) retrievals for turbid, estuarine waters. Although the updated SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms perform best in optically complex waters, the original SeaUV/SeaUVc models still perform well in most coastal and oceanic waters. Therefore, we propose a composite set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, optimized for K-d(lambda) retrieval in almost all marine systems, ranging from oceanic to inshore waters. The composite algorithm set can retrieve K-d from ocean color with good accuracy across this wide range of water types (e.g., within a mean relative error of 13% for K-d(340)). A validation step using three independent, in situ data sets indicates that the composite SeaUV/SeaUVc can generate accurate K-d(lambda) values at lambda = 320-490 nm from ocean color on a global scale. Taking advantage of the inherent benefits of our statistical methods, we pooled the validation data with the training set, obtaining an optimized composite model for estimating K-d(lambda) in UV wavelengths for almost all marine waters. This "optimized composite" set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms will provide the optical community with improved ability to quantify the role of solar UV radiation in photochemical and photobiological processes in the ocean.

AB Optical data from a sun-synchronous satellite were used to investigate how large-scale estuarine suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations were affected by tidal and bulk meteorological drivers, and how retrieved SPM is biased by tidal aliasing and sampling under clear sky conditions. Local absorption and scattering properties were used to derive surface SPM maps from 84 cloud-free ENVISAT MERIS FR reflectance images of the Westerschelde estuary (51 degrees 30' N, 3 degrees 30' E) for the period 2006-2008, and validated with in situ SPM at fixed stations (r = 0.89 for geometric means). The distinctly different SPM maps were categorized for different tidal and seasonal conditions. Resulting composites reveal spatial patterns in SPM as a function of semi-diurnal tidal phase, fortnightly tidal phase, or season. For the estuary proper, tidal and seasonal effects on the variation of SPM are similar in magnitude. Observed controls for surface SPM are distance to shallow source area, tidal current velocity, and advection of North Sea and estuarine surface waters. Turbidity maxima appear only during favourable tidal and meteorological conditions. For the Westerschelde, the bias introduced by sun-synchronous sampling causes low water image acquisitions to uniquely coincide with spring tides, and high water images with neap tides. Cloud-free images were associated with low wind velocities. Simulations from a mud transport model confirmed the overestimation of geometric mean SPM from the tidal aliasing, and underestimation from fair weather. This resulted in a net relative error of -8% at the wave-exposed mouth, but biases cancelled out in the upper estuary. We argue that local biases should be considered when interpreting water quality products for estuaries and coasts around the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new approach for mapping wetland inundation change using Landsat and LiDAR intensity data. In this approach, LiDAR data were used to derive highly accurate reference subpixel inundation percentage (SIP) maps at the 30-m resolution. The reference SIP maps were then used to establish statistical relationships between SIP and Landsat data. Inundation changes were mapped by applying the derived relationships to Landsat images acquired in different years. This approach was applied to the upper Choptank River sub-watershed to map wetland inundation for average (2005 and 2007), dry (2009), and wet (2010) years. The derived SIP maps revealed large changes in wetland inundation among dry, average, and wet years. Total areas of near complete inundation (SIP > 75%) and high inundation (SIP between 50% and 75%) in the wet year of 2010 were about five and three times of those in the dry year of 2009, respectively. The wet year also had more medium inundated areas (SIP between 25% and 50%) than the average and dry years, but low inundated areas (SIP < 25%) did not have any particular trend. The mapped inundation changes were found correlated with local drought conditions and stream flow, with the near complete inundated and highly inundated areas having the highest correlations. Given the fact that Landsat are globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable and available, the approach developed in this study has potential for deriving historical inundation changes over the past decades and for monitoring ongoing changes over much larger areas than demonstrated in this study.

AB The use of Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) is rapidly gaining acceptance as a source of ground displacement information for permafrost regions. The accuracy of the information however, is still not well established. This paper uses a stack of RADARSAT-2 D-InSAR data to map seasonal ground displacement at the Iqaluit Airport, Baffin Island, Canada. The accuracy and information content of the D-InSAR products are evaluated with a variety of ground truth data. The D-InSAR derived seasonal ground displacement patterns align well with surficial geology units and reflect the thaw settlement characteristics of the sediments; they also identify localised displacement patterns in the vicinity of features such as ice wedges and frost cracks. Comparisons with ground settlement measurements from in-situ thaw tubes indicate sub-centimetre agreement in dry areas. In low lying wet areas however, subject to saturation and flooding, the D-InSAR stack significantly underestimates the true settlement, detecting only 3.7 cm of the 8.5 cm thaw tube measurement The combination of high phase gradients and poor coherence over intermittently flooded surfaces makes it challenging to preserve reliable phase measurements in these areas. Information from electromagnetic surveys shows that some surface displacement is related to sub-surface conditions (<6 m depth), possibly conditions related to the presence and movement of water in the active layer and to a lesser extent, unfrozen water content within the permafrost.

AB Hybrid-polarity SAR architecture will be included in future SAR missions such as the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). These sensors will enable the use of compact polarimetry (CP) data in wide swath imagery. We investigate the sea ice type and open water classification potential of CP parameters for future RCM image modes. We simulate twenty three CP parameters for three RCM modes with different resolutions and noise floors, using RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized data. A case study is used encompassing multi-year sea ice, first-year sea ice and open water, in the Canadian Arctic. We use a methodology for quantitatively selecting the optimum CF parameter subset for classification. Preliminary CF parameter selection is based on Jeffries-Matusita separability. A batch-mode Maximum Likelihood classification approach is then used to iterate through all possible combinations of CP parameter subsets, in order to select the optimum subset, the one with the highest accuracy. Combinations between two and ten CP parameters, depending on RCM mode, are found to provide the highest accuracy. The effects of an increased noise level and higher resolution on different CP parameters are found to vary. However, the impact on classification accuracy is small. High classification accuracies support methodology for the selection of the working subset of the CP parameters and their classification potential. Multi-year sea ice, first-year sea ice and open water can be successfully classified with an overall classification accuracy of 99.92% using two simulated compact polarimetric parameters from the RCM LN25 mode: the circular cross polarization ratio and the volume scattering parameters of the m-chi and m-delta decompositions. In the same mode, the ice and the open water can be successfully discriminated with an overall accuracy of 100% using the sigma nought back-scattering coefficients sigma(RH)degrees and sigma(RR)degrees in addition to the two previous compact polarimetric parameters.

AB Airborne small-footprint LiDAR is replacing field measurements in regional-level forest inventories, but auxiliary fieldwork is still required for the optimal management of young stands. Waveform (WF) -recording sensors can provide a more detailed description of the vegetation than discrete return (DR) systems through accurate characterization of the backscattered signal. Furthermore, knowing the signal shape facilitates comparisons between real data and those obtained with simulation tools. We performed calibration and quantitative validation of a Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) -based LiDAR simulator against real data, and used simulations and real data to study small-footprint WF-recording LiDAR for the classification of juvenile boreal forest vegetation. The simulations were based on geometric-optical models of three species: birch (Betula pendula Roth), raspberry (Rubus idaeus L), and fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium (L) Holub). Simulated WF features were in good agreement with the real data (differences of -19% to 11% in radiometric features, -0.23 m to 0.45 m in mean height), and relative interspecies differences were preserved. We used simulated data to study the effects of sensor parameters on the classification among the three species. An increase in footprint size improved the classification accuracy up to 0.30-036 m in diameter, while the emitted pulse width and the WF sampling rate showed minor effects. Finally, we used real data to classify four silviculturally important vegetation functional groups (conifers, broad-leaved trees, low vegetation (green), low vegetation (barren) + abiotic material). Classification accuracies of 68.1-86.7% (kappa 0.50-0.80) showed slight improvement compared with existing studies on DR LiDAR and passive optical data. The results of simulator validation serve as a basis for the future use of simulation models, e.g. in LiDAR survey planning or in the simulation of synthetic training data, while the other findings clarify the potential of small-footprint WF data for characterizing vegetation in intensively managed forest stands at seedling and sapling stages in the boreal region.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation in tropical high mountain areas remains a key challenge. Point measurements are often not sufficient to capture the strong spatial variability particularly in mountain regions. Satellite remote sensing allows capturing the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation, yet it is generally characterized by significant bias. Rainfall satellite products such as those coming from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are being continuously improved and an increasing amount of high- and medium-resolution remote sensing data on biophysical surface properties is becoming available. Here we present a methodology that blends two TRMM products with remote sensing data on vegetation and topography to quantify the spatial distribution of precipitation in areas where direct observations are lacking. The approach assumes that vegetation cover, the topography and satellite-derived estimates of rainfall are reasonable indirect measures of ground-based precipitation. The methodology is evaluated for an area in the Andes of Ecuador. The results show that around 40% of the variance in weekly precipitation is explained by these proxies. During the drier periods of the year, vegetation is the strongest proxy. In the very wet areas and during the wet periods vegetation is usually in a climax development phase with no development trends to correlate with rain, and the other proxies dominate precipitation estimation. A cross-validation procedure in which each one of the weather stations is sequentially excluded from the analysis, was applied to test the performance of the methodology. The performance was satisfactory, and as expected it is related to the density of the weather station network and temporal rainfall variability. Overall we conclude that the methodology is useful for areas with very high variable conditions, where sufficient ground-data is available to establish the relationships with the different remote sensing datasets.

AB Methods for estimating seasonal and long term trends of the Arctic sea ice albedo are of growing importance to cryosphere and climate studies. Remote sensing of the sea ice albedo has hitherto been carried out using optical satellite instruments. However, the measured data is often insufficient in late summer and fall because of clouds and low solar elevations. Therefore, new methods are a prerequisite for realistic estimations for the global sea ice albedo over the whole melting-refreezing period. Here, we show that a new microwave based sea ice albedo estimation method alleviates problems of optical instruments, offering new albedo data especially during the refreezing periods even on a daily basis. In this study we present detailed weekly and daily albedo progress over the whole Arctic sea ice area from June to September for the period of 2003-2011, estimated using the microwave method.

AB This study assesses the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/albedo 8 day standard product and products from the daily Direct Broadcast BRDF/albedo algorithm, and shows that these products agree well with ground-based albedo measurements during the more difficult periods of vegetation dormancy and snow cover. Cropland, grassland, deciduous and coniferous forests are considered. Using an integrated validation strategy, analyses of the representativeness of the surface heterogeneity under both dormant and snow-covered situations are performed to decide whether direct comparisons between ground measurements and 500-m satellite observations can be made or whether finer spatial resolution airborne or spaceborne data are required to scale the results at each location. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data are used to generate finer scale representations of albedo at each location to fully link ground data with satellite data. In general, results indicate the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are less than 0.030 over spatially representative sites of agriculture/grassland during the dormant periods and less than 0.050 during the snow-covered periods for MCD43A albedo products. For forest, the RMSEs are less than 0.020 during the dormant period and 0.025 during the snow-covered periods. However, a daily retrieval strategy is necessary to capture ephemeral snow events or rapidly changing situations such as the spring snow melt. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eight-year ocean color observations between 2002 and 2009 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the satellite Aqua are used to quantitatively assess the tidal effects on variability of ocean's optical, biological, and biogeochemical properties in the Chesapeake Bay. We demonstrate that tidal variation in the lower Chesapeake Bay is one of the important ocean processes that drive significant changes of the ocean's optical and biogeochemical properties. Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), and total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration show significant tidal variations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Indeed, in the lower Bay region, K-d(490) increases from 0.9 m(-1) under low tidal current conditions at 0.10-0.15 m/s to 1.35 m(-1) under high tidal current conditions at 0.45-0.50 m/s, while chlorophyll-a concentration in the lower Bay region decreases slightly with an increase of the tidal current. Tide-driven variability in K-d(490) and TSS in the lower Bay is similar to and slightly larger than the seasonal variability in the region. On the other hand, different from the variability in the lower Bay, the tidal effects on the ecosystem are small and negligible in the middle and a large part of upper Chesapeake Bay regions.

AB In this paper we present maps of K, eU, and eTh abundances of Elba Island (Italy) obtained with a multivariate spatial interpolation of airborne gamma-ray data using the constraints of the geologic map. The radiometric measurements were performed by a module of four NaI(Tl) crystals of 16 L mounted on an autogyro. We applied the collocated cokriging (CCoK) as a multivariate estimation method for interpolating the primary under-sampled airborne gamma-ray data considering the well-sampled geological information as ancillary variables. A random number has been assigned to each of 73 geological formations identified in the geological map at scale 1:10,000. The non-dependency of the estimated results from the random numbering process has been tested for three distinct models. The experimental cross-semivariograms constructed for radioelement-geology couples show well-defined co-variability structures for both direct and crossed variograms. The high statistical correlations among K, eU, and eTh measurements are confirmed also by the same maximum distance of spatial autocorrelation. Combining the smoothing effects of probabilistic interpolator and the abrupt discontinuities of the geological map, the results show a distinct correlation between the geological formation and radioactivity content. The contour of Mt. Capanne pluton can be distinguished by high K, eU and eTh abundances, while different degrees of radioactivity content identify the tectonic units. A clear anomaly of high K content in the Mt. Calamita promontory confirms the presence of felsic dykes and hydrothermal veins not reported in our geological map. Although we assign a unique number to each geological formation, the method shows that the internal variability of the radiometric data is not biased by the multivariate interpolation.

TI Quantifying the heat flux and outflow rate of hot springs using airborne

AB In undertaking heat loss studies of geothermal systems, it is important to consider the heat flux associated with the outflow of thermal waters at hot springs, which may account for over 50% of the total natural surface heat loss. Conventional in-situ methods for quantifying hot spring heat flux may not always be feasible if there are low rates of flow or thermal waters are not confined to well-defined drainage channels. This paper describes the use of high spatial resolution airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery for quantifying the heat flux and corresponding outflow rate of hot springs using a case study of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. The approach is based upon the use of a simplified, steady-state, heat budget model that describes the heat gains and losses from areas of thermal water to calculate the hot spring heat flux required to maintain the temperature of these waters above ambient conditions. Inputs to the model include calibrated surface temperature maps for areas of thermal water derived from processing of airborne TIR imagery acquired using a broadband forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera as well various atmospheric variables relevant to the thermodynamics of water bodies. The model is applied on a per-pixel basis to provide maps of the hot spring heat flux for the thermal waters. The total hot spring heat flux, representing the sum of the per-pixel heat fluxes, is used to calculate a corresponding hot spring outflow rate assuming a fixed hot spring temperature. This approach has been applied to TIR imagery acquired during two surveys over Pilgrim Hot Springs in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. Although the heat budget model is particularly sensitive to wind speed, the results provide conservative estimates of the hot spring heat flux and outflow rates (at 81.3 degrees C) of similar to 4.7-6.7 MW thermal energy, and similar to 976-1400 1/min, respectively. These results are 2-3 times higher than field-based estimates of the hot spring heat flux derived using direct measurements of the flow rate in streams draining part of the thermal catchment at the site. This result is consistent with the synoptic capabilities of the airborne TIR data that map all areas of thermal water. This approach has significant potential as a rapid and repeatable method for quantitative investigations of spring-dominated geothermal systems in support of resource assessment, and long-term monitoring.

   the Chesapeake Bay
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE Chesapeake Bay; Spatial interpolation; Satellite remote sensing;
   MODIS-derived salinity; Sea surface temperature; Hydrodynamic models
AB In dynamic coastal systems such as the Chesapeake Bay, limited coverage and frequency of in situ measurements often makes generalizability of regional forecasting systems difficult Satellite-derived environmental variables have the potential to address this problem, but satellite datasets suffer from incomplete coverage as well: atmospheric conditions-most notably cloud cover-lead to data gaps that significantly hinder the broad application of satellite-informed predictions. In this study, the Chesapeake Bay estuary was used as a model "test bed" to which we applied the power of near real-time satellite-derived observations to the issue of water quality monitoring. To use remote sensing in support of spatially complete estimates of salinity and temperature in the Bay, we tested geospatial interpolation techniques as a method for filling gaps and minimizing errors in the satellite record. These interpolated values were then compared to the output of a regional hydrodynamic model in order to assess the relative value of each method for generating inputs into various modeling applications. Results show that MODIS-derived salinity and temperature can be interpolated with acceptable accuracy in the Bay, with a mean absolute error of 1.88 psu and 0.60 degrees C. These errors differed systematically from ChesROMS errors both spatially and seasonally, with higher errors for salinity and lower errors for temperature at most sampling stations throughout the year. This suggests that the two techniques offer complementary information that can be applied to ecological monitoring systems in complex estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The main objective of this research is to develop, test and validate a soil moisture content (SMC) algorithm for GMES Sentinel-1 characteristics. The SMC product, which is to be generated from Sentinel-1 data, requires an algorithm capable of processing operationally in near-real-time and delivering the product to the GMES services within 3 h from observation. An approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been proposed that represents a good compromise between retrieval accuracy and processing time, thus enabling compliance with the timeliness requirements. The algorithm has been tested and subsequently validated in several test areas in Italy, Australia, and Spain.
   In all cases the validation results were very much in line with GMES requirements (with RMSE generally <4%SMC - between 1.67%SMC and 6.68%SMC - and very low bias), except for the case of the test area in Spain, where the validation results were penalized by the availability of only VV polarized SAR images and MODIS low-resolution NDVI. Nonetheless, the obtained RMSE was slightly higher than 4%SMC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cities and surrounding suburbs are Earth's fastest growing land.use. Urban impervious surfaces affect hydrological and energy balances, as well as biological composition and functioning of ecosystems. Although datasets have been produced documenting urban growth at multiple time periods in coarse intervals, there remains an unmet need for observations spanning multiple decades at high frequency. We have developed an empirical method for retrieving annual, long-term continuous fields of impervious surface cover from the Landsat archive and applied it to the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, MD megalopolis from 1984 to 2010. Fitting and applying a single regression model over time, the method relies on a multi-annual training sample of high-resolution impervious cover layers tied to coincident intra- and inter-annual Landsat image composites. These predictor images are composited and normalized to maximize discrimination of impervious surfaces from intermittently bare agricultural fields and minimize inter-annual variation due to phenology, solar illumination, and atmospheric noise. Excluding the year 2009 due to lack of data availability resulting from nearly continual winter snow cover, the resulting dataset is a continuous-field representation of impervious surface cover at 30-m horizontal and annual temporal resolution from 1984 to 2010. Average error was approximately +/- 6% cover, with outliers due to shadows from large buildings in winter images. The region's impervious surface cover grew from 881 to 1176 +/- 11 km(2) over the 27-year span-an average annual gain of approximately 11 +/- 2 km(2)/year-with great variability among local municipalities in terms of rate of development. Patterns including intensification (i.e., "infill") and expansion (i.e., exurban or "sprawl") of development, as well as fragmentation and isolation of natural areas were clearly visible in the data at various places and times. Neither impervious surface loss nor deceleration of growth were observed in any of the cities or counties over the study span. These findings show that empirical retrieval of impervious coverage at the spatial and temporal scale of the Landsat archive is possible using dense time-stacks of calibrated Landsat images, and that long-term records such as this can provide new opportunities for analyzing land-use patterns and their underlying causes to improve understanding of socio-economic processes and human-environment interactions.

AB We compared estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) produced with six different vegetation measures derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and three contrasting estimation approaches using measurements from eddy covariance flux towers at 16 FLUXNET sites located over six different land cover types. The aim was to assess optimal approaches in using optical remote sensing to estimate ET. The first two approaches directly regressed various MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and products such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) with ET and evaporative fraction (EF). In the third approach, the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation was inverted to obtain surface conductance (G(s)), for dry plant canopies. The G(s) values were then regressed against the MODIS data products and used to parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of ET. Jack-Knife cross-validation was used to evaluate the various regression models against observed ET. The PM-G(s) approach provided the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), and highest determination coefficients (R-2) across all sites, with an average RMSE = 38 W m(-2) and R-2=0.72. Direct regressions of observed ET against the VIs resulted in an average RMSE = 60 W m(-2) and R-2=0.22, while the EF regressions an average RMSE = 42 W m(-2) and R-2=0.64. The MODIS LAI and fPAR product produced the poorest estimates of ET (RMSE> 44 W m(-2) and R-2<0.6); while the VIs each performed best for some of the land cover types. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) produced the best Er estimates for evergreen needleleaf forest (RMSE = 28.4W m(-2), R-2=0.66). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) best estimated ET in grassland (RMSE = 23.8 W m(-2) and R-2=0.68), cropland (RMSE = 29.2 W m(-2) and R-2=0.86) and woody savannas (RMSE = 25.4 W m(-2) and R-2=0.82), while the VI-based crop coefficient (K-c) yielded the best estimates for evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests (RMSE = 27 W m(-2) and R-2=0.7 in both cases). Using the ensemble-average of ET as estimated using NDVI, EVI and K-c we computed global grids of dry canopy conductance (G(c)) from which annual statistics were extracted to characterise different functional types. The resulting G(c) values can be used to parameterize land surface models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical rainforests are significant contributors to the global cycles of energy, water and carbon. As a result, monitoring of the vegetation status over regions such as Amazonia has been a long standing interest of Earth scientists trying to determine the effect of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the tropical ecosystems and its feedback on the Earth's climate. Satellite-based remote sensing is the only practical approach for observing the vegetation dynamics of regions like the Amazon over useful spatial and temporal scales, but recent years have seen much controversy over satellite-derived vegetation states in Amazonia, with studies predicting opposite feedbacks depending on data processing technique and interpretation. Recent results suggest that some of this uncertainty could stem from a lack of quality in atmospheric correction and cloud screening. In this paper, we assess these uncertainties by comparing the current standard surface reflectance products (MYD09, MYD09GA) and derived composites (MYD09A1, MCD43A4 and MYD13A2 - Vegetation Index) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to results obtained from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. MAIAC uses a new cloud screening technique, and novel aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction procedures which are based on time-series and spatial analyses. Our results show considerable improvements of MAIAC processed surface reflectance compared to MYD09/MYD13 with noise levels reduced by a factor of up to 10. Uncertainties in the current MODIS surface reflectance product were mainly due to residual cloud and aerosol contamination which affected the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): During the wet season, with cloud cover ranging between 90% and 99%, conventionally processed NDVI was significantly depressed due to undetected clouds. A smaller reduction in NDVI due to increased aerosol levels was observed during the dry season, with an inverse dependence of NDVI on aerosol optical thickness (AOT). NDVI observations processed with MAIAC showed highly-reproducible and stable inter-annual patterns with little or no dependence on cloud cover, and no significant dependence on AOT (p < 0.05). In addition to a better detection of cloudy pixels, MAIAC obtained about 20-80% more cloud free pixels, depending on season, a considerable amount for land analysis given the very high cloud cover (75-99%) observed at any given time in the area. We conclude that a new generation of atmospheric correction algorithms, such as MAIAC, can help to dramatically improve vegetation estimates over tropical rain forest, ultimately leading to reduced uncertainties in satellite-derived vegetation products globally.

AB Environmental variability has important influences on mosquito life cycles and understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of mosquito populations is critical for mosquito control and vector-borne disease prevention. Meteorological data used for model-based predictions of mosquito abundance and life cycle dynamics are typically acquired from ground-based weather stations: however, data availability and completeness are often limited by sparse networks and resource availability. In contrast, environmental measurements from satellite remote sensing are more spatially continuous and can be retrieved automatically. This study compared environmental measurements from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and in situ weather station data to examine their ability to predict the abundance of two important mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex tarsalis) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA from 2005 to 2010. The AMSR-E land parameters included daily surface water inundation fraction, surface air temperature, soil moisture, and microwave vegetation opacity. The AMSR-E derived models had better fits and higher forecasting accuracy than models based on weather station data despite the relatively coarse (25-km) spatial resolution of the satellite data. In the AMSR-E models, air temperature and surface water fraction were the best predictors of Aedes vexans, whereas air temperature and vegetation opacity were the best predictors of Cx. tarsalis abundance. The models were used to extrapolate spatial, seasonal, and interannual patterns of climatic suitability for mosquitoes across eastern South Dakota. Our findings demonstrate that environmental metrics derived from satellite passive microwave radiometry are suitable for predicting mosquito population dynamics and can potentially improve the effectiveness of mosquito-borne disease early warning systems.

AB We investigate the instability of slopes in a 15.6 km(2) catchment area in the Southern Apennine mountains (Italy) traversed by a mid-slope road and characterized by predominance of clay-rich flysch units. High resolution multispectral satellite imagery is used to identify active landslides, to investigate their close association with seasonally wet zones (areas covered by free surface-water including ponds, migrating surface-water, seeps), as well as to guide subsurface hydrogeological investigations. By combining the remotely sensed surface information and the extensive subsurface dataset from over 40 monitoring piezometer bore-holes we demonstrate that many wet zones initially mapped from the IKONOS imagery are indicative of sites with seasonally persistent very high groundwater levels within landslide-prone slopes and on intermittently active landslides. Where such surface-subsurface water linkage can be established, the appearance of the wet zones (fully saturated ground/soil) resulting from groundwater discharge or seepage can be used as a forewarning signal of the increased susceptibility to landsliding, since the hillslopes with shallow groundwater tables are generally more prone to failure. The information about changing surface-water conditions retrieved from high resolution satellite data timely acquired during rainy seasons can thus provide crucial input for temporal and spatial landslide hazard assessments. We anticipate that in the near future high resolution optical space-borne remote sensing will become a commonly used tool for monitoring landslide activity and for providing temporal series of spatial data necessary to improve our understanding of causative and triggering processes leading to slope failures.

AB In this paper two sampling and estimation strategies for regional forest inventory were investigated in detail and results were presented for various geographical scales. Airborne laser scanner (ALS) data were acquired to augment data from a systematic sample of National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground plots in Hedmark County, Norway (27,390 km(2)). Approximately 50% of the NFI field plots were covered by the systematic ALS sample of 53 parallel flight lines spaced 6 km apart. The area was stratified into eight cover classes and independent log-transformed regression models were developed for each class to predict total above-ground dry biomass (AGB). The two laser-ground estimation strategies tested were a model-dependent (MD), two-phase approach that rests on the assumption that the predictive models are correctly specified, and a model-assisted (MA) approach with a two-stage probability sampling design which utilizes design-unbiased estimators. ALS AGB estimates were reported by land cover class and compared to the NH ground estimates. The ALS-based MA and MD mean estimates differed from the NFI AGB estimates by about 2% and 8%, respectively, for the entire County. At the county level the smallest estimated standard error (SE) for the estimates was obtained using the field data alone. However, the SEs calculated from field and ALS data were based on unequal numbers of ground plots. When considering only the NFI plots in the ALS strips, the smallest SEs were obtained using the MD framework. However, we also illustrated the sensitivity of the estimates of applying different plausible models. All the applied estimators assumed simple random sampling while the selection of flight lines as well as ground plots followed a systematic design. Thus, the estimates of SE were most likely conservative. Simulated sampling undertaken in a parallel research effort suggests that the overestimation of the SEs was probably much larger for the ALS-based estimates compared to the NEI estimates. ALS-based estimates were also derived for sub-county political units and thereby demonstrated how limited sample sizes affect the standard error of the biomass estimates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB A series of satellite-based passive and active microwave instruments provide soil moisture retrievals spanning altogether more than three decades. This offers the opportunity to generate a combined product that incorporates the advantages of both microwave techniques and spans the observation period starting 1979. However, there are several challenges in developing such a dataset, e.g., differences in instrument specifications result in different absolute soil moisture values, the global passive and active microwave retrieval methods produce conceptually different quantities, and products vary in their relative performances depending on vegetation density. This paper presents an approach for combining four passive microwave products from the VU University Amsterdam/National Aeronautics and Space Administration and two active microwave products from the Vienna University of Technology. First, passive microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TMI) instruments were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) derived product and then all four were combined into a single merged passive microwave product. Second, active microwave soil moisture estimates from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) Scatterometer instrument were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) derived estimates. Both were combined into a merged active microwave product. Finally, the two merged products were rescaled to a common globally available reference soil moisture dataset provided by a land surface model (GLDAS-1-Noah) and then blended into a single passive/active product. Blending of the active and passive data sets was based on their respective sensitivity to vegetation density. While this three step approach imposes the absolute values of the land surface model dataset to the final product, it preserves the relative dynamics (e.g., seasonality and inter-annual variations) of the original satellite derived retrievals. More importantly, the long term changes evident in the original soil moisture products were also preserved. The method presented in this paper allows the long term product to be extended with data from other current and future operational satellites. The multi-decadal blended dataset is expected to enhance our basic understanding of soil moisture in the water, energy and carbon cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid fire severity assessments are essential for timely post-fire rehabilitation responses. The Landsat differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) has become the standard spectral index for assessing fire severity. The dNBR is generally calculated using the first available cloud-free post-fire image and a pre-fire image. This bitemporal image differencing can be problematic due to image-to-image differences in illumination and phenology for example. We have developed an alternative index based on single date short-wave infrared (SWIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance. In contrast with the (d)NBR, the SWIR-MIR index (SMI) is robust against scattering caused by smoke plumes over active fires allowing fire severity assessments to be generated when the area is still obscured by smoke. The SMI was generated using MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over the recent 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona, USA. Simulation experiments showed that the SMI is more sensitive to char fractional cover than the NBR. We performed a regression analysis in which 92 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) field plots of severity were randomly assigned to two equal halves, a training and a validation dataset, during ten separate trials. The SMI performed better to estimate GeoCBI values than the NBR (SMI R-2=0.69 +/- 0.06 and NBR R-2=0.60 +/- 0.06). The dNBR demonstrated slightly better performance than the SMI (dNBR R-2= 0.71 +/- 0.05), however this difference was not significant at the 95% confidence level. Although no spaceborne sensors with pixel sizes smaller than 100 m currently offer the possibility of a SWIR-MIR band combination, the airborne results illustrate the potential of this band combination for the remote sensing of post-fire effects. Such data will become available with the advent of the next generation satellite sensors, such as the planned spaceborne Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI). (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding fine-grain patterns of forest disturbance and regrowth at the landscape scale is critical for effective management, particularly in forests in western Washington, Oregon, and California, U.S., where the policy known as the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was imposed in 1994 over >8 million ha of forest in an effort to balance environmental and economic tensions. We developed approaches to create disturbance and regrowth maps for forests within the area of the NWFP from the results of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm described previously only at the pixel scale. Maps were developed from 674 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper + images distributed across 22 separate scene areas, and were assessed for validity at 2360 points using TimeSync, a time-series validation and interpretation tool. Unlike maps derived using other techniques, maps derived from the segmentation approach were unique in providing simultaneous detection of abrupt disturbance, chronic disturbance, and ongoing vegetative growth with consistency across large areas and across time. Maps were then used to address six core monitoring questions focusing on the distribution of disturbance across time, ownership categories, and ecoregions. Forest was disturbed at rates that varied by ownership category and state, ranging from 9% to >39% of forest area over the period 1985 to 2008, with highest cumulative disturbed area on private and native lands in Washington and Oregon and lowest disturbed area on federal protected lands in Washington. Effects of court injunctions and subsequent implementation of the NWFP lowered forest disturbance rates, particularly in Oregon, and also caused decreases in the relative magnitude of disturbance on those lands relative to private lands. State-managed forests showed forest disturbance rates that varied considerably among the three states, with the highest rates in Washington state and lowest in California. Affected by large, stochastic fire events, protected lands in both Oregon and California showed disturbance rates similar to those found on actively managed federal lands. Protected lands also experienced high rates of chronic disturbance, often associated with insect-related mortality. As expected, moisture-limited ecoregions recovered vegetation more slowly than those where moisture was not limiting. Vegetative regrowth rates showed substantial variation among ownership categories. suggesting that differential forest policies may affect vegetative recovery rate. Taken together, these results emphasize that forest management policies do have manifestations at the landscape scale, but that detection of these manifestations is best achieved with mapping approaches that can detect both abrupt and longer-duration processes within the Landsat archive.

AB This study focuses on the directionality of wheat leaf reflectance as a function of leaf surface characteristics. Wheat leaf BRF measurements were completed under 45 degrees zenith illumination angle in three visible broad spectral bands with a conoscope that provides very high angular resolution data over a large portion of the whole hemisphere, including around the illumination direction. The measurements show a clear anisotropy with a specular lobe in the forward scattering direction and a small but significant hotspot feature in the backward scattering direction. The BRF directional features further depend on the illumination orientation because of the leaf roughness created by longitudinal veins: the specular lobe was more pronounced when the illumination was perpendicular to the veins, while specular reflection was more spread over azimuths for longitudinal illumination. Moreover, a sharp hotspot feature was observed for transversal illumination where the apparent roughness is the largest. The scattering was tentatively decomposed into specular, hotspot and isotropic components. Results showed that the hotspot contribution to the directional hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) was marginal conversely to that of the specular component that ranges between 0.036 and 0.050 (absolute DHRF value). The specular component was almost the same in the three visible bands considered. The isotropic component originating from volume scattering was contributing the most to the DHRF and was depending on wavelength, ranging between 0.055 and 0.097 in absolute DHRF value. A simple model was proposed to estimate the volume scattering from the isotropic and the surface components. Consequences of these findings were drawn on the ability to estimate leaf biochemical composition independently from leaf surface scattering, as well as on the interpretation of remote sensing at the canopy level.

AB Quantifying above-cloud aerosol can help improve the assessment of aerosol intercontinental transport and climate impacts. In this study we conduct an integrated analysis of aerosols above clouds by using multi-sensor A-Train measurements, including above-cloud aerosol optical depth at 532 nm (AOD(532)) from CALIPSO lidar, the UV aerosol index (AI) from OMI, and cloud fraction and cloud optical depth (COD) from MOD'S. The analysis of Saharan dust outflow and Southwest African smoke outflow regions shows that the above-cloud AOD correlates positively with AI in an approximately linear manner, and that the AOD(532)/AI ratio decreases with increasing COD. The dependence of AOD(532)/AI ratio on COD doesn't depend on aerosol type when potential biases in the CALIOP AOD measurements are empirically accounted for. Our results may suggest the potential of combining OMI AI and MODIS cloud measurements to empirically derive above-cloud AOD with a spatial coverage much more extensive than CALIPSO measurements, which needs 10 be further explored in the future.

AB The Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 satellite missions can meet various observational needs for spatially explicit physical, biogeophysical, and biological variables of the ocean, cryosphere, and land research activities. The currently known observational requirements were extracted from documents produced by major international scientific projects and programs. The summarized observational needs were then cross-referenced with the capabilities of the planned sensors aboard of the first three Sentinels. A comparative analysis, also incorporating scientific challenges of the ESA Living Planet Programme and the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), resulted in a preliminary scientific priority assessment of the reviewed environmental variables. Results of these activities, discussed and consolidated in March 2011 at the Sentinels for Science (SEN4SCI) scientific workshop, demonstrate the high potential of the Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 missions for systematic, long-term observations of the Earth system.

Satellite and payload are being built to provide routine, day-and-night, all-weather medium (typically 10 m) resolution observation capability. Ground infrastructure is provided for planning, mission control, data processing, dissemination and archiving. Free and open data access is provided. Data quality of the Sentinel-1 data products is shown along with uncertainty estimation of retrieved information products confirming specified performance and indicating application growth potential. The unique data availability performance of the Sentinel-1 routine operations makes the mission particularly suitable for emergency response support, marine surveillance, ice monitoring and interferometric applications such as detection of subsidence and landslides.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE Land surface temperature; MODIS; Aqua; Terra; Clouds
ID SOIL-MOISTURE; CLOUDS
AB A major shortcoming of any remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) dataset is the lack of observations for cloud-covered areas. A method is presented that uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the Terra platform to fill in spatial gaps in the Aqua MODIS LST dataset over the conterminous United States (CONUS) and limited adjacent areas. Over this domain, data are available for only about 50% of all times and pixels for each of the two MODIS sensors. Coverage is highest in summer and lowest in winter, with major regional variations. The relative close temporal proximity (similar to 3 h) of the Aqua and Terra overpasses provides an opportunity to combine information from the two data sources, which can reduce the data loss, most of which we assume is cloud-related. We applied the approach to create a 'merged' data set that supplements existing Aqua and Terra daytime and nighttime LST products. We used Terra LST data to fill gaps in Aqua data, resulting in a data set tied to the similar to 1:30 AM/PM overpass times, so that the resulting data closely approximate daily minimum and maximum LST values. In order to use Terra LST observations to supplement Aqua data, an adjustment was applied to account for the different overpass times of the two platforms. Terra's 10:30 AM overpass usually senses a cooler surface than does Aqua with its 1:30 PM overpass. Conversely, for nighttime overpasses, Terra typically measures a warmer surface at 10:30 PM than does Aqua at 1:30 AM. Our approach was to determine, by season, mean Aqua and Terra LST values on the CONUS grid, based on data from a multi-year (2003-2008) period. Adding the mean Aqua-Terra LST differences for the respective season and time of day to a daily gridded Terra LST field removes the mean offset related to overpass time, resulting in LST values that can then be used to fill Aqua LST data gaps. Using independent offsets for each grid cell and season provides a first-order accounting for factors such as land cover, elevation, terrain slope and aspect, latitude, season and snow cover, which control the diurnal cycle of LST. For the six-year period, the merged data set increases data coverage by 24% and 30% for daytime and nighttime overpasses, respectively, relative to the Aqua LST product alone. The CONUS data set is a potentially valuable tool for weather and climate studies in which high spatial and temporal coverage are desired. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite derived night-time lights have been used to study global economic and demographic differences between countries. The majority of studies to date have used the coarse spatial resolution datasets of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). In this study, we hypothesize that night-time lights can serve as an indicator for demographic and socio-economic properties of built-up areas at a local scale. We used night-time light images acquired by the American DMSP (2003, 2.7 km), Argentinean SAC-C (2007, 300 m) and photographs taken by astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS; 2003. 60 m). We compared the night-time lights of built-up areas based on their geographical location (Israel and the West Bank) and their population (Jewish and Arab). Israeli localities were better lit than West Bank localities, corresponding to the difference in the gross domestic product of the two entities. No difference was found in the night-time lights brightness of Jewish and Arab localities within Israel. However, night-time lights of built-up areas with a Jewish population within Israel and the West Bank were positively correlated with population density and roads density. In contrast, built-up areas with an Arab population had weaker correlations. Differences in the urban structure of Jewish and Arab built-up areas, as well as economic and geopolitical differences between Israel and the West Bank led to the observed differences in night-time lights patterns. Demographic and infrastructure data were able to explain 60% of the spatial variation of the ISS night-time lights, compared with only 28% of the spatial variation of the DMSP night-time lights dataset. The results of this study demonstrate potential uses of night-time lights databases of high spatial resolution, and emphasize the need for a dedicated night-time lights observing satellite.

AB Russian boreal forests are the largest forested zone on Earth and a tremendous pool of organic carbon. Current limited records on forest structure, composition, successional stage and disturbances contribute to large uncertainties in estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes in this zone. Our ability to monitor ongoing changes in forest cover has improved with the influx of remotely sensed data products since 2000 from multiple satellite platforms. Here we present a method aimed at reconstructing disturbance history from a known distribution of land cover. We developed and tested the method over a biologically and topographically diverse region of the Russian Far East. This method explores capabilities introduced through fusion of the long-term but spatially limited Landsat data archive and the spatially continuous but temporally limited 2000-present data record from the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Landsat data from 1972 to 2002 were used to develop a reference disturbance dataset to train and validate a MODIS-based decision tree classification. The results showed a reliable differentiation of disturbed and mature forests with an overall accuracy of 88% (Kappa 0.73). Individual disturbances by type and decade were estimated with an overall accuracy of 70% (Kappa 0.64). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a new four-component algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data. These four components are polarimetric decomposition. PolSAR interferometry, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms. First, polarimetric decomposition can be used to support the classification of PoISAR data. It is aimed at extracting polarimetric parameters related to the physical scattering mechanisms of the observed objects. Second, PoISAR interferometry is used to extract polarimetric interferometric information to support LULC classification. Third, the main purposes of object-oriented image analysis are delineating image objects, as well as extracting various textural and spatial features from image objects to improve classification accuracy. Finally, a decision tree algorithm provides an efficient way to select features and implement classification. A comparison between the proposed method and the Wishart supervised classification which is based on the coherency matrix was made to test the performance of the proposed method. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was 86.64%, whereas that of the Wishart supervised classification was 69.66%. The kappa value of the proposed method was 0.84, much higher than that of the Wishart supervised classification, which exhibited a kappa value of 0.65. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits much better performance than the Wishart supervised classification for LULC classification. Further investigation was carried out on the respective contribution of the four components to LULC classification using RADARSAT-2 PoISAR data, and it indicates that all the four components have important contribution to the classification. Polarimetric information has significant implications for identifying different vegetation types and distinguishing between vegetation and urban/built-up. The polarimetric interferometric information extracted from repeat-pass RADARSAT-2 images is important in reducing the confusion between urban/built-up and vegetation and that between barren/sparsely vegetated land and vegetation. Object-oriented image analysis is very helpful in reducing the effect of speckle in PoISAR images by implementing classification based on image objects, and the textural information extracted from image objects is helpful in distinguishing between water and lawn. The decision tree algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy than the nearest neighbor classification implemented using Definiens Developer 7.0, and the accuracy of the decision tree algorithm is similar with that of the support vector classification which is implemented based on the features selected using genetic algorithms. Compared with the nearest neighbor and support vector classification, the decision tree algorithm is more efficient to select features and implement classification. Furthermore, the decision tree algorithm can provide clear classification rules that can be easily interpreted based on the physical meaning of the features used in the classification. This can provide physical insight for LULC classification using PoISAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal remote sensing can quantify climate change in the Arctic, where ground-based measurements continue to be rare. The land surface temperature (LST) is accessible on the pan-arctic scale through a number of remote sensing platforms, such as the "Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer" (MODIS). This study compares remotely sensed LST from MODIS to ground-based point measurements of the snow surface temperature on Svalbard for seven consecutive winters, thus covering more than half of the winter seasons in the operation period of MODIS Terra and Aqua. We find a systematic negative bias of the average winter surface temperature computed from single LST measurements between 1.5 and 6 K, with a mean bias of 3 K. The bias consistently occurs both for the MODIS L2 and for the daily and eight-day MODIS L3 products, which is explained by two reasons: i) During winter on Svalbard, cold surface temperatures are associated with clear-sky conditions, while warm surface temperatures typically occur during overcast periods. This leads to an overrepresentation of cold temperature in averages computed from remotely sensed LST measurements. ii) The MODIS cloud detection scheme fails to recognize some cloud-covered or partially cloud-covered situations, thus leading to admixing of colder cloud top temperatures. Both effects contribute equally to the total average bias accumulated over the winter season, with effect (i) dominating in some winters, while the observed bias can be fully explained by (ii) in other winters.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) acquisitions are frequently carried out in long (several kilometers) but narrow (several hundred meters) flight strips forming a block of overlapping and parallel strips. Small inaccuracies in the height measurements result from the interaction among the different parts of the ALS system and differ within each strip. Therefore, some additional strips are flown perpendicular to the main flight direction and across the first set of strips. Strip adjustment is carried out by using information from the additional flight strips. Even if low density data are acquired for the main block, due to the double coverage, the return density under the additional strips flown may be high enough for the use of individual tree crown (ITC) approaches. The study analyzed how this kind of high and low density ALS data can be combined in order to improve k-nearest neighbor (kNN) predictions. An ITC approach was followed to predict tree attributes for automatically segmented tree crowns on more than 580 artificially created sample plots under high density flight strips. No field-measured trees were available for these artificial plots. The predicted tree attributes of the artificial plots and the measured tree attributes of 154 sample plots were then aggregated to the plot level. For all sample plots, plot-level metrics were derived from low density ALS data. The metrics were used as explanatory variables in a kNN model to predict above-ground biomass. The kNN model was validated on external data.
   The combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in smaller relative root mean squared differences (RRMSD) (26.7%) compared to the use of the sample plots alone (28.5%). It can be concluded that the use of artificial plots improves the accuracy of kNN predictions. This is especially the case if the data range of sample plots for which predictions are sought is not adequately covered by the sample plots used to fit the kNN model. To illustrate this, approximately 30% of the sample plots with the largest and smallest biomass values were omitted. In this case, the combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in a RRMSD of 29.7%, whereas the use of the sample plots alone resulted in a RRMSD of 37.4%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB To meet Kyoto Protocol obligations, New Zealand is required to estimate forest carbon stock change over the first commitment period (2008-2012). New Zealand has three subcategories of forest, namely: Natural forest; Pre-1990 forest; and Post-1989 forest. The Post-1989 forest carbon inventory undertaken in 2008 used discrete return airborne LiDAR and ground-based measurements of 0.06 ha circular plots located on a 4-km x 4-km grid. The national carbon stock estimate was based on a double sampling scheme consisting of 246 plots from which both ground and LiDAR data were obtained, supplemented with 46 additional plots assessed using only LiDAR. This paper describes the relationships established between carbon stocks estimated using ground-based measurements and LiDAR metrics. A regression model explaining 74% of the variation in total carbon was developed using LiDAR 30th percentile height (P3Oht) and canopy cover (%Cover). The regression estimator improved the precision of the national carbon stock estimate in 2008 by 6% compared to the ground-based estimate. This inventory indicates that it is possible to reduce the cost of obtaining carbon stock estimates to a specified level of precision using a combination of ground-based and LiDAR measurements in a double sampling approach. The theoretical maximum improvement in precision expected in 2012, when additional LiDAR data are expected to be available, is 50-55%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Pathfinder sea surface temperature (SST) data set, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), is an important climate data record for SST due to the longevity of the sensor series of potentially 38 years (from 1981 to 2020). However high amounts of aerosol in the atmosphere, such as after a major volcanic eruption, lead to a cool bias on the sea surface temperatures retrieved from single view sensors such as the AVHRR. The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series of instruments provide a better climate-quality SST data record but are only available from 1991. The purpose of the work presented in this paper was to develop and test a method of reducing the bias in AVHRR Pathfinder SST during periods of high stratospheric volcanic aerosol. In this paper we take the ATSR record to be the reference SST for calculating the bias on the AVHRR Pathfinder SSTs during the Pinatubo eruption aerosol period (1991-1992). The analysis gives a bias of approximately -0.1 K for AVHRR Pathfinder SSTs in periods with low atmospheric aerosol and a much larger bias (globally -0.44 K in September to November 1991) in periods affected by volcanic aerosol. This paper shows the bias can largely be corrected using a multi-linear regression with aerosol optical depths from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during periods of high volcanic aerosol. The AVHRR Pathfinder minus ATSR SST bias, for grid-boxes where the correction with TOMS can be applied, is reduced from -0.53 K to -0.12 K in a three month period heavily affected by the stratospheric aerosol. This bias corrected value is close to the bias during low atmospheric aerosol loading periods. A three-way error analysis technique was used to evaluate the random retrieval uncertainty as measured by standard deviation on the SST datasets before and after bias correction. AVHRR Pathfinder SST error in the months after the Pinatubo eruption fell from 0.53 K uncorrected to 0.20 K after correction which shows the correction technique has value.

AB Airborne LiDAR is increasingly used to map carbon stocks in tropical forests, but our understanding of mapping errors is constrained by the spatial resolution (i.e., plot size) used to calibrate LiDAR with field data (typically 0.1-0.36 ha). Reported LiDAR errors range from 17 to 40 Mg C ha(-1), but should be lower at coarser resolutions because relative errors are expected to scale with (plot area)(-1/2). We tested this prediction empirically using a 50-ha plot with mapped trees, allowing an assessment of LiDAR prediction errors at multiple spatial resolutions. We found that errors scaled approximately as expected, declining by 38% (compared to 40% predicted from theory) from 0.36- to 1-ha resolution. We further reduced errors at all spatial resolutions by accounting for tree crowns that are bisected by plot edges (not typically done in forestry), and collectively show that airborne LiDAR can map carbon stocks with 10% error at 1-ha resolution a level comparable to the use of field plots alone.

TI 2 Parametric, bootstrap, and jackknife variance estimators for the
   k-Nearest Neighbors technique with illustrations using forest inventory
   and satellite image data

AB Nearest neighbors techniques have been shown to be useful for estimating forest attributes, particularly when used with forest inventory and satellite image data. Published reports of positive results have been truly international in scope. However, for these techniques to be more useful, they must be able to contribute to scientific inference which, for sample-based methods, requires estimates of uncertainty in the form of variances or standard errors. Several parametric approaches to estimating uncertainty for nearest neighbors techniques have been proposed, but they are complex and computationally intensive. For this study, two resampling estimators, the bootstrap and the jackknife, were investigated and compared to a parametric estimator for estimating uncertainty using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique with forest inventory and Landsat data from Finland, Italy, and the USA. The technical objectives of the study were threefold: (1) to evaluate the assumptions underlying a parametric approach to estimating k-NN variances: (2) to assess the utility of the bootstrap and jackknife methods with respect to the quality of variance estimates, ease of implementation, and computational intensity; and (3) to investigate adaptation of resampling methods to accommodate cluster sampling. The general conclusions were that support was provided for the assumptions underlying the parametric approach, the parametric and resampling estimators produced comparable variance estimates, care must be taken to ensure that bootstrap resampling mimics the original sampling, and the bootstrap procedure is a viable approach to variance estimation for nearest neighbor techniques that use very small numbers of neighbors to calculate predictions.

AB In recent years methods have been developed to extract the seaward landfast ice edge from series of remote sensing images, with most of them relying on incoherent change detection in optical, infrared, or radar amplitude imagery. While such approaches provide valuable results, some still lack the required level of robustness and all lack the ability to fully automate the detection and mapping of landfast ice over large areas and long time spans. This paper introduces an alternative approach to mapping landfast ice extent that is based on coherent processing of interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The approach is based on a combined interpretation of interferometric phase pattern and interferometric coherence images to extract the extent and stability of landfast ice. Due to the low complexity of the base imagery used for landfast ice extraction, significant improvements in automation and reduction of required manual interactions by operators can be achieved. A performance analysis shows that L-band interferometric SAR (InSAR) data enable the mapping of landfast ice with high robustness and accuracy for a wide range of environmental conditions.
