AB Three MERIS Case II water processors included in the BEAM software package were studied for estimating the water quality in the coastal waters of the northern Baltic Sea. The processors, named Case II Regional (C2R), boreal (BOR), and eutrophic (EUT), for the associated lake types, have been developed for different types of coastal or inland (Case II) waters. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (alpha(CDOM)(443)), and signal depth (Z(90)) products of the BEAM processors were compared with in situ data. In addition, total absorption (alpha(TOT)) and scattering of TSM (b(TSM)) from different BEAM processors were compared against the results of coastal field campaign measurements. The in situ water quality data consisted of monitoring station data gathered by the Finnish environmental administration during 2006-2009 and data from coastal field campaigns with a flow-through system. AERONET-OC (SeaPRISM) data from the Helsinki Lighthouse station were used to validate the BEAM reflectance products. The comparison with the BEAM processor results and in situ data showed that the bias of the original BEAM algorithms can be decreased through adjustment of the coefficients that relate IOPs such as the absorption of pigments and the scattering of TSM to water quality constituents such as chl-a and turbidity. The TSM products of the BEAM processors can be used to estimate the turbidity measured at monitoring stations with an r(2) of 0.76-0.84 and an RMSE of 0.7-0.85 FNUs (Formazin Nephelometric Units) on the coast of Finland. The best functionality for turbidity estimation was observed with the EUT processor, but the C2R processor also gave a sound performance. The BOR and C2R processors proved to be the best for deriving chl-a concentration. However, the accuracy of chl-a estimations was low with both processors (r(2) ranged from 0.45 to 0.47 and RMSE was between 44 and 45%). Chl-a products, particularly during the phytoplankton bloom seasons of spring and summer, require further development. The Z(90) product from the BOR processor was used to derive an algorithm for Secchi disk depth estimation with r(2) 0.48 and RMSE 0.97 m. The BOR processor was the most successful at CDOM estimation (r(2) 0.6 and RMSE 0.49 1/m), but a simple reflectance ratio was actually able to perform better (r(2) 0.75 and RMSE 0.39 1/m). In many cases, the differences between the outcomes of processors were small and related only to a part of the in situ dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing-based analyses of vegetation function such as photosynthesis and productivity are challenging in wetlands with complex cover and difficult field access. Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several "small" object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350-9000 m(2)); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (> 85-90%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29-35% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications. We conclude that OBIA with machine-learning classifiers is useful for landscape vegetation analyses, however, considerations of spatial scale and image segmentation outcomes are critical in mapping PFTs and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

AB Using reliable observed data is important for performing real-time flood forecasts or hydrological simulation in order to calibrate parameters or to update model variables. Satellite snow products can be one of these data, since snow is a water reservoir with a high impact on the quality of discharge simulation. The satellite Snow Cover Area products are known to be of good quality and are regularly used for studies in the meteorological and hydrological fields. However, these products are reprocessed and thus are not representative of the quality of a real-time product that would be needed for operational applications. The assessment of a real-time Snow Cover Area daily product at 250 m-resolution (the EURAC MODIS SCA product, which is based on the MODIS sensor) by comparing it directly or indirectly to the classical NASA MODIS SCA daily product and to the simulated Snow Cover Area of the distributed hydrological model, LISFLOOD, is realized in this article at the pan-European scale. This real-time product showed an overall good performance compared with the classical product, and a good agreement with the LISFLOOD simulated snow over Europe. The study showed the impact of forest cover on the scores of the compared products, whereas altitude did not have an impact. Using quality flags that are provided with the EURAC product improved its performance by reducing the misclassification of clouds as snow. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimates of soil moisture as initial conditions to hydrological models are expected to greatly increase the accuracy of flood and drought predictions. As in-situ soil moisture observations are scarce, satellite-based estimates are a suitable alternative. The validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products is generally hampered by the difference in spatial support of in-situ observations and satellite footprints. Unsaturated zone modeling may serve as a valuable validation tool because it could bridge the gap of different spatial supports. A stochastic, distributed unsaturated zone model (SWAP) was used in which the spatial support was matched to these of the satellite soil moisture retrievals. A comparison between point observations and the SWAP model was performed to enhance understanding of the model and to assure that the SWAP model could be used with confidence for other locations in Spain. A timeseries analysis was performed to compare surface soil moisture from the SWAP model to surface soil moisture retrievals from three different microwave sensors, including AMSR-E, SMOS and ASCAT. Results suggest that temporal dynamics are best captured by AMSR-E and ASCAT resulting in an averaged correlation coefficient of 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. SMOS shows the capability of capturing the long-term trends, however on short timescales the soil moisture signal was not captured as well as by the other sensors, resulting in an averaged correlation coefficient of 0.42. Root mean square errors for the three sensors were found to be very similar (+/- 0.05 m(3)m(-3)). The satellite uncertainty is spatially correlated and distinct spatial patterns are found over Spain.

AB Surface water inundation in the Arctic-Boreal region is dynamic and strongly influences land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2, CH4) fluxes, and potential feedbacks to climate change. Here we report on recent (2003-2010) surface inundation patterns across the Arctic-Boreal region (>= 50 degrees N) and within major permafrost (PF) zones detected using satellite passive microwave remote sensing retrievals of daily fractional open water (Fw) cover from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E). The AMSR-E Fw (25-km resolution) maps reflect strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water variability and compare favorably (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.84) with alternative, static Fw maps derived from finer scale (30-m to 250-m resolution) Landsat, MODIS and SRTM radar (MOD44W) data. The AMSR-E retrievals show dynamic seasonal and annual variability in surface inundation that is unresolved in the static Fw maps. The AMSR-E Fw record also corresponds strongly (0.71 <= R <= 0.87) with regional wet/dry cycles inferred from basin discharge records. An AMSR-E algorithm sensitivity analysis shows a conservative estimate of Fw retrieval uncertainty (RMSE) within +/- 4.1% for effective resolution of regional inundation patterns and seasonal to annual variability. A regional trend analysis of the 8-year AMSR-E record shows no significant Arctic-Boreal region wide Fw trend for the period, and instead reveals contrasting inundation changes within different PF zones. Widespread Fw wetting is detected within continuous (92% of grid cells with significant trend; p<0.1) and discontinuous (82%) PF zones, while sporadic/isolated PF areas show widespread (71%) Fw drying trends. These results are consistent with previous studies showing evidence of contrasting regional inundation patterns linked to PF degradation and associated changes to surface hydrology under recent climate warming.

AB National forest inventories report estimates of parameters related to forest area and growing stock volume for geographic areas ranging in size from municipalities to entire countries. Landsat imagery has been shown to be a source of auxiliary information that can be used with stratified estimation to increase the precision of estimates, although the increase is greater for estimates of forest area than for estimates of growing stock volume. The objective of the study was to assess the utility of lidar-based stratifications for increasing the precision of mean proportion forest area and mean growing stock volume per unit area. Stratifications based on nonlinear logistic regression model predictions of volume obtained from lidar data reduced variances of mean growing stock volume estimates by factors as great as 3.2 and variances of mean proportion forest area estimates by factors as great as 1.5.

AB Hyperspectral data covering a wavelength range of 1.2-2.5 mu m can be used to detect fires and model fire temperature and background land cover. Previous work has used hyperspectral data acquired from airborne platforms, limiting spatial resolution to finer than 20 m. The Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), a proposed hyperspectral/thermal infrared mission, will provide hyperspectral data over a spectral range of 0.35-2.5 mu m at a spatial resolution of 60 m. This study uses airborne hyperspectral data to investigate changes in modeled fire temperature and area as spatial resolution is varied from 5 m to coarser than 60 m. Four images containing active fires were acquired by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), with spatial resolutions ranging from similar to 5 to similar to 20 m. Gaussian and aggregation resampling methods were compared for one scene containing fire, and both resampling methods were found to produce similar radiance values. As spatial resolution coarsened, the area flagged as having fire by the hyperspectral fire detection index (HFDI) increased. Fire temperature modeled using a multiple endmember spectral mixing model decreased at coarser spatial resolutions, while the modeled fire fractional area increased. Coarser spatial resolution hyperspectral data, including data collected by HyspIRI, are likely to provide increased fire area and lower temperatures when compared against simultaneously acquired higher spatial resolution data. Saturation in shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands was found in all four images, and increasing SWIR saturation thresholds could lead to improvements in fire characterization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Integrating multi-angle, multi-spectral, and polarized measurements can improve the accuracy of retrieved aerosol microphysical properties, such as aerosol size distribution and complex refractive index. Using polarized measurements assisted by intensity measurements, a new algorithm to retrieve aerosol size distribution is developed. Constrained by fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) extracted from polarization and anisotropy of reflectances for atmospheric science coupled with observations from a LIDAR (PARASOL) intensity measurements, aerosol size distribution is retrieved from multi-angle polarized measurements of PARASOL. The retrieved results of our algorithm are compared with ground-based measurements from Beijing, Xianghe, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) sites in the PHOtometrie pour le Traitement Operational de Normalisation Satellitaire (PHOTONS) network included in the worldwide Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and the correlation coefficient of AOD is greater than 0.7, whereas the modal radii is greater than AERONET/PHOTONS. The discussions of complex refractive index, fixed surface reflectance in the blue, fixed parameters for the coarse-mode size distribution, and restricted range for fine/coarse fraction show the potential for algorithm improvement in the future.

AB Indonesia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, with a significant impact on the planetary carbon balance and loss of biodiversity. It also covers a vast and often inaccessible area frequently obscured by clouds, making accurate, timely monitoring of its forests difficult. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are unhindered by clouds and can provide clear images whenever there is a satellite pass, hence provide a potentially important tool for monitoring forest changes. Over Sumatra, the JAM Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR L-band radar provided both ScanSAR HH polarisation with repeat images every 46 days, thus providing much more frequent clear imagery than other available rapid deforestation monitoring tools, and approximately annual Fine-Beam Dual (FBD) image pairs with HH and HV polarisations. Temporal analysis of ScanSAR images shows that deforestation in the Sumatran province of Riau can be identified by large values of the temporal standard deviation, but high detection rates are associated with high false alarm rates, particularly in swamp forest. There does not appear to be a reliable signature of the onset of forest disturbance in the ScanSAR time-series. Deforestation can also be detected in annual FBD data by combining increases and decreases in both the HH and HV channels, since the four types of change are complementary; these different polarisation responses indicate a variety of physical processes that may be involved in the radar signature of deforestation. Significant improvements in performance are possible by combining FBD and ScanSAR data, giving 72% detection of deforestation for a false alarm rate (detection of deforestation in undisturbed forest) of 20%. Error analysis based on (a) likely errors in the Landsat data used to provide a reference for deforestation and (b) differences between the times of acquisition of the Landsat data and the FBD data suggest that the true detection rate for the FBD data is underestimated. All the analysis in the paper uses fully automatic methods, but it is likely that false alarms in the ScanSAR data due to periodic flooding could be reduced by human inspection. The performance figures reported here could also be improved if knowledge about the locations of dry and swamp forest was included in the methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment of uncertainties and biases affecting remote sensing products is a pre-condition for an effective exploitation of these data in climate studies. Within such a context, this work presents and discusses the intra-annual variations of biases in primary satellite ocean color products (i.e.. normalized water-leaving radiance and aerosol optical thickness) at a coastal site in the northern Adriatic Sea for the period 2002-2010. The analysis is performed using in situ data from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) and satellite data products from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-A and MODIS-T) onboard the Aqua and Terra platforms. Results indicate biases in the normalized water leaving radiance significantly increasing with the sun zenith angle and, to a lesser extent, also affected by variations in chlorophyll concentration and aerosol optical thickness.

AB Sound forest policy and management decisions to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 depend upon accurate methodologies to quantify forest carbon pools and fluxes over large tracts of land. LiDAR remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology for quantifying aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools: however, little work has evaluated the efficacy of repeat LiDAR measures for spatially monitoring aboveground carbon pools through time. Our study objective was therefore to evaluate the use of discrete return airborne LiDAR for quantifying biomass change and carbon flux from repeat field and LiDAR surveys. We collected LiDAR data in 2003 and 2009 across similar to 20,000 ha of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to impute aboveground biomass pools of trees, saplings, shrubs, herbaceous plants, coarse and fine woody debris, litter, and duff using field-based forest inventory data and metrics derived from the LiDAR collections. Separate predictive tree aboveground biomass models were developed from the 2003 and 2009 field and LiDAR data, and biomass change was estimated at the plot, pixel, and landscape levels by subtracting 2003 predictions from 2009 predictions. Traditional stand exam data were used to independently validate 2003 and 2009 tree aboveground biomass predictions and tree aboveground biomass change estimates at the stand level. Over this 6-year period, we found a mean increase in tree aboveground biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of 4.1 Mg/ha/yr. We found that 26.3% of the landscape had been harvested during this time period which outweighed growth at the landscape level, resulting in a net tree aboveground biomass change of -5.7 Mg/ha/yr. and -2.3 Mg/ha/yr in total aboveground carbon, summed across all the aboveground biomass pools. Change in aboveground biomass was related to forest successional status: younger stands gained two- to three-fold less biomass than did more mature stands. This result suggests that even the most mature forest stands are valuable carbon sinks, and implies that forest management decisions that include longer harvest rotation cycles are likely to favor higher levels of aboveground carbon storage in this system. A 30-fold difference in LiDAR sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 collections did not affect plot-scale biomass estimation. These results suggest that repeat LiDAR surveys are useful for accurately quantifying high resolution, spatially explicit biomass and carbon dynamics in conifer forests. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The sudden drainage of supraglacial lakes has been previously observed to initiate surface-to-bed hydrologic connections, which are capable of enhancing basal sliding, in regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet where ice thickness approaches 1 km. In this study, we develop a robust algorithm, which automatically detects and tracks individual supraglacial lakes using visible satellite imagery, to document the evolution of a population of West Greenland supraglacial lakes over ten consecutive melt seasons. Validation tests indicate that the algorithm is highly accurate: 99.0% of supraglacial lakes can be detected and tracked and 96.3% of reported lakes are true supraglacial lakes with accurate lake properties, such as lake area, and timing of formation and drainage. Investigation of the interannual evolution of supraglacial lakes in the context of annual melt intensity reveals that during more intense melt years, supraglacial lakes drain more frequently and earlier in the melt season. Additionally, the lake population extends to higher elevations during more intense melt years, exposing an increased inland area of the ice sheet to sudden lake drainage events. These observations suggest that increased surface meltwater production due to climate change will enhance the spatial extent and temporal frequency of lake drainage events. It is unclear whether this will ultimately increase or decrease the basal sliding sensitivity of interior regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing products such as Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Infra Red (IR) dust index and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Aerosol Index (AI) are commonly used to infer dust source areas. Here, two methods for dust source identification are compared, (1) a "back-tracking" method applied to 15-minute MSG IR dust index, and (2) a "frequency" method applied to daily OMI AI and daily MODIS DeepBlue Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) data.
   Using the "back-tracking" method, dust source areas are inferred by tracking individual dust plumes back to their place of origin, allowed by the high temporal resolution of the MSG images. OMI AI and MODIS Deep Blue AOT products are available on daily resolution only, which does not allow for back-tracking of individual dust plumes. Thus, dust source areas are identified by relating the frequencies of occurrence of high dust loadings to source areas.
   The spatial distribution of inferred dust source areas not only from the two methods, but also from the two satellite products, shows significant differences. The MSG back-tracking method highlights frequent dust emission from sources within complex terrain, while frequencies of high OMI AI values emphasise topographic basins as important dust source areas. Dust source areas retrieved from DeepBlue AOTs are generally further south towards the Sahel region. This study shows that the temporal resolution of satellite dust products is a key issue in identifying dust source areas. Both, the spatial distribution of dust sources and their annual cycle strongly depend on the acquisition time related to the start of dust emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present here results that strongly support the use of MERIS-based NIR-red algorithms as standard tools for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in turbid productive waters. The study was carried out as one of the steps in testing the potential of the universal applicability of previously developed NIR-red algorithms, which were earlier calibrated using a limited set of MERIS imagery and in situ data from the Azov Sea and the Taganrog Bay, Russia, and data that were synthetically generated using a radiative transfer model. We used an extensive set of MERIS imagery and in situ data collected over a period of three years in the Azov Sea and the Taganrog Bay for this validation task. We found that the two-band and three-band NIR-red algorithms gave consistently highly accurate estimates of chl-a concentration, with a mean absolute error of 4.32 mg m(-3) and 4.71 mg m(-3), respectively, and a root mean square error as low as 5.92 mg m(-3), for data with chl-a concentrations ranging from 1.09 mg m(-3) to 107.82 mg m(-3). This obviates the need for case-specific reparameterization of the algorithms, as long as the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the water does not change drastically, and presents a strong case for the use of NIR-red algorithms as standard algorithms that can be routinely applied for near-real-time quantitative monitoring of chl-a concentration in the Azov Sea and the Taganrog Bay, and potentially elsewhere, which will be a real boon to ecologists, natural resource managers and environmental decision-makers.

AB Basal area (BA) is a basic structural and ecological attribute of forests that is often used to describe forest composition, estimate volume of wood, and guide management decisions. BA is the sum of cross-sectional area of trees measured at 1.37 m above ground surface, per unit area, and is most commonly measured in-situ. The objective of this study was to supply estimates of BA for oak woodlands and savannas on the 12,828.5 ha Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge in Central Minnesota to guide management efforts. We used winter and summer Landsat imagery, combined with field measurements, to assess the potential for improving forest BA estimates by taking advantage of the high spectral contrast between sunlit snow, forest canopy elements, and shadows projected onto snow ground cover. We explained up to 90% of measured variation in BA using partial least squares regression models calibrated using single- and multiple-date winter Landsat data (R-2 = 0.898, RMSE = 2.79 m(2)ha(-1)), which performed better than models calibrated using summer imagery (R-2 = 0.762, RMSE = 3.85 m(2)ha(-1)). Success of the winter-based BA models may be driven, in part, by potential geometric/allometric relationships between cast shadow and forest BA, but definitive proof of this is a topic for future research. This method of BA estimation is not refuge-specific and may be extended for regional use to manage oak forest wherever winter snow coverage is consistent. Additional research is needed to determine the degree of robustness to variations in the empirical relationship between BA and tree shading patterns across different forest functional types.

AB The subalpine zone is the transition between forest and alpine vegetation communities. In Norway, as in many other nations, low productivity or non-merchantable forests, like the subalpine zone, are not routinely subject to inventory programs. Awareness of expected changes in the sub-alpine zone as a result of a warmer climate, and the interest in full carbon accounting at the national level, has dictated a need for data capture in these mountainous areas. We propose an approach for integrating strip samples of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with Landsat imagery to delineate the subalpine zone. In the current study the subalpine zone was defined according to international definitions based on tree heights and canopy cover. The three-dimensional measurements of forest structure obtained from LiDAR enable a delineation of the subalpine zone. The approach was implemented using 53 LiDAR sample strips in Hedmark County, Norway, and validated with field measurements at 26 locations. The subalpine zone boundaries were found to be within one Landsat pixel, on average, when validated using an image gradient technique. Furthermore, binomial logistic regression was used to upscale the LiDAR classes to the entire county (27400 km(2)) using satellite images and information derived from a digital terrain model. The result from the binomial logistic regression was a probability map suitable for monitoring changes in the extent and location of the subalpine zone. The probability surface was separated into hard classes by calibrated alpha-cuts derived using density estimation to support the information needs of inventory stratification and area estimation.

AB Remote sensing techniques are used to study the large scale patterns related to the seasonal modes of variability of the marine phytoplankton. Ten years of monthly composite maps of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration and the PHYSAT database of four Phytoplanktonic Functional Types (PFTs), both from SeaWiFS, are used to investigate characteristics of phytoplankton seasonality in the trades and westerlies wind oceanic biomes, where data density is adequate. We use a combination of wavelet transform and statistical techniques that allow us to quantify both intensity and duration of the seasonal oscillation of chlorophyll-a concentration and PFTs relative occurrence, and to map these relationships. Next, the seasonal oscillations detected are related to four PFTs revealing six major global phytoplanktonic associations. Our results elucidate the intensity and duration of the seasonal dynamic of the chlorophyll-a concentration and of the relative occurrence of four PFTs at a global scale. Thus, the typology of the different types of seasonality is investigated. Finally, an overall agreement between the results and the biogeochemical provinces partition proposed by Longhurst is found, revealing a strong environmental control on the seasonal oscillation of primary producers and a clear latitudinal organization in the succession of the phytoplankton types. Results provided in this study quantify the seasonal oscillation of key structural parameters of the global ocean, and their potential implications for our understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

AB Because atmospheric aerosols scatter sunlight back to space, reflectance measurements from spaceborne radiometers can be used to estimate the aerosol load and its optical properties. Several aerosol products have been generated in a systematic way, and are available for further studies. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of such aerosol products derived from the measurements of POLDER, MODIS, MERIS, SEVIRI and CALIOP, through a statistical comparison with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET sunphotometer network Although this method is commonly used, this study is, to our knowledge, among the most extensive of its type since it compares the performance of the products from 5 different sensors using up to five years of data for each of them at global scale. The choice of these satellite aerosol datasets was based on their availability at the ICARE Data and Service Centre (www.icare.univ-lille1.fr).
   We distinguish between retrievals over land and ocean and between estimates of total and fine mode AOD. Over the oceans, POLDER and MODIS retrievals are of similar quality, with RMS difference lower than 0.1 and a correlation with AERONET of around 0.9. The POLDER estimates suffer from a small positive bias for clean atmospheres, which weakens its statistics. The other aerosol products are of lesser quality, although the SEVIRI products may be of interest for some applications that require a high temporal resolution. The MERIS product shows a very high bias. Over land, only the MODES product offers a reliable estimate of the total ADD. On the other hand, the polarization-based retrieval using POLDER data allows a better fine mode estimate than that from MODIS. These results suggest the need for a product combining POLDER and MODES products over land.
   The paper also analyses how the statistics change with the spatial and temporal thresholds that are used. Spatio-temporal averaging improves the statistics only slightly, which indicates that random errors are not dominant in the error budget. The paper includes various statistical indicators at global scale, and detailed results at individual ground stations can be obtained on request from the authors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of lidar remote sensing for mapping the spatial distribution of canopy characteristics has the potential to allow an accurate and efficient estimation of tree dimensions and canopy structural properties from local to regional and continental scales. The overall goal of this paper was to compare biomass estimates and height metrics obtained by processing GLAS waveform data and spatially coincident discrete-return airborne lidar data over forest conditions in east Texas. Since biomass estimates are derived from waveform height metrics, we also compared ground elevation measurements and canopy parameters. More specific objectives were to compare the following parameters derived from GLAS and airborne lidar: (1) ground elevations; (2) maximum canopy height; (3) average canopy height; (4) percentiles of canopy height; and (5) above ground biomass. We used the elliptical shape of GLAS footprints to extract canopy height metrics and biomass estimates derived from airborne lidar. Results indicated a very strong correlation for terrain elevations between GLAS and airborne lidar, with an r value of 0.98 and a root mean square error of 0.78 m. GLAS height variables were able to explain 80% of the variance associated with the reference biomass derived from airborne lidar, with an RMSE of 37.7 Mg/ha. Most of the models comparing GLAS and airborne lidar height metrics had R-square values above 0.9. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how semi-analytical inversion techniques developed for the remote sensing of water quality parameters (chlorophyll a, tripton and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) in inland waters could be adapted or improved for application to Australian tropical and subtropical water bodies. The Matrix Inversion Method (MIM) with a semi-analytic model of the anisotropy of the in-water light field was applied to MERIS images of Burdekin Falls Dam, Australia, a tropical freshwater impoundment. Specific attention was required to improve the atmospheric correction of the MERIS data. The performance of the conventional three band exact solution of the MIM was compared to that of over-determined solutions that used constant and differential weighting for each sensor band.
   The results of the application of the MIM algorithm showed that the best weighting scheme had a mean chlorophyll a retrieval difference of 1.0 mu gl(-1), the three band direct matrix inversion scheme had a mean difference of 4.2 mu gl(-1) and the constant weight scheme had a mean difference of 5.5 mu gl(-1). For tripton, the best performed weighting scheme had a mean difference of 12 mgl(-1), the three band scheme had a mean difference of 3.4 mgl(-1) and the constant weight scheme had a mean difference of 1.8 mgl(-1). For the CDOM retrieval, the mean difference was found to be 0.12 m(-1) for the best performed weighting scheme, 025 m(-1) for the three band scheme and 0.52 m(-1) for the constant weight scheme. It was found that significant improvements in the accuracy and precision of retrieved water quality parameter values can be obtained by using differentially weighted, over-determined systems of equations, rather than exact solutions. These more reliable estimates of water quality parameters will allow water resource managers to improve their monitoring regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophylls absorb photosynthetically active radiation and thus function as vital pigments for photosynthesis, which makes leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) useful for monitoring vegetation productivity and an important indicator of the overall plant physiological condition. This study investigates the utility of integrating remotely sensed estimates of C-ab into a thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model that estimates land-surface CO2 and energy fluxes using an analytical, light-use-efficiency (LUE) approach to estimating bulk canopy resistance. The LUE model component computes canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, internally estimating fluctuations in effective LUE from a nominal (species-dependent) value (LUEn) in response to short-term variations in environmental conditions. LUEn, however, may vary on a daily timescale, responding to changes in plant phenology, physiological condition and nutrient status. Therefore, remote sensing methodologies for improving daily estimates of LUEn have been investigated. Day-to-day variations in LUEn were assessed for a heterogeneous corn crop field in Maryland, U.S.A. through model optimization with eddy covariance CO2 flux tower observations. The optimized daily LUEn values were then compared to gridded estimates of C-ab over the tower flux footprint, retrieved from a canopy reflectance model driven by green, red and near-infrared imagery acquired with an aircraft imaging system. The tower-calibrated LUEn data were generally well correlated with airborne retrievals of C-ab, and hourly water, energy and carbon flux estimation accuracies from TSEB were significantly improved when using C-ab for delineating spatio-temporal variations in LUEn. The study highlights the potential synergy between thermal infrared and shortwave reflective wavebands in producing valuable remote sensing data for estimating carbon, water and heat fluxes within a two-source energy balance framework.

AB The terrestrial carbon cycle is strongly affected by natural phenomena, terrain heterogeneity, and human-induced activities that alter carbon exchange via vegetation and soil activities. In order to accurately understand terrestrial carbon cycle mechanisms, it is necessary to estimate spatial and temporal variations in carbon flux and storage using process-based models with the highest possible resolution. We estimated terrestrial carbon fluxes using a biosphere model integrating eco-physiological and mechanistic approaches based on satellite data (BEAMS) and observations with 1-km grid resolution. The study area is the central Far East Asia region, which lies between 30 degrees and 50 degrees north latitude and 125 and 150 east longitude. Aiming to simulate terrestrial carbon exchanges under realistic land surface conditions, we used as many satellite-observation datasets as possible, such as the standard MODIS, TRMM, and SRTM high-level land products. Validated using gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), net radiation and latent heat with ground measurements at six flux sites, the model estimations showed reasonable seasonal and annual patterns. In extensive analysis, the total GPP and NPP were determined to be 2.1 and 0.9 PgC/year, respectively. The total NEP estimation was + 5.6 TgC/year, meaning that the land area played a role as a carbon sink from 2001 to 2006. In analyses of areas with complicated topography, the 1-km grid estimation could prove to be effective in evaluating the effect of landscape on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The method presented here is an appropriate approach for gaining a better understanding of terrestrial carbon exchange, both spatially and temporally. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Effective land cover mapping often requires the use of multiple data sources and data interpretation methods. particularly when no one data source or interpretation method provides sufficiently good results. Method-oriented approaches are often only effective for specific land cover class/data source combinations, and cannot be applied when different classification systems or data sources are required or available. Here we present a method, based on Endorsement Theory, of pooling evidence from multiple expert systems and spatial datasets to produce land cover maps. Individual 'experts' are trained to produce evidence for or against a class, with this evidence being categorised according to strength. An evidence integration rule set is applied to evidence lists to produce conclusions of different strength regarding individual classes, and the most likely class identified. The only expert system design implemented currently within the methodology is a neural network model, although the system has been designed to accept information from decision trees, fuzzy k-means and Bayesian statistics as well. We have used the technique to produce land cover maps of Scotland using three classification systems of varying complexity. Mapping accuracy varied between 52.6% for a map with 96 classes to 88.8% for a map with eight classes. The accuracy of the maps generated is higher than when individual datasets are used, showing that the evidence integration method applied is suitable for improving land cover mapping accuracy. We showed that imagery was not necessarily the most important data source for mapping where a large number of classes are used, and also showed that even data sources that produce low accuracy scores when used for mapping by themselves do improve the accuracy of maps produced using this integrative approach. Future work in developing the method is identified, including the inclusion of additional expert systems and improvement of the evidence integration, and evaluation carried out of the overall effectiveness of the approach.

AB The aim of the present study is to define the most suitable methodologies for ASTER data pre-processing and analysis in order to enhance peraluminous granitoid rocks in rugged and vegetated areas.
   The research started with raw image data pre-processing and continued with a comparison of satellite. field and laboratory data. The masking technique adopted to isolate rocky pixels was of fundamental importance to perform further analysis. An integration of density-sliced images and false colour composite images of Band Ratio, Relative Absorption Band Depth and Principal Component Analysis allowed us to generate a geological map that highlights a new granitoid body (Buraburi Granite) and the surrounding host rocks in the Dolpo region (western Nepal). The Buraburi Granite was mapped and sampled integrating remotely sensed ASTER data with analysis of rocks and minerals spectral signatures.
   The innovative approach that we have adopted considers the absorption features of particular lichen species (acidophilic). The results highlight the importance of considering acidophilic lichen means of detecting granitoid rocks. Furthermore, since peraluminous granitoids (i.e. Buraburi granite) have a considerable Al2O3 bulk rock content, the Muscovite Al-OH absorption peaks centred in the 6th ASTER band were also considered an important parameter for their detection.
   Field observations confirm the results of remote sensing analysis showing the intrusive relationship between the newly discovered 110 km(2) granitoid body and the wall rocks of the Higher Himalayan Crystalline and the Tibetan Sedimentary Sequence.
   In conclusion, the proposed methods have great potential for granitoid mapping in vegetated and rough terrains, particularly those with climatic and geological conditions similar to the ones of the Southern Himalayan belt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface and climate modelling requires continuous and consistent Leaf Area Index (LAI). High spatiotemporal resolution and long-time record data are more in demand nowadays and will continue to be in the future. MODIS LAI products meet these requirements to some degree. However, due to the presence of cloud and seasonal snow cover, the instrument problems and the uncertainties of retrieval algorithm, the current MODIS LAI products are spatially and temporally discontinuous and inconsistent, which limits their application in land surface and climate modelling. To improve the MODIS LAI products on a global scale, we considered the characteristics of the MODIS LAI data and made the best use of quality control (QC) information, and developed an integrated two-step method to derive the improved MODIS LAI products effectively and efficiently on a global scale. First, we used the modified temporal spatial filter (mTSF) method taking advantage of background values and QC information at each pixel to do a simple data assimilation for relatively low quality data. Then we applied the post processing-TIMESAT (A software package to analyze time-series of satellite sensor data) Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to get the final result We implemented the method to 10 years of the MODIS Collection 5 LAI data. In comparison with the LAI reference maps and the MODIS LAI data, our results showed that the improved MODIS LAI data are closer to the LAI reference maps in magnitude and also more continuous and consistent in both time-series and spatial domains. In addition, simple statistics were used to evaluate the differences between the MODIS LAI and the improved MODIS LAI. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Choushui River Alluvial Fan (CRAF), one of the most important agricultural areas in Taiwan, suffers severe subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal. We use 20 ENVISAT images from 2006 to 2008 to derive vertical deformation over CRAF by persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), which effectively reduces errors affecting conventional DInSAR techniques. The pixel density over CRAF is 107.6 pixels/km(2), compared to 0.19 points/km(2) of the leveling benchmarks. PSI yields vertical displacements matching the leveling result to 0.6 cm/year (RMS), and provides a higher spatial resolution of subsidence than the latter. We also develop a data fusion method that considers the high-precision, low point-density leveling result as a smoothed correction to the PSI result. The combined field is more representative of overall deformation characteristics than the PSI-only or leveling-only field, and it is better suited for the assessment of the impact of subsidence over CRAF.

AB Neural networks trained over radiative transfer simulations constitute the basis of several operational algorithms to estimate canopy biophysical variables from satellite reflectance measurements. However, only little attention was paid to the training process which has a major impact on retrieval performances. This study focused on the several modalities of the training process within neural network estimation of LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR biophysical variables. Performances were evaluated over both actual experimental observations and model simulations. The SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models were used here to simulate the training and the synthetic test datasets. Measurements of LAI. FCOVER and FAPAR were achieved over the Barrax (Spain) agricultural site for a range of crop types concurrently to CHRIS/PROBA satellite image acquisition. Results showed that the spectral band selection was specific to LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR variables. The optimal band set provided significantly improved performances for LAI, while only small differences were observed for the other variables. Gaussian distributions of the radiative transfer model input variables performed better than uniform distributions for which no prior information was exploited. Including moderate uncertainties in the reflectance simulations used in the training process improved the flexibility of the neural network in cases where simulations departed slightly from observations. Simple neural network architecture with a single hidden layer of five tangent sigmoid transfer functions was performing as good as more complex architectures if the training dataset was larger than ten times the number of coefficients to tune. Small sensitivity of performances was observed depending on the way the solution was selected when several networks were trained in parallel. Finally, comparison with a NDVI based approach showed the generally better retrieval accuracy of neural networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (USA). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Luldsat archive. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming is the focus of several studies where the soil temperature plays an essential role as a state variable for the surface energy balance of the Earth. Many methods have been developed to determine summer surface temperature, but the determination in presence of snow is an ill-conditioned problem for microwave techniques because snow changes the emissivity of the surface. This project aims to improve the estimation of soil temperature, within the top 5 cm of the ground, under the snowpack using passive microwave remote sensing. Results show the potential of the passive microwave brightness temperature inversion at 10 GHz (derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System, AMSR-E) for the estimation of soil temperature using a physical multilayer snow-soil model (SNTHERM) coupled with a snow emission model (HUT). The snow model is driven with meteorological measurements from ground-based stations as well as data generated from reanalysis. The proposed iterative retrieval method minimizes the difference between the simulated and measured brightness temperature using the soil temperature as a free parameter given by SNTHERM. Results are validated against ground-based measurements at several sites across Canada through several winter seasons. The overall root mean square error and bias in the retrieved soil temperature is respectively 3.29 K and 0.56 K, lower than the error derived from the snow-soil model without the use of remote sensing. The accuracy in detection of frozen/unfrozen soil under the snowpack is 78%, which is improved up to 81% if the spring melting period is not considered. This original procedure constitutes a very promising tool to characterize the soil (frozen or not) under snow cover, as well as its evolution in northern remote locations where measurements are unavailable.

AB For many years, the classification of forest communities and their associated species from airborne data (primarily aerial photography) has largely been through manual interpretation. With the development of digital imagery, options for delineating individual crowns and identifying these to species have become available but automated techniques for grouping these into meaningful community descriptions still requires development. This paper proposes a method that links individual tree crowns (classified to species) using graph data structures and minimum spanning trees. The method was applied to tree crowns delineated and mapped to species using hyperspectral CASI data acquired over Injune, central Queensland, Australia. The resulting clusters were attributed with tree level statistics relating to crown area and diversity and were shown to produce mapping comparable to that of manual interpretation of stereo aerial photography. The study concludes that provided reliable tree level mapping of species can be achieved, automated classification of forest communities can be undertaken. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Due to technical and budget limitations, remote sensing instruments trade spatial resolution and swath width. As a result not one sensor provides both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. However, the ability to monitor seasonal landscape changes at fine resolution is urgently needed for global change science. One approach is to "blend" the radiometry from daily, global data (e.g. MODIS, MERIS, SPOT-Vegetation) with data from high-resolution sensors with less frequent coverage (e.g. Landsat, CBERS, ResourceSat). Unfortunately, existing algorithms for blending multi-source data have some shortcomings, particularly in accurately predicting the surface reflectance of heterogeneous landscapes. This study has developed an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) based on the existing STARFM algorithm, and has tested it with both simulated and actual satellite data. Results show that ESTARFM improves the accuracy of predicted fine-resolution reflectance, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and preserves spatial details. Taking the NIR band as an example, for homogeneous regions the prediction of the ESTARFM is slightly better than the STARFM (average absolute difference [AAD] 0.0106 vs. 0.0129 reflectance units). But for a complex, heterogeneous landscape, the prediction accuracy of ESTARFM is improved even more compared with STARFM (AAD 0.0135 vs. 0.0194). This improved fusion algorithm will support new investigations into how global landscapes are changing across both seasonal and interannual timescales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture controls the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration and, consequently, the runoff generation. On the catchment scale its routine monitoring can be performed through remote sensing technologies. Within this framework, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), radiometer on board the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellites and operating since 1998, for the assessment of soil wetness conditions by comparing soil moisture data with both those measured in situ and provided by a continuous rainfall-runoff model applied to four catchments located in the Upper Tiber River (Central Italy). In particular, in order to perform a robust analysis an extensive and long-term period (nine years) of data was investigated. In detail, the Soil Wetness Variation Index, derived from the AMSU data modified in order to take account of the difference between the soil layer investigated by the satellite sensor and that used as a benchmark, was found to be correlated both with the in-situ and modeled soil moisture variations showing correlation coefficients in the range of 0.42-0.49 and 0.33-0.48, respectively. As far as the soil moisture temporal pattern is concerned, higher correlations were obtained (0.59-0.84 for the in-situ data and 0.82-0.87 for the modeled data set) partly due to the soil moisture seasonal pattem that enhances the correlation. Overall, the root mean square error was found to be less than 0.05 m(3)/m(3) for both the comparisons, thus assessing the potential of the AMSU sensor to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture temporal patterns. Moreover. the AMSU sensor can be considered as a useful tool to provide a reliable and frequently updated global soil moisture data set, considering its higher temporal resolution now available (about 4 passes per day) thanks to the presence of the sensor aboard different satellites.

AB Fire is an important natural disturbance process in many ecosystems, but humans can irrevocably change natural fire regimes. Quantifying long-term change in fire regimes is important to understand the driving forces of changes in fire dynamics, and the implications of fire regime changes for ecosystem ecology. However, assessing fire regime changes is challenging, especially in grasslands because of high intra- and inter-annual variation of the vegetation and temporally sparse satellite data in many regions of the world. The breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused substantial socioeconomic changes and a decrease in grazing pressure in Russia's arid grasslands, but how this affected grassland fires is unknown. Our research goal was to assess annual burned area in the grasslands of southern Russia before and after the breakdown. Our study area covers 19,000 km(2) in the Republic of Kalmykia in southern Russia in the arid grasslands of the Caspian plains. We estimated annual burned area from 1985 to 2007 by classifying AVHRR data using decision tree algorithm, and validated the results with RESURS, Landsat and MODIS data. Our results showed a substantial increase in burned area, from almost none in the 1980s to more than 20% of the total study area burned in both 2006 and 2007. Burned area started to increase around 1998 and has continued to increase. albeit with high fluctuations among years. We suggest that it took several years after livestock numbers decreased in the beginning of the 1990s for vegetation to recover, to build up enough fuel, and to reach a threshold of connectivity that could sustain large fires. Our burned area detection algorithm was effective, and captured burned areas even with incomplete annual AVHRR data. Validation results showed 68% producer's and 56% user's accuracy. Lack of frequent AVHRR data is a common problem and our burned area detection approach may also be suitable in other parts of the world with comparable ecosystems and similar AVHRR data limitations. In our case, AVHRR data were the only satellite imagery available far enough back in time to reveal marked increases in fire regimes in southern Russia before and after the breakdown of the Soviet Union.

AB Although cities, towns and settlements cover only a tiny fraction (<1%) of the world's surface, urban areas are the nexus of human activity with more than 50% of the population and 70-90% of economic activity. As such, material and energy consumption, air pollution, and expanding impervious surface are all concentrated in urban areas, with important environmental implications at local, regional and potentially global scales. New ways to measure and monitor the built environment over large areas are thus critical to answering a wide range of environmental research questions related to the role of urbanization in climate, biogeochemistry and hydrological cycles. This paper presents a new dataset depicting global urban land at 500-m spatial resolution based on MODIS data (available at http://sage.wisc.edu/urbanenvironment.html). The methodological approach exploits temporal and spectral information in one year of MODIS observations, classified using a global training database and an ensemble decision-tree classification algorithm. To overcome confusion between urban and built-up lands and other land cover types, a stratification based on climate, vegetation, and urban topology was developed that allowed region-specific processing. Using reference data from a sample of 140 cities stratified by region, population size, and level of economic development, results show a mean overall accuracy of 93% (k = 0.65) at the pixel level and a high level of agreement at the city scale (R-2 = 0.90).

AB The forest canopy is the medium for energy, mass, and momentum exchanges between the forest ecosystem and the atmosphere. Tree crown size is a critical aspect of canopy structure that significantly influences these biophysical processes in the canopy. Tree crown size is also strongly related to other canopy structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height and biomass. But information about tree crown sizes is difficult to obtain and rarely available from traditional forest inventory. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that a model previously developed for estimation of tree crown size can be generalized across sensors and sites. Our study sites include the Racoon Ecological Management Area in southeast Ohio, USA and the Duke Forest in North Carolina Piedmont, USA. We sampled a series of circular plots in the summers of 2005 and 2007. We derived average tree crown diameter (CD) for trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 6.4 cm (2.5 in) for each sampling plot. We developed statistical models using image spatial information from Ikonos and QuickBird images as the independent variable and CD for stands in Ohio as the dependent variable. The models provide an explanation of tree crown size for the hardwood stands comparable to other approaches (R-2 = similar to 0.5 and RMSE = 0.83 m). Moreover, the models that estimate tree crown size using the ratio of image variances at two spatial resolutions can be applied across sensors and sites, i.e. the statistical models developed with Ikonos images can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with QuickBird image, and the statistical models developed in Ohio can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with images in North Carolina. These results indicate that the model developed based on image variance ratio at two spatial resolutions can be used to take advantage of existing sampling plot data and images to estimate CD with more recent images, enhancing the efficiency of forest resources inventory and monitoring.

AB Due to increased fuel loading as a result of fire suppression, land managers in the American west are in need of precise information about the fuels they manage, including canopy fuels. Canopy fuel metrics such as canopy height (CH), canopy base height (CBH), canopy bulk density (CBD) and available canopy fuel (ACF) are specific inputs for wildfire behavior models such as FARSITE and emission models such as FOFEM. With finer spatial resolution data, accurate quantification of these metrics with detailed spatial heterogeneity can be accomplished. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and color near-infrared imagery are active and passive systems, respectively, that have been utilized for measuring a range of forest structure characteristics at high resolution. The objective of this research was to determine which remote sensing dataset can estimate canopy fuels more accurately and whether a fusion of these datasets produces more accurate estimates. Regression models were developed for ponderosa pine (Pines ponderosa) stand representative of eastern Washington State using field data collected in the Ahtanum State Forest and metrics derived from LiDAR and imagery. Strong relationships were found with LiDAR alone and LiDAR was found to increase canopy fuel accuracy compared to imagery. Fusing LiDAR with imagery and/or LiDAR intensity led to small increases in estimation accuracy over LiDAR alone. By improving the ability to estimate canopy fuels at higher spatial resolutions, spatially explicit fuel layers can be created and used in wildfire behavior and smoke emission models leading to more accurate estimations of crown fire risk and smoke related emissions.

AB Methane (CH4) is an extremely important greenhouse gas that has increased significantly in pre and post-industrial times. Due to CH4's strong absorptions in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), the potential exists to use imaging spectrometers, such as the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), to map CH4 emissions. Here, we present research evaluating the ability of AVIRIS to map CH4 emitted by one of the largest marine geologic CH4 sources in the world, the Coal Oil Point seep field in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. To develop algorithms for detecting CH4 and to establish detection limits, initial analysis focused on simulated radiance spectra. calculated using Modtran 5.2 radiative transfer code that was parameterized to match scene conditions for a 6 August 2007 AVIRIS flight over the area. Model simulations included a range of surface albedos, variable column water vapor, and CH4 concentrations ranging from 1.7 ppm (background) up to the equivalent of 2500 ppm in the lower 20 m of the boundary layer. A multistep CH4 detection algorithm was developed using Modtran simulations. First, surface albedo was estimated from the radiance at 2139 nm. Next, albedo-specific radiance for background CH4 was used to calculate spectral residuals for CH4 above background. A CH4 index, C, calculated as the average residual between 2248 and 2298 nm, showed high sensitivity to CH4, with minimal sensitivity to water vapor or surface albedo. Detection limits in simulations depended on CH4 concentrations and albedo, ranging from 990 pprn for a 0.5% albedo surface, to as low as 18 pprn for albedos higher than 22%. Application of this approach to the AVIRIS data demonstrated considerable potential for mapping CH4. Due to specular reflectance off of the ocean surface, albedo in the scene varied significantly, from less than 0.5% to over 30%. Strong CH4 anomalies were observed in the data acquired over the seep field, which produced large C values with spectral residuals consistent with CH4 and estimated radiance spectra that matched measurements. All strong anomalies were located in close vicinity to and downwind from known CH4 sources. However, contrary to simulated data, C was overly sensitive to albedo, restricting high confidence anomalies only to the brightest surfaces, and showing high frequency spatial variation throughout the AVIRIS image. CH4 concentration was overestimated by C, potentially due to a spectral trend in sea surface reflectance and/or the impact of diffuse light on dark surfaces (<1%) leading to the over-expression of CH4 absorptions.

AB A retrieval algorithm, of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) was developed using observations made in the 2003 Spring and Autumn cruises over the YS and the ECS. Analysis of the in-situ backscattering coefficients of the suspended particles (b(bp)) indicates that the accuracy becomes worse when the concentration of TSM (C-TSM) is higher than 20 mg/l. The accuracy of the b(bp) is improved by using a bio-optical model in which b(bp) is optimized with a non-linear least-square Levenberg-Marquardt method. The remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) is obtained by means of the optimization. The optimized R-rs for waters with C-TSM higher than 20 mg/l, together with the measured R-rs for waters with C-TSM lower than 20 mg/l, are used to establish the relationships between R-rs (748), R-rs (869) and R-rs (645), which are used in the iterative method for atmospheric correction. Two atmospheric correction algorithms are switched according to the water turbidity. The shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) method is used for waters with high-turbidity, and the iterative method is used otherwise. Results of the atmospheric correction were then applied to the Tassan model modified in this paper to compute the C-TSM. Comparison between the retrieval results from MODIS imagery and the in-situ measurements indicates that the algorithms described in this paper can provide a reliable estimation of the C-TSM distributions in the YS and ECS.

AB Information related to land cover is immensely important to global change science. In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature. and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75% correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm.

AB The PARASOL instrument provides polarization measurements of the Earth's reflectance. Data processing of these measurements leads to a large and representative dataset of Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Functions (BPDF) for a wide range of surface cover. All surfaces show a similar pattern of the polarized reflectances, with very little polarization at backscattering and a general increase with the phase angle. The largest polarized reflectances are observed facing the sun, with large sun and view angles and amount to 0.02-0.04 depending on the surface type. Simple BPDF models available in the literature predict the correct order of magnitude as well as the main features of its directional signatures. However, these models also show significant biases for some viewing geometries. We propose a new model for the BPDF of natural surfaces, based on theoretical development as well as empirical fit to the PARASOL measurements. This linear model with only one free parameter allows a similar fit to the measurements as a previously published one (Nadal and Breon, 1999), non-linear with two parameters. Because the BPDF of natural surfaces appears to vary very little, a fixed model (i.e. with a priori biome-specific values for the parameter) is defined and may be sufficient for most applications.

AB Landsat imagery with a 30 m spatial resolution is well suited for characterizing landscape-level forest structure and dynamics. While Landsat images have advantageous spatial and spectral characteristics for describing vegetation properties, the Landsat sensor's revisit rate, or the temporal resolution of the data, is 16 days. When considering that cloud cover may impact any given acquisition, this lengthy revisit rate often results in a dearth of imagery for a desired time interval (e.g., month, growing season, or year) especially for areas at higher latitudes with shorter growing seasons. In contrast, MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) has a high temporal resolution, covering the Earth up to multiple times per day, and depending on the spectral characteristics of interest, MODIS data have spatial resolutions of 250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. By combining Landsat and MODIS data, we are able to capitalize on the spatial detail of Landsat and the temporal regularity of MODIS acquisitions. In this research, we apply and demonstrate a data fusion approach (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM) at a mainly coniferous study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Reflectance data for selected MODIS channels, all of which were resampled to 500 m, and Undsat (at 30 m) were combined to produce 18 synthetic Landsat images encompassing the 2001 growing season (May to October). We compared, on a channel-by-channel basis, the surface reflectance values (stratified by broad land cover types) of four real Landsat images with the corresponding closest date of synthetic Landsat imagery, and found no significant difference between real (observed) and synthetic (predicted) reflectance values (mean difference in reflectance: mixed forest (chi) over bar = 0.086, rho = 0.088, broadleaf (chi) over bar = 0.019, sigma = 0.079, coniferous (chi) over bar = 0.039, sigma = 0.093). Similarly, a pixel based analysis shows that predicted and observed reflectance values for the four Landsat dates were closely related (mean r(2) = 0.76 for the NIR band: r(2) = 0.54 for the red band; p<0.01). Investigating the trend in NDVI values in synthetic Landsat values over a growing season revealed that phenological patterns were well captured; however, when seasonal differences lead to a change in land cover (i.e., disturbance, snow cover), the algorithm used to generate the synthetic Landsat images was, as expected, less effective at predicting reflectance.

AB Eight new refinements were implemented in the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) product suite when transitioning from version 4 (W) to version 5 (V5). The refinements were designed to improve the spatial coverage, stability, and accuracy of the product suite. Version 4.1 (V4.1) is an interim collection which uses V5 input products (MOD02, MOD03, MOD07, MOD10, and MOD35), but the LST&E retrieval algorithm is unchanged from V4 in which the split-window and day/night temperature retrieval algorithms are only partially incorporated, and not fully incorporated as in V5. A test dataset for the V4.1 product was produced by MODAPS for a 3-month period from July through September 2004, and after an initial evaluation period, it was decided to generate the V4.1 product from mission period 2007001 onwards as a continuation of previous years of V4 data. This paper compares MODIS retrieved surface emissivities between V4, V4.1 and V5 using the level-3 MODIS daily LST&E product, MOD11B1.Comparisons of MOD11B1 retrieved surface emissivity during the Jul-Sep 2004 test period with lab measurements of sand samples collected at the Namib desert, Namibia result in a combined mean absolute emissivity difference for bands 29 (8.55 mu m), 31 (11 mu m) and 32 (12 mu m) of 1.06%, 0.65% and 1.93% for V4, V4.1 and V5 respectively. Maximum band 29 emissivity differences with the lab results were 4.10%, 2.96% and 8.64% for V4, V4.1 and V5 respectively. These results indicate that over and and semi-arid areas, users should consider using MODIS V4 or V4.1 data instead of V5. Furthermore, users should be careful not to develop time series from a mixture of product versions that could introduce artifacts at version boundaries. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Multi-temporal C-band SAR data (C-HH and C-VV), collected by ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite systems, are compared with field observations of hydrology (i.e., inundation and soil moisture) and National Wetland Inventory maps (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) of a large forested wetland complex adjacent to the Patuxent and Middle Patuxent Rivers, tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Multi-temporal C-band SAR data were shown to be capable of mapping forested wetlands and monitoring hydroperiod (i.e., temporal fluctuations in inundation and soil moisture) at the study site, and the discrimination of wetland from upland was improved with 10 m digital elevation data. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the multi-temporal SAR data sets and to isolate the dominant temporal trend in inundation and soil moisture (i.e., relative hydroperiod). Significant positive, linear correlations were found between the first principal component and Percent area flooded and soil moisture. The correlation (r(2)) between the first principal component (PC1) of multi-temporal C-HH SAR data and average soil moisture was 0.88 (p=<.0001) during the leaf-off season and 0.87 (p=<.0001) during the leaf-on season, while the correlation between PC1 and average percent area inundated was 0.82 (p=<.0001) and 0.47 (p=.0016) during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons, respectively. When compared to field data, the SAR forested wetland maps identified areas that were flooded for 25% of the time with 63-96% agreement and areas flooded for 25% of the time with 44-89% agreement, depending on polarization and time of year. The results are encouraging and justify further studies to attempt to quantify the relative SAR-derived hydroperiod classes in terms of physical variables and also to test the application of SAR data to more diverse landscapes at a broader scale. The present evidence suggests that the SAR data will significantly improve routine wooded wetland mapping. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Information regarding the spatial extent and timing of flooding in the world's major wetlands is important to a wide range of research questions including global methane models, water management, and biodiversity assessments. The Florida Everglades is one of the largest wetlands in the US, and is subject to substantial development and pressures that require intensive hydrological modeling and monitoring. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is a global sensor with high frequency repeat coverage and significant potential for mapping wetland extent and dynamics at moderate spatial resolutions. In this study, empirical models to predict surface inundation in the Everglades were estimated using MODIS data calibrated to water stage data from the South Florida Water Management District for the calendar year 2004. The results show that hydropatterns in the Florida Everglades are strongly correlated to a Tasseled Cap wetness index derived from MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Function Adjusted Reflectance data. Several indices were tested, including the Normalized Difference Wetness Index and the diurnal land surface temperature difference, but the Tasseled Cap wetness index showed the strongest correlation to water stage data across a range of surface vegetation types. Other variables included in the analysis were elevation and percent tree cover present within a pixel. Using logistic regression and ensemble regression trees, maps of water depth and flooding likelihood were produced for each 16-day MODIS data period in 2004. The results suggest that MODIS is useful for dynamic monitoring of flooding, particularly in wetlands with sparse tree cover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem energy has been shown to be a strong correlate with biological diversity at continental scales. Early efforts to characterize this association used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to represent ecosystem energy. While this spectral vegetation index covaries with measures of ecosystem energy such as net primary production, the covariation is known to degrade in areas of very low vegetation or in areas of dense forest. Two of the new vegetation products from the MODIS sensor, derived by integrating spectral reflectance, climate data, and land cover, are thought to better approximate primary productivity than NDVI. In this study, we determine if the new MODIS derived measures of primary production, gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) better explain variation in bird richness than historically used NDVI. Moreover, we evaluate if the two productivity measures covary more strongly with bird diversity in those vegetation conditions where limitations of NDVI are well recognized.
   Biodiversity was represented as native landbird species richness derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Analyses included correlation analyses among predictor variables, and univariate regression analyses between each predictor variable and bird species richness. Analyses were done at two levels: for all BBS routes across natural landscapes in North America: and for routes in 10 vegetation classes stratified by vegetated cover along a gradient from bare ground to herbaceous cover to tree cover. We found that NDVI, GPP and NPP were highly correlated and explained similar variation in bird species richness when analyzed for all samples across North America. However, when samples were stratified by vegetated cover, strength of correlation between NDVI and both productivity measures was low for samples with bare ground and for dense forest. The NDVI also explained substantially less variation in bird species richness than the primary production in areas with more bare ground and in areas of dense forest. We conclude that MODIS productivity measures have higher utility in Studies of the relationship of species richness and productivity and that MODIS GPP and NPP improve on NDVI, especially for studies with large variation in vegetated cover and density.

AB Many ecological processes in intertidal areas act at very small (mm to cm) spatial scales so manipulative ecological experiments are done at scales at which these processes are proposed to occur. Remote-sensing using field-based sensors enable ecologists to capture Variability that must be measured to test hypotheses about small-scale processes.
   We present two case studies where remote-sensing from field-based platforms has been used to acquire data for manipulative ecological experiments in intertidal areas. The first study, from a rock platform, investigates the spatial scales of variability in chlorophyll (as an index of algal biomass) in experimental plots prior to and after the removal of encrusting macro-algae. Digital colour-infrared (CIR) imagery of the rock platform was obtained before the removal of the encrusting macro-algae and on 1, 44, 75,117 and 160 days after removal. Amount of chlorophyll was derived from the CIR data using a simple ratio of reflectances at near-infrared (NIR) and red wavelengths. Block Mean Square (BMS) analysis showed that there was little variability in amounts of chlorophyll at very small (<= 2.26 cm(2)) scales, prior to and after removal of encrusting macro-algae. The greatest variability occurred at the largest block-size analysed (36.19 cm(2)). This identifies the spatial scale at which micro-algal food resources are variably scattered on the shore. Results discriminate variability at about 60-80 mm distances. Distributions of micro-algae are caused by a complicated interplay of scale-dependent ecological processes, including grazing. These findings provide a basis for the design of manipulative experiments at appropriate scales to unravel these processes.
   The second study used field reflectance spectra (350-1050 nm) to: i) determine whether the amount of algae in soft sediments could be changed by manipulating the amounts of light reaching the sediment surface and ii) test the hypothesis that the strength of in vivo absorption features, as indices of the amount of chlorophyll and other pigments, was correlated with measures of sediment-stability (erosion threshold and erosion rate). Several different measures of the strength of absorption features were investigated to determine the best predictor of stability of the sediment. Reflectance spectra showed that amounts of algae had been successfully manipulated. Derivative reflectance at individual wavelengths, indicative of absorption by chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-c, were the best predictors of sediment-stability.
   These case studies demonstrate some novel uses of field-based remote-sensing to provide information at the spatial scales relevant to many intertidal ecologists. Such techniques should have an increasingly important role in ecological field experimentation where non-destructive sampling of photosynthetic pigments is desired. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB It is generally accepted that responsible stewardship of the ocean implies ecosystem-based management. A requirement then arises for ecosystem indicators that can be applied in serial fashion with a view to detection of ecosystem change in response to environmental perturbations such as climate change or overfishing. The status of ecological indicators for the pelagic ecosystem is reviewed. The desirable properties of such indicators are listed and it is pointed out that remote sensing (ocean colour, supplemented by sea-surface temperature) is an important aid to achieving them. Some ecological indicators that can be developed from remotely-sensed data on ocean colour are tabulated. They deal with the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton biomass, production and loss terms, annual production, new production, ratio of production to respiration, spatial variances in phytoplankton biomass and production, spatial distribution of phytoplankton functional types, delineation of ecological Provinces and phytoplankton size structure.

AB A hybrid scheme for the inversion of the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model is presented. It combines the inversion technique described by Lavergne et a]. (Lavergne, T., Kaminski, T., Pinty, B., Taberner, M., Gobron, N., Verstraete, M.M., Vossbeck, M., Widlowski, J.L., Giering, R. (2007). Application to MISR land products of an RPV model inversion package using adjoint and Hessian codes. Remote Sensing of Environment, 107, 362-375.) and a multilayer backpropagation feedforward neural network. The RPV inversion package is applied to a sample set of pixels within the satellite scene. Subsequently the pairs of bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) and model parameters estimated from the sample set of pixels are used to train the neural network. Since the mathematical formulation of the RPV model is embedded in these training data variables, the neural network can efficiently retrieve the model parameters for the whole satellite scene. This scheme has been tested for a MISR L2 BRF scene, MISR L1B2-deFived BRF data corresponding to two different dates and a mosaic of MISR L2 BRF scenes acquired over Southern Africa covering a large extent of Miombo woodland. The results show this strategy retrieves the RPV model parameters and uncertainties with high accuracy and considerable speed over large areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forests are complex ecological systems, characterised by multiple-scale structural and dynamical patterns which are not inferable from a system description that spans only a narrow window of resolution; this makes their investigation a difficult task using standard field sampling protocols.
   We segment a QuickBird image covering a beech forest in an initial stage of old-growthness - showing, accordingly, a good degree of structural complexity - into three segmentation levels. We apply field-based diversity indices of tree size, spacing, species assemblage to quantify structural heterogeneity amongst forest regions delineated by segmentation. The aim of the study is to evaluate, on a statistical basis, the relationships between spectrally delineated image segments and observed spatial heterogeneity in forest structure, including gaps in the outer canopy. Results show that: some 45% of the segments generated at the coarser segmentation scale (level 1) are surrounded by structurally different neighbours; level 2 segments distinguish spatial heterogeneity in forest structure in about 63% of level 1 segments; level 3 image segments detect better canopy gaps, rather than differences in the spatial pattern of the investigated structural indices.
   Results support also the idea of a mixture of macro and micro structural heterogeneity within the beech forest: large size populations of trees homogeneous for the examined structural indices at the coarser segmentation level, when analysed at a finer scale, are internally heterogeneous; and vice versa.
   Findings from this study demonstrate that multiresolution segmentation is able to delineate scale-dependent patterns of forest structural heterogeneity, even in an initial stage of old-growth structural differentiation. This tool has therefore a potential to improve the sampling design of field surveys aimed at characterizing forest structural complexity across multiple spatio-temporal scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Mediterranean rangelands are unique marginal ecosystems, which are characterized by a highly heterogeneous structure and are often interwoven with other ecosystems. Traditionally, rangelands provided resources for livestock grazing in transhumantic rotation schemes. In recent times, there has been a trend towards semi-intensive grazing systems, which is partly connected to the European system of agricultural and infrastructural subsidies, and which effectuates both intensification and extensification. This study employed trend analysis of a remote sensing data time series for a retrospective assessment of rangeland processes, and interpreted these in the light of land-use practices and previous management interventions.
   We have selected a test area in Northern Greece that is representative of typical land-use transitions of the European Mediterranean. A time series of Landsat TM and ETM+ data covering the years 1984-2000 with one image per year was acquired, and for all images a geometric correction including digital elevation information and full radiative transfer modelling were carried out to attain surface reflectance data. For further analyses, proportional vegetation cover was selected as the target indicator, which was derived using Spectral Mixture Analysis. The resulting data set was used in a linear trend analysis to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation cover development. These could be interpreted based on knowledge of the local grazing regime and factors driving it, as well as using auxiliary spatial data sets. Results showed that temporal trends in the test area reflect the underlying pattern of potential livestock distribution at the per-pixel level, with a spatially differentiated pattern of both positive and negative trends in close proximity. On the other hand, no direct relation could be established between the development of vegetation cover and animal stocking rates at the community level. This suggests that this aggregation level is too coarse given the combination of highly heterogeneous landscapes with semi-intensive to intensive land tenure systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The availability of a wide range of satellite measurements of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions, together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrences, has created the opportunity to model and monitor species geographic distribution and richness at regional to continental scales. In this paper, we examine the application of recently developed global data products from satellite observations in modeling the potential distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin. We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT, SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of omission rates and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance, the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats. To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers and to compare the results with model simulations using climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity, modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and field observations. The results compare with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations suggest that climate and remote sensing results are complementary and that the best distribution patterns can be achieved when the two data sets are combined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate quantification of photo-induced marine processes requires a realistic description of UV radiation (UVR) penetration in the surface ocean. Remote sensing of ocean color could supply global views of UVR attenuation if reliable algorithms were made available. Although a few models for the retrieval of UV diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d(lambda), have been proposed in the past, robust and properly validated algorithms are still needed. We have developed and validated two algorithms for the retrieval of K-d(lambda) at lambda = 320, 340, 380, 412, 443, 490 nm from multispectral remote-sensing reflectances, R-rs(lambda) (SeaWiFS wavebands). These algorithms, SeaUV and SeaUV(C), were developed from a large "training dataset" comprising simultaneous in situ measurements of R-rs(lambda) and K-d(lambda) made in a variety of water types ranging from blue oligotrophic to turbid estuarine systems. Four orthogonal dimensions of ocean color defined from the original R-rs(lambda) spectra are used as predictors in multiple linear regressions of K-d(lambda) to develop the algorithms. In the case of SeaUV(C), an optical classification permits the development of water-type specific parameterizations. Validation against an independent synthetic Hydrolight (R) data set and an in sitar data set showed that the algorithms can be used with confidence over the range of water types for which they have been developed. SeaUV and SeaUV(C) will find applicability in the fields of marine photochemistry and photobiology where their performance and inherent simplicity make them suitable for batch implementation on large data sets and at global scales.

AB Most ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) do not take into account the effect: of space- and time-varying phytoplankton on solar radiation penetration; or do it in a simplistic way using a constant attenuation depth, even though one-dimensional experiments have shown potential significant effect of phytoplankton on mixed-layer dynamics. Since some ocean basins are biologically active, it is necessary fir an OGCM to take water turbidity into account, even if it is not coupled with a biological model. Sensitivity experiments carried out with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) OGCM with spatially and temporally-varying pigment concentration from Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data during 1998-2003 reveal the effect of ocean turbidity on tropical Indian Ocean circulation. Variations of light-absorbing phytoplankton pigments change the vertical distribution of solar heating in the mixed layer, thereby affecting upper-ocean circulation. A simulation was performed from 1948 to 2003 with a constant minimum pigment concentration of 0.02 mg m(-3) while another simulation was performed from September 1997 to December 2003 with variable pigment concentration, and the differences between these two simulations allow us to quantify the effects of phytoplankton on solar radiation penetration in the ocean model. Model results from a period of 6 years (1998-2003) show large seasonal variability in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), meridional heat transports (MHT), and equatorial under current (EUC). The MOC mass transport changes by 2 to 5 Sv (1 Sv=10(6) m(3) s(-1)) between boreal winter (January) and boreal summer (July), with a corresponding change in the MHT of similar to 0.05 PW (1 PW=10(15) W) in boreal winter, which is close to the expected change associated with a significant climate change [Shell, K., Frouin, R., Nakamoto, S., & Somerville, R.C.J. (2003): Atmospheric response to solar radiation absorbed by phytoplankton. Journal of Geophysical Research, 108(D15), 4445. doi:10.1029/2003JD003440.]. In addition, changes in phytoplankton pigments concentration are associated with a reduction in the EUC by similar to 3 cm s(-1). We discuss the possible physical mechanisms behind this variability, and the necessity of including phytoplankton forcing in the OGCM. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interferometric processing of JERS-1 L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired over south Florida during 1993-1996 reveals detectable surface changes in the Everglades wetlands. Although our study is limited to south Florida it has implication for other large-scale wetlands, because south Florida wetlands have diverse vegetation types and both managed and natural flow environments. Our analysis reveals that interferometric coherence level is sensitive to wetland vegetation type and to the interferogram time span. Interferograms with time spans less than six months maintain phase observations for all wetland types, allowing characterization of water level changes in different wetland environments. The most noticeable changes occur between the managed and the natural flow wetlands. In the managed wetlands, fringes are organized, follow patterns related to some of the managed water control structures and have high fringe-rate. In the natural flow areas, fringes are irregular and have a low fringe-rate. The high fringe rate in managed areas reflects dynamic water topography caused by high flow rate due to gate operation. Although this organized fringe pattern is not characteristic of most large-scale wetlands, the high level of water level change enables accurate estimation of the wetland InSAR technique, which lies in the range of 5-10 cm. The irregular and low rate fringe pattern in the natural flow area reflects uninterrupted flow that diffuses water efficiently and evenly. Most of the interferograms in the natural flow area show an elongated fringe located along the transitional zone between salt- and fresh-water wetlands, reflecting water level changes due to ocean tides.

ID VALIDATION
AB The exploitation of global Earth Observation data hinges increasingly on physically-based radiative transfer (RT) models. These models simulate the interactions of solar radiation within a given medium (e.g., clouds, plant canopies) and are used to generate look-up-tables that are embedded into quantitative retrieval algorithms, such as those delivering the operational surface products for MODIS, MISR and MERIS. An assessment of the quality of canopy RT models thus appears essential if accurate and reliable information is to be derived from them. Until recently such an undertaking was a time consuming and labour intensive process that was made even more challenging by the general lack of absolute reference standards. Several years of benchmarking activities in the frame of the RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise have now led to the development of the RAMI On-line Model Checker (ROMC). The ROMC is a web-based tool allowing model developers and users to autonomously assess the performance of canopy RT models (http://romcjrc.ec.europa.eo. Access to the ROMC is free and enables users to obtain both statistical and graphical indications as to the performance of their canopy RT model. In addition to providing an overall indication of the skill of a given model to correctly match the reference data, the ROMC allows also for interactive comparison/evaluations of different model versions/submissions of a given user. All ROMC graphs can be downloaded in PostScript format and come with a reference number for easy usage in presentations and publications. It is hoped that the ROMC will prove useful for the RT modeling community as a whole, not only by providing a convenient means to evaluate models outside the triennial phases of RAMI but also to attract participation in future RAMI activities.

AB Detailed knowledge of light interactions between the atmosphere and vegetation, and within vegetation are of particular interest for terrestrial carbon cycle studies and optical remote sensing. This study describes a model for 3-D canopy radiative transfer that is directly coupled with an atmospheric radiative transfer model (Forest Light Environmental Simulator, FLiES). The model was developed based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method using some existing modeling frameworks. To integrate the canopy radiative transfer model with atmosphere, the same numerical method, sampling technique, and variance reduction technique were employed in both the atmospheric and the canopy modules. Farquhar's leaf photosynthesis model was combined to calculate the canopy level photosynthesis from the light environmental parameters obtained by the radiative transfer calculation. In order to document the quality of the coupled model, we first compared the atmospheric radiative transfer module to well known 1-D atmospheric radiative transfer models, and then evaluated the 3-D canopy radiative transfer module against a series of test cases provided by the RAMI On-line Model Checker (ROMC). We used the model to show the impact of atmospheric properties and 3-D canopy structure on the directionality of downward photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the top of canopy, the 3-D distribution of absorbed PAR (APAR), and overall canopy photosynthesis. The results indicate the importance to consider angular geometry of incident light at TOC and 3-D canopy structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We observed the large tabular iceberg A-38B in the time period from the calving event at the Ronne lee Shelf in 1998 until its grounding near South Georgia in 2004 by means of various space-borne sensors. The initial ice thickness was determined by radar altimetry, the iceberg shape from radar imaging and optical instruments. The freeboard change at different stages of the drift was derived from ICESat Laser altimeter profiles. The analysis of the satellite data confirms that the decay of A-38B is governed mainly by basal erosion. We then used a numerical model for simulating iceberg melting and fitted the melt rate by varying the turbulent exchange parameters for temperature (gamma(T)) and salt (gamma(s)) to match the results obtained by ICESat data. Our results show that the iceberg passed through three melting regimes characterized by iceberg drift velocity: (1) In the Weddell Sea melting conditions are similar to the situation under an ice shelf with strong tidal currents which corresponds to a gamma(T) Of 1.0 * 10(-4) m s(-1). (2) In the Scotia Sea, where the iceberg drifts unhindered with the ocean current and is surrounded by its own melt water, gamma(T,) is 0.4 * 10(-4) m s(-1). (3) At the grounding position friction velocity is again high due to tidal currents and gamma(T) is 1.8 * 10(-4) m s(-1). gamma(s) is set to 0.00505 gamma(T) in all cases. The analysis shows that ICESat GLAS data together with satellite imagery can provide better estimates of turbulent exchange parameters, which is a step forward in improving the knowledge of fresh water input from melting icebergs into the Southern Ocean.

AB Grain size is a key parameter of a snowpack, affecting its thermodynamic state and influencing the spectral snow albedo. Differently from visible wavelengths, where the sensitivity to grain size is very low, in the near-infrared band there is a strong sensitivity of the reflectance to the grain size. This sensitivity provides the basis for the retrieval of grain size. In this paper we introduce a new snow retrieval algorithm that makes use of near-infrared measurements in which snow is modeled as a semi-infinite, weakly absorbing medium. It is assumed that the dense packing effects can be neglected and the radiative transport in snow can be studied using the standard radiative transfer equation extensively used, e.g., in cloud optics. The shape of grains is accounted for in the framework of fractal snow grain model. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using ground-based measurements of snow albedo and results from a different retrieval algorithm. The technique is applied to study the changes of snow properties before and just after snow fall as seen by two MODIS sensors on TERRA and AQUA satellites. These satellites fly approximately 3 h and half apart (10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. equator crossing time). The values of grain size retrieved from MODIS are also compared with values of grain size collected on ground. However, the area observed by MODIS including the locations of ground measurements was completely covered by clouds on the date of the measurements and the comparison could be performed only for the two previous days. A sensitivity analysis of the retrieval error due to atmospheric correction is also performed. Results show that the error on grain size retrieval induced by atmospheric correction ranges between +/- 5% and +/- 40%, depending on the grain size. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes the algorithmic principles used to generate LAI, WAR and Mover estimates from VEGETATION observations. These biophysical variables are produced globally at 10 days temporal sampling interval under lat-lon projection at 1/112 degrees spatial resolution. After a brief description of the VEGETATION sensors, radiometric calibration process, based on vicarious desertic targets is first presented. The cloud screening algorithm was then fine tuned using a global network of cloudiness observations. Atmospheric correction is then achieved using the SMAC code with inputs coming from meteorological values of pressure, ozone and water vapour. Aerosol optical thickness is derived from MODIS climatology assuming continental aerosol type. The Roujean BRDF model is then adjusted for red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands used to the remaining cloud free observations collected over a time window of 15 days. Outliers due to possible cloud contamination or residual atmospheric correction are iteratively eliminated and prior information is used to get more robust estimates of the three BRDF kernel coefficients. Nadir viewing top of canopy reflectance in the three bands is input to the biophysical algorithm to compute the products at 10 days sampling interval. This algorithm is based on training neural networks over SAIL+PROPSPECT radiative transfer model simulations for each biophysical variable. Details on the way the training data base was generated and the neural network designed and calibrated are presented. Finally, theoretical performances are discussed. Validation over ground measurement data sets and inter-comparison with other similar biophysical products are presented and discussed in a companion paper.

AB Satellite sensors are well suited to monitoring changes on the Earth's surface through provision of consistent and repeatable measurements at a spatial scale appropriate for many processes causing change on the land surface. Here, we describe and test a new conceptual approach to change detection of forests using a dense temporal stack of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The central premise of the method is the recognition that many phenomena associated with changes in land cover have distinctive temporal progressions both before and after the change event, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in spectral space. Rather than search for single change events between two dates of imagery, we instead search for these idealized signatures in the entire temporal trajectory of spectral values. This trajectory-based change detection is automated, requires no screening of non-forest area, and requires no metric-specific threshold development. Moreover, the method simultaneously provides estimates of discontinuous phenomena (disturbance date and intensity) as well as continuous phenomena (post-disturbance regeneration). We applied the method to a stack of 18 Landsat TM images for the 20-year period from 1984 to 2004. When compared with direct interpreter delineation of disturbance events, the automated method accurately labeled year of disturbance with 90% overall accuracy in clear-cuts and with 77% accuracy in partial-cuts (thinnings). The primary source of error in the method was misregistration of images in the stack, suggesting that higher accuracies are possible with better registration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The areal and intensity indices of the South China Sea Warm Pool (SCSWP) derived from three datasets, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Optimum Interpolation Version 2 (O1.v2) sea surface temperature (SST), are generally consistent with each other at monthly, seasonal and interannual scales. However, the three records are different in some cases. First, minor differences among the monthly records of intensity index are observed in the period July to September. Secondly, the interannual records of SCSWP intensity derived from AVHRR and O1.v2 are different in autumn during the period 1990-1996. The reason is not yet clear and nor is it clear which record best represents fluctuations in SCSWP intensity. These suggest that various drawbacks of the three datasets, such as low resolution of O1.v2, and cloud and rain contamination on AVHRR and TMI data, would be serious enough to allow deviation from each other to appear. Merging AVHRR and TMI SST data might be the way leading to a more convincing time series of SCSWP. In addition, changes of areal and intensity indices are not always consistent with each other, for example, they have different monthly patterns. Although the three interannual records of intensity index in three seasons all capture the main Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) signals at a half-year lag, only those which are in the summer significantly correlated with MEI.

AB Relatively little is known about the disturbance ecology of large wildfires in the southern Appalachians. The occurrence of a 4000-ha wildfire in the Linville Gorge Wilderness area in western North Carolina has provided a rare opportunity to study a large fire with a range of severities. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the potential for using multi-temporal Landsat imagery to map fire severity in the southern Appalachians, 2) examine the influences of topography and forest community type on the spatial pattern of fire severity; and 3) examine the relationship between predicted fire severity and changes in species richness. A non-linear regression equation predicted a field-based composite burn index (CBI) as a function of change in the Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) with an R(2) of 0.71. Fire severity was highest on drier landforms located on upper hillslopes, ridges, and on southwest aspects, and was higher in pine communities than in other forest types. Predicted CBI was positively correlated with changes in species richness and with the post-fire cover of pine seedlings (Pinus virginiana, R rigida, and P pungens), suggesting that burn severity maps can be used to predict community-level fire effects across large landscapes. Despite the relatively large size of this fire for the southern Appalachians, severity was strongly linked to topographic variability and pre-fire vegetation, and spatial variation in fire severity was correlated with changes in species richness. Thus, the Linville Gorge fire appears to have generally reinforced the ecological constraints imposed by underlying environmental gradients. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the near future, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission will provide global maps of surface soil moisture (SM). The SMOS baseline payload is an L-band (1.4 GHz) two dimensional interferometric microwave radiometer which will provide multi-angular and dual-polarization observations. In the framework of the ground segment activities for the SMOS mission an operational SMOS Level 2 Soil Moisture algorithm was developed. The principle of the algorithm is to exploit multi-angular data in order to retrieve simultaneously several surface parameters including soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. The algorithm uses an iterative approach, minimizing a cost function computed from the differences between measured and modelled brightness temperature (TB) data, for all available incidence angles.
   In the algorithm, the selected forward model is the so-called L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model which was the result of an extensive review of the current knowledge of the microwave emission of various land covers. This model is a key element in the SMOS L2 algorithm and could be used in future assimilation studies. There is thus a strong need for a reference study, describing the model and its implementation. In order to address these needs a detailed description of soil and vegetation modelling in L-MEB is given in this study. In a second step, the use of L-MEB in soil moisture retrievals is evaluated for several experimental data sets over agricultural crops. Calibrations of the soil and vegetation L-MEB parameters are investigated for corn, soybean and wheat. Over the different experiments, very consistent results are obtained for each vegetation type in terms of calibration and soil moisture retrievals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantification of the magnitude of net terrestrial carbon (C) uptake, and how it varies inter-anually, is an important question with future potential sequestration influenced by both increased atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. However the assessment of differences in measured and modeled C accumulation is a challenging task due to the significant fine scale variation occurring in terrestrial productivity due to soil, climate and vegetation characteristics as well as difficultie,s in measuring carbon accumulation over large spatial areas. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers a means of monitoring gross primary production (GPP), both spatially and temporally, routinely from space. However it is critical to compare and contrast the temporal dynamics of the C and water fluxes with those measured from ground-based networks, or estimated using physiological models. In this paper, using a number of approaches, our objective is to determine if any systematic biases exists in either the MODIS, or the modeled estimates of fluxes, relative to the measurements made over an evergreen, needleleaf temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, Canada. Results indicate that 8-day GPP as predicted with a simple physiological model (3PGS), forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, matched measured fluxes very well (r(2)-0.86, p < 0.001) with no significant difference between eddy covariance (EC) and modeled GPP (p < 0.001). In addition, modeled water supply closely matched measured relative available soil water content at the site. Using canopy characteristics from the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (WAR) algorithm, slightly reduced the correspondence of the predictions due to a large number of unsuccessful retrievals (83%) due to sun angle, snow and cloud. Predictions of GPP based on the MODIS GPP algorithm, forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, were also highly correlated with EC measurements (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) however these estimates were biased under predicting GPP. Estimates of GPP based on the most recent MODIS reprocessing (collection 4.5) remained highly correlated (r(2)=0.88, p < 0.001) yet were also the most biased with the estimates being 30% less than the EC-measured GPP. Most of the variance in GPP at the site was explained by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. We also compared the nighttime respiration as measured over 2 years at the site with the minimum 8-day MODIS land surface temperature and found a significant relationship (r(2)=0.57), similar to other studies.

AB Forest fires leave behind a changed ecosystem with a patchwork of surface cover that includes ash, charred organic matter, soils and soil minerals, and dead, damaged, and living vegetation. The distributions of these materials affect post-fire processes of erosion, nutrient cycling, and vegetation regrowth. We analyzed high spatial resolution (2.4 in pixel size) Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected over the Cerro Grande fire, to map post-fire surface cover into 10 classes, including ash, soil minerals, scorched conifer trees, and green vegetation. The Cerro Grande fire occurred near Los Alamos, New Mexico, in May 2000. The AVIRIS data were collected September 3, 2000. The surface cover map revealed complex patterns of ash, iron oxide minerals, and clay minerals in areas of complete combustion. Scorched conifer trees, which retained dry needles heated by the fire but not fully combusted by the flames, were found to cover much of the post-fire landscape. These scorched trees were found in narrow zones at the edges of completely burned areas. A surface cover map was also made using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data, collected September 5, 2000, and a maximum likelihood, supervised classification. When compared to AVIRIS, the Landsat classification grossly overestimated cover by dry conifer and ash classes and severely underestimated soil and green vegetation cover. In a comparison of AVIRIS surface cover to the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) map of burn severity, the BAER high burn severity areas did not capture the variable patterns of post-fire surface cover by ash, soil, and scorched conifer trees seen in the AVIRIS map. The BAER map, derived from air photos, also did not capture the distribution of scorched trees that were observed in the AVIRIS map. Similarly, the moderate severity class of Landsat-derived burn severity maps generated from the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) calculation had low agreement with the AVIRIS classes of scorched conifer trees. Burn severity and surface cover images were found to contain complementary information, with the dNBR map presenting an image of degree of change caused by fire and the AVIRIS-derived map showing specific surface cover resulting from fire.

AB Satellite altimetry is a powerful tool to map the ice sheet elevation as well as a number of other parameters linked to geometrical and geophysical properties of ice sheets. Irrespective of new instrumental developments like the laser altimeter on ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) the well-established radar altimeter (RA) missions ERS-1,2 (European Remote Sensing satellites) and ENVISAT (ENVIronment SATellite) are unique in their temporal coverage over more than a decade and in their temporal and spatial sampling. Therefore, the full exploitation of these RA data by improved methods is imperative. Here we develop improved techniques to correct for topographically induced errors by a refined consideration of the relevant topographic conditions. Furthermore we improve the gridding procedure by adapting it to local conditions and thus preserving smaller-scale features. We apply our methods to the region of the subglacial Lake Vostok/Antarctica and derive digital elevation models (DEMs) for this region with the aim of improving/resolving smaller scales. The effect of our improvements is demonstrated in detail by comparing our DEMs and previously published DEMs to the ICESat laser measurements which are taken as a reference here. Due to our improvements, the standard deviation of the difference between RA-based DEMs of the Lake Vostok region and ICESat data decreases from more than 1.1 m to 0.5 m. This remaining error is chiefly the error inherent in the RA observations. Our RA-ICESat comparisons, supported by Fourier analyses, also reveal the presence and importance of small-scale features that can be detected by laser but not by the RA measurements.

AB Two spatially-explicit estimates of gross primary production (GPP) are available for the Northern Great Plains. An empirical piecewise regression (PWR) GPP model was developed from flux tower measurements to map carbon flux across the region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging spectrometer (MODIS) GPP model is a process-based model that uses flux tower data to calibrate its parameters. Verification and comparison of the regional PWR GPP and the global MODIS GPP are important for the modeling of grassland carbon flux. This study compared GPP estimates from PWR and MODIS models with five towers in the grasslands. Among them, PWR GPP and MODIS GPP showed a good agreement with tower-based GPP at three towers. The global MODIS GPP, however, did not agree well with tower-based GPP at two other towers, probably because of the insensitivity of MODIS model to regional ecosystem and climate change and extreme soil moisture conditions. Cross-validation indicated that the PWR model is relatively robust for predicting regional grassland GPP. However, the MYR model should include a wide variety of flux tower data as the training data sets to obtain more accurate results.
   In addition, GPP maps based on the PWR and MODIS models were compared for the entire region. In the northwest and south, PWR GPP was much higher than MODIS GPP. These areas were characterized by the higher water holding capacity with a lower proportion of C-4 grasses in the northwest and a higher proportion Of C4 grasses in the south. In the central and southeastern regions, PWR GPP was much lower than MODIS GPP under complicated conditions with generally mixed C-3/C-4 grasses. The analysis indicated that the global MODIS GPP model has some limitations on detecting moisture stress, which may have been caused by the facts that C-3 and C-4 grasses are not distinguished, water stress is driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) from coarse meteorological data, and MODIS land cover data are unable to differentiate the sub-pixel cropland components.

AB The shape and amplitude of the bathymetric lidar waveforms (the recorded time history of the reflected lidar pulses) contain information about the attenuation of the water and the bottom reflectivity in the survey area. This study considers the factors that affect the amplitude of the bottom return and examines the use of the amplitude of the bottom return to distinguishing between different bottom types. The amplitude of the bottom return was corrected for pulse stretching and retro-reflectance due to the bottom slope based on a simple lidar radiative transfer model before the examination. Within-flightline and between-flightline variations of the bottom return were considered, both of which are related to the attenuation of water, surface wave condition, and bottom reflectivity. The major concern of within-flightline variation is the effect of surface waves on the reliability of bottom return. Between-flightline variation concerns the effect of change in viewing orientation on the bottom return from the same bottom type. A data set of Egmont Key, Florida, assuming homogeneous water clarity, was chosen to investigate the latter two effects on the bottom return signals. The result shows that the presence of surface waves is the most impeding factor that complicates the use of bottom return signal, as it can exaggerate the value (not prominent in our data) and variance of the amplitude of bottom return. A map of sand, continuous seagrass, and discontinuous seagrass ranging from the depth of 0.8 to 4.3 m was produced correctly from a single lidar flightline with limited in-situ information, in this case, a nadir viewing videotape concurrent with lidar survey mission. Finally, suggestions are proposed for ways to improve the production of a bottom map using the lidar wavefonn data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new approach to AVHRR-sensors cross-calibration in the visible to shortwave-infrared spectral domain using an a-priori, well calibrated sensor (MODIS). The approach has been tested over a stable Sahara desert site and was initially applied to compare the absolute calibration coefficients of three different bands of the Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments. The observed agreement was better than 1% for bands 1 (0.67 mu m), 2 (0.87 mu m) and 7 (2.13 mu m). The approach was then applied to cross-calibrate the AVHRR sensor onboard NOAA16. The absolute calibration coefficients derived for bands 1 and 2, using the Terra MODIS as a reference, were compared to the vicarious coefficients derived using the ocean and clouds method [Vermote E.F. and Kaufman Y.J. (1995). Absolute calibration of AVHRR visible and near-infrared channels using ocean and cloud views, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, 13, 2317-2340.]. The coefficients were consistent within less than 1%. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in numerous environmental studies. Surface heterogeneity induces uncertainty in pixel-wise LST. Spatial scaling may account for the uncertainty, however, different approaches lead to differences in scaled values. Satellite-retrieved LST may be representative of the pixel-wise LST and useful for scaling analysis, but the limited accuracy of retrieved values adds uncertainty into the scaled values. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann (S-B) law, this study proposed scaling approaches for LST over flat and relief areas to explore the combined uncertainties in scaling using satellite-retrieved data. To take advantage of simultaneous, multi-resolution observations at coincident nadirs by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), LST products from these two sensors were examined for part of the Loess Plateau in China. 90-m ASTER LST data were scaled up to 1 km using the proposed approaches, and variation in the LST was generally reduced after scaling. Amongst the sources of uncertainties, surface heterogeneity (emissivity) and different scaling approaches resulted in very minor differences, with a maximum difference of 0.2 K for the upscaled LST. Terrain features, taken as an areal weighting factor, had negligible effects on the upscaled value. Limited accuracy of the retrieved LST was the major uncertainty. The overall LST increased 0.6 K on average with correction for terrain-induced angular effect and 0.4 K for both angular and adjacency effects over the study area. Accounting for terrain correction in scaling is necessary for rugged areas. With terrain correction, the upscaled ASTER LST achieved an agreement of -0.1 +/- 1.87 K and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.87 K overall with the 1-km MODIS LST rectified by Wan et al.'s approach [Wan, Z., Zhang, Y., Zhang Q., Li, Z.-L. (2002b), Validation of the land-surface temperature products retrieved from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradionneter data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, 163-1801. Refining the rectification approach resulted in a better agreement of -0.2 +/- 1.57 K and a RMSE of 1.58 K. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tidal marshes are characterized by complex patterns both in their geomorphic and ecological features. Such patterns arise through the elaboration of a network structure driven by the tidal forcing and through the interaction between hydrodynamical, geophysical and ecological components (chiefly vegetation). Intertidal morphological and ecological structures possess characteristic extent (order of kilometers) and small-scale features (down to tens of centimeters) which are not simultaneously accessible through field observations, thus making remote sensing a necessary observation tool. This paper describes a set of remote sensing observations from several satellite and airborne platforms, the collection of concurrent ground reference data and the vegetation distributions that may be inferred from them, with specific application to the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The data set comprises ROSIS, CASI, MIVIS, IKONOS and QuickBird acquisitions, which cover a wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions. We show that spatially-detailed and quantitatively reliable vegetation maps may be derived from remote sensing in tidal environments through unsupervised (K-means) and supervised algorithms (Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper). We find that, for the objective of intertidal vegetation classification, hyperspectral data contain largely redundant information. This in particular implies that a reduction of the spectral features is required for the application of the Maximum Likelihood classifier. A large number of experiments with different feature extraction/selection algorithms show that the use of four bands derived from Maximum Noise Fraction transforms and four RGBI broad bands obtained by spectral averaging yield very similar classification performances. The classifications from hyperspectral data are somewhat superior to those from multispectral data, but the close performance and the results of the features reduction experiments show that spatial resolution affects classification accuracy much more importantly than spectral resolution. Monitoring schemes of tidal environment vegetation may thus be based on high-resolution satellite acquisitions accompanied by systematic ancillary field observations at a relatively limited number of reference sites, with practical consequences of some relevance.

AB The combination of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instruments on Meteosat-8 provides a powerful new tool for detecting aerosols and estimating their radiative effect at high temporal and spatial resolution. However, at present no specific aerosol treatment is performed in the GERB processing chain, severely limiting the use of the data for aerosol studies. A particular problem relates to the misidentification of Saharan dust outbreaks as cloud which can bias the shortwave and longwave fluxes. In this paper an algorithm is developed which employs multiple-linear regression, using information from selected thermal infrared SEVIRI channels, to detect dust aerosol over ocean and provide an estimate of the optical depth at 0.55 mu m (tau(055)). To test the performance of the algorithm, it has been applied to a number of dust events observed by SEVIRI during March and June 2004. The results are compared to co-located MODIS observations taken from the Terra and Aqua platforms, and ground based observations from the Cape Verde AERONET site. In terms of detection capability, employing the algorithm results in a notable improvement in the routine GERB scene identification. Locations identified by MODIS as being likely to be dust contaminated were originally classified as cloud in over 99.5% of the cases studied. With the application of the detection algorithm approximately 60-70% of these points are identified as dusty depending on the dust model employed. The algorithm is also capable of detecting dust in regions and at times which would be excluded when using shortwave observations, due for example to the presence of sun-glint, or through the night. We further investigate whether the algorithm is capable of generating useful information concerning the aerosol loading. Comparisons with co-located retrievals from the SEVIRI 0.6 mu m solar reflectance band observations show a level of agreement consistent with that expected from the simulations, with rms differences of between 0.5 and 0.8, and a mean bias ranging from -0.5 to 0.3 dependent on the dust representation employed in the algorithm. Temporally resolved comparisons with observations from the Capo Verde AERONET site through the months of March and June reinforce these findings, but also indicate that the algorithm is capable of discerning the diurnal pattern in aerosol loading. The algorithm has now been incorporated within the routine GERB processing in detection mode, and will be used to provide an experimental aerosol product for assessment by the scientific community.

AB Over the last few decades, the coastal regions throughout the world have experienced incidences of algal blooms, which are harmful or otherwise toxic because of their potential threat to humans as well as marine organisms, owing to accelerated eutrophication from human activities and certain oceanic processes. Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (L-w), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 5 10 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(w)) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4-71 mg m(-3), which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999-2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.

AB Tethered balloon remote sensing platforms can be used to study radiometric issues in terrestrial ecosystems by effectively bridging the spatial gap between measurements made on the ground and those acquired via airplane or satellite. In this study, the Short Wave Aerostat-Mounted Imager (SWAMI) tethered balloon-mounted platform was utilized to evaluate linear and nonlinear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) for a grassland-conifer forest ecotone during the summer of 2003. Hyperspectral measurement of a 74-m diameter ground instantaneous field of view (GIFOV) attained by the SWAMI was studied. Hyperspectral spectra of four common endmembers, bare soil, grass, tree, and shadow, were collected in situ, and images captured via video camera were interpreted into accurate areal ground cover fractions for evaluating the mixture models. The comparison between the SWAMI spectrum and the spectrum derived by combining in situ spectral data with video-derived areal fractions indicated that nonlinear effects occurred in the near infrared (NIR) region, while nonlinear influences were minimal in the visible region. The evaluation of hyperspectral and multispectral mixture models indicated that nonlinear mixture model-derived areal fractions were sensitive to the model input data, while the linear mixture model performed more stably. Areal fractions of bare soil were overestimated in all models due to the increased radiance of bare soil resulting from side scattering of NIR radiation by adjacent grass and trees. Unmixing errors occurred mainly due to multiple scattering as well as close endmember spectral correlation. In addition, though an apparent endmember assemblage could be derived using linear approaches to yield low residual error, the tree and shade endmember fractions calculated using this technique were erroneous and therefore separate treatment of endmembers subject to high amounts of multiple scattering (i.e. shadows and trees) must be done with caution. Including the short wave infrared (SWIR) region in the hyperspectral and multispectral endmember data significantly reduced the Pearson correlation coefficient values among endmember spectra. Therefore, combination of visible, NIR, and SWIR information is likely to further improve the utility of SMA in understanding ecosystem structure and function and may help narrow uncertainties when utilizing remotely sensed data to extrapolate trace glas flux measurements from the canopy scale to the landscape scale.

AB Montane coniferous forests and woodlands in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains have been subject to increased wildfire in recent years. The area and intensity of these fires is strongly dependent upon the spatial variability and type of fuels as they are arrayed across the landscape. Considering the size of the patches and the mosaic of fuel materials, high spectral and spatial resolution estimates of vegetation components and fuel types are needed to improve fire risk assessment, especially around the wildland/urban interface. Here we used highly resolved remotely sensed imagery, in combination with several spectral techniques to map major forest components and fuel types in montane coniferous forests in the Colorado Front Range by discriminating the fractional covers of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil at a sub-pixel level. An accuracy assessment based on a dataset including 34 field transects indicated that we could explain fractional cover of 73.5%, 40.3%, and 77.6% for PV, NPV, and soil respectively through the use of hyperspectral indicators. Based on the fractional cover of these components, we were able to assess the spatial patterns of vegetation and fuel characteristics at a landscape scale. Throughout the study areas, PV fractions were dominant (48.7%), followed by NPV (28.8%) and soil (22.5%). However, due to microclimate and disturbances such as fire, insect infestations and forest management practices, the spatial distribution of fractions was highly heterogeneous. There was a high fraction of PV in mature forest and on north-facing slopes, and a high fraction of NPV and bare soil in areas with recent disturbance such as fire or insect infestation. In severely burned areas, bare soil was dominant. Fuel treatments reduced the fraction of PV by 11.7%, and increased fractions of NPV by 7.4% and bare soil by 4.5%. These results suggest that hyperspectral remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only fuel fractional cover, but of fuel condition after fire, thereby greatly improving regional fire risk assessment.

AB The increasing number of sensor types for terrestrial remote sensing has necessitated supplementary efforts to evaluate and standardize data from the different available sensors. In this study, we assess the potential use of IKONOS, ETM+, and SPOT HRVIR sensors for leaf area index (LAI) estimation in forest stands. In situ measurements of LAI in 28 coniferous and deciduous stands are compared to reflectance in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave bands, and also to five spectral vegetation indices (SVIs): Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). The three sensor types show the same predictive ability for stand LAI, with an uncertainty of about 1.0m(2)/m(2) for LAI between 0.5 and 6.9 m(2)/m(2). For each sensor type, the strength of the empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI remains the same, regardless of the image processing level considered [digital counts, radiances using calibration coefficients for each sensor, top of atmosphere (TOA), and top of canopy (TOC) reflectances]. On the other hand, NDVIs based on radiance, TOA reflectance, and TOC reflectance, determined from IKONOS radiometric data, are systematically lower than from SPOT and ETM+ data. The offset is approximately 0.11 NDVI units for radiance and TOA reflectance-based NDVI, and approximately 0.20 NDVI units after atmospheric corrections. The same conclusions were observed using the other indices. SVIs using IKONOS data are always lower than those computed using ETM+ and SPOT data. Factors that may explain this behavior were investigated. Based on simulations using the SAIL bidirectional canopy reflectance model coupled with the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model (i.e., PROSAIL), we show that the spectral response in radiance of IKONOS sensor in the red band is the main factor explaining the differences in SVIs between IKONOS and the other two sensors. Finally, we conclude that, for bare soils or very sparse vegetation, radiometric data acquired by IKONOS, SPOT, and ETM+ are similar and may be used without any correction. For surfaces covered with dense vegetation, a negative offset of 10% of IKONOS NDVI should be considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There has been growing concern about land use/land cover change in tropical regions, as there is evidence of its influence on the observed increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and consequent climatic changes. Mapping of deforestation by the Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE) in areas of primary tropical forest using satellite data indicates a value of 587,727 km(2) up to the year 2000. Although most of the efforts have been concentrated in mapping primary tropical forest deforestation, there is also evidence of large-scale deforestation in the cerrado savanna, the second most important biome in the region.
   The main purpose of this work was to assess the extent of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) in 2000, using a set of multitemporal images from the 1-km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. Additionally, we discriminated primary tropical forest, cerrado savanna, and natural/artificial waterbodies. Four classification algorithms were tested: quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), simple classification trees (SCT), probability-bagging classification trees (PBCT), and k-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The agriculture/ pasture class is a surrogate for those areas cleared of its original vegetation cover in the past, acting as a source of carbon. On the contrary, the secondary succession forest class behaves as a sink of carbon.
   We used a time series of 12 monthly composite images of the year 2000, derived from the SPOT-4 VGT sensor. A set of 19 Landsat scenes was used to select training and testing data. A 10-fold cross validation procedure rated PBCT as the best classification algorithm, with an overall sample accuracy of 0.92. High omission and commission errors occurred in the secondary succession forest class, due to confusion with agriculture/pasture and primary tropical forest classes. However, the PBCT algorithm generated the lower misclassification error in this class. Besides, this algorithm yields information about class membership probability, with similar to 80% of the pixels with class membership probability greater or equal than 0.8. The estimated total area of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in 2000 in the BLA was 966 x 103 and 140 x 103 king, respectively. Comparison with an existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred primarily in areas previously occupied by primary tropical forest (46%) and cerrado savanna (33%), and also in transition forest (19%), and other vegetation types (2%). This further confines the existing evidence of extensive cerrado savanna conversion.
   This study also concludes that SPOT-4 VGT data are adequate for discriminating several major land cover types in tropical regions. Agriculture/pasture was mapped with errors of about 5%. Very high classification errors were associated with secondary succession forest, suggesting that a different methodology/sensor has to be used to address this difficult land cover class (namely with the inclusion of ancillary data). For the other classes, we consider that accurate maps can be derived from SPOT-4 VGT data with errors lower than 20% for the cerrado savanna, and errors lower than 10% for the other land cover classes. These estimates may be useful to evaluate impacts of land use/land cover change on the carbon and water cycles, biotic diversity, and soil degradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB "Case-1" has been a term frequently used to characterize water type since the seventies. However, the distribution of Case-1 waters in global scale has been vague, though open ocean waters are often referred to as Case-1 in the literature. In this study, based on recent bio-optical models for Case-1 waters, an inclusive and quantitative Case-1 criterion for remote sensing applications is developed. The criterion allows Case-1 waters to have about two-fold variations of non-pigment absorption and particle backscattering around their exact Case-1 values, allowing a large range of waters to be classified as Case-1. Even so, application of this criterion to ocean color data from the SeaWiFS satellite sensor suggests that Case-1 waters occupy only about 60% of the global ocean surface. Regionally, more Case-1 waters are found in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, and most Indian Ocean waters are found to be Case-1. The Case-1 percentage and spatial distribution change with season, and with the boundaries chosen in the criterion. Nevertheless, this study for the first time provides a quantitative and geographical perspective of Case-1 waters in global scale, and further demonstrates that many open ocean waters are not necessarily Case-1.

AB The directional emissivity of snow and ice surfaces in the 8-14 mu m thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window was determined from spectral radiances obtained by field measurements using a portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in conjunction with snow pit work. The dependence of the directional ernissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths lambda = 10.5-12.5 mu m which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 mu m and 12.5 mu m for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity lambda = 12.5 mu m for the off-nadir angle of 75 degrees reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window.

AB Current models of vegetation dynamics using the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) time series perform poorly for high-latitude environments. This is due partly to specific attributes of these environments, such as short growing season, long periods of darkness in winter, persistence of snow cover, and dominance of evergreen species, but also to the design of the models. We present a new method for monitoring vegetation activity at high latitudes, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. It estimates the NDVI of the vegetation during winter and applies a double logistic function, which is uniquely defined by six parameters that describe the yearly NDVI time series. Using NDVI data from 2000 to 2004, we illustrate the performance of this method for an area in northern Scandinavia (35 x 162 km(2), 68 degrees N 23 degrees E) and compare it to existing methods based on Fourier series and asymmetric Gaussian functions. The double logistic functions describe the NDVI data better than both the Fourier series and the asymmetric Gaussian functions, as quantified by the root mean square errors. Compared with the method based on Fourier series, the new method does not overestimate the duration of the growing season. In addition, it handles outliers effectively and estimates parameters that are related to phenological events, such as the timing of spring and autumn. This makes the method most suitable for both estimating biophysical parameters and monitoring vegetation phenology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a detailed study of Lascar volcano (Chile) based on the combination of satellite, aerial and ground-based data, in order (i) to better characterize the deformation style of Andean explosive volcanoes, and (ii) to provide new insights on the potential of space techniques to monitor active volcanic deformations on such edifices. Lascar is one of the most active volcanoes in Central Andes characterized by a recent cyclic activity. Additionally, it is located in favourable conditions for radar imaging. Lascar thus offers very good conditions for studying large to small scale ground deformations associated with volcano dynamics. The analysis of InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry) time series data from the European and Japanese satellites (ERS, JERS) acquired between 1993 and 2000, encompassing three eruptive events, confirmed the absence of broad far-field deformation signal. Thus during the recent activity of Lascar we discard significant magmatic input at depth. The following approaches were used to improve the InSAR signal/noise ratio in order to detect possible local deformation. We carried out a quantitative evaluation of the potential tropospheric contribution in INSAR interferograms for the Salar de Atacama-Lascar area using radar (ASAR-ENVISAT) and spectrometer (MODIS) data. We also used an accurate aerial photogrammetric and GPS constrained DEM in our InSAR data reprocessing. We find a co-eruptive ground-deformation confined into the summit crater for the 1995 eruption. This deformation has spatial dimension of 500 by 400 in and relates to a subsidence of crater floor up to 17 mm. We interpret it as pressure or volume decrease at subsurface levels below the active crater. Our study made it possible to image a new near-field volcanic deformation confined within the summit crater of the Lascar volcano. It also demonstrates that the combination of precise photogrammetry DEM and INSAR data can significantly improve our ability to remotely sense subtle surface deformation on these explosive volcanoes. This methodology might contribute to better understand volcano dynamics and to complement their monitoring in remote areas. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sixteen landscape metrics were evaluated with respect to the effects of spatial aggregation oil six different years of Landsat data for a deforested area in Rondonia, Brazil. Spatial aggregation was performed by two methods. The first method involved varying the window size in texture mean co-occurrence filtering prior to classification. The second method involved aggregating the data post-classification by resampling with a majority filter. The Landscape Shape Index (LSI) and Square Pixel (SqP) metric showed the most predictable behavior of the shape complexity metrics having strong decreases with each increase in aggregation. The Edge Density (ED) and Patch Densh, (PD) metrics showed the most predictable behavior among the edge and patch metrics, decreasing with increasing aggregation. The Mean Nearest Neighbor (MNN) metric also behaved as expected but its results were less consistent than those of ED and PD. Many of the remaining metrics gave inconsistent and unpredictable results with respect to spatial aggregation. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Northern landcover mapping for climate change and carbon modeling requires greater detail than what is available from coarse resolution data. Mapping landcover with medium resolution data from Landsat presents challenges due to differences in time and space between scene acquisitions required for full coverage. These differences cause landcover signatures to vary due to haze, solar geometry and phenology, among other factors. One way to circumvent this problem is to have an image interpreter classify each scene independently, however, this is not an optimal solution in the north due to a lack of spatially extensive reference data and resources required to label scenes individually. Another possible approach is to stabilize signatures in space and time so that they may be extracted from one scene and extended to others, thereby reducing the amount of reference data and user input required for mapping large areas. A radiometric normalization approach was developed that exploits the high temporal frequency with which coarse resolution data are acquired and the high spatial frequency of medium resolution data. The Current paper compares this rachometric correction methodology with an established absolute calibration methodology for signature extension for landcover classification and explores factors that affect extension performance to recommend how and when signature extension can be applied. Overall, the new normalization method produced better extension and classification results than absolute calibration. Results also showed that extension performance was affected more by geographical distance than by differences in anniversary dates between acquisitions for the range of data examined. Geographical distance in the north-south direction leads to poorer extension performance than distance in the east-west direction due in part to differences in vegetation composition assigned the same class label in the latitudinal direction. While extension performance was somewhat variable and in some cases did not produce a best classification result by itself. it provided an initial best guess of landcover that can subsequently be refined by an expert image interpreter.

AB This research investigates the utility of passive microwave remote sensing instruments to accurately determine snow water equivalent (SWE) over large spatial extents. Three existing Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) snow water equivalent algorithms produced by Chang, Tait and Goodison were evaluated for their ability to determine snow water equivalent in a snowpack containing substantial depth hoar, large faceted snow crystals. The Kuparuk River Watershed (8140 km(2)) test site on the North Slope of Alaska was chosen for its snowpack containing a think depth hoar layer and long history of ground truth data. A new regional snow water equivalent algorithm was developed to determine if it could produce better results than the existing algorithms in an area known to contain significant depth hoar. The four algorithms were tested to see how well they could determine snow water equivalent: (1) on a per pixel basis, (2) across swath-averaged spatial bands of approximately 850 km(2), and (3) on a watershed scale. The algorithms were evaluated to see if they captured the annual spatial distribution in snow water equivalent over the watershed. Results show that the algorithms developed by Chang and from this research are generally within 3 cm of the spatially averaged snow water equivalents over the entire watershed. The algorithms produced by Chang, Tait, and in this research were able to predict the basin-wide ground measured snow water equivalent value within a percent error range from -32.4% to 24.4% in the years with a typical snowpack. None of the algorithms produce accurate results on a pixel-by-pixel scale, with errors ranging from -26% to 308%. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE coral reef; spatial statistics; change detection
ID SPECTRAL DISCRIMINATION; ASSOCIATION; HEALTHY; ISSUES
AB We examine the potential for a spatial operator to highlight the change in the spatial homogeneity of a coral reef over time from satellite imagery. The Getis statistic may be used to quantify the degree of spatial homogeneity or heterogeneity of a spatial data set. We test the application for sequential SPOT imagery that includes a coral reef in the Savusavu region of Fiji that underwent extensive damage due to an industrial accident between the image dates. The ability of the statistic to capture this damage is evaluated through comparison against a null case of open water with no change. A decadal time sequence of SPOT imagery for the Bunaken region of North Sulawesi is also examined to determine whether the statistic may be useful for image understanding where there is a lack of independent knowledge of the degree of coral stress in the area.
   For the time series of data analyzed for the Bunaken region, we believe that a change in the spatial statistic applied to SPOT data represents a change in reef heterogeneity. Our premise is that heterogeneity is, at this scale, a surrogate for changes in 'reef health' with the assumption that a healthy reef illustrates heterogeneity at the scale of the statistical operator. With additional data, this change detection procedure can be used to identify potential 'hot spots' that warrant field examination for potential reef damage. This alternative to per-pixelbased approaches has the advantage that it is relatively insensitive to changes in depth, water constituents and atmospheric variability within the area of the spatial operator.

AB Automated and reliable satellite-based techniques are strongly required for volcanic ash cloud detection and tracking. In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes.
   A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 mum. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional "split-window" brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/naturat/observationaI conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered.
   The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.

AB For quantitative studies of vegetation dynamics, satellite data need to be corrected for spurious effects. In this study, we have applied several changes to an earlier advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) processing methodology (ABC3; [Remote Sens. Environ. 60 (1997) 35; J. Geophys. Res.-Atmos. 102 (1997) 29625; Can. J. Remote Sens. 23 (1997) 163]), to better represent the various physical processes causing contamination of the AVHRR measurements. These included published recent estimates of the NOAA-11 and NOAA-14 AVHRR calibration trajectories for channels I and 2; the best available estimates for the water vapour, aerosol and ozone amounts at the time of AVHRR data acquisition; an improved bidirectional reflectance algorithm that also takes into consideration surface topography; and an improved image screening algorithm for contaminated pixels. Unlike the previous study that compared the composite images to a single-date AVHRR image, we employed coincident TM images to approximate the AVHRR pixel field of view during the data acquisition. Compared to ABC3, the modified procedure ABC3V2 was found to improve the accuracy of AVHRR pixel reflectance estimates, both in the sensitivity (slope) of the regression and in r(2). The improvements were especially significant in AVHRR channel 1. In comparison with reference values derived from two full TM scenes, the corrected AVHRR surface reflectance estimates had average standard errors values of +/- 0.009 for AVHRR C1, +/- 0.019 for C2, and +/- 0.04 for NDVI; the corresponding r(2) values were 0.55, 0.80, and 0.50, respectively. The changes in ABC3V2 were not able to completely remove interannual variability for land cover types with little or no vegetation cover, which would be expected to remain stable over time, and they increased the interannual variability of mixed forest and grassland. These results are attributed to a combination of increased sensitivity to interannual dynamics on one hand, and the inability to remove all sources of noise for barren or sparsely vegetated northern land cover types on the other.

ID RECIPROCITY PRINCIPLE
AB The fundamental quantity that characterizes the reflectance property of a surface is the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), defined as the ratio of the radiance scattered by a surface into a specified direction to the unidirectional irradiance incident on a surface. Its standard definition was derived under very restrictive conditions and it has only the angles of illumination and measurement as dependent variables. Several recent papers have attempted to generalize the BRDF to include the spatial attributes of illumination and measurement in order to make it applicable to heterogeneous media. The various BRDF definitions proposed by these papers are shown to be special cases of a generalized form of the BRIDE derived herein. The spatial attributes of illumination and measurement are included as part of the nomenclature of the generalized BRDF It is also shown that the generalized BRDF obeys reciprocity when properly weighted by the areas of illumination and measurement.

AB Spaceborne Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology used in the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and spaceborne lidar such as Shuttle Laser Altimeter-02 (SLA-02) are two promising technologies for providing global scale digital elevation models (DEMs). Each type of these systems has limitations that affect the accuracy or extent of coverage. These systems are complementary in developing DEM data. In this study, surface height measured independently by SRTM and SLA-02 was cross-validated. SLA data was first verified by field observations, and examinations of individual lidar waveforms. The geolocation accuracy of the SLA height data sets was examined by checking the correlation between the SLA surface height with SRTM height at 90 in resolution, while shifting the SLA ground track within its specified horizontal errors. It was found that the heights from the two instruments were highly correlated along the SLA ground track, and shifting the positions did not improve the correlation significantly. Absolute surface heights from SRTM and SLA referenced to the same horizontal and vertical datum (World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 Ellipsoid) were compared. The effects of forest cover and surface slope on the height difference were also examined. After removing the forest effect on SRTM height, the mean height difference with SLA-02 was near zero. It can be further inferred from the standard deviation of the height differences that the absolute accuracy of SRTM height at low vegetation area is better than the SRTM mission specifications (16 in). The SRTM height bias caused by forest cover needs to be further examined using future spaceborne lidar (e.g. GLAS) data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A radiometric characterization of Space Imaging's IKONOS 4-m multispectral imagery has been performed by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funded team from NASA Stennis Space Center, the University of Arizona Remote Sensing Group (U of A RSG), and South Dakota State University (SDSU). Both intrinsic radiometry and the effects of Space Imaging processing on radiometry were investigated. Relative radiometry was examined with uniform Antarctic and Saharan sites. Absolute radiometric calibration was performed using reflectance-based vicarious calibration methods on several uniform sites imaged by IKONOS coincident with ground-based surface and atmospheric measurements. Ground-based data and the IKONOS spectral response function served as input to radiative transfer codes to generate a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance estimate. Calibration coefficients derived from each vicarious calibration were combined to generate an IKONOS radiometric gain coefficient for each multispectral band assuming a linear response over the full dynamic range of the instrument. These calibration coefficients were made available to Space Imaging, which subsequently adopted them by updating its initial set of calibration coefficients. IKONOS imagery procured through the NASA Scientific Data Purchase was processed with or without a Modulation Transfer Function Compensation (MTFC) kernel. The radiometric effects of this kernel on various scene types were also investigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Image classification typically utilizes single-date imagery and does not take into account seasonal variation in the spectral characteristics and separability of image spectra. While global vegetation classifications have relied on seasonal changes in multitemporal data, seasonal vegetation dynamics have seldom been explored at higher spatial and spectral resolutions. In particular, investigations of vegetation phenology in the hyperspectral domain have been limited. This paper uses endmember average root mean square error (EAR), a method for selecting endmembers for multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), to explore temporal changes in the spectral characteristics of the selected endmembers. The images modeled by these endmembers demonstrate temporal changes in the confusion between vegetation species in southern California chaparral.
   Endmembers were selected from five Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images of the area surrounding Santa Barbara, CA, USA. The selected endmembers demonstrated spectral changes that were consistent with an increase in nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) as soil water balance decreased. Polygon level modeling accuracies for soil water surplus images ranged between 59% and 90%, while accuracies for soil water deficit images ranged between 52% and 81%. Variation in NPV content in the water deficit images resulted in increased confusion between chaparral species. Increasing the number of endmembers used to model each land cover class significantly increased accuracy in the water deficit images. Seasonal variations in the spectral response of chaparral are important for determining the separability of chaparral species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A project on monitoring urban CO2 budgets has been conducted since the year 2000 focusing on the Metropolitan area of Copenhagen, Denmark. Methodologically, the project combines remote sensing with CO2 fluxes measured by eddy covariance technique from the top of a 40-m mast located in the center of Copenhagen. These data are supplemented by flux measurements from a mobile system on a 10-m mast which is moved between different urban types, including a major entrance road, and residential and industrial areas. By comparing the time series of vertical CO2 exchange and the number of cars on the major entrance roads, it is demonstrated that the traffic intensity has a major impact on the urban carbon budget. The spatial distribution of the CO2 emission rates is examined through texture-based classification of Landsat-TM satellite images. Local traffic intensity and local heating is seen as a function of specific local urban land use and activities, and the corresponding satellite image texture is used as a proxy for the CO2 emission from these components. The urban scene is divided into urban land use classes that constitute homogenous areas in terms of main types of activity and these are linked to specific levels Of CO2 emission. For this purpose, a multi-scale approach based on co-occurrence matrices has been developed and applied.
   The paper outlines how the CO2 exchange from the urban sources and sinks can be estimated from continuous flux measurements in central Copenhagen. It is shown that traffic is the largest single CO2 source in the city. The mobile measurements demonstrate that the emission rates ranges from less than 0.8 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in the residential areas up to a maximum of 16 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) along the major entrance roads in the city center.
   An average annual CO2 exchange rate of 35 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1) is calculated by assigning fluxes to each land use type and excluding the effect of remote sources (power plants, air and sea traffic). This value can be compared to a carbon budget recently calculated from national statistics showing that the local urban sources (road traffic, industry, service and household) have a comparable net emission rate of 38 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1).
   The perspective of having more precise knowledge of the distribution of sources and sinks is finally discussed in relation to changing land use patterns. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two different configurations of a shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) are derived from the MODIS near- and shortwave infrared data. A large absorption by leaf water occurs in the shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) and the reflectance from plants thereby is negatively related to leaf water content. Two configurations of a water stress index, SIWSI(6,2) and SIWSI(5,2) are derived on a daily basis from the MODIS satellite data using the information from the near infrared (NIR) channel 2 (841-876 nm) and the shortwave infrared channel 5 (1230-1250 nm) or 6 (1628-1652 nm), respectively, which are wavelength bands at which leaf water content influence the radiometric response. The indices are compared to in situ top layer soil moisture measurements from the semiarid Senegal 2001 and 2002, serving as an indicator of canopy water content. The year 2001 rainfall in the region was slightly below average and the results show a strong correlation between SIWSI and soil moisture. The SIWSI(6,2) performs slightly better than the SIWSI(5,2) (r(2) = 0.87 and 0.79). The fieldwork in 2002 did not verify the results found in 2001. However, year 2002 was an extremely dry year and the vegetation cover apparently was too sparse to provide information on the canopy water content. To test the robustness of the SIWSI findings in 2001, soil moisture has been modelled from daily rainfall data at 10 sites in the central and northern part of Senegal. The correlations between SIWSI and simulated soil moisture are generally high with a median r(2) = 0.72 for both configurations of the SIWSI. It is therefore suggested that the combined information from the MODIS near- and shortwave infrared wavelengths is useful as an indicator of canopy water stress in the semiarid Sahelian environment.

AB The lack of continuous soil moisture fields at large spatial scales, based on observations, has hampered hydrologists from understanding its role in weather and climate. The most readily available observations from which a surface wetness state could be derived is the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) observations at 10.65 GHz. This paper describes the first attempt to map daily soil moisture from space over an extended period of time. Methods to adjust for diurnal changes associated with this temporal variability and how to mosaic these orbits are presented. The algorithm for deriving soil moisture and temperature from TMI observations is based on a physical model of microwave emission from a layered soil-vegetation-atmosphere medium. An iterative, least-squares minimization method, which uses dual polarization observations at 10.65 GHz, is employed in the retrieval algorithm. Soil moisture estimates were compared with ground measurements over the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) in Oklahoma and the Little River Watershed, Georgia. The soil moisture experiment in Oklahoma was conducted in July 1999 and Little River in June 2000. During both the experiments, the region was dry at the onset of the experiment, and experienced moderate rainfall during the course of the experiment. The regions experienced a quick dry-down before the end of the experiment. The estimated soil moisture compared well with the ground observations for these experiments (standard error of 2.5%). The TMI-estimated soil moisture during 6-22 July over Southern U.S. was analyzed and found to be consistent with the observed meteorological conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Research was conducted in a forest adjacent to an abandoned acid mine tailings site to assess forest structural health using high spatial and spectral resolution digital camera imagery. Conventional approaches to this problem involve the use image spectral information, basic spectral transformations, or occasionally spatial transformations of image brightness. This research introduces fractional textures and semivariance analysis of image fractions. They were integrated with conventional image measures in stepwise multiple regression modelling of forest structure, (canopy and crown closure, stem density, tree height, crown size) and health (a visual stress index). The goal was to conduct a relative comparison of the potential of the various image variable types in modelling of forest structure and health. Analysis was conducted for both canopy (crowns and shadows) and individual tree crown sample data sets extracted from 10 nm bandwidth spectral bands at three resolutions (0.25, 0.5, 1.0. m). Spatial transformations (texture, sernivariogram range) of image brightness (DN) and image fractions (IF) were consistently the most significant and first entered variables in the best models of the forest parameters. At the canopy-scale, despite a limited number of available plots (6), stable models were produced that demonstrated the potential for spatially transformed variables. Semivariogram range explained 88% of the total variation of 9 of the 18 models and represented 56% of the variables used in all models while texture variables explained 51% of model variance in 8 of the 18 models and represented 40% of the variables used. At the tree crown scale (n = 31), 88% of the total variation of six of eight models was explained by texture variables and 6% by sernivariogram variables. DN and IF variables that were not spatially transformed contributed little to the models at both scales. They represented 4% and 6%, respectively, of the variables used in all models. Spatial information in image fractions and image brightness has proven to be more significant than spectral information in these analyses. Of the spatial resolutions evaluated, 0.5 in consistently produced similar or better models than those using the 0.25 or 1.0 m resolutions. These results demonstrate the potential for integration of spatial transforms of image fractions and raw brightness in high-resolution modelling of forest structure and health.

AB Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum Flugge.) plants were grown in silica sand and irrigated daily with one of five levels of Zn (0, 0.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg l(-1)) to determine the effects of the heavy metal on the growth and development of plant canopies. Healthy and stressed plants were measured with two hyperspectral imagers, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS), and laser-induced fluorescence imaging (LIFI) systems in order to determine if the four handheld remote sensing instruments were equally capable of detecting plant stress and measuring canopy chlorophyll levels in bahia grass. Symptoms of bahia grass plants grown at deficient (0 mg l(-1)) or toxic (25, 50, or 100 ing l(-1)) concentrations of Zn were dominated by leaf chlorosis and plant stunting. Leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, CO2 assimilation, total chlorophyll, and leaf thickness followed (+) quadratic models in which control plants (0.5 mg l(-1) Zn) exhibited higher responses than plants grown at either deficient or toxic levels of Zn. Normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI=(NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)] and ratio vegetation index [RVI=R-750/R-700, in which R denotes reflectance] values were calculated for calibrated digital images from both hyperspectral imagers. The NDVI and RVI values from both hyperspectral imagers were fit best by (+) quadratic models when treatments were constrained between Wand 100 ing l(-1) Zn, but were fit best by linear regression models with ( -) slopes when treatments were constrained between 0.5 and 100 ing l(-1) Zn. Furthermore, both NDVI and RVI algorithms were effective in predicting the concentrations of chlorophyll in canopies of bahia grass grown at the various levels of Zn. In contrast, red/far-red (R/FR) fluorescence ratios estimated from leaf fluorescence values measured with the LIFS and LIFI instruments were fit best by ( -) quadratic models when treatments were constrained between 0 and 100 mg l(-1) Zn, but were fit best by linear regression models with (+) slopes when treatments were constrained between 0.5 and 100 mg l(-1) Zn. A series of regression analyses were conducted among plant biometric, biochemical, and leaf anatomical parameters (treated as independent variables) and the remote sensing algorithms, NDVI, RVI, blue/green (BL/GR), and R/FR (treated as dependant variables). In general, residuals were significantly higher for NDVI and RVI models compared to the BL/GR and R/FR models indicating that the NDVI and RVI algorithms were able to measure total chlorophyll and plant biomass more accurately than the BL/GR and R/FR algorithms. However, unique capabilities of LIFS and LIFI instruments continue to argue for the development of laser-induced fluorescence remote sensing technologies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor is providing a series of products of unparalleled quality and sophistication for the observation and biophysical monitoring of the terrestrial environment. The capabilities of the MODIS sensor of NASA's Terra and Aqua platforms, in observing the terrestrial environment, are a precursor to the operational capabilities of the National Polar Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) series of missions, which will succeed the current polar operational capabilities of the NOAA series of satellites. Prior to NPOESS, the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) will be launched, acting as a bridge between the two MODIS instruments and the longer term advanced operational capability. The result of these missions will be the establishment of long-term systematic, operational capabilities. Notwithstanding the improvements arising from these missions, there are many lessons to be learnt from current experiences in using MODIS data. Moreover, the timing of the implementation of these missions will provide challenges to users. Additionally, agencies must anticipate a rapid evolution of requirements associated with burgeoning terrestrial programs such as Global Observations of Forest Cover/Global Observations of Landcover Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD) and Terrestrial Carbon Observations (TCO).

AB This article presents albedo measurements of snow and glacier ice at Vatnajokull (Iceland) and the Kangerlussuaq transect (Greenland). Radiative fluxes were measured in the broadband and in four narrowbands, namely, Thematic Mapper (TM) Bands 2 and 4, and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Bands 1 and 2. The incoming fluxes were measured near the ground and the outgoing fluxes from a helicopter. Extracts of the data collected over snow, ice, supraglacial moraines, supraglacial lakes, and tundra are discussed. Using the data sets from Iceland and Greenland, and data sets with entirely ground-based albedo measurements from the Morteratschgletscher (Switzerland) and Scharffenbergbotnen (Antarctica), new equations for narrowband-to-broadband (NTB) conversion were developed. They have a residual standard deviation of 0.011 for TM and 0.008 for AVHRR and can be applied without having to classify the surface. The helicopter data are also used to develop criteria for distinguishing different types of surfaces, which are needed for tine application of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs). Snow can be distinguished from ice by defining a threshold for a single narrowband albedo. The ratio of the albedos in TM4 and TM2, and to a lesser extent. the ratio of the albedos in AVHRR2 and AVHRR1, may serve as a proxy for the surface characteristics of glacier ice in terms of concentrations of water, debris, and dust.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between microwave backscatter signatures and rice canopy growth variables, as well as to provide definitive insight into the interaction between backscatter and vegetation based on a comprehensive data set collected under the unique crop conditions of paddy rice (background is water surface). Our unique data consisted of daily microwave backscattering coefficients at all combinations of five frequencies (Ka, Ku, X, C, and L), all polarizations (HH, VH, HV, and VV), and four incident angles (25degrees 35degrees, 45degrees, and 55degrees) for the entire rice crop period, from before transplantation until postharvest cultivation. A wide range of plant variables, such as leaf area index (LAI), and biomass of the whole plant and plant parts were measured periodically throughout the season. Analyses based on statistical correlation and a simple backscatter process model (the water cloud model) showed that LAI was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the C-band, while fresh biomass was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the L-band. Contrarily, the higher frequency bands (Ka, Ku, and X) were poorly correlated with LAI and biomass. Interestingly, the weight of heads (ultimately the grain yield) was highly correlated with the backscattering coefficient of the Ka- and Ku-bands, while the others were poorly correlated. The simple scattering process model may be applicable for C- and L-bands in rice canopies, while it may not be suitable for Ka- and Ku-bands. In the model, LAI was a better canopy descriptor for the C-band, while total fresh biomass was a better canopy descriptor for the L-band. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing estimates of vegetation nitrogen (N) and lignin concentration are central to assess ecosystem processes such as growth and decomposition. Although remote sensing techniques have been proven useful to assess N and lignin contents in continuous green canopies, more studies are needed to address their capabilities, particularly in low and sparsely vegetated ecosystems. We investigated the possibility of estimating canopy N and lignin concentrations in chaparral vegetation using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance acquired over an area around Point Dume in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Two approaches were tested: multiple stepwise regression based on first difference reflectance (FDR) and reflectance (R) indices. Multiple stepwise regressions (of three or fewer wavelengths) accounted for a large variance in canopy biochemical concentration (r(2) similar to 0.9, P<0.01). Log transformed R indices [log (1/R)] formulated on the basis of previously known N and lignin absorption wavelengths also showed significant correlations (P < 0.01) with canopy biochemical concentration (r(2) ranging from 0.39 to 0.48). In addition, the contribution of structural and biochemical signals and background effects on the performance of these indices was evaluated. These indices accounted for a increased variance when adding information on canopy structural attributes (e.g., relative contribution of each species and biomass amount) to foliar biochemical concentration. The relative contributions of foliar biochemical concentration and canopy structure (biomass amount) on the spectral signal were further evaluated by analyzing the residuals from linear regressions: foliar N concentration accounted for 42% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1510-nm N absorption feature, while the foliar lignin concentration accounted for 44% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1754 nm lignin absorption feature. These percentages increased to 58% when stands with senescing vegetation were disregarded. We propose the two indices, Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI = [log (1/R-1510) - log (1/R-1680)]/[log (1/R-1510) + log (1/R-1680)]) and Normalized Difference Lignin Index (NDLI = [log (1/R-1754) - log (1/R-1680)]/[log (1/R-1754) + log (1/R-1680)]) as indices to assess N and lignin in native shrub vegetation.

AB This paper describes a method of integrating remotely sensed data with an ecosystem model to estimate net primary productivity (NPP) in East Asia. We improved the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model for global NPP estimation by incorporating a new land cover map and employed a robust Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-Leaf Area Index (NDVI-LAI) algorithm. Using this method, we produced a map showing the distribution of annual NPP in East Asia in 1998 and calculated that the mean NPP for that area in that year was 634 g C/m(2)/year. Comparing the estimated NPP obtained from model computation with the observed NPP obtained from an NPP database, we found that the estimated NPP closely approximates the observed NPP, with an average error of - 20%. We checked the accuracy of a six-biome land cover map using a Geographic Information System (GIS) data set for Japan [Data Sets for GIS on the Natural Environment, Japan (DS_GIS_NEJ), Japan Environment Agency, Ver. 2, 1999] and how the accuracy of the map affects NPP estimation. Results show that an accurate land cover map is essential if one is to accurately and reliably estimate NPP, and it is especially crucial if one is to estimate the NPP of an individual biome (e.g., for crop prediction).

ID CALIBRATION
AB A continuing series of field campaigns to Lunar Lake, Nevada, has been established to develop measurement protocols and assess the uncertainties of ground-based calibrations of on-orbit satellite sensors. In June 1997, an ensemble of field radiometers was deployed to validate the fundamental reflectance and radiance measurements of the Land Satellite (Landsat-5) Thematic Mapper (TM) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-2) Haute Resolution Visible (HRV) satellite instruments. Prior their deployment to Lunar Lake, many of the field instruments measured a common sphere source at the University of Arizona (UA). The results, presented in this work, showed variations in the relative stabilities of the field instruments, and demonstrate the need for in-depth characterization of field instruments for an accurate assessment of instrument performance and measurement uncertainty.

AB Monitoring landcover and landcover change at regional and global scales often requires Landsat data to identify and map landscape features and patterns with sufficient detail. Analytical methods based on image-by-image interpretation are too time-consuming and labor-intensive for studies of large areas to be undertaken with any degree of frequency. One potential solution is to develop algorithms or classifiers that can be generalized beyond the arena of the initial training to new images from different spatial, temporal or sensor domains. Building upon earlier success with a generalized classifier to monitor forest change, we now address the question of generalization for classifications of stable landcovers. We evaluate the ability of a supervised neural network, Fuzzy ARTMAP, to identify conifer forest across time and space with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for a region in northwest Oregon. We also assess the effects of atmospheric corrections on generalized classification accuracies. Using midsummer images atmospherically corrected with a simple dark-object-subtraction (DOS) method, there is no statistically significant loss of accuracy as the classification is extended from the initial training image to other images from the same scene (path and row): temporal generalization is successful. Extending the classifier across space and time to nearby scenes results in a mean decline of 8-13% accuracy depending on the atmospheric correction used. Obvious sources of error, such as seasonality solar angle variation, and complexity of landcover identification, do not explain the decline in error. Additionally, the patterns in generalization accuracies are complex, and the relationship between pairs of training and testing images is not necessarily reciprocal, i.e., good training data are not necessarily good testing data. Simple DOS atmospheric corrections produce classifications with comparable accuracies as classifications from the more complex radiative transfer corrections. These findings are based on over 200 classifications. A high degree of variability in the classification accuracies underscores the importance of extensive, in-depth analysis of remote sensing techniques and applications, and highlights the potential problem for misleading results based on just a few tests. Generalization is well suited for multitemporal classifications of one Landsat scene. Using simple DOS and midsummer images, generalization offers the opportunity for frequent landcover mapping of a Landsat scene without having to retrain the classifier for each time period of interest. However, at this point, the utility of regional landcover mapping with a generalized classifier remains limited. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. Alt rights reserved.

AB A two-flow radiative transfer model is used to study the sensitivity of spectral reflectance to variations of solid suspended matter (SSM) concentration with depth. Examples are given of the variations of reflectance spectra with depth profiles of SSM. We developed an inversion method for the model restricted to the simple case of a two-layer ocean. The method was tested on various documented experimental data. A majority of stratified cases were detected by the method. Reasonably good estimates of the mean sediment concentration of the upper layer were obtained. Only the order of magnitude of the thickness of the upper layer and the mean concentration of the lower layer were recovered. The influence of chlorophyll (CHL) concentration profile on reflectance spectra was found to be weak for such high SSM concentrations. Our inverse algorithm, of low computational cost, could be envisaged in a remote-sensing perspective provided complementary studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The vertical distribution of light transmittance was derived from field and laser altimeter observations taken in the same canopies of five forests of several ages (young to mature) and canopy types (eastern broadleaved and western tall conifer). Vertical transmittances were derived remotely from the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery (SLICER) laser altimeter and in the field from measurements of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) made within the canopy using quantum sensors suspended from the gondola of a tower crane or atop small balloons. Derived numerical characteristics of mean transmittance profiles (the rate of attenuation, whole canopy transmittance, and the radiation-effective height) were similar for both methods across the sites. Measures of the variance and skewness of transmittance also showed similar patterns far corresponding heights between methods. The two methods exhibited greater correspondence in the eastern stands than in the western ones; differences in the interaction between canopy organization and the sensor characteristics between the stand types might explain this. The narrower, more isolated crowns of the western stands permit a deeper penetration into the canopy of nadir-directed laser light than of direct solar radiation from typical elevation angles. Transects of light transmittance in two stands demonstrate that the SLICER sensor can capture meaningful functional variation. Additionally, for one stand with numerous overlapping transects we constructed a three-dimensional View of the transmittance field. Using geostatistics, we demonstrated that the spatial covariance measured in the horizontal plane varied as a function of height. These results suggest a means to remotely assess an important functional characteristic of vegetation, providing a capacity for process-based ecological studies at large scales.

AB When a multikernel modelling approach is being applied to remotely sensed data, a new criteria - least variance of white-sky albedo selects semiempirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) kernel combinations better than the more conventional least-squares fitting criteria. The BRDF describes the scattering of light from surface as a function of illumination and view geometry. Semiempirical kernels are nonlinear geometric functions derived from a simplification of physical models of scattering. These are combined linearly to fit observed bidirectional reflectance measurements. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is the integral of directional reflectance for all viewing and illumination directions and is a true surface property. The variance of retrieved white-sky albedo is a function of the noises of measurement, the specific viewing and illumination geometry of the surface scattering measurements, and the number of observations used in the inversion. By selecting the kernel combination that provides the least variance of white-sky albedo, our studies show that a more stable estimate of white-sky and black-sky (directional-hemispherical) albedo is produced.

AB The MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator was developed for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) projects. ASTER and MODIS are both spaceborne imaging instruments on the Tel-ra platform launched in the fall of 1999. Currently MASTER is flown on the Department of Energy (DOE) King Air Beachcraft B200 aircraft and the NASA DC-8. In older to validate the in-flight performance of the instrument, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona conducted a joint experiment in December 1998. The experiment involved overflights of the MASTER instrument at two sites at three elevations (2000, 4000, and 6000 m). The two sites: Ivanpah Playa, California, and Lake Mead, Nevada, were selected to validate the visible-shortwave infrared and thermal infrared (TIR) channels, respectively. At Ivanpah Playa, a spectrometer was used to determine the surface reflectance and a sun photometer used to obtain the optical depth. At Lake Mead contact and radiometric surface lake temperatures were measured by buoy-mounted thermistors and self-calibrating radiometers, respectively. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity were obtained by launching an atmospheric sounding balloon. The measured surface radiances were then propagated to the at-sensor radiance using radiative transfer models driven by the local atmospheric data. There was excellent agreement between the predicted radiance at sensor and the measured radiance at sensor at all three altitudes. The percent difference between the channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere in the visible-shortwave infrared was typically 1-5% and the percent difference between the TIR channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere was typically less than 0.5%. These results indicate the MASTER instrument should provide a well-calibrated instrument for Earth Science Studies. It should prove particularly valuable for those studies that leverage information across the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to the TIR. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A linear mixture model based on calibrated, atmospherically corrected Probe-1 hyperspectral imagery was compared with three vegetation indices to test its relative ability to measure small differences in percent green vegetative cover for areas of sparse vegetation in arid environments. The goal of this research was tp compare multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing approaches for detecting human disturbances of arid environments. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was tested using both narrow and broad band-widths. Broadband NDVI provided results (r(2) = 0.63) similar to NDVI derived from individual hyperspectral channels (r(2) = 0.60). While the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was designed as an improvement to NDVI for sparse vegetation, in this study SAVI performed significantly worse than NDVI (r(2) = 0.51). The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) provided an insignificant improvement overt NDVI (r(2) = 0.64). Linear mixture modeling provided significantly better results, r(2) of 0.74. Cross-validation was used to test the significance of differences between the various methods and to determine the standard error associated with each method. Results suggest that any improvements provided by adjusted vegetation indices over NDVI may be strongly dependent on those adjustments being derived from local conditions. The use of a linear mixture model with multiple soil endmembers appears to provide the best method for quantifying sparse vegetative cover. Though present in small amounts, a single plant species, Krameria erecta, was strongly correlated with residuals of the mixture model. Inclusion of a spectral endmember for this species increased the r(2) of the fit with percent green cover to 0.86. However, it is not clear if the explained variation was actually due to K. erecta or a correlated phenomena. Problems were also identified with the use of multiple vegetation endmembers.

AB The forest reflectance model by Nilson and Peterson has been extensively modified. Leaf optics model PROSPECT2, atmosphere radiative transfer model 6S, and homogenous canopy reflectance model MCRM have been incorporated into the model. The new model works in the spectral region 400-2500 nm with the same set of input parameters. Any Sun and view directions are allowed. Sample calculations are compared to published data on the old black spruce stand of the BOREAS Southern Study Area. The new model is able to adequately simulate both the reflectance spectrum and angular distribution. The determination of the whole set of input parameters of the model is a difficult practical problem. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

ID SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; VEGETATION COVER; MICROWAVE; CIRCULATION
AB Soil water content is an important component that influences meso- and microscale processes. The agricultural capacity of a site is directly affected by soil water content and it is especially important in a-id regions. In temperate and humid regions, soil water content is important in determining flood risks. Environmentally, soil water content will influence the risk of carrying pollutants through the soil. For these reasons, a scatterometer was developed as a remote sensor for mapping soil water content. The scatterometer is frequency modulated ruing a continuous wave. This scatterometer operates at nadir with a wide antenna diagram of 10 degrees. Measurements were conducted in two environment with different implications. The first was in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster nr-ea and the second in the Negev desert. Results show? a good correlation between soil water content and the amplitude of the re turned signal measured by the scatterometer. Thus, the scatterometer provides art efficient tool for mapping soil water content. The long wavelength (P-band) of lambda=68 cm makes this scatterometer more sensitive to soil teeter content and less affected by surface roughness than scatterometers operating at shorter wavelengths.

We introduce the subject by distinguishing between absolute and relative calibration, briefly discussing the use of scene and sensor models, and describing five calibration desiderata. We then briefly describe the different types of existing methods, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages, making the distinction between: preflight, onboard, and vicarious calibration. The different types of radiometric calibration: absolute, multitemporal, interband, and intersensor are mentioned with their related constraints. Finally, recommendations are made on how to improve these methods so that the scientific community may obtain remote-sensing data of the highest quality. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB A scanning lidar, a relatively one type of sensor which explicitly measures canopy height, was used to measure structure of conifer forests in the Pacific Northwest. SLICER (Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery), an airborne pulsed laser developed by NASA which scans a swath of five 10-m diameter footprints along the aircraft's flightpath, captures the power of the reflected laser pulse as a function of height from the top of thr: canopy to the ground. Ground measurements of forest stand structure were collected oz 26 plots with coincident SLICER data. Height, basal area, total biomass, and leaf biomass as estimated from field data could be predicted from SLICER-derived metrics with r(2) values of 0.95, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.84, respectively. These relationships were strong zip to a height of 52 m, basal area of 132 m(2)/ha and total biomass of 1300 Mg/ha. In light of these strong relationships, large-footprint, airborne scanning lidar shows promise for characterizing stand structure for management and research purposes.

AB Boreal and subarctic plant phenaphases are advantageous indicators of climatic change on a global scale. Remote sensing is a promising technique for assessing such changes oz;er extended areas. An automated field measuring system collected seasonal reflectances of natural shrubs in visible, near-, and mid-infrared wavelength ranges. A boom mounted four-band spectroradiometer teas installed on a 4-m-high tower to measure seasonal radiances in green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm), near-infrared (765-900 nm), and mid-infrared (1570-1730 nln! spectral bands from undisturbed subarctic shrub vegetation during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons (mid-June to mid-September) in northernmost Finland (69 degrees 45'N, 27 degrees 00'E, 105 m above sea level). The radiometer was vertically looking dozen on four fixed ground plots and a weatherproof reference panel continuously during all the daylight hours. The reflectance factor calculations, using the reference panel and solarimeter readings, included corrections for the reference panel degradation and non-Lambertian characteristics. Daily averages of visible and near-infrared band reflectance factors offered smooth seasonal ti-ends in spite of the variation in solar irradiance at the times of data collection. The turning point dates in the trends of seasonal near-infrared (765-900 nm) and red (630-690 nm) reflectance factors might indicate the end of growth and the beginning of autumn changes, respectively. The normalised difference vegetation index and ratio of green (520-600 2nzj to red (630-690 nm) band reflectance factors, however, seemed to be more accurate in monitoring them.

AB We developed a technique to improve spectral mixture analysis of snow-covered area in alpine regions through the use of multiple snow endmembers. Snow reflectance in near-infrared wavelengths is sensitive to snow grain size while in visible wavelengths it is relatively insensitive. Snow-covered alpine regions often exhibit large surface grain size gradients due to changes in aspect and elevation. The sensitivity of snow spectral reflectance to grain size translates these grain size gradients into spectral nature of snow must be accounted for by use of multiple snow endmembers of varying grain size. We performed numerical simulations to demonstrate the sensitivity of mixture analysis to grain size for a range of sizes and snow fractions. From Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected over Mammoth Mountain CA on 5 April 1994, a suite of snow image endmembers spanning the imaged region's grain size range were extracted. Mixture models with fixed vegetation, rock, and shade were applied with each snow endmember. For each pixel, the snow fraction estimated by the model with least mixing error (RMS) was chosen to produce an optimal map of subpixel snow-covered area. Results were verified with a high spatial resolution aerial photograph demonstrating equivalent accuracy. Analysis of fraction under/overflow and residuals confirmed mixture analysis sensitivity to grain size gradients. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

AB in this article we analyse the anisotropy of the reflected radiation field over the melting glacier ice using 118 ground-based radiance measurements in Landsat TM Bands 2 and 4. The measurements were carried out on the tongue of the Morteratschgletscher, Switzerland. On the basis of directional measurement several bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) were derived for dirty and clean glacier ice and for solar zenith angles between 46 degrees and 60 degrees. The anisotropic reflectance factor ranges between 0.70 and 1.60 for TM 2 and between 0.56 and 1.72 for TM 4. The BRDFs exhibit nadir darkening and maximum brightening near the forward limb. Dirty and wet ice reflect more anisotropically than clean ice. We give an example to illustrate the effect of anisotropic reflectance on the TM-derived albedo along a cross-section of the glacier. For solar zenith angles around 48 degrees and in the nadir viewing direction we found differences of 0.05 (in TM 2) and 0.08 (in TM 4) between the albedo (a) and birectional reflectance (r). the differences prove to be more or less uniform for both clean ice and dirty ice. It is therefore suggested that once can convert r to a without having to classify the glacier surface. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Canopy radiative transfer models simulate the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of vegetation covers with differing leaf and soil spectral and canopy structural characteristics. Numerical inversion of these models has provided estimates of vegetation structural and biophysical characteristics from multiangle, remotely sensed optical data. The number of angularly unique observations compared to BRDF model parameters largely determines the accuracy of retrievals. To increase this ratio, additional observations of a target must be acquired and the BRDF models and inversions must be simplified. The former will occur when the EOS instruments become available. Previous studies suggest that simplification of BRDF model inversions may best be accomplished by constraining the leaf optical parameters. This study focused on full-range (400-2500 nm) leaf and litter spectral properties convolved to ASHRR, MODIS, and MISR optical channels. Using a diverse array of woody plant and grass species, we found robust and readily usable interrelationships among spectra through correlation, regression and principal components analyses. Significant differences between green leaf and litter optical properties and their sensor specific interrelationships indicate that green leaf optical constraints may be useful with BRDF retrievals to detect the onset of canopy senescence. These findings will provide increased efficiency in canopy BRDF model inversions by decreasing the number of observations required to retrieve canopy structural and biophysical information from multiangle remotely sensed data.

ID SAHEL
AB Recently processed radar images from the two flights of the space shuttle Endeavour by the spaceborne imaging radar-C/X-band synthetic aperture radar instrument in 1994 give a clear view of widely distributed sediments of a palaeolake in today's hyperarid eastern Sahara (NW Sudan). Although a few of the sites of lacustrine sediments were previously examined in the field, their extent now visible on the images yields a new perspective on the Early- to Mid-Holocene wet phase that affected northern Africa. Freshwater wetlands across an area exceeding 15,000 km(2) existed between 8800 and 4500 B.P. owing to a significant increase in rainfall. The phenomenon called the West Nubian Lake constitutes the largest-scale hydrographic evidence in the eastern Sahara for a northward shift of the tropical min belt. Given that the region now receives less than 15 mm of precipitation per year on average, the former open water body and its vegetated catchment may have acted as a modifier of the regional climate. In connection with the detection of a buried major palaeodrainage system near Kufra (SE Libya), the West Nubian Lake confirms the new multifrequency and multipolarization radar imaging as a powerful tool for the reconstruction of arid land palaeohydrology.

ID SATELLITE; SURFACE
AB Nightime ''city light'' footprints derived from DMSP/ OLS satellite images were merged with census data and a digital soils map in a continental-scale test of a remote sensing and geographic information system methodology for approximating the extent of built-up land and its potential impact on soil resources in the United States. Using image processing techniques and census data, we generated maps where the ''city lights'' class represented mean population densities of 947 persons km(-2) and 392 housing units km(-2), areas clearly not available to agriculture. By our analysis, such ''city lights'' representing urban areas accounted for 2.7% of the surface area in the United States, an area approximately equal to the State of Minnesota or one half the size of California. Using the UN/FAO Fertility Capability Classification System to rank soils, results for the United States show that development appears to be following soil resources, with the better agricultural soils being the most unbanized. Some unique soil types appear to be on the verge of being entirely coopted by ''urban sprawl.'' Urban area figures derived from the DMSP/OLS imagery compare well to those derived from statistical sources. Further testing and refinement of the methodology remain but the technique shows promise for possible extension to global evaluations of urbanization, population and even global productivity.

AB We invert a bidirectional reflectance model with NOAA AVHRR data collected over a mired grassland during the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE). Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf optical properties are accurately retrieved in one-parameter inversions. In two-parameter inversions, the accuracy of the retrieved parameters is coupled: LAI is accurately retrieved only when leaf optical properties are accurately retrieved and vice-versa. Since inversion accuracy depends on the sampling geometries of the reflectance data, we also develop a ''derivative weighting'' scheme for the merit function. This scheme causes inversion solutions to be preferentially determined by data containing the most information about the model parameters. We show this scheme increases the gradients of the merit function such that more rapid and accurate inversions are possible. We also use derivative weights to select the most promising data subsets for inversion. This study confirms the operational potential of model inversions with inexpensive, widely available satellite data. Moreover, our methods can. be used with future remote sensing systems such as EOS MODIS, MISR, and POLDER. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB The objectives of this study were to test the usefulness of various spectral channel combinations of AVHRR multitemporal composites for deriving land cover information in northern environments, and to assess the effect of AVHRR spatial resolution on the classification accuracy. A sequence of operations was carried out to remove radiometric distortions from AVHRR composites (1 km pixel sire) prepared for the landmass of Canada using multidate NOAA-11 data for the 1993 growing season: atmospheric corrections for AVHRR Channels 1, 2, and 4; identification and replacement of cloud-contaminated pixels; bidirectional reflectance corrections of Channels 1 and 2; and principal component (PC) calculations to retain significant Independent PC channels. Input principal components were classified using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, and accuracies were assessed through a comparison to 30 m Landsat TM pixels at five different sites in three biomes. We found that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the most effective single spectral dimension to derive land cover types, but other channels (especially 1 and 2) were needed to obtain highest accuracies. Overall, classification accuracies for the 30 m pixels were between 45% and 60%. Mixes of land cover classes within AVHRR pixels were the principal reason for the low accuracies. When considering only AVHRR pixels with one dominant band cover type, the accuracy increased up to 80% or more in proportion to the mixed types retained. The accuracy also increased when a dispersed class (mixed forest) was combined with the more ubiquitous coniferous forest class. The intrinsic AVHRR resolution and the compositing process are the major factors influencing the impact of mixed cover types on the classification accuracy. The impact of these factors is discussed and strategies for optimizing the use of multitemporal AVHRR data in land cover classification are suggested.

AB Satellite radar altimeter measurements have shown spn tial and temporal variations in the backscattered signal from desert surfaces. In order to understand these variations we have carried out extensive in situ measurements for the validation of a compilation of existing backscatter models. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with ground- and satellite-based measurements of the radar backscatter coefficient, and show that the altimeter backscatter measurements are strongly affected by variations in soil moisture following rainfall and by the presence of dew On the surface. Regional, but time-invariant, differences in backscatter are attributed to variations in surface topography.

AB Aerosol scatters solar radiation before it reaches the surface and scatters and absorbs it again after it is reflected from the surface and before it reaches the satellite sensor. The effect is spectrally and spatially dependent. Therefore, atmospheric aerosol (dust, smoke, and air pollution particles) has a significant effect on remote sensing. Correction for the aerosol effect on remote sensing of land areas was never achieved on an operational basis though several case studies were demonstrated. We distinguish between direct correction, in which the aerosol loading is derived from the image itself (or supplied from external sources) followed by correction of the image using an appropriate radiative transfer model, and indirect correction, achieved by defining remote sensing functions that are less dependent on the aerosol loading. To some degree this was already achieved in global remote sensing of vegetation where a composite of several days of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements, choosing the maximal value, was used instead of a single cloud-screened value. The atmospheric resistant vegetation index (ARVI) introduced recently for the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the most appropriate example of indirect correction, where the index is defined in such a way that the atmospheric effect in a blue spectral channel cancels to a large degree the atmospheric effect in the red channel in computations of the vegetation index. Atmospheric corrections can also use aerosol climatology or simultaneous measurements with ground-based instrumentation. These aspects of aerosol studies and remote sensing are reviewed in this article. New advances in ground-based instrumentation and future satellite systems (including measurements of polarization) are discussed. In the conclusions a strategy is introduced for a combination of ground-based measurements, with direct and indirect corrections that is implemented for the EOS-MODIS and recommended for other similar platforms. Such strategy, planned in advance, is a first step to face the challenge and take advantage of the opportunities that the remote sensing community will face with the launch of EOS and ADEOS in the next several years.

AB Seasonal changes in the greeness of vegetation, described in remotely sensed data as changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) throughout the year have been the basis for discriminating between cover types in previous attempts to derive land cover from AVHRR data at global and continental scales. Several researchers have suggested and applied the use of metrics, such as maximum NDVI or length of growing season derived from a temporal profile of 10-day or monthly NDVI values, as an alternative to classifying cover types front the monthly NDVI values directly. This study examines the use of metrics derived from the NDVI temporal profile, as well as metrics derived from observations in red, infrared, and thermal bands, to improve discrimination between 12 cover types on a global scale. According to separability measures calculated front Bhattacharya distances, average separabilities improved by using 12 of the 16 metrics tested (1.97) compared to separabilities using 12 monthly NDVI values alone (1.88). Separabilities improved from poor to good in 20 out of 25 pairs of cover types with poor separability. Percentage of pixels correctly classified in a maximum likelihood classifications also improved by using the metrics from 76% to 86%. Overall, the most robust metrics for discriminating between cover types were: mean NDVI, maximum NDVI, NDVI amplitude, AVHRR Band 2 (near-infrared reflectance) and Band 1 (red reflectance) corresponding to the time of maximum NDVI, and maximum land surface temperature. Deciduous and evergreen vegetation can be distinguished by mean NDVI, maximum NDVI, NDVI amplitude, and maximum land surface temperature. Needleleaf and broadleaf vegetation can be distinguished by either mean NDVI and NDVI amplitude or maximum NDVI and NDVI amplitude.

ID AVHRR DATA; FOREST COVER; VEGETATION; FIFE
AB We present a technique for extracting subpixel cover type reflectances from the mired pixels of a coarse spatial resolution image, A Gaussian filter is used to spatially degrade a set of fine spatial resolution images [based on, e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)], each of which represent the spatial structure and extent of a land-cover type. From the degraded image data, a set of weights representing the proportions of cover types within the mixed pixels of a coarse spatial/fine temporal resolution image [e.g., NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)] is produced. These weights and the AVHRR spectral band reflectances are used in multiple linear regression analyses to extract mean cover type reflectances. A simulation study was conducted to define the operational limitations of this technique. Cover type reflectances are accurately estimated if the cover types are spatially well represented within the area of interest, are spectrally distinct, and have small within-class spectral variability. The accuracy of retrieved reflectances is most sensitive to errors in the coarse spatial resolution data and least sensitive to errors in the weights, By applying this technique to multiple images, temporal profiles of subpixel cover type reflectance may be obtained. This particular application is demonstrated by using TM and AVHRR data from the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) to create normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal profiles of the dominant land-cover types.

ID PRAIRIE
AB Ground Investigations of rangeland use and condition are restricted by resource and travel limitations. Management of these vast, multiuser resources could be enhanced by information from remote sensing. Microwave radar imagery is becoming readily available and its all weather capability provides greater reliability than visible-infrared (VIR) sensors. The objective of this study was to evaluate a combination of radar and visible-infrared sensors as tools in rangeland monitoring. Data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT VIR sensors were compared with data from airborne and ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to determine similarities and contrasts with a view to exploiting any synergism. The study site was the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada One four Research Substation in southeastern Alberta. The TM and SPOT VIR sensor bands were highly correlated. The radar sensors were correlated with each other to a lesser degree. Correlations between VIR and radar were not high. Vegetation type influenced VIR reflectance and radar backscatter. Russian wildrye pastures had high radar backscatter as well as high VIR reflectance. Native range had low VIR reflectance and low radar backscatter. Crested wheatgrass pastures had low VIR reflectance and high radar backscatter. Other features, such as exposed sedimentary Cretaceous softrock, had high values for both sensor groups, while intermittent water bodies or shallow depressions characterized by high clay content and strong microtopography had high radar backscatter but low VIR reflectance. More information can be obtained from the combination of both types of sensor than from either alone.

AB Calculations using a heat balance and a radiative transfer model have been done to study relations among evaporation coefficients and vegetation indices. The evaporation coefficients are the crop coefficient (defined as the ratio of total evaporation and reference crop evaporation) and the transpiration coefficient (defined as the ratio of unstressed transpiration and reference crop evaporation), while the vegetation indices considered in this study are the normalized difference, soil adjusted vegetation index, and transformed soil adjusted vegetation index. The reference crop evaporation has been calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation. The observed variations of crop (wheat) height, leaf area index, and weather conditions for 30 days at Phoenix (Arizona), together with the reflectances of different types of soil in wet and dry states, are used in the simulation. The total evaporation calculated from the model compared well with lysimeter observations. Variations in soil evaporation can introduce considerable scatter in the relation between the crop coefficient and leaf area index, while this scatter is much less for the relation between transpiration coefficient and leaf area index. The simulation results for 30 days of crop and weather data and reflectances of 19 soil types in wet and dry conditions gave significant linear correlations between the transpiration coefficient and the vegetation indices, the explained variance (r2) being highest for the soil adjusted vegetation index (r2 = 0.88) and lowest for the normalized difference (r2 = 0.81). A clump vegetation model is used to address the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the relationship between the transpiration coefficient and soil adjusted vegetation index. These simulated relationships between transpiration coefficient and vegetation indices for wheat are discussed in the context of the relationships derived from observations for several crops and grasses. The present analysis provides a theoretical basis for estimating, transpiration from remotely sensed data.

TI A PARAMETRIC APPROACH FOR THE GEOCODING OF AIRBORNE VISIBLE INFRARED
   IMAGING SPECTROMETER (AVIRIS) DATA IN RUGGED TERRAIN
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A geocoding procedure for remotely sensed data of airborne systems in rugged terrain is affected by several factors:  buffeting of the aircraft by turbulence, variations in ground speed, changes in altitude, attitude variations, and surface topography.  The current investigation was carried from Central Switzerland, using two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) scenes out of NASA's Multi Aircraft Campaign (MAC) in Europe (1991).  The first scene was acquired over flat and hilly terrain and the second over a mountainous area with steep slopes.  The parametric approach reconstructs for every pixel the observation geometry based on the flight line, aircraft attitude, and surface topography.  Aircraft navigation data, instrument engineering data, information from a conical radar tracking system, and a digital elevation model are used.  To prevent changes to the radiometric characteristics, the original value is selected by an improved extraction algorithm, thereby eliminating the need to interpolate the values.  The results are visually checked for correspondence at locations with different slope and aspect angles by overlaying scanned forest maps and digitized shorelines of the Swiss Topographical Map.  This validation is completed by a quantization of the spatial deviation at selected points and a comparison with an improved nonparametric approach.  In general, the results show very good correspondence with the maps.  The algorithm reported in this article is a necessary base to apply georadiometric correction methods for slope-aspect-dependent illumination corrections, atmospheric corrections, and to use AVIRIS data within single-pixel based information systems for land use classification.

ID BUDGET
AB Monitoring freeze-thaw cycles of high latitude terrestrial ecosystems is useful for estimating the length of the growing season and annual productivity in the tundra and in boreal forests, for estimating potential damage to living plants due to frost drought, and for evaluating major changes in heat fluxes between land and atmosphere. At microwave frequencies, freezing results in a dramatic decrease of the dielectric constant of soil and vegetation, which significantly alters their radar scattering properties. In this article, we investigate the possibility of monitoring freeze-thaw cycles of terrestrial ecosystems using C-band frequency (5.3 GHz), vertical transmit and receive polarization, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data gathered by the European Space Agency's Earth Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1). Repeat-pass SAR images are mosaicked together along a north-south transect across Alaska, coregistered, and analyzed using a change detection algorithm that determines when the landscape freezes based on a decrease in radar backscatter greater than 3 dB relative to a known thawed, wet state of the landscape. Air-temperature recordings from seven airport weather stations and in situ observations from three monitored forest stands in interior Alaska concur to indicate SAR accurately maps frozen areas across the entire state. The technique does not apply to open water areas because calm water and frozen water are confused. Elsewhere, ERS-1 SAR could monitor thaw/freeze transitions of terrestrial ecosystems at the regional scale, at a spatial resolution of several tens of meters and independent of cloud cover and vegetation type.

AB Native and atrazine-induced fluorescence of chloroplasts from palisade and spongy parenchyma of european beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) leaves are investigated by high-resolution laser-scanning microscopic imaging.and 3D-image processing software. The effects of light as environmental factor for leaf morphology (sunny and shade leaves) and atrazine as a D1-protein receptor blocker of the chloroplast-thylakoid antenna protein complex on chlorophyll fluorescence are studied by successive z-scans (depth scan). Significant differences in chlorophyll fluorescence intensities of sunny and shade leaves are observed. The diffuse and nondiffuse chlorophyll fluorescence of sunny leaf are higher than those of the shade leaf at each z-depth. Strong fluorescence of grana stacks from palisade parenchyma chloroplast due to atrazine treatment indicates a high number of D1 protein binding sites at the grana stacks of palisade parenchyma chloroplast at each z-depth. It seems that a shutterlike arrangement of D1-D2-Cytochrome b559-CP43-CP47 complexes exists, and apparently it regulates the light absorption, photosynthetic quantum conversion, and the fluorescence and protects the PSII antenna structures from thermal disturbances. As compared to chlorophyll fluorescence at atrazine bound sites, the generation of native chlorophyll fluorescence is suggested to take place at other than D1-associated chlorophyll protein complexes.

AB We assessed the ability of AVHRR/NDVI data to record intrabiome variability of phenological and structural characteristics of three dominant vegetation communities in the intermountain northwest. Seasonal NDVI signatures were developed from biweekly composite data for two grass and one shrub community within a sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. The signatures were found statistically separable (p = 0.01) among all three communities in three of 19 composite periods, and between shrub and grass in 15 of 19. Integrated NDVI provided the greatest differentiation among the communities due to ordinal consistency of the three signatures throughout the growing season. A supervised classification of adjacent regions with contrasting topography and substrate was tested for accuracy, and results indicate a strong potential for AVHRR applications to community-level vegetation differentiation. Classification errors are primarily caused by subpixel scale topographic and soil background variations that may not be correctable for coarse resolution imagery.

AB The Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) is a test-bed for future spacecraft sensors such as the High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometers planned for the Earth Observing System. To use this sensor for ocean applications, S/N was increased by spatial averaging of images. Post-flight recalibration was accomplished by measuring in situ the water-leaving radiance at flight time, modeling its transmission to the aircraft, and adding modeled atmospheric radiance to that value. The preflight calibration curve was then adjusted until aircraft and modeled total radiance values matched. Water-leaving radiance values from the recalibrated AVIRIS imagery were consistent with in situ data supporting the validity of the approach. Imagery of the absorption coefficient at 415 nm and backscattering coefficient at 671 nm were used to depict the dissolved and particulate constituents of the Tampa Bay plume during late, ebb-tidal conditions.

AB We introduce a technique to aid in interpreting infrared satellite images of the North Atlantic Ocean Gulf Stream region. Present interpretive methods are largely manual, require significant effort, and are highly dependent on the interpreter's skill. Our quasiautomated technique is based on mathematical morphology, specifically the image transformations of opening and closing, which are defined in terms of erosion and dilation. The implementation performs successive openings and closings at increasing thresholds until a stable division into objects and background is found. This method finds the North Wall of the Gulf Stream in approixmately the same place as human analysts and another automated procedure, and does less smoothing of small irregularities than the other two methods. The North Wall is continuous and sharp except where obscured by clouds. Performance in locating warm-core eddies is also comparable to the other methods. However, the present procedure does not find cold-core rings well. We are presently investigating ways to reduce the effects of clouds and delete the unwanted water areas found by the method. We expect to be able to improve the cold-core eddy performance.

DT Article
ID SOLAR-RADIATION
AB A model of radiative transfer in regular-clumped canopies is presented. The canopy is approximated by an array of porous cylinders located at the vertices of equilateral triangles. The model is split into two submodels, each describing a different level of structure: 1) The macrostructure submodel is based on Brown and Pandolfo (1969), who applied geometrical optics theory to an array of opaque cylinders. This model is adapted for porous cylinders and is used to derive expressions for directional interception efficiency as a function of height, radius, spacing and porosity of the cylinders. 2) The microstructure submodel makes use of the average canopy transmittance theory, applied to a cylinder, to compute the porosity of the clumps as a function of the leaf area density, the leaf inclination distribution function, the dimensions of the cylinder (height and radius), and the transmittance of green leaves in the appropriate spectral band. It is shown that, in the case of erectophile plant stands, the daily porosity of the cylinder can be approximated by the porosity calculated using the extinction coefficient of diffuse radiation. Directional interception efficiency, geometric conditions (incidence/viewing), and landscape component reflectances are used to compute hemispherical (interception, absorption, and reflectance) and directional (reflectance) radiative fluxes from simple analytical formulae. This model is validated against a data set of biological, radiative (PAR region) and radiometric (SPOT channels) measurements, collected in Niger on pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides). The model fits the data quite well in terms of hourly and daily single-band or combined (NDVI) radiative fluxes. Close correspondence to measured fluxes, using few parameters, and the possibility of inversion makes the present model a valuable tool for the study of radiative transfer in discontinuous canopies.

AB A radiative transfer model for a vegetation canopy is used to compute several quantities used in remote sensing applications and to determine the sensitivity of these radiometric quantities to several of the important problem parameters. In particular, the following quantities are considered: 1) the ratio of near IR (700-1100 nm) to visible (600-690 nm) reflected intensities in the nadir direction, 2) the ratio of the fraction of incident energy reflected in the near IR to that in the visible (ratio of canopy hemispheric reflectances), 3) the normalized difference between the near IR and visible nadir reflected intensities, 4) the visible intensity transmitted in a given downward direction, and 5) the visible energy incident on the soil surface. A realistic radiative transfer model is proposed for calculating these radiometric quantities. Also simple approximate models are derived for the radiation transmitted through the canopy. With these models, the sensitivity of the reflected and transmitted quantities to various canopy and illumination conditions are then determined. Specifically, the effects of 1) sun angle, 2) the ratio of the diffuse-to-direct incident radiation, 3) the leaf-normal distribution for the canopy, 4) the scattering properties of the leaves, and 5) the soil albedo are considered. The sensitivity of the calculated quantities are presented as a function of the leaf area index of the canopy, and, for the reflected quantities, also as a function of the fraction of visible light absorbed in the canopy.

AB Solutions of the radiative transfer equation are used to derive relationships of water reflectance to the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K) in moderately turbid water (K > 0.5 m-1). Data sets collected from the NOAA AVHRR and in situ observations from five different dates confirm the appropriateness of these relationships, in particular the logistic equation. Values of K calculated from the reflectance data agree to within 60 % of the observed values, although the reflectance derived using a more comprehensive aerosol correction is sensitive to chlorophyll concentrations greater than 50-mu-g L-1. Agreement between in situ and remote observations improves as the time interval between samples is narrowed.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID RADAR POLARIMETRY; AREAS
AB A technique for separating classes of surface roughness and vegetation in semiarid  regions using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Thematic Mapper (TM) data has been developed.  We conclude that polarimetric SAR data may be used to separate areas with < 10% vegetation cover where one suite of model inversions may be applicable for derivation of surface roughness.  In more vegetated regions, visible/near-infrared (NIR) data will provide a mechanism for determining the relative contribution of vegetation to multiple scattering in the SAR data.  Thus, the synergistic use of the two data sets provides a more complete characterization of surface units and cover.  This result, while important for geologic interpretations, is even more critical when trying to monitor dielectric constant variations related to changes in moisture content of soil and vegetation cover in arid to semiarid regions.  A strategy for automating a procedure for measurement of surface roughness is proposed.

   ERUPTIONS
AB A study of volcanic activity and its effects on the atmosphere is one of 28 interdisciplinary investigations for the Earth Observing System (EOS), due to be launched in 1997 and 1999.  The volcanology investigation will include long- and short-term monitoring of selected volcanoes, the detection of precursory activity associated with unanticipated eruptions, and the detailed study of on-going eruptions.  The data collected will allow us to address two aspects of volcanism:  volcanic landforms and the atmospheric effects of eruptions.  A variety of instruments on the two NASA EOS platforms, together with supplemental data from the Japanese and European platforms, will enable the study of local- to regional-scale thermal and deformational features of volcanoes, and the chemical and structural features of volcanic eruption plumes and aerosols.  This investigation fits well within the overall goal of the EOS Project, which is to study the regional and global interrelationships between components of the Earth System, because it specifically investigates the links between volcanism, atmospheric chemistry and short-term (1 - 3 year) climate change.

DT Article
ID MICROWAVE
AB Radar backscatter measurements of wheat were made during two closely spaced nights:  one with dew and the other without.  Concurrent plant and soil moisture data were also obtained.  The ability to detect the dew event was investigated for various radar frequencies, polarizations, incidence angles, and row orientations.  The best detection of dew against the background of changing internal plant moisture or soil moisture was found with C band, HH polarization, incidence angles of 20-degrees or less, and view direction parallel to the wheat rows.

AB Accurate simulations of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of snow-covered forests are crucial for retrieving snow and canopy properties, which affects the analysis of net radiation, radiative forcing, and climate change. The anisotropic reflectance of snow in conifer forests is greatly influenced by the high reflectance of snow and the complex travel pathways of radiation in 3D canopy structures, which complicates BRDF simulations. Although bidirectional reflection models have been widely established for snow-free forests, few studies have attempted to simulate the BRDF in snow-covered forests. Therefore, we propose a new snow-covered forest bidirectional reflectance (SFBR) model by coupling geometric optical and radiative transfer models, which includes a snow anisotropic reflectance model (ART), needle leaf optical properties model (LIBERTY), canopy radiative transfer model (4SAIL), and geometric optical model (GOST2). The SFBR model mainly focuses on conifer forests with snow backgrounds; it can simulate anisotropic reflectance spectra from 400 nm to 2500 nm and is the only model to fully consider discontinuous canopy distribution, topographic effects, and snow anisotropy. The SFBR model was validated by simulating the reflectance over snow-covered forests, the results of which showed good consistency with simulations of 3D scene model and remote sensing observations. The proposed SFBR model has the potential to quantify radiation interactions between the snow background and forest overstory, evaluate the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to snow and forest properties, and retrieve snow-covered forest parameters from satellite-observed reflectance data.

AB We present Interferometric Synthetic Aperture data spanning a series of precipitation events that impacted the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula in 2017-2018. The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a "dry" date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower. However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude. This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture. In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series. We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation. For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is reduced by 40%. We present results for synthetic time series, including a demonstration of the widely-observed phenomenon that displacement rates inferred from InSAR time series depend on the choice of interferometric pairs used in the analysis.

AB There is a lack of understanding of the complex spatiotemporal patterns of heat exposure during heat waves, and the impact of urbanization intensity and urban morphology on heat exposure in urban thermal environments. To address these issues, this study used mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) as an index to indicate human exposure to extreme heat, and generated hourly heat exposure maps at a 1-m spatial resolution in Summer 2020 for heat wave and non-heat wave days across three diversely urbanized and climatically different U.S. cities (Riverside, CA; Des Moines, IA; and Boston, MA) using the SOlar LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model and multi-source remote sensing and GIS data. Based on these high-frequency and microscale maps, we found that heat exposure in urban canyons of downtown areas was high due to relatively low building's height to street's width (H/W) ratio, which resulted in a limited shading effect in the studied cities. Heat exposure during heat waves was enhanced by 6 degrees C to 10 degrees C compared to non-heat wave conditions, with the main differences occurring in the early afternoon between 12 pm and 2 pm. We found that hot cities (Riverside, 63 degrees C) had higher heat exposure than warm cities (Des Moines and Boston, 53 degrees C and 51 degrees C) during heat waves. Heat exposure in urban core areas was approximately 5C higher than that in rural areas during heat waves. Additionally, we found that sky view factor was the most important urban morphology factor influencing heat exposure, with a relative importance of over 67% in these cities, but the role of impervious surface and trees varied among these cities. Impervious surface area (ISA) contributed more to heat exposure than trees in dry and hot regions (Riverside), but not in humid and warm cities (Des Moines and Boston). This study is the first to generate hourly heat exposure maps at a 1-m resolution for heat wave and non-heat wave days, and to investigate spatiotemporal patterns and the impacts of urbanization intensity and urban morphology on heat exposure in multiple cities. The findings of this study can be useful in developing urban policies to improve urban thermal environments in diverse urban settings, and our transferable framework can potentially be applied to other cities for heat exposure studies.

AB Contemporary research on Greenland surface mass balance (SMB) is largely focused on the characteristics of decadal or longer trends, periodic oscillations, and acceleration. However, the specific components of the SMB such as snowfall (SF), rainfall (RF) and runoff (RU), and their corresponding temporal and spatial variability remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the respective contributions of SF, RF, and RU to the seasonal and transient crustal deformations of Greenland during the past two decades using GPS network and satellite gravimetry (GRACE) datasets, and regional climate model output. Our study unraveled that the largest annual vertical displacement caused by precipitations is in southeastern Greenland, reaching 7.27 mm. The largest surface displacement caused by RU is in western Greenland, reaching 19.82 mm. Ice mass gain/loss in Greenland shows a clear correlation between latitude and temperature, with greater variations in the south compared to the north. The transient deformation signals in Greenland mainly manifested in terms of abrupt subsidence in 2010, followed by uplift in 2014. The 2014 uplift can mainly be attributable to the combined effect of SF, RF, and RU. The largest transient signal occurs in the southeast subregions, with peak-to-peak amplitude exceeding 10 mm. Transient crustal deformation is mainly caused by precipitation in southeastern Greenland, while the contribution of RU dominates most of the time and in most subregions. We find that even though RF is increasing due to an increasingly warmer climate, its effect on SMB is still negligible, when compared with SF and RU. In some subregions and some periods, SF could become the primary contributor to transient SMB variations in Greenland.

AB Mangrove forests, a critical component of blue carbon ecosystems, make a significant contribution to mitigating climate change and maintaining biodiversity. But in China, they have been suffering from severe invasion by Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). Accurate information on spatial distribution of mangroves and S. alterniflora is a prerequisite to protecting indigenous mangrove ecosystems and managing S. alterniflora invasion. However, the classification performance is often constrained by two major issues: (1) A single-date image, regardless of acquisition time, hardly provides optimal spectral separability among evergreen mangroves, deciduous S. alterniflora and mudflats; (2) Due to the gradual invasion process, the mixtures between land cover classes are prevalent in moderate-resolution images. The use of high-resolution (finer than 2 m) image time series could effectively solve these two issues. However, due to frequent cloud cover in coastal areas and long revisit time of high-resolution satellite sensors, the collection of high-resolution image time series is still a great challenge, let alone substantial expenses. In this study, we proposed a new multi-temporal classification approach to fine-scale mapping of exotic S. alterniflora and native mangroves using synthetic high-resolution image time series derived from spatiotemporal fusion of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 data. A total of six synthetic WorldView-2-like images in different phenological periods were produced by the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method. With the combination of the original and synthetic images, both types of image-based multi-temporal features and pixel-based image compositing features were extracted and evaluated in the following Random Forest classifications. Monte Carlo cross-validation was adopted to provide robust accuracy estimates, and a spatially explicit confidence map was generated to show classification uncertainty and potential errors. In order to further demonstrate the necessity of generating synthetic WorldView-2 images, the entire classification process was repeated using Sentinel-2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and the comparison between fine-and moderate resolution classification results was made in terms of classification accuracies, classification maps and fractional abundances. Our results show that the spectral profiles of S. alterniflora and mangroves generated from the synthetic WorldView-2 images were consistent with the ones from the paired Sentinel-2 images. Meanwhile, the spatial details of high landscape heterogeneity, unrecognizable in the Sentinel-2 images, were revealed by the synthetic WorldView-2 images. Compared to the single-date classification with the original WorldView-2 image, most of multi-temporal classifications using both the original and synthetic images provided more accurate results, with the overall accuracy raised by up to 3.9%. Among various temporal features adopted in this study, the use of the image-based, stacked spectral reflectance and vegetation index features of all original and synthetic images produced the best classification performance, increasing the producer's and user's accuracies of mangroves, S. alterniflora and mudflats by 2.5%-7.1%. Finally, the Sentinel-2 classification accuracies were generally lower than the WorldView-2 counterparts across all temporal features, with a 6% difference in the highest overall accuracy between the two. Prediction errors of the moderate-resolution classification were often found in heterogeneous landscapes, where S.
   alterniflora was mixed with mangroves or mudflats. Considering the availability of moderate-resolution data with high revisit frequencies, such as Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat 8/9, future fine scale mapping exercises might benefit from the multi-temporal classification approach with spatiotemporal fusion of moderate-and high-resolution data, alleviating the problem of the scarcity of high-resolution data in cloudy areas.

AB The unprecedented availability of spaceborne hyperspectral data has great potential to provide fire severity estimates that align with post-fire management needs, overcoming complex logistics and data acquisition costs of airborne hyperspectral sensors, and the suboptimal sensitivity of broadband data to several post-fire ground components. We analyzed the feasibility of the PRISMA mission -one of the first spaceborne spectrometers operationally active- to assess fire severity by leveraging hyperspectral data dimensionality through the retrieval of sub-pixel components directly related to fire severity in the field. Multispectral data provided by Sentinel-2, commonly used in fire severity quantitative assessments, were used as a benchmark method. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to retrieve fractional cover of char, photosynthetic vegetation (PV), as well as non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) from post-fire PRISMA Level 2D and Sentinel-2 Level 2A scenes in one of the largest wildfires ever recorded in the western Mediterranean Basin. Ground-truth data were obtained using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) to procure three field-measured severity metrics: vegetation, soil and site. The relationship between the CBI data on a continuum scale and the cover of char, PV and NPVS image fractions retrieved from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 was assessed through Random Forest regression (RFR). Likewise, Ordinal Forests (OF) algorithm was used to classify categorized CBI data (low, moderate and high fire severity). PRISMA-based RFR fire severity estimates at vegetation, soil and site levels (R2 = 0.64-0.79 and RMSE = 0.33-0.41) outperformed those of Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.27-0.53 and RMSE = 0.54-0.60), and were in line with previous studies using airborne hyperspectral sensors at higher spatial resolution. Fire severity underestimation for high field CBI values was almost unnoticeable in the PRISMA estimates. Categorical fire severity, not currently estimated using hyperspectral data but with high interest in post-fire management, were accurately predicted by PRISMA-based OF classification, with consistent user's and producer's accuracy for each fire severity category. The high confusion between moderate and low/high fire severity categories, typical when unmixing broadband multispectral data, was overcome by the PRISMA-based classification scheme. Our results suggest that new spaceborne spectrometer missions can support reliable fire severity assessments equivalent to airborne spectrometers, but readily applicable to large-scale assessments of extreme wildfire events.

AB Accurate understanding of the variability in foliar physiological traits across landscapes is critical to improve parameterization and evaluation of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) that seek to represent the response of terrestrial ecosystems to a changing climate. Numerous studies suggest imaging spectroscopy can characterize foliar biochemical and morphological traits at the canopy scale, but there is only limited evidence for retrieving canopy photosynthetic capacity (e.g., maximum carboxylation rate, Vc,max and maximum electron transport rate, Jmax). Moreover, the effect of canopy structure within forest communities on scaling up spectra-trait relationships from leaf to canopy level is not well known. To advance the spectra-trait approach and enable the estimation of key traits using remote sensing, we collected imaging spectroscopy data from an Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) platform over two forest sites in China (a subtropical forest in Mt. Dinghu and a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna). At these sites, we also collected ground measurements of leaf spectra and traits, including biochemical (leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll, and water content), morphological (leaf mass per area, LMA) and physiological (Vc,max25 and Jmax25) traits (n = 135 tree-crowns from 42 species across two sites). Using a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) approach, we built and tested spectra-trait models with repeated cross-validation. The spectral models developed with leaf spectra were directly transferred to canopy spectra to evaluate the effect of canopy structure. We further applied canopy spectral models to map these traits at indi-vidual tree-crown scale. The results demonstrate that (1) UAS-based canopy spectra can be used to estimate Vc, max (R2 = 0.55, nRMSE = 11.79%), Jmax (R2 = 0.54, nRMSE = 12.34%), and five additional foliar traits (R2 = 0.38-0.60, nRMSE = 10.11-13.56%) at the tree-crown scale with demonstrated generalizability across two sites; (2) canopy structure strongly affects the spectra-trait relationships from leaf to canopy level, but the effects vary considerably across foliar traits and cannot be well captured by the 4SAIL canopy radiative transfer model. UAS-based imaging spectroscopy maps large variability in all foliar traits (including physiological traits) with spatially explicit information, reproducing the field-observed inter-and intra-specific variations. These results demonstrate the capability of using UAS-based imaging spectroscopy for characterizing the variability of foliar physiological traits at individual tree-crown scale over forest landscapes and highlight the similar generaliz-ability but different biophysical mechanisms underlying spectra-trait relationships at leaf and canopy levels.

TI Evaluating and mitigating the impact of systematic geolocation error on
   canopy height measurement performance of GEDI
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE GEDI; Lidar; Geolocation; Canopy height
AB NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is designed to provide high-resolution measurements of forest structure and topography between 52 degrees N and S. However, current geolocation accuracy may limit further science applications of footprint-level products as early adopters have found it difficult to align with in-situ forestry inventory data and high-resolution imagery for calibration and validation purpose. Here we developed a new means to rapidly evaluate and mitigate the impact of systematic geolocation error on the performance of GEDI's forest height estimates in the US. By integrating nationwide high-resolution airborne lidar data collected through the 3D Elevation Program of the USGS, we provided optimal geolocation adjustments of GEDI at per beam level and tracked their performances over the first 18-mo. Our results suggest that the first release of GEDI product (R01) can have large systematic geolocation errors at beam level (i.e., 50.5% of beams with an error > 20 m). Its impact on canopy height measurement could drastically vary in space and time, which in turn also offers a separate indirect method to evaluate and track geolocation performance. The second release of GEDI data (R02) has achieved a much-improved systematic geolocation accuracy which is shown to meet the mission requirement (0.2% beams >20 m and 80.8% beams <10 m) and should be able to meet requirements from many practical science applications tolerant to moderate geolocation errors. In sum, our approach has provided a shortterm solution for an enhanced Cal/Val strategy for GEDI. While further improvements will certainly be made in future releases, it can potentially create an alternative pathway to generate and validate biomass products by linking GEDI footprint samples directly with in-situ data collections.

AB The TomoSense experiment was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) to support research on remote sensing of forested areas by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, with a special focus on the use of tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) to retrieve information about the vertical structure of the vegetation at different frequency bands. The illuminated scene is the temperate forest at the Eifel National Park, North-West Germany. Dominant species are beech and spruce trees. Forest height ranges roughly from 10 to 30 m, with peaks up to over 40 m. Forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) ranges from 20 to 300 Mg/ha, with peaks up to over 400 Mg/ha. SAR data include P-, L-, and C-band surveys acquired by flying up to 30 trajectories in two headings to provide tomographic imaging capabilities. L-and C-band data were acquired by simultaneously flying two aircraft to gather bistatic data along different trajectories.The SAR dataset is complemented by 3D structural canopy measurements made via terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle lidar (UAV-L) and airborne laser scanning (ALS), and in-situ forest census. This unique combination of SAR tomographic and multi-scale lidar data allows for direct comparison of canopy structural metrics across wavelength and scale, including vertical profiles of canopy wood and foliage density, and per-tree and plot-level above ground biomass (AGB). The resulting TomoSense data-set is free and openly available at ESA for any research purpose. The data-set includes ALS-derived maps of forest height and AGB, forest parameters at the level of single trees, TLS raw data, and plot-average TLS vertical profiles. The provided SAR data are coregistered, phase calibrated, and ground steered, to enable a direct implementation of any kind of interferometric or tomographic processing without having to deal with the subtleties of airborne SAR processing. Moreover, the data-base comprises SAR tomographic cubes representing forest scattering in 3D both in Radar and geographical coordinates, intended for use by non-Radar experts. For its unique features and completeness, the TomoSense data-set is intended to serve as an important basis for future research on microwave scattering from forested areas in the context of future Earth Observation missions.

AB Cloud top height (CTH) is an important factor influencing its radiative effects, weather and climate change, and spaceborne passive radiometers widely used to retrieve CTH mostly use an oversimplified single-layer cloud assumption. Nevertheless, natural clouds exhibit complex vertical inhomogeneity, such as overlapping clouds. This study investigates the potential of multispectral observations for characterizing overlapping cloud prop-erties and introduces a new CTH retrieval algorithm for overlapping CTHs. Synthetic radiative transfer simu-lations and an information content analysis are applied to demonstrate the theoretical basis of using passive radiometers for overlapping cloud property retrievals. Specifically, this method leverages the merits of four shortwave infrared (0.87, 1.6, 2.13 and 2.25 mu m) channels in distinguishing cloud optical and microphysical properties in different phases and the capabilities of longwave infrared (8.6, 11 and 12 mu m) channels for the corresponding CTHs. The method performs effectively for overlapping clouds with an optically thin but detectable ice layer (optical thickness less than similar to 7) above a liquid water layer. We consider collocated Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements to provide sufficient spectral information. Compared with conven-tional single-layer-assumed CTH retrievals, our CTHs for both upper-layer ice and lower-layer water clouds show closer agreement with those indicated by active instruments. Statistically, the average bias of the upper ice CTH results is constrained from-2.89 km to-1.36 km and we obtain lower water CTHs with an average bias of-1.21 km. The cloud properties based on our retrievals also make the simulated multichannel radiances more consistent with the observed ones. The new method will greatly improve our understanding of the vertical structures of overlapping clouds and their parameterization in general circulation models; thus, we suggest that including increased numbers of cloud-sensitive channels is necessary to better determine cloud properties.

AB Global observations of ocean color from space provide a unique capability to conduct multi-decadal studies of biogeochemical constituents and processes in the upper ocean layers at the regional, basin, and global scales. The concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean waters is one of the biogeochemically important data products derivable from satellite ocean color observations. The data record of standard global POC product is available from NASA and has been obtained from the empirical power-function relationship between POC and a single blue-to-green band ratio of ocean remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs(lambda), which is here referred to as the BR-PF algorithm. Recently, we formulated a new suite of satellite ocean-color sensor-specific global POC algorithms that are referred to as hybrid algorithms because they contain two components, one based on the maximum band-ratio (MBR) and the other on the band ratio difference index (BRDI) of reflectance (Stramski et al., 2022). The present study describes the validation analysis and provides performance assessment of hybrid algorithms for SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS-SNPP satellite ocean color sensors. For comparison, the standard global (BR-PF) algorithms and the color-index (CI) algorithm from the literature were also analyzed. The analyses were made with an in situ validation dataset containing concurrent measurements of POC and Rrs(lambda) as well as three satellite validation datasets containing data matchups of field measurements of POC and satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) from the SeaWIFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP missions. The hybrid algorithms showed an overall improvement of performance compared to other algorithms, in particular in waters with relatively high POC compared to the standard BR-PF algorithms. The aggregate bias of hybrid algorithm-derived POC is small or negligible (<10%) for the validation datasets, and a measure of median percentage difference is about 20% for the in situ validation dataset and ranges between about 20% and 30% for the satellite validation datasets. In addition, comparisons of POC retrievals from the three sensor-specific hybrid algorithms show good inter-sensor consistency. The validation results of this study indicate that hybrid algorithms have high potential to provide improved POC retrievals within a broader range of POC than the predecessor global algorithms and the capability for generating a consistent long-term POC data record from multiple satellite missions.

It explains the difference in optical properties observed on the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) sides of leaves, i.e., their dorsiventrality, with a limited number of structural parameters. The performance of ISPECT in estimating LMA is compared to that of five other leaf radiative transfer models (FASPECT, DLM, PROSPECT-D, PROSPECT-5B, and Leaf-SIP). We tested six experimental datasets with 962 leaf samples and two spectral ranges: the solar domain (0.4-2.5 mu m) and the shortwave infrared (1.7-2.4 mu m). Results show that PROSPECT-D and PROSPECT-5B accurately estimate LMA using the shortwave infrared spectra, while ISPECT and FASPECT perform well in both spectral ranges. Further analysis demonstrates that leaf dorsiventrality is likely to be an influential factor for LMA estimation: thus ISPECT can accurately estimate LMA in the solar and shortwave infrared domains, with NRMSE of 26.0% and 28.8%, respectively. This motivates further studies on LMA mapping from spaceborne imaging spectrometers (e.g., PRISMA, GaoFen-5, EnMAP) by coupling ISPECT with canopy radiative transfer models.

AB Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendrstabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 & PLUSMN; 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 & PLUSMN; 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events.

AB Vegetation structure influences landscape use and habitat quality for many bird species. Owing to the difficulties associated with collecting structural data from traditional field measurements, numerous studies have investigated the utility of Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for providing landscape-scale structural information that may be useful for exploring animal-habitat associations. Notably, almost all of these studies have involved the use of LiDAR from airborne rather than terrestrial platforms. However, vegetation metrics that might be important for explaining bird species occurrence and diversity, such as understory vegetation complexity and overall vegetation volume, may be partially obscured from airborne sensors by tree canopy cover. These challenges might be overcome by terrestrial and UAV LiDAR sensors that can provide detailed information of understory forest strata. For the first time, we collected terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) and unoccupied aerial vehicle LiDAR (ULS) data in a woodland landscape to compare the ability of both sensors to identify relationships among vegetation structural metrics and bird species richness and abundance. Overall, TLS and ULS models provided similar results based on the sampling methodology we used for LiDAR data collection in an open woodland landscape. Canopy roughness, ground vegetation vertical complexity, total vegetation volume and canopy height derived from these sensors were among the most common significant variables in explaining avian diversity and individual species abundance. Individual species abundance models provided better prediction power (up to R2 = 0.82 (TLS) and R2 = 0.83 (ULS)) than bird community abundance by functional guilds (up to R2 = 0.40 (TLS), R2 = 0.41 (ULS)) and overall bird abundance (R2 = 0.10 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)), species richness (R2 = 0.14 (TLS), R2 = 0.14 (ULS)) and diversity (R2 = 0.17 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)). Additionally, we found that several vulnerable bird species are strongly associated with LiDAR structural variables, which may assist with habitat assessment and conservation management.

AB Snow, as a fundamental reservoir of freshwater, is a crucial natural resource. Specifically, knowledge of snow density spatial and temporal variability could improve modelling of snow water equivalent, which is relevant for managing freshwater resources in context of ongoing climate change. The possibility of estimating snow density from remote sensing has great potential, considering the availability of satellite data and their ability to generate efficient monitoring systems from space.
   In this study, we present an innovative method that combines meteorological parameters, satellite data and field snow measurements to estimate thermal inertia of snow and snow density at a catchment scale. Thermal inertia represents the responsiveness of a material to variations in temperature and depends on the thermal conductivity, density and specific heat of the medium. By exploiting Landsat 8 data and meteorological modelling, we generated multitemporal thermal inertia maps in mountainous catchments in the Western European Alps (Aosta Valley, Italy), from incoming shortwave radiation, surface temperature and snow albedo. Thermal inertia was then used to develop an empirical regression model to infer snow density, demonstrating the possibility of mapping snow density from optical and thermal observations from space. The model allows for estimation of snow density with R-CV(2) and RMSECV of 0.59 and 82 kg m(-3), respectively. Thermal inertia and snow density maps are presented in terms of the evolution of snow cover throughout the hydrological season and in terms of their spatial variability in complex topography. This study could be considered a first attempt at using thermal inertia toward improved monitoring of the cryosphere. Limitations of and improvements to the proposed methods are also discussed.
   This study may also help in defining the scientific requirements for new satellite missions targeting the cryosphere. We believe that a new class of Earth Observation missions with the ability to observe the Earth's surface at high spatial and temporal resolution, with both day and night-time overpasses in both optical and thermal domain, would be beneficial for the monitoring of seasonal snowpacks around the globe.

AB Unlike deforestation, forest degradation implies a change in forest structure, with no modification in land use; thus, it is subtle and less visible than deforestation. Moreover, forest degradation is a major concern, as the potential for carbon sequestration is reduced. Degradation is related to location, anthropogenic drivers, climate, and forest types, and there is no unique detection methodology to map this phenomenon on a global scale. This study proposes a procedure for detecting degraded forests using Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral imagery in Guinea, West Africa, and demonstrates that consideration of context improves degraded forest detection. In Guinea, the primary degradation process is selective logging in the massif forest, in addition to forest fragmentation caused by land use change. Monitoring forest degradation using remote sensing methods usually requires significant overhead in terms of photo-interpretation expertise. We proposed an approach to monitoring degradation through a semi-automated classification procedure with minimum photo-interpretation costs. First, the radio-metric values of the Sentinel-2 data were explored using a photo-interpreted reference map and ground obser-vations carried out with a local forester. Many of the ground observations found that forests considered as intact in the photo-interpreted reference map were degraded. This suggests photo-interpretation can be affected when investing in a single-date image. Our results showed that radiometric moisture-related indices (canopy water content [CWC], moisture stress index [MSI]), associated with leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from S2 data, were strongly related to the degree of degradation. Second, we improved the mapping of degraded forests through photo-interpretation of S2 data. Third, classification methodologies involving LAI, MSI, and CWC were estab-lished, and the results were compared with the improved photo-interpreted map. Two types of classification were compared: standard pixel-based classification and a hybrid method of classification that took contextual infor-mation into account by including neighbour pixel values in the algorithm to consider the pixel context, similar to the photo-interpretation methods. The inclusion of neighbour pixels in the semi-automated classification process led to a substantial improvement in the results. When contextual information was included, photo-interpretation of 1.6% of the latest year's data was sufficient to reach an overall accuracy above 85% requiring no use of past reference maps. Our method strongly supports the photo-interpretation procedure for less time-consuming and expensive map production, offering a significant foundation for degraded forest delineation in regions under similar conditions of canopy opening.

AB Accurate and up-to-date maps of built-up areas are crucial to support sustainable urban development. Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source to cover this demand. In particular, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) missions offer new opportunities to map built-up areas on a global scale. Using Sentinel-2 images, recent urban mapping efforts achieved promising results by training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on available built-up data. However, these results strongly depend on the availability of local reference data for fully supervised training or assume that the application of CNNs to unseen areas (i.e. across-region generalization) produces satisfactory results. To alleviate these short-comings, it is desirable to leverage Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) algorithms that can take advantage of un-labeled data, especially because satellite data is plentiful. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) approach using SSL that jointly exploits Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI to improve across-region generalization for built-up area mapping. Specifically, two identical sub-networks are incorporated into the proposed model to perform built-up area segmentation from SAR and optical images separately. Assuming that consistent built-up area segmentation should be obtained across data modality, we design an unsupervised loss for unlabeled data that penalizes inconsistent segmentation from the two sub-networks. Therefore, we propose to use complementary data modalities as real-world perturbations for consistency regularization. For the final prediction, the model takes both data modalities into account. Experiments conducted on a test set comprised of sixty representative sites across the world showed that the proposed DA approach achieves strong improvements (F1 score 0.694) over fully supervised learning from Sentinel-1 SAR data (F1 score 0.574), Sentinel-2 MSI data (F1 score 0.580) and their input-level fusion (F1 score 0.651). To demonstrate the effectiveness of DA, we also performed a comparison with two state-of-the-art products, namely GHS-BUILT-S2 and WSF 2019, on the test set. The comparison showed that our model is capable of producing built-up area maps with comparable or even better quality than the state-of-the-art global human settlement maps. Therefore, the multi-modal DA offers great potential to be adapted to produce easily updateable human settlements maps at a global scale.

AB Anthropogenic carbon emissions directly contribute to global warming, which has induced severe environmental concerns like extreme droughts and devastating fires. To evaluate the effects of fires on carbon cycling and climate change, it is crucial to accurately estimate the amount of carbon released during fires. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission offers spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of global forests, providing excellent opportunities for monitoring forest dynamics and carbon emissions. The ICESat-2 Land and vegetation height product (ATL08), Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-1 data were integrated to estimate biomass burning emissions with a three-phase hierarchy model. In Phase 1, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish the relationship between ATL08 LiDAR metrics and reference aboveground biomass (AGB), R2 0.77 and RMSE 56.67 Mg ha-1. In Phase 2, the LASSO regression predicted AGB for all ATL08 segments. A Random Forest Regression model was trained with Landsat 8 reflectance data and derived vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 data, and terrain variables as predictors and with the LASSO predicted AGB as the response variable, R2 0.71 and RMSE 45.91 Mg ha-1. Wall-to-wall maps of pre-fire and post-fire AGB were produced with the Random Forest model. In Phase 3, the difference between the pre-fire and the post-fire AGB was converted to carbon emissions. The estimated biomass burning emissions of the 2018 Carr fire group, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2019 Walker fire in California are 3.54 (+/- 0.067) Tg C, 1.66 (+/- 0.041) Tg C, and 0.45 (+/- 0.022) Tg C, respectively. Forests have the highest biomass burning emissions with an average emission of 30.09 Mg ha-1, approximately twice and four times the average emissions from shrubs and grasses. This study highlights the merit of integrating spaceborne remote sensing data, including LiDAR data, optical data, and radar data, for estimating biomass burning emissions, opening an avenue for accurate forest biomass and carbon dynamics monitoring, as well as climate change mitigation.

AB PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution, frequent revisits, and global coverage have provided an unprecedented opportunity to advance land surface monitoring over the recent years. Similar to other optical satellites, cloud-induced data missing in PlanetScope satellites substantially hinders its use for broad applications. However, effective gap-filling in PlanetScope image time series remains challenging and is subject to whether it can 1) consistently generate high accuracy results regardless of different gap sizes, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and 2) effectively recover the missing pixels associated with rapid land cover changes. To address these challenges, we proposed an object-class based gap-filling ('OCBGF') method. Two major novelties of OCBGF include 1) adopting an object-based segmentation method in conjunction with an unsupervised classification method to help characterize the landscape heterogeneity and facilitate the search of neighboring valid pixels for gap-filling, improving its applicability regardless of the gap size; 2) employing a scenario-specific gap-filling approach that enables effective gap-filling of areas with rapid land cover change. We tested OCBGF at four sites representative of different land cover types (plantation, cropland, urban, and forest). For each site, we evaluated the performance of OCBGF on both simulated and real cloud-contaminated scenarios, and compared our results with three state-of-the-art methods, namely Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI), AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC), and Spectral-Angle-Mapper Based Spatio-Temporal Similarity (SAMSTS). Our results show that across all four sites, OCBGF consistently obtains the highest accuracy in gap-filling when applied to scenarios with various gap sizes (RMSE = 0.0065, 0.0090, 0.0092, and 0.0113 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively) and with/without rapid land cover changes (RMSE = 0.0082, 0.0112, 0.0119, and 0.0120 for OCBGF, SAMSTS, ARRC, and NSPI, respectively). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCBGF for gap-filling PlanetScope image time series, with potential to be extended to other satellites.

AB A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to estimate the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) C-band microwave normalized backscatter (ao40), slope (a ') and curvature (a '') over France. The Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) is used to produce land surface variables (LSVs) that are input to the DNN. The DNN is trained to simulate ao40, a ' and a '' from 2007 to 2016. The predictive skill of the DNN is evaluated during an independent validation period from 2017 to 2019. Normalized sensitivity coefficients (NSCs) are computed to study the sensitivity of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs as a function of time and space. Model performance yields a near-zeros bias in ao40 and a '. The domain-averaged values of rho are 0.84 and 0.85 for ao40 and a ', compared to 0.58 for a ''. The domain-averaged unbiased RMSE is 8.6% of the dynamic range for a40 o and 13% for a ', with land cover having some impact on model performance. NSC results show that the DNN-based model could reproduce the physical response of ASCAT observables to changes in LSVs. Results indicated that ao40 is sensitive to surface soil moisture and LAI and that these sensitivities vary with time, and are highly dependent on land cover type. The a ' was shown to be sensitive to LAI, but also to root zone soil moisture due to the dependence of vegetation water content on soil moisture. The DNN could potentially serve as an observation operator in data assimilation to constrain soil and vegetation water dynamics in LSMs.

AB River discharge is one of the most critical renewable water resources. Accurately estimating river discharge with land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging due to the difficulty in estimating land water storages such as snow, soil moisture, and groundwater. While data assimilation (DA) ingesting optical, microwave, and gravity measurements from space can help constrain theses storage states, its impacts on runoff and eventually river discharge are not fully understood. Here, by taking advantage of recently published land DA results that jointly assimilate eight different combinations of observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), we quantify to what degree multi-sensor land DA improves the river discharge simulation skills over 40 global river basins, and investigate the complementary strengths of different satellite measurements on river discharge. To be more specific, river discharge is updated by feeding gridded runoff from the eight multi-sensor DA simulations into a vector-based river routing model named the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID). Our modeling results, including 7-year simulations at 177,458 river reaches globally, are used to study the seasonal to interannual variability of river discharge. It is found that assimilating GRACE has the greatest impact on global runoff patterns, leading to the most pronounced improvements in spatial river discharge in the middle and high latitudes with the R2 increased by 0.16. The seasonal variation of spatial discharge is most skillful during the boreal summer. However, our evaluation also shows model and DA still struggle to generate reasonable variability and averaged discharge over permafrost regions. By assessing how different satellites add value to discharge forecasts, this study paves the way for more advanced multi-sensor satellite data assimilation to predict the terrestrial hydrological cycle.

AB This study presented an integrated SVM classification method that investigated the relationship between intrinsic scattering attributes of the surface features and the conductivity characteristics of the soil in the newly proposed two-and three-dimensional classification (2D and 3D) schema to classify the saline landscape. The study was conducted in the Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, which is composed of heterogeneous saline landforms due to the active geological processes and anthropogenic activities. The intensity products of Sentinel-1 data (VV + VH) of C-band frequency were employed in the present study. The SVM with linear kernel has outperformed the other models, namely random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), in performing the broad level of classification from the 2D classification schema (SVMOA = 84.2%, RFOA = 80.4%, k-NNOA = 78.8%, NBOA = 68.4%). The soil EC values derived from the dielectric loss measurements (R-2 = 0.79, rho = 0.018, and alpha=95%) were used to introduce the integrated SVM approach in the 3D schema to further breakdown the mapped classes into non-saline (NS) (soil EC <= 2 ds/cm), slightly saline (SS) (soil EC = 2.1 to 4 ds/cm) and moderately saline (MS) (soil EC = 4.1 to 8 ds/cm) categories. The overall performance of the integrated SVM approach implemented for the 3D classification schema (F1 = 0.80) was found to be satisfactory, but with an associated uncertainty majorly from MS (Precision = 0.52, F1 = 0.69), SS (Recall = 0.09, F1 = 0.15), and NS waterbodies (Recall = 0.18, F1 = 0.29) as shown in the Precision-Recall graph (AUCPR(3D) = 0.62). However, with the promising performance level demonstrated for the other nine classes such as NS, SS, and MS wet soil (F1 = 0.92, 0.92, 0.96), healthy plants (F1 = 0.83), salt-tolerant plants under SS and MS conditions (F1 = 0.83, 0.88), and waterlogged vegetation under NS, SS, and MS conditions (F1 = 0.82, 0.83, 0.83), the proposed classification scheme becomes an effective method to map saline and non-saline features from dual-polarimetric SAR data.

AB Water plays a crucial role in maintaining plant functionality and drives many ecophysiological processes. The distribution of water resources is in a continuous change due to global warming affecting the productivity of ecosystems around the globe, but there is a lack of non-destructive methods capable of continuous monitoring of plant and leaf water content that would help us in understanding the consequences of the redistribution of water. We studied the utilization of novel small hyperspectral sensors in the 1350-1650 nm and 2000-2450 nm spectral ranges in non-destructive estimation of leaf water content in laboratory and field conditions. We found that the sensors captured up to 96% of the variation in equivalent water thickness (EWT, g/m(2)) and up to 90% of the variation in relative water content (RWC). Further tests were done with an indoor plant (Dracaena marginate Lem.) by continuously measuring leaf spectra while drought conditions developed, which revealed detailed diurnal dynamics of leaf water content. The laboratory findings were supported by field measurements, where repeated leaf spectra measurements were in fair agreement (R-2 = 0.70) with RWC and showed similar diurnal dynamics. The estimation of leaf mass per area (LMA) using leaf spectra was investigated as a pathway to improved RWC estimation, but no significant improvement was found. We conclude that close-range hyper spectral spectroscopy can provide a novel tool for continuous measurement of leaf water content at the single leaf level and help us to better understand plant responses to varying environmental conditions.

AB SAR Interferometry (InSAR) proves to be effective for investigating landslides. However, its measurement accuracy is largely limited by the complex atmospheric delay distortion in alpine valley regions, resulting in poor performance of landslides detection and monitoring. Particularly, the spatial atmospheric heterogeneity over wide areas cannot be accurately reflected by conventional empirical phase-elevation models or external databased methods. In this study, we proposed a multi-temporal moving-window linear model (MMLM) to correct the tropospheric delay for wide-area landslides investigation. This is a linear regression model based on the elevation-phase relationship for modeling multi-temporal phases within a sliding local window. It mitigates the influence of local turbulent phase, local landslide deformation, and phase unwrapping error on parameter estimation, providing precise heterogeneous atmospheric corrections for wide-area InSAR landslide identification and monitoring. A simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the sensitivity of model parameters settings and evaluate the effectiveness of the MMLM model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the performance of the MMLM model through a comparison with the ERA5, GACOS, spatial-temporal filtering, and traditional linear model using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data over the reservoir area of the Lianghekou hydropower station. Among the above-mentioned methods, the standard deviation of original unwrapped phases achieved the largest decrease of more than 35% and 50% after correction by the MMLM model for the descending and ascending Sentinel-1 tracks, respectively. In addition, the accurate deformation corrected by the MMLM model improved the landslides investigation, not only can help for delineating landslide boundaries in space but also retrieving movement evolution in time.

AB As the availability of satellite and airborne thermal infrared remote sensing (TIR-RS) data increases and their spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions improve, researchers are finding diverse applications for TIR-RS measurements. TIR-RS is now commonly applied in regional- and continental-scale analyses, such as those focused on fire and surface energy balance. However, its application lags in plant physiology and ecology, for which a finer-scale understanding of plant canopy temperatures would be useful to elucidate plant water dynamics, for example. In particular, while methods to disaggregate TIR-RS pixels in horizontal space have advanced, possible vertical stratification of plant canopy temperature and its implications for understanding the correspondence between TIR-RS and finer-scale, field-based thermal measurements (e.g. made with a thermal camera) remain unexplored. Here, we use data from a thermal camera deployed concurrently with the recent ECOSTRESS mission to quantify vertical temperature gradients within tree canopies and temperatures of overvs. under-story plants in a Mediterranean woodland savanna. We then leverage diverse ancillary data to maximize the geometric comparability of ECOSTRESS and thermal camera measurements, in order to assess the extent to which the two forms of thermal measurements correspond. Specifically, we ask: (1) What are the patterns of intra-canopy and over- vs. under-story vertical temperature in a Mediterranean woodland savanna?, and (2) How can vertically-resolved, but spatially-limited field-based temperature measurements be reconciled with spatiallyextensive, but surface-only, temperature measurements of a space-borne remote sensor? We found consistent patterns of vertical thermal heterogeneity both within tree canopies and between ecosystem over- and understories. The daytime difference between the top and bottom thirds of blue oak canopies was, on average, 0.48 degrees C - and sometimes several times larger. Notably, canopy tops are cooler, likely associated with the understory grass reaching daytime temperatures often exceeding over-story temperatures by 10 degrees C. Given the consistency of the intra-canopy temperature gradients, we expected the ECOSTRESS sensor would be in better agreement with camera measurements of canopy tops than bulk canopies or canopy bottoms. However, withincanopy gradients were overwhelmed by other sources of disagreement between the measurements, in part associated with upscaling camera measurements across space. Overall, thermal camera and ECOSTRESS measurements were largely in agreement at night (pixel RMSE = 1.1 degrees C), but they were more divergent during times of low (but >0 W/m2) and high incoming solar radiation (daytime pixel RMSE = 3.5 degrees C).

AB Laboratory spectral libraries of well-characterized natural samples are necessary for accurate interpretation of remote sensing spectral data. Tephra deposits, the result of explosive volcanic eruptions, are potentially found on all differentiated terrestrial bodies and are important chronologic and compositional marker beds on Earth. Here we present a visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 0.35-2.5 mu m) and mid-infrared (MIR, 3.5-25 mu m) spectral library composed of nineteen natural tephra samples from ten volcanic sources that span a range of compositions and components. The bulk, glass, and mineral phase compositions of each sample are measured and spectra from multiple size fractions of each sample were collected. The library can be found via the Terrestrial Analog portal (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5066/P9O54M4Q).

AB Understanding changes in salmonid populations and their habitat is a critical issue given changing climate, their importance as a keystone species, and their cultural significance. Terrain features such as slope, gradient, and morphology, as well as forest structure attributes including canopy cover, height, and presence of on ground coarse wood, all influence the quality and quantity of salmonid habitat in forested ecosystems. The increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data for forest applications offers an opportunity to utilize these data for assessing the quality and quantity of habitat, which is often costly and difficult to characterize. ALS data provides detailed and accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) under forest canopies, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, as well as stream and terrain attributes important to salmonids. At the Nahmint watershed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, we sampled six, 200 m long stream reaches, describing a range of terrain and stream features following standard data collection protocols. Our objective in this research was to use ALS data to estimate three attributes from the 3D point cloud and DEM that are known to be important for salmonids, including bankfull width,instream wood and discrete stream morphological units. Results indicate that ALS-based estimates had strong, significant, correlations with field measured attributes (with Pearson's correlation of 0.80 and 0.81 for bankfull width and instream wood, respectively). Bankfull width was slightly underestimated using the ALS data (Bias =-1.01 m; MAD = 1.89 m; RMSD = 2.05 m) and 80% of instream wood pieces were detected. Using ALS-derived predictors in a Random Forest model, discrete stream morphological units (i.e. pools, riffles, glides, cascades) were classified with an overall accuracy of 85%, with pools having the highest user's class accuracy at 96%. Results presented herein indicate that ALS data can be used to provide a fine scale characterization of stream attributes that are required to identify salmonid habitat, providing critical information for sustainable forest management decision making, and providing a foundation for advanced salmonid habitat modeling.

AB Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing is increasingly needed to assess the 3D architecture of Earth's surface. Physically-based LiDAR radiative transfer (RT) models are essential tools for interpreting LiDAR signals, designing LiDAR systems, and validating information retrieval methods. Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate LiDAR signals of urban and natural landscapes. Its physical modeling relies on a forward Monte Carlo mode optimized by a ray-tracking technique, also called DART-RC (Ray Carlo) mode. However, DART-RC is not adapted to simulate massive LiDAR signals of large landscapes due to its constraints of high memory demand and long computational time. Therefore, we developed a novel computationally efficient LiDAR modeling method based on a new DART modeling mode called DART-Lux. It simulates LiDAR signal by adapting the bidirectional path tracing algorithm of DART-Lux to the time and power measurements and by implementing the LiDAR instrument and multiple product outputs in DART-Lux. We verified the accuracy of DART-Lux for LiDAR modeling using DART-RC as a reference for several case studies with different LiDAR configurations (i.e., single-pulse waveform, multi-pulse point cloud, multi-pulse photon counting, with and without solar signal) on realistic scenes from the RAMI experiment. Results stress that i) DART-Lux is consistent with DART-RC, for example, R-2 = 1 and rRMSE = 0.21% for the waveform of a forest simulated with a huge number of rays; ii) DART-Lux converges faster than DART-RC: its processing time is usually about half that of DART-RC, and over ten times smaller if the solar signal is simulated; iii) DART-Lux memory usage can be a hundred times less than DART-RC. Also, several sensitivity studies with various sensor configurations and solar directions illustrate the usefulness of DART-Lux for impact studies. This new DART-Lux LiDAR model opens promising perspectives for large-scale LiDAR applications with 3D modeling. It is already part of the official DART version freely available to scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

AB Forests represent the world's largest terrestrial ecosystem and their monitoring is therefore critical from scientific, ecological, and management perspectives. Present day sustainable forest management practices go beyond forest inventory and increasingly include aspects such as carbon accounting and regeneration assessments. Such monitoring requires often unavailable, spatially exhaustive and up-to-date information on forest attributes over broad areas. Recent developments in the acquisition of broad-scale forest attribute information from remotely sensed data has included the use of multiple technologies that take advantage of globally available data products to derive forest attribute layers. However, less is known about the applicability and performance of such products when used to produce broad-scale, accurate, and up-to-date forest information products. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement between two broad-scale forest canopy height products - Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) and the National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) imputed canopy height layers for Canada - across a variety of ecological gradients. Overall, the two datasets showed high correspondence, with a root-mean-square difference of 4.87 m, and 85% of ICESat-2 canopy heights falling within the 95% confidence interval of the NTEMS height estimate. Across ecozones, canopy heights in the Taiga Shield West and Boreal Shield West had stronger agreement (91% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS), while the Taiga Cordillera and Taiga Shield East had lower agreement (< 75% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS). Interestingly, we found that the modeled heights based upon optical satellite data had a less generalized distribution than heights from ICESat-2 as well as achieving a greater representation for the taller (overall and by ecozone) height classes. An increase in absolute difference between data products was also found as a function of increasing slope. Finally, the correspondence between products was evaluated across disturbed areas (35 to 10 years since disturbance) to assess the agreement of the two products in areas of regenerating forest. In general, the analysis found that burned areas, which tend to be more structurally heterogeneous, had lower agreement between products then harvested areas. The high overall correspondence between the data products demonstrate the potential for integration of ICESat-2 to inform (via calibration / validation) or update height products based upon optical satellite data.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key variable to determine soil functioning, ecosystem services, and global carbon cycles. Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350-2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0-780 g.kg(-1) across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g.kg(-1)), mineral soils (SOC <= 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g.kg(-1)), and organic soils (SOC > 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g.kg(-1)). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture <0.4 m(3).m(-3), green leaf area < 0.3 m(2).m(-2), plant residue <0.4 m(2).m(-2)) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.

AB The current study evaluates consistency among three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, namely GIMMS, MODIS and SPOT, to characterize alpine vegetation dynamics (greening and browning) across High Mountain Asia (HMA) in 2001-2015. The utility of these datasets is explored to evaluate the vegetation's variability at different spatial-temporal scales and, elevation, and to compare their spatial trends and distribution patterns. In addition to the Pearson correlation coefficients performed to quantitatively analyze the consistency and inconsistency of each dataset, an NDVI quality control (QC) layer and Landsat NDVI are also used to evaluate the findings. The results indicate that the GIMMS has the highest NDVI mean, while SPOT has the lowest. However, GIMMS also showed a browning trend for both Tianshan (TS) and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (TP) at a rate of -0.3 x 10(-3) per year, whereas MODIS and SPOT exhibit a greening trend (TSMODIS = 0.5 x 10(-3) per year, TSSPOT = 0.6 x 10(-3) per year, TPMODIS = 0.9 x 10(-3) per year, TPSPOT = 1.6 x 10(-3) per year). Furthermore, MODIS-SPOT shows the highest correlation (R-GREEN = 0.73; R-BROWN = 0.47), followed by MODIS-GIMMS, and GIMMS-SPOT. The overall, NDVI trend consistency appears to be higher in TS. Finally, the consistent greening pixels mainly distributed in central TP stretching to the northeastern part, and in western stretching to eastern TS, account for 32.14%, while 8.32% of consistent browning pixels are concentrated in southwestern TP and central TS. The inconsistent pixels account for 59.54%, with 39.21% of inconsistent greening pixels being widely distributed across HMA, and 20.58% of inconsistent browning pixels being relatively pronounced in central TS and southern TP. This study provides baseline inferences for the selection and reconstruction of data in follow-up studies on vegetation dynamics.

AB Satellite radar altimetry is widely used to measure glacier and ice sheet elevation changes, but can suffer from uncertainties related to geolocation and signal penetration. The unique capabilities of ESA's CryoSat-2 allow for accurate geolocation but impacts from signal penetration persist. This study uses surface elevations from Global Navigation Satellite System and airborne laser transects over the Austfonna ice cap, Svalbard, to measure the elevation bias of CryoSat-2 Point-of-closest-approach (POCA) and swath points, and to provide validation for dhdt estimates derived through the application of a least-squares plane-fit algorithm to these data. The mean elevation bias of swath points varies between 1 and 1.5 m of penetration, which is close to observed winter snow depths. Histograms of POCA elevation bias for the applied leading-edge retracker peak near the surface, with a distribution skewed towards the sub-surface. At the onset of surface melt, surface scattering dominates backscatter, and penetration reduces. This results in spurious peaks in derived elevation and mass change time series. In spite of this seasonal variability in elevation bias, the validation dhdt dataset demonstrates that the CryoSat-2 dhdt estimates are robust on multi-year timescales. The transition from volume to surface scattering suggests the potential to estimate yearly snowpack thickness.

AB Fire managers seek accurate methods to map fire severity for forest management efforts. Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3-7 cm spatial resolution; -11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsatderived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with startand end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, -1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment.

AB One great advantage of optical hyperspectral remote sensing from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) compared to satellite missions is the possibility to fly and collect data below clouds. The most typical scenario is flying below intermittent clouds and under turbulent conditions, which causes tilting of the platform. This study aims to advance hyperspectral imaging from UAS in most weather conditions by addressing two challenges: (i) the radiometric and spectral calibrations of miniaturized hyperspectral sensors; and (ii) tilting effects on measured downwelling irradiance. We developed a novel method to correct the downwelling irradiance data for tilting effects. It uses a hybrid approach of minimizing measured irradiance variations for constant irradiance periods and spectral unmixing, to calculate the spectral diffuse irradiance fraction for all irradiance measurements within a flight. It only requires the platform's attitude data and a standard incoming light sensor. We demonstrated the method at the Palo Verde National Park wetlands in Costa Rica, a highly biodiverse area. Our results showed that the downwelling irradiance correction method reduced systematic shifts caused by a change in flight direction of the UAS, by 87% and achieving a deviation of 2.78% relative to a on ground reference in terms of broadband irradiance. High frequency (< 3 s) irradiance variations caused by high-frequency tilting movements of the UAS were reduced by up to 71%. Our complete spectral and radiometric calibration and irradiance correction can significantly remove typical striped illumination artifacts in the surface reflectance-factor map product. The possibility of collecting precise hyperspectral reflectance-factor data from UAS under varying cloud cover makes it more operational for environmental monitoring or precision agriculture applications, being an important step in advancing hyperspectral imaging from UAS.

AB Global change analyses are facilitated by the growing number of remote-sensing datasets that have both broad spatial extent and repeated observations over decades. These datasets provide unprecedented power to detect patterns of time trends involving information from all pixels on a map. However, rigorously testing for time trends requires a solid statistical foundation to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses. Appropriate statistical analyses are challenging because environmental data often have temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which can either obscure underlying patterns in the data or suggest false associations between patterns in the data and independent values used to explain them. Existing statistical methods that account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation are not practical for remote-sensing datasets that often contain millions of pixels. Here, we first analyze simulated data to show the need to account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in time-trend analyses. Second, we present a new statistical approach, PARTS (Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series), to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses about time trends using all pixels in large remotesensing datasets. PARTS is flexible and can include, for example, the effects of multiple independent variables, such as land-cover or latitude, on time trends. Third, we use PARTS to analyze global trends in NDVI, focusing on trends in pixels that have not experienced land-cover change. We found that despite the appearance of overall increases in NDVI in all continents, there is little statistical support for these trends except for Asia and Europe, and only in some land-cover classes. Furthermore, we found no overall latitudinal trend in greening for any continent, but some latitude by land-cover class interactions, implying that latitudinal patterns differed among land-cover classes. PARTS makes it possible to identify patterns and test hypotheses that involve the aggregate information from many pixels on a map, thereby increasing the value of existing remote-sensing datasets.

AB Current estimates of forest degradation are associated with large uncertainties. However, recent advancements in the availability of remote sensing data (e.g., the free data policies of the Landsat and Sentinel Programs) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) provide new opportunities for monitoring forest degradation. Several recent studies focus on monitoring forest degradation in the tropics, particularly the Amazon, but there are less studies of temperate forest degradation. Compared to the Amazon, temperate forests have more seasonality, which complicates satellite-based monitoring. Here, we present an approach, Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA), that combines time series analysis and spectral mixture analysis running on GEE for monitoring abrupt and gradual forest degradation in temperate regions. We used this approach to monitor forest degradation and deforestation from 1987 to 2019 in the country of Georgia. Reference conditions were observed at sample locations selected under stratified random sampling for area estimation and accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of our map was 91%. The user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of the forest degradation class were 69% and 83%, respectively. The sampling-based area estimate with 95% confidence intervals of forest degradation was 3541 +/- 556 km(2) (11% of the forest area in 1987), which was significantly larger than the area estimate of deforestation, 158 +/- 98 km(2). Our approach successfully mapped forest degradation and estimated the area of forest degradation in Georgia with small uncertainty, which earlier studies failed to estimate.

AB Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a key physiological trait and is crucial for monitoring plant health and accurately modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, spatially-continuous information on LCC variability at fine time-steps, and at fine spatial resolutions across regional spatial extents, is sparse. In this study, we improved a physically-based, two-step inversion approach by using an advanced canopy-to-leaf reflectance conversion model to estimate LCC at fine spatial resolution (20 m) from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The first step is to convert MSI canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance using look-up tables constructed from a geometric optical model (4-Scale). The second step is to estimate LCC from the modeled leaf reflectance using the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. Both leaf reflectance and LCC derived from MSI were validated against field measurements at a mixed temperate forest site in Canada to examine the accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) and LCC retrievals. The results demonstrate robust canopy-level inversions with strong relationships between measured and MSI-derived leaf reflectance (R-2 = 0.995, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.0143). The modeled LCC results were also strong when compared to measured LCC samples: R-2 = 0.849, p < 0.001, and RMSE = 0.304 mu g/cm(2), respectively. The most important Sentinel-2 MSI band for LAI and LCC derivation was centered at 705 nm (Band 5). Importantly, this two-step radiative transfer inversion approach substantially improved upon the current LAI and LCC algorithms adopted by the Sentinel-2 Application Platform, which underestimated LAI by 52.93% and overestimated LCC by 44.45%. This work highlights the potential of the physically-based two-step inversion method for deriving leaf and canopy traits from Sentinel-2 at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions, for a wide range of terrestrial ecological applications.

AB Dense time series of optical satellite imagery describing vegetation activity provide essential information for the efficient and regular monitoring of vegetation. Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of optical sensors is strongly affected by cloud cover, resulting in significant missing information. The use of complementary acquisitions, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, opens the door to the development of new multi-sensor methodologies aiming at the reconstruction of missing information. However, the joint exploitation of new radar and optical missions, such as the Sentinel, raises new challenges given the different nature and response of the two data sources. In this work, the SenRVM methodology is proposed as a new multi-sensor approach to regress SAR time series towards Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A deep Recurrent Neural Network architecture which integrates SAR acquisitions and ancillary data is adopted. The regression task permits a continuous optical temporal resolution of 6 days. Multiple experiments are carried out to assess the SenRVM framework by studying two large-scale areas in France. Through an extensive interpretation of the results, SenRVM is evaluated on three main vegetation types (grasslands, crops, and forests). High accurate results (R2 0.83 and MAE < 0.05) over more than 140,000 vegetation polygons are obtained, both for multi-class and class-specific models. The importance of the SenRVM input features is discussed through an ablation study, highlighting that the relevance of the features differs for the various classes. The good performances of SenRVM are assessed by evaluating the quality of the reconstruction over short- and long-term data gaps. Results are compared to five state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, some preliminary experiments are first carried out to show how SenRVM results could be used to improve the existing cloud & shadow masks. The recovering of time series breaks caused by vegetation cover changes is also illustrated.

AB A framework is proposed for assessing the physical consistency between two terrestrial Essential Climate Vari-ables (ECVs) products retrieved from Earth Observation at global scale. The methodology assessed the level of agreement between the temporal variations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The simultaneous changes were classified according to their sign, magnitude and level of confidence, whereby the respective products uncertainties were taken into consideration. A set of pro-posed agreement metrics were used to identify temporal and spatial biases of non-coherency, non-significance, sensitivity and the overall level of agreement of the temporal changes between two ECVs. We applied the methodology using the Joint Research Center (JRC) Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) products at 1 km, those provided by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) based on the SPOT/VGT and Proba-V at 1 km, and the MODIS MCD15A3 at 500 m. In addition, the same analysis was applied with aggregated products at a larger scale over Southern Africa. We found that the CGLS LAI and FAPAR products lacked consistency in their spatial and temporal changes and were severely affected by trends. The MCD15A3 products were characterized by the highest number of non-coherent changes between the two ECVs but temporal inconsistencies were mainly located over the eastern hemisphere. The JRC-TIP products were highly consistent. The results showed the advantages of physically-based retrieval algorithms, in both JRC-TIP and MODIS products, and indicated also that, except for MODIS over forests, aggregated products using an uncertainty-based weighted average led to higher agreement between the ECVs changes.

AB Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory. Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm density map with 10m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of +/- 7.3 trees/ha, estimated from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states within a country and compare them to official estimates. According to our estimates there are, in total, >1.2 billion oil palms in Indonesia covering >15 million ha, and > 0.5 billion oil palms in Malaysia covering >6 million ha.

AB Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellite measurements has been widely used as proxy for chlorophyll-a concentration and as indicator of phytoplankton physiological status in oceans. The practical use of this naturally occurring light signal in environmental research is, however, under-exploited, particularly in research focusing on optically complex waters such as inland and coastal waters. In this study, we investigated methodological and knowledge gaps in remote sensing of chlorophyll-a SIF in optically complex waters by reviewing the theory behind SIF occurrence, the availability of existing and upcoming instrumentation, the availability of SIF retrieval schemes, and the applications for aquatic research.
   Starting with an overview of factors that influence SIF leaving the water body, we further investigated available and upcoming observational capacity by in situ, airborne and satellite sensors. We discuss requirements for spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolution of observing systems in the context of SIF dynamics. We assessed viable retrieval techniques able to disentangle SIF from non-SIF contribution to the upwelling radiance, ranging from the established multispectral Fluorescence Line Height algorithm (FLH) approach to hyperspectral approaches including model inversion, spectral fitting methods and machine learning regression procedures. Finally, we provide an overview of applications, which could potentially benefit from improved SIF emission estimates such as biomass estimation, algal bloom investigation and primary productivity modelling.

AB Monitoring surface deformation associated with geohazards is a prerequisite for geological disaster prevention. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the ability to capture ground deformation of landslides with high precision over a large area. However, in mountainous regions this capability is often limited by decorrelation noise and atmospheric phase artifacts. Over Eldorado National Forest, California, where many landslides need to be monitored and investigated, InSAR images are severely affected by atmospheric noise and the coherence is highly variable throughout the year, challenging InSAR techniques to effectively detect movement of active landslides. In order to obtain reliable measurements, we have designed an interferogram selection method and an InSAR segment processing (SP) technique to improve the deformation measurement. Compared with the traditional non-segment processing (NSP), the SP technique has demonstrated advantages in reducing the impact of atmospheric noise. Our results from both the ascending and descending InSAR datasets based on SP indicate that many landslides along the Highway 50 corridor were creeping at a rate of less than 10 cm/year during the investigation period. We have found that landslide movements in the study region present obvious seasonal patterns. The precipitation and pore-water measurements and our hydrogeological diffusion models suggest that the seasonal movements of these landslides are primarily driven by the pore-water pressures, and the peak deformation of the landslides may occur in the dry season (May to October) due to the time lag of precipitation infiltration. In addition, we have observed subtle upward movement of the landslides after the precipitation begins, which is likely caused by the swelling of clay-rich landslide body due to an increase in the pore pressure. Furthermore, several other localized unstable regions which may contain potential landslide hazards were also detected and mapped in the study area, and their dynamics need further investigation. We conclude that InSAR is capable of detecting slow landslide motions over difficult terrains if associated artifacts in the interferograms are suppressed. InSAR time-series measurements along with hydrogeological models enable us to characterize the time delay between peaks of landslide motions and precipitation.

AB Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a fundamental vegetation biophysical variable serving as an essential input to many land surface and atmospheric models. Long-term LAI maps are typically generated with satellite images at moderate spatial resolution (0.25 to 1 km), such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While useful for regional-scale land surface modeling, these moderate resolution products often cannot resolve spatial heterogeneity important for many agricultural and hydrological applications. This paper proposes an approach to map LAI at 30-m resolution based on Landsat images for the Contiguous US (CONUS) consistent with the MODIS product, aimed at multi-scale modeling applications. The algorithm was driven by 1.6 million spatially homogeneous samples derived from MODIS LAI and Landsat surface reflectance products from 2006 to 2018. Based on these samples, we trained separate random forest models to estimate LAI from Landsat surface reflectance for eight biomes of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). A balanced sample design regarding the saturation status of MODIS LAI and a machine-learning-based noise detection technique were introduced to mitigate the trade-off in estimation accuracy between medium LAI (e.g., 3 to 4, unsaturated) and high LAI (e.g., 4-6, saturated).
   This approach was evaluated using ground measurements from 19 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and eight independent sites from other sources. These sites comprise a representative sample of forests, grasslands, shrublands, and croplands across the US. For NEON sites, the LAI estimates show an overall Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.8 with r(2) of 0.88. For the eight independent sites, the Landsat LAI algorithm achieves RMSE between 0.52 and 0.91. The uncertainty in Landsat estimated LAI varies across biomes and locations. The proposed algorithm was implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform, allowing for the rapid generation of long-term high-resolution LAI records from the 1980s using Landsat images (code is available at https://github.com/yanghuikang/Landsat-LAI). Our findings also highlight the importance of sample balance on regression-based modeling in remote sensing applications.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides us with new opportunities to understand the physiological and structural dynamics of vegetation from leaf to global scales. However, the relationships between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) are not fully understood, which is mainly due to the challenges of decoupling structural and physiological factors that control the relationships. Here, we report the results of continuous observations of canopy-level SIF, GPP, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and chlorophyll: carotenoid index (CCI) in a temperate evergreen needleleaf forest. To understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between GPP and SIF, we investigated the relationships of light use efficiency (LUEp), chlorophyll fluorescence yield (?F), and the fraction of emitted SIF photons escaping from the canopy (fesc) separately. We found a strongly non-linear relationship between GPP and SIF at diurnal and seasonal time scales (R2 = 0.91 with a hyperbolic regression function, daily). GPP saturated with APAR, while SIF did not. Also, there were differential responses of LUEp and ?F to air temperature. While LUEp reached saturation at high air temperatures, ?F did not saturate. We found that the canopy-level chlorophyll: carotenoid index was strongly correlated to canopy-level ?F (R2 = 0.84) implying that ?F could be more closely related to pigment pool changes rather than LUEp. In addition, we found that the fesc contributed to a stronger SIF-GPP relationship by partially capturing the response of LUEp to diffuse light. These findings can help refine physiological and structural links between canopy-level SIF and GPP in evergreen needleleaf forest.

TI SAR-derived flow velocity and its link to glacier surface elevation
   change and mass balance
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Modern remote sensing techniques, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), can measure the direction and intensity of glacier flow. Yet the question remains as to what these measurements reveal about glaciers? adjustment to the warming climate. Here, we present a technique that addresses this question by linking the SARderived velocity measurements with the glacier elevation change and the specific mass balance (i.e. mass balance per unit area). The technique computes the speckle offset tracking results from the north, east and vertical flow displacement time series, with the vertical component further split into a Surface Parallel Flow (SPF) advection component due to the motion along a glacier surface slope and a non-Surface Parallel Flow (nSPF). The latter links the glacier surface elevation change with the specific mass balance and strain rates. We apply this technique to ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data to derive the four-dimensional flow displacement time series for glaciers in southeast Alaska during 2016-2019. Time series extracted for a few characteristic regions demonstrate remarkable temporal variability in flow velocities. The seasonal signal observed in the nSPF component is modeled using the Positive Degree Day model. This method can be used for computing either mass balance or glacier surface elevation change if one of these two parameters is known from external observations.

AB In this study, on the basis of the image correlation technique and the time-series images of Landsat-8 (L8), Sentinel-2 (52), and GaoFen-2 (GF2), a systematic technical process is designed to investigate the precursory displacement evolution of two successive slope failures occurred in Baige Village, China on Oct. 11, 2018 and Nov. 3, 2018. An innovative fusion strategy is proposed to investigate the displacement history of the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide, which has two steps: (1) selecting the optimal correlation window size and search step to eliminate the inconsistency of image correlation for different sensors, and (2) inverting the fused displacement time-series from correlation results to enhance the temporal sampling density. The normalized displacement velocity indicates that the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide is characterized by high-speed sliding (28 m/yr) and high shear outlet with an average elevation difference of around 82 m. The fused displacement time series indicates that the whole phase transformation can be from the secondary stage to the tertiary stage on Mar. 26, 2017. Furthermore, the displacement velocity shows four quiescence phases in the secondary stage and two acceleration phases in the tertiary stage. The seasonal precipitation is assumed as the main external triggering factor, and it combined with the brittle geological material attributes to control the precursory landslide displacement evolution and caused the catastrophic slope failure on Oct. 11, 2018. The precursory displacement signals with a magnitude above 5 m/day of the second landslide (Nov. 3, 2018) is quantified by the 52 image correlation. This study highlights the prospects of optical observation time series with medium-/high-resolution in detecting and quantifying the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of long-term creeping landslides which may play a significant role in the early warning of the catastrophic slope failure.

AB Global, repeated, and accurate measurements of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are critical for weather and climate projections. While thermometers on buoys measure SST relatively accurately, only sensors aboard satellites give global and repeated SST measurements necessary for many applications, including climate modeling. For satellite-based thermal infrared sensors, an atmospheric correction converts calibrated brightness temperatures measured at orbital height into an SST estimate, but imperfect assumptions in the correction algorithm coupled with variability in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries can lead to a wide range of errors and uncertainties in the satellite-derived SST retrievals. Estimates of the resulting errors are imperative for satellite-derived SST assimilation into climate models. This paper evaluates the use of machine learning Decision Tree algorithms to predict the central tendency and dispersion of errors in satellite-derived SST retrievals. First, using records from the NASA R2014.1 MODIS Aqua SST Matchup Database, which includes matched-up satellite and in situ SST measurements, a set of seven variables was derived that addresses the assumptions and known issues in the satellite SST retrieval process. Then, both Random Forest and Cubist Decision Trees were used to predict the SST residual (satellite SST minus skin-corrected buoy SST) for each matchup. While both Decision Tree methods performed similarly well, the Cubist model is more easily interpreted and yields better predictions of errors for relatively infrequent conditions. Various characteristics of the groups of matchups identified by Cubist were explored, and uncertainty values for the error estimates were derived for each group. Overall, the Cubist model predicted the skin SST residual with a root-mean-squared-error of 0.380 degrees C across nighttime cloud-filtered domains, demonstrating that a Cubist model is viable for quantitatively and accurately predicting Single Sensor Error Statistics per pixel as required by the Group for High Resolution SST. In this paper, we present the training and testing of both Decision Tree models. Because of its interpretability, we explore in detail the characteristics of the Cubist-derived groups to gain new geophysical insight into the satellite-derived SST retrieval error across different measurement conditions.

AB Crop yield maps estimated from satellite data increasingly are used to understand drivers of yield trends and variability, yet satellite-derived regional maps are rarely compared with location-specific yields due to the difficulty of acquiring sub-field ground truth data at scale. In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r(2) = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r(2) = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data. Our results demonstrate that satellite yield maps can provide much-needed information on multidecadal yield trends and inform yield gap analyses.

AB Epiphytic bryophytes (EBs) are commonly found in tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs), and they play significant roles in ecological functioning. Field sampling to assess the abundance of EB is challenging because of their "epiphytic" habitat, which makes large-scale quantifications impractical. The abundance of EBs is highly related to forest structure, physical environment and microclimate. These characteristics may permit landscape-scale assessments using a synoptic sensing approach. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the plot-scale EB biomass density (kg ha(-1)) and a comprehensive set of field and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived forest biophysical, topographic and bioclimatic attributes (factors), and assessed the feasibility of landscape-scale mapping of EB biomass in TMCFs. The study was carried out in 16,773 ha of TMCFs on Chilan Mountain in northeastern Taiwan. The relationship between EB biomass density data from 21 plots (30 x 30 m) and 39 field or 1-m gridded lidar data-derived forest structural, topographic and bioclimatic factors was investigated. We applied a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to minimize the effects of multi-collinearity among those 39 factors, and selected latent variables (LVs) explaining the majority of data variation for landscape-scale EB biomass mapping. The first four LVs explained 92% of the data variation, and the performance of the PLSR was satisfactory (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.001). The majority (35 out of 39) of the selected forest structural, topographic and bioclimatic factors were significantly related to one or more LVs, and most (37 out of 39) could be directly derived or were indirectly related to lidar metrics, thereby permitting the landscape-scale mapping of EB biomass density. We estimated that the mean (+/- standard deviation) EB biomass density was 296.5 +/- 373.1 kg ha(-1) and that the total EB biomass of the TMCF of Chilan Mountain was 4973.9 Mg. This study demonstrates that the proposed approach may be feasible for landscape-scale EB biomass mapping, thereby advancing our understanding of the role of EBs in the hydrological and nutrient cycles of TMCFs. The outcomes of the PLSR may elucidate the physiological mechanisms underpinning EB abundance in TMCFs and guide ecological management under future climate scenarios.

AB There is a worldwide need for detailed spatial information to support soil mapping, mainly in the tropics, where main agricultural areas are concentrated. In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (similar to 30-50%) when compared to the single-date images (similar to 20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture.

TI Identifying relative strengths of SMAP, SMOS-IC, and ASCAT to capture
   temporal variability
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB This study evaluates the relative strengths of three remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products to capture temporal variability at a global scale, the products being the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). For this, the conventional reference-based Pearson correlation (R) and a statistical technique called Triple Collocation (TC)-based R are calculated. In addition, two alternatives for linear combination of the three data sources for maximizing R against the truth are evaluated, the first using a reference product (i.e. assumed truth) and the second based on TC where three data sources are combined without the need for an underlying reference or assumed truth. The estimated optimal combination weights represent quantitative contributions of the three products in forming the new combined product having the maximized R. Two reanalysis products: the European Centre for Medium Range Forecast (ECMWF) Interim product (ERA-Interim) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Land version 2 reanalysis product (MERRA2), are used as the references as well as data alternatives to calculate the conventional reference-based R and the TC-based R combinations. Both types of R, and their derived optimal weights are then compared globally and analyzed under various climate, land cover, and vegetation conditions. Despite the differences between the conventional R and the TC-based R, both metrics displayed consistent spatial distributions and can reflect the temporal variations of each studied dataset without considerable impact from adopted references. All products had difficulty in retrieving SM over arid and polar regions while exhibiting good performance in areas such as South America and Australia. While ASCAT presented higher R values over tropical, savannas, and the vegetation water content interval of 2-5 kg/m(2), SMAP and SMOS-IC displayed overall comparable and continually high temporal performances across almost all conditions. In the case of the derived optimal weights, a global complementarity of the areas was observed where each satellite-based observation product showed its respective advantage in capturing SM variations in different geographic areas.

AB This paper investigates the soil moisture retrievals over Tibetan Plateau using multi-temporal ALOS2-PALSAR2 data acquired in ScanSAR mode, in contrary to the commonly used StripMap SAR imaging mode. Considering the dual-polarimetry with limited observables, the surface roughness parameters such as the RMS height and auto-correlation length are first estimated by optimizing the semi-empirical Oh2004 model applied to the ALOS2 data acquired under bare soil condition. The vegetation water content corresponding to each ALOS2 acquisition time is derived from an empirical model applied to the temporally interpolated MODIS NDVI data. Then, the obtained roughness and vegetation optical depth are substituted into the Water Cloud Model which we modified by adding a double-bounce component according to the L-band scattering processes to retrieve the effective scattering albedo and soil moisture. The results show that the optimized surface RMS height and the associated slope are negatively related to a dual-angular radar index Delta HH, indicating the feasibility to optimize the relatively stable surface roughness parameters before retrieving the soil moisture dynamics. The obtained vegetation optical depth which is cross-validated against a normalized cross-polarized radar descriptor indicates a significant increase from May to August, in response to the vegetation phenological growth. Furthermore, the time variable scattering albedo is less than 0.08, and slightly increases with the vegetation development. By accounting for the double-bounce component, the retrieved soil moisture better agrees with the ground measurements with R = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.058 m(3)/m(3), but exhibits an overestimation issue for the soil moisture higher than 0.35 m(3)/m(3) due to the saturation of SAR signal and the relatively strong vegetation cover. A positive correspondence (R = 0.81) between the retrieved soil moisture and the interpolated NDVI was found, verifying their close coupling in the soil-vegetation system. This study deepens the insights in the potential integration between the optical and L-band microwave observations to retrieve soil moisture over vegetated area.

AB Advances in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) processing algorithms, such as the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS), and increased data availability from SAR systems, such as Sentinel-1, provide the opportunity to increase the spatial and temporal density of ground deformation measurements. Such measurements, when combined with modelling, have the potential to make a significant cost-effective contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields. Applications of DInSAR over coalfields have observed heave in coal measures rocks and temporal correlations between the rise of mine water and deformation time-series. The cessation of systematic dewatering can have a variety of detrimental impacts and knowledge of the time-scales (i.e. the rate of rebound) and structure of the mine system are crucial to the remediation strategy. Although mine plans and borehole measurements provide vital information in this regard, mine plans are often incomplete or inaccurate, whereas monitoring boreholes are spatially sparse. Consequently, groundwater can flow in unanticipated directions via goaf, mine shafts and roadways, making it difficult to determine where the impacts of rebound are likely to occur. In this study, ground deformation data obtained using ISBAS DInSAR on ENVISAT (2002-2009) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2019) data are used to develop a simple method to model groundwater rebound in abandoned coalfields. A forward analytical model based upon the principle of effective stress and mine water ponds is first implemented to estimate surface heave in response to changes in groundwater levels measured in monitoring boreholes. The forward model is then calibrated and validated using the ground deformation data. The DInSAR data were subsequently inverted to map the change in groundwater levels in greater detail across the coalfield and forecast surface discharges in order to support mitigation strategies.

AB Numerous algorithms are used in remote sensing to detect changes in vegetation. Majority of them require several tunable parameters or can only detect abrupt forest disturbances. The aim of this study was to develop a new thresholdand trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm (TVCMA) that can detect abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation within forested and non-forested areas. To test the algorithm, the Polish and Slovak Tatra Mountains were used as the study area. Strong winds and bark beetle outbreaks (BBOs) are the primary causes of vegetation disturbances in this region. An annual time series of vegetation indices from 1984 to 2016 was used as the input. The long time span necessitated the use of scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fifty-one images were atmospherically and topographically corrected. The collected in situ data included the chlorophyll content, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and spectral signatures of non-forest vegetation, dwarf pine, and forest stands in 190 sample plots. To select the vegetation indices (VIs) most suitable for disturbance detection, ten satellite-based VIs were correlated with the acquired field data. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) was found to be more sensitive to vegetation disturbances and more resistant to data noise than any other tested index. The TVCMA uses two separate approaches, namely, thresholding, which indicates where and when the disturbances occurred, and a regression analysis, which presents the general trend in the time series for each pixel. The number of detected disturbances, the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the modeled trend line and satellite observations, and p-values were calculated. Different threshold values were tested to identify the value that yielded the most accurate results. By using 200 randomly selected validation points, we achieved an 83.3% producer's accuracy for disturbances (PAD), 46.3% user's accuracy for disturbances (UAD), and 97.8% overall accuracy (OA). These results confirm the potential of TVCMA for monitoring abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation. Moreover, the simplicity and data-driven character of the proposed algorithm make it suitable for multi-temporal analyses of other types of satellite data.

However, existing EWS tend only to monitor current, rather than forecast future, environmental and socioeconomic indicators of drought, and hence are not always sufficiently timely to be effective in practice. Here we present a novel method for forecasting satellite-based indicators of vegetation condition. Specifically, we focused on the 3-month Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) over pastoral livelihood zones in Kenya, which is the indicator used by the Kenyan National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). Using data from MODIS and Landsat, we apply linear autoregression and Gaussian process modelling methods and demonstrate high forecasting skill several weeks ahead. As a bench mark we predicted the drought alert marker used by NDMA (VCI3M < 35). Both of our models were able to predict this alert marker four weeks ahead with a hit rate of around 89% and a false alarm rate of around 4%, or 81% and 6% respectively six weeks ahead. The methods developed here can thus identify a deteriorating vegetation condition well and sufficiently in advance to help disaster risk managers act early to support vulnerable communities and limit the impact of a drought hazard.

AB The Greater Maasai Mara Ecosystem (GMME) in Kenya is an iconic savanna ecosystem of high importance as natural and cultural heritage, notably by including the largest remaining seasonal migration of African ungulates and the semi-nomadic pastoralist Maasai culture. Comprehensive mapping of vegetation distribution and dynamics in GMME is important for understanding ecosystem changes across time and space since recent reports suggest dramatic declines in wildlife populations alongside troubling reports of grassland conversion to cropland and habitat fragmentation due to increasing small-holder fencing. Here, we present the first comprehensive vegetation map of GMME at high (10-m) spatial resolution. The map consists of nine key vegetation cover types (VCTs), which were derived in a two-step process integrating data from high-resolution WorldView-3 images (1.2-m) and Sentinel-2 images using a deep-learning workflow. We evaluate the role of anthropogenic, topographic, and climatic factors in affecting the fractional cover of the identified VCTs in 2017 and their MODIS-derived browning/greening rates in the preceding 17 years at 250-m resolution. Results show that most VCTs showed a preceding greening trend in the protected land. In contrast, the semi- and unprotected land showed a general preceding greening trend in the woody-dominated cover types, while they exhibited browning trends in grass-dominated cover types. These results suggest that woody vegetation densification may be happening across much of the GMME, alongside vegetation declines within the non-woody covers in the semi- and unprotected lands. Greening and potential woody densification in GMME is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with anthropogenic pressure. Increasing woody densification across the entire GMME in the future would replace high-quality grass cover and pose a risk to the maintenance of the region's rich savanna megafauna, thus pointing to a need for further investigation using alternative data sources. The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and efficient approaches for vegetation mapping will play a crucial role in monitoring conservation effectiveness as well as ecosystem dynamics due to pressures such as climate change.

AB Fire disturbance is a significant component of the climate system. Analysis of satellite-derived burned areas has allowed the identification of fire patches and their morphology as a new resource for tracking fire spread to improve fire models used to assess the impact of fires on climate and the carbon cycle. A critical parameter of the flood-fill algorithm used to create fire patches is the cut-off (in days) below which it aggregates two contiguous burned pixels to the same fire patch. However, the current level of validation is insufficient to understand the effect of the cut-off values and sensor resolutions on the subsequent fire-patch morphology. The FRY v1.0 database of functional fire-patch traits (e.g., size, elongation, and direction) emanates from the analyses of two global burned-area products derived from MODIS and MERIS sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and with cut-off values of 3, 5, 9, and 14 days. To evaluate whether the FRY products are accurately identifying the spatial features of fire patches and what are the most realistic cut-off values to use in different sub-regions of North America, we propose a new functional diversity trait-based approach, which compares the satellite-derived fire patches to forest service perimeters as reference data. This paper shows the accuracy of the FRY fire patches >= 300 ha in North America during 2005-2011. Our analysis demonstrates that fire patches with a high cut-off of 14 days and those derived from the MODIS sensor, with their high temporal resolution, better identify the fire diversity in North America. In conclusion, our statistical framework can be used for assessing satellite-derived fire patches. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of satellite sensors is the most important factor in identifying fire patches- thus space agencies should consider it when planning the future development of cost-effective climate observation systems.

AB Topography is one of the key factors that impact remotely sensed data and their interpretation. Indeed, combined with the viewing geometry and neighbour effects, it strongly affects the direct, diffuse and multi-scattered scene irradiance, which in turn impacts the radiative budget and remote sensing signals of the landscapes. The increased availability of digital elevation models (DEM) and the advancement of 3D radiative transfer (RT) models allow us to better address these topographic effects. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate remote sensing observations of natural and urban landscapes with topography and atmosphere. It simulates environmental effects (i.e., impact of adjacent landscape on the observed landscape) using a so-called infinite slope mode that infinitely duplicates the observed landscape while ensuring the continuity of slope and altitude at the DEM edges. Up to DART version 5.7.4, this mode was slightly inaccurate and computer intensive, depending on the topography. This paper presents an innovative modelling strategy that greatly improves it in terms of accuracy, image quality and computer efficiency. For that, a fictive auxiliary oblique plane, adapted to the landscape topography, is introduced for managing the scene illumination, the Earth-Atmosphere coupling and the storage of the radiation that exits the scene before being projected onto the sensor plane. Improvements and validations are illustrated both visually and quantitatively by DART images, radiometric products and radiative budget. For example, the observed reflectance of a Lambertian slope is equal to the expected analytical value. In addition, the solar plane reflectance of a forest on a mountain slope (experimental scene) has an average error of about 0.01% relative to the reflectance of the same forest stand in the reference scene (i.e., nine duplications of the experimental scene). This new modelling is already integrated in the official DART version (https://dart.omp.eu).

AB Rivers are essential to the Earth's ecosystem, but the current understanding of river width variability is limited, owing to the sparse distribution of gauging stations. Remote sensing data enable the surveying and analysis of river geomorphology by providing multi-temporal Earth observation data from satellites at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We proposed an optimized RivWidth method to automatically calculate width for all channels in a water map and parallelized it to produce the Multi-temporal China River Width (MCRW) dataset, which is the first 30-m multi-temporal river width dataset for China during 1990-2015, including estimates under both seasonal fluctuations and dynamic inundation frequencies. The MCRW dataset is made up of 1.3 x 10(8) seasonal estimates of river width, and covers 1.4 x 10(5) km of rivers in China. We validated the MCRW dataset against in-situ measurements. The MCRW estimates at maximum water extent showed a satisfactory accuracy of 15.0% and 15.2% for the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), respectively. The MCRW dataset was further compared with the current state-of-the-art global product, the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) dataset, which demonstrated the superiority of the MCRW in describing the basins of China. Our analysis indicated that the mean river widths of China in both summer and winter have increased over the past 25 years, and river width of the Yangtze River mainstream in the lower drainage region has shown a downward trend while the its middle reaches and tributaries (upstream of the Three Gorges Dam) have shown an upward trend. We also developed a locally adaptive search method to quantify seasonal (summer and winter) river width variability. The results revealed that most of the rivers were wider in summer during the study period, and mainstream of Yangtze River in middle/lower region exhibited less seasonal variability than its tributaries. Larger widths were observed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Black River in winter due to ice-jam floods. Overall, the generated MCRW dataset has the potential to serve as a fundamental resource in Earth system science, and could provide valuable support to surface water resource and riverine management.

AB Region-wide investigation of glacier change in High Mountain Asia marked the strongest recession in southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) in recent decades. However, evident differences of quantitative glacier mass balance (MB) estimations on fine scales exist in the prior reports. The large uncertainties in current geodetic observations over this region highlight the need for more independent validations and investigations on the spatial variability of glacier change. This study enriched glacier MB estimates over the SETP by using the newly released global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the TanDEM-X and analyzed the spatial pattern of glacier change on multi-spatial scales by comparing available satellite-based geodetic observations. Results reveal that the TanDEM-X - SRTM elevation differences, which show no obvious horizontal shifts and no significant elevation-dependent bias, provide reliable elevation change information over this challenging area. On the regional scale, the geodetic datasets (the ASTER elevation change rates data, TanDEM-X- SRTM differences, ICESat) achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier MB at -4.11 +/- 1.52 Gt a(-1) (-0.60 +/- 0.16 m w.e. a(-1)) during 2000 and 2010s. On the subregional scale, the two gridded geodetic datasets revealed a clear contrast between moderate thinning of spring-accumulation type glaciers in the south and significantly more negative glacier MB of summer-accumulation type glaciers in the north. Glacier-wide MB showed high heterogeneity, which was closely related to the combined effect of topographic variation and climate forcings. We observed similar glacier thinning rates between debris-covered land-terminating glaciers and clean-ice glaciers (-0.50 +/- 0.32 m w.e. a(-1)) but remarkable more negative MB (-0.89 +/- 0.36 m w.e. a(-1)) of debris-covered glaciers connected with glacial lakes, which may indicate different evolution process of debris-covered glaciers in the monsoon-influenced region. This study demonstrates that current satellite-based geodetic observations achieve overall consistent patterns of glacier mass changes even over the most challenging mountainous areas (complicated terrain and climate). With the global TanDEM-X DEM and increasing observations from the mission, we expect improved consistency in glacier MB estimation on large spatial scales as well as detailed investigation of glacier mass change variability in the future.

AB Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing has proven to be a useful approach to characterize the volume of seasonal snowpack in remote northern regions at the synoptic scale. Modeling emitted microwave brightness temperatures (TB) is made possible using a physical radiative transfer model that takes into account microstructural and stratigraphic structure of the snowpack. However, prescribing the microstructure remains a difficult task. This paper aims to find proper microstructure parametrization and the snow emission model formulation that best optimize TB simulations for Arctic and Subarctic snowpacks. Surfaced-based radiometric measurements in conjunction with in-situ snowpack characterization were used for testing different configurations based on the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT), with two electromagnetic models (Dense Media Radiative Transfer Quasi Crystalline Approximation, DMRT, and Improved Born Approximation, IBA) and two microstructure description theories (Sticky Hard Sphere, SHS, and Exponential, Exp). We compare the performance of three configurations (DMRT-SHS, IBA-SHS and IBA-Exp) with a unique large dataset (119 snowpits with concomitant microwave ground-based radiometer observations) covering a wide range of Arctic and Subarctic snow types in Northern and Eastern Canada. Results show that the input measured microstructure parameters must be scaled up in order to better match simulated and observed TB at 11, 19, 37 and 89 GHz. We show that the IBA-Exp gives the best results, with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) lower by up to 30% for Subarctic snow and 24% for Arctic snow compare to the other model configurations we used. In addition, we undertake a complementary experiment on isolated homogeneous snow slabs to investigate the sensitivity of the scaling factor to snow microstructure. The retrieved microwave correlation length appears significantly different than the in-situ Debye correlation length. At high frequencies, the observed variability of these scaling factors with frequency and snowpack types means that density, SSA and estimated correlation length seem insufficient to appropriately fully characterize snow microstructure for microwave modeling purposes.

AB Sediment budgets are a critical metric to assess coastal marsh vulnerability to sea level rise and declining riverine sediment inputs. However, calculating accurate sediment budgets is challenging in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries where suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) typically vary on scales of hours and hundreds of meters, and where SSC dynamics are driven by a complex and often site-specific interplay of hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions. The mapping of SSC using ocean-color remote sensing is well established and can help capture the spatio-temporal variability of SSC and determine the dominant drivers regulating sediment budgets. However, the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean-color sensors (1-km) generally precludes their use in coastal-marsh estuaries. Here, using the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, USA) as an example, we demonstrate that high-spatial-resolution maps of SSC derived from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instruments (MSI) can be used to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries, despite the long revisit time of these sensors. Local empirical algorithms between SSC and remote-sensing reflectance were derived and applied to a total of 46 clear-sky scenes collected by the OLI and the MSI between 2013 and 2018. The analysis revealed that this 5-year record was sufficient to capture a representative range of meteorological and tidal conditions required to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in this mid-latitude system. The interplay between river and tidal flows dominated SSC dynamics in this estuary, whereas wind-driven resuspension had a more moderate effect. The SSC was higher during spring because of increased river discharge due to snowmelt. Tidal asymmetry also enhanced sediment resuspension during flood tides, possibly favoring deposition on marsh platforms. Together, water level, water-level rate of change, river discharge and wind speed were able to explain > 60% of the variability in the main channel SSC, thereby facilitating future prediction of SSC from these readily available variables. This study demonstrates that the existing multi-year records of high-resolution remote sensing can provide a representative depiction of SSC dynamics in hydrodynamically-complex and small-scale estuaries that moderate-resolution ocean color remote sensing and in situ measurements are unable to capture.

AB Tree canopy density metrics (TCDM) derived from airborne lidar data are used in a range of crucial environmental monitoring, forestry and natural resource management applications. The derivation of spatially and temporally consistent TCDM, however, typically requires field calibration to account for differences in instrument/survey parameters. Lidar surveys with no coincident field measurements consequently will have an unknown error associated with TCDM limiting their application. In this study, we analysed an extensive set of lidar captures with coincident field data to determine the lidar TCDM that best match the canopy gap probability (P-gap), foliage projective cover (FPC) and crown projective cover (CPC). Furthermore, we developed and evaluated models designed to reduce the bias introduced by variations in lidar instrument and survey acquisition parameters. The dataset incorporated 148 field sites (100 m diameter circular plots) coincident with 13 different lidar surveys between 2008 and 2015, distributed across a range of Australian forests and woodlands. The best lidar metric for 1 - P-gap, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.7% with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 6.1-7.3%, was the proportion of all returns greater than a canopy height threshold (tcanopy) of 1.5 m above ground (dall). The best metric for FPC (RMSE = 6.0%, CI = 5.3-6.7%) used the proportion of returns, weighted as the fraction of the number of returns recorded from each pulse (dweighted), with tcanopy of 1.7 m. The best metric for CPC (RMSE = 7.0%, CI = 6.4-7.7%) was the proportion of 0.5 m pixels greater than 0.8 m above the ground, for an interpolated canopy height model (dinterp). Overall bias for these metrics was low (similar to 1%), however, the bias for individual surveys varied significantly. For example, for one survey dall consistently underestimated 1 - P-gap with a bias of -8.3%, while a different survey consistently overestimated 1 - P-gap with a bias of 3.8%. Elastic net regression models, using instrument, survey and plot parameters as predictor variables, were unable to consistently remove the bias. No relationships could be discerned between lidar parameters and the bias between lidar metrics and field measurements, potentially due to complex interactions between parameters, the spatial scale of the field plots, and uncertainties in field measurements and lidar attributes. Although the bias could not be modelled, the results provide metrics to derive P-gap, FPC and CPC with less than 10% error from lidar surveys captured with similar parameters across Australia (>600,000 km(2)).

AB The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is an important parameter for understanding the accumulation of pollutants and the dynamics of the lower atmosphere. Lidar has been used for tracking the evolution of PBLH by using aerosol backscatter as a tracer, assuming aerosol is generally well-mixed in the PBL; however, the validity of this assumption actually varies with atmospheric stability. This is demonstrated here for stable boundary layers (SBL), neutral boundary layers (NBL), and convective boundary layers (CBL) using an 8-year dataset of micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde (RS) measurements at the ARM Southern Great Plains, and MPL at the GSFC site. Due to weak thermal convection and complex aerosol stratification, traditional gradient and wavelet methods can have difficulty capturing the diurnal PBLH variations in the morning and forenoon, as well as under stable conditions generally. A new method is developed that combines lidar-measured aerosol backscatter with a stability dependent model of PBLH temporal variation (DTDS). The latter helps "recalibrate" the PBLH in the presence of a residual aerosol layer that does not change in harmony with PBL diurnal variation. The hybrid method offers significantly improved PBLH detection, with better correlation and smaller biases, under most thermodynamic conditions, especially for SBL and CBL. Relying on the physical process of PBL diurnal development, different schemes are developed for growing, maintenance, and decaying periods. Comprehensive evaluation of this new method shows much better tracking of diurnal PBLH variation and significantly smaller biases under various pollution levels.

AB Classifying land use/land cover (LULC) with sufficient accuracy in heterogeneous landscapes is challenging using only satellite imagery. To improve classification accuracy inclusion of features from auxiliary geospatial datasets in classification models is applied since 1980s. However, the method is mostly limited to pixel-based classifications, and the coverage, accuracy and resolution of free and open-access auxiliary datasets have been poor until recent years.
   We evaluated how recent global coverage open-access geospatial datasets improve object-based LULC classification accuracy compared to using only spectral and texture features from satellite images. We applied feature sets topography, population, soil, canopy cover, distance to watercourses and spectral-temporal metrics from Landsat-8 time series on the southern foothills and savanna of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, where the landscape is characterized by heterogeneous and fragmented mosaic of disturbed savanna vegetation, croplands, and settlements.
   The classification was based on image objects (groups of spectrally similar pixels) derived from segmentation of four Formosat-2 scenes with 8 m spatial resolution using 1370 ground reference points for training, validation, and for defining 17 LULC classes. We built six Random Forest classification models with different sets of object features in each. The baseline model having only spectral and texture features was compared with five other models supplemented with auxiliary features.
   Inclusion of auxiliary features significantly improved classification overall accuracy (OA). The baseline model gave a median OA of 60.7%, but auxiliary features in other models increased median OA between 6.1 and 16.5 percentage points. The best OA was achieved with a model including all features of which elevation was the most important auxiliary feature followed by Enhanced Vegetation Index temporal range and slope degree.
   Applying object-based classification to geospatial information on topography, soil, settlement patterns and vegetation phenology, the discriminatory potential of challenging LULC classes can be significantly improved. We demonstrated this for the first time, and the technique shows good potential for improving LULC mapping across a multitude of fragmented landscapes worldwide.

AB Spatially and temporally consistent vegetation structure time-series have great potential to improve the capacity for national land cover monitoring, to reduce latency and cost of international reporting, and to harmonize regional land cover characterizations. Here we present a semi-automatic, operational algorithm for mapping and monitoring of woody vegetation canopy cover and height at a regional scale using freely available Landsat time series data. The presented algorithm employs automatic data processing and mapping using a set of lidar-based vegetation structure prediction models. Changes in vegetation cover are detected separately and integrated into the structure time-series. Sample-based validation and inter-comparison with existing datasets demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistency of our regional data time-series. The dataset reliably reflects changes in tree cover (tree cover loss user's accuracy of 0.84 and producer's accuracy of 0.75) and can serve as a tool to map annual forest extent (user's accuracy of 0.98 and producer's accuracy of 0.81 for 10% canopy cover threshold to define the forest class). The tree height estimates are consistent with a GLAS-based global map (mean average error of 3.7 m, the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and the R-2 of 0.85). The algorithm was prototyped within the Lower Mekong region where it revealed an intensive woody vegetation dynamic. Of the year 2000 forest area (defined using canopy cover threshold of 10% and tree height threshold of 5 m), 9.4% was deforested by the year 2017, and 16.6% was affected by stand-replacement disturbance followed by reforestation. The average annual area of stand-level forest disturbance within the region was 2.34 Mha, and increased by 34% from 2001 (1.85 Mha) to 2017 (2.48 Mha). Total forest area decreased by 6.2% within the region, and 11.1% of year 2000 primary forest area was lost by 2017. At the national level, Cambodia demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net forest area loss of 22.5%. We estimated that 21.3% of 2017 forest cover had an age of 17 years or less, illustrating the intensive forest land uses within the region. The time-series product is suitable for mapping annual land cover and inter-annual land cover change using customized class definitions. The regionally-consistent data are publicly available for download (https://glad.umd.edu/), and online analysis (https://rlcms-servir.adpc.net/en/forest-monitor/), and serve as an input to the SERVIR-Mekong Regional Land Cover Monitoring System.

AB During the 2017 record-breaking burning season in Canada/United States, intense wild fires raged during the first week of September in the Pacific northwestern region (British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and northern California) burning mostly temperate coniferous forests. The heavy loads of smoke particles emitted in the atmosphere reached the Iberian Peninsula (IP) a few days later on 7 and 8 September. Satellite imagery allows to identify two main smoke clouds emitted during two different periods that were injected and transported in the atmosphere at several altitude levels. Columnar properties on 7 and 8 September at two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) mid-altitude, background sites in northern and southern Spain are: aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm up to 0.62, angstrom ngstrom exponent of 1.6-1.7, large dominance of small particles (fine mode fraction > 0.88), low absorption AOD at 440 nm (< 0.008) and large single scattering albedo at 440 nm (> 0.98). Profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) show the presence of smoke particles in the stratosphere during the transport, whereas the smoke is only observed in the troposphere at its arrival over the IP. Portuguese and Spanish ground lidar stations from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network/Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure Network (EARLINET/ACTRIS) and the Micro-Pulse Lidar NETwork (MPLNET) reveal smoke plumes with different properties: particle depolarization ratio and color ratio, respectively, of 0.05 and 2.5 in the mid troposphere (5-9 km) and of 0.10 and 3.0 in the upper troposphere (10-13 km). In the mid troposphere the particle depolarization ratio does not seem time-dependent during the transport whereas the color ratio seems to increase (larger particles sediment first). To analyze the horizontal and vertical transport of the smoke from its origin to the IP, particle dispersion modelling is performed with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) parameterized with satellite-derived biomass burning emission estimates from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Three compounds are simulated: carbon monoxide, black carbon and organic carbon. The results show that the first smoke plume which travels slowly reaches rapidly (similar to 1 day) the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) but also shows evidence of large scale horizontal dispersion, while the second plume, entrained by strong subtropical jets, reaches the upper troposphere much slower (similar to 2.5 days). Observations and dispersion modelling all together suggest that particle depolarization properties are enhanced during their vertical transport from the mid to the upper troposphere.

AB Spectroscopy is becoming an increasingly powerful tool to alleviate the challenges of traditional measurements of key plant traits at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales. Spectroscopic methods often rely on statistical approaches to reduce data redundancy and enhance useful prediction of physiological traits. Given the mechanistic uncertainty of spectroscopic techniques, genetic modification of plant biochemical pathways may affect reflectance spectra causing predictive models to lose power. The objectives of this research were to assess over two separate years, whether a predictive model can represent natural and imposed variation in leaf photosynthetic potential for different crop cultivars and genetically modified plants, to assess the interannual capabilities of a partial least square regression (PLSR) model, and to determine whether leaf N is a dominant driver of photosynthesis in PLSR models. In 2016, a PLSR analysis of reflectance spectra coupled with gas exchange data was used to build predictive models for photosynthetic parameters including maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-c,V-max), maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) and percentage leaf nitrogen ([N]). The model was developed for wild type and genetically modified plants that represent a wide range of photosynthetic capacities. Results show that hyperspectral reflectance accurately predicted V-c,V-max,V- J(max) and [N] for all plants measured in 2016. Applying these PLSR models to plants grown in 2017 resulted in a strong predictive ability relative to gas exchange measurements for V-c,V-max but not for J(max,) and not for genotypes unique to 2017. Building a new model including data collected in 2017 resulted in more robust predictions, with R-2 increases of 17% for V-c,V-max. and 13% Plants generally have a positive correlation between leaf nitrogen and photosynthesis, however, tobacco with reduced Rubisco (SSuD) had significantly higher [N] despite much lower V-c,V-max. The PLSR model was able to accurately predict both V-c,V-max lower and higher leaf [N] for this genotype suggesting that the spectral based estimates of V-c,V-max and leaf nitrogen [N] are independent. These results suggest that the PLSR model can be applied across years, but only to genotypes used to build the model and that the actual mechanism measured with the PLSR technique is not directly related to leaf [N]. The success of the leaf-scale analysis suggests that similar approaches may be successful at the canopy and ecosystem scales but to use these methods across years and between genotypes at any scale, application of accurately populated physical based models based on radiative transfer principles may be required.

AB This study demonstrates the applicability of harmonizing Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery products to enable the monitoring of inland lake water clarity in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Processing steps include (1) atmospheric correction and masking of MSI and OLI imagery, and (2) generating scene-based water clarity maps in terms of Secchi depth (SD). We adopted ocean-color based atmospheric correction theory for MSI and OLI sensors modified with associated scene-specific metadata and auxiliary datasets available in GEE to generate uniform remote sensing reflectances (R-rs) products over optically variable freshwater lake surfaces. MSI-R-rs products derived from the atmospheric correction were used as input predictors in a bootstrap forest to determine significant band combinations to predict water clarity. A SD model for MSI (SDMSI) was then developed using a calibration dataset consisting of log-transformed SDin situ measurements (InSDin situ) from 79 optically variable freshwater inland lakes collected within +/- 1 day of satellite overpass on 23-Aug 2017 (MAE = 0.53 m) and validated with 276 samples collected within +/- 1 day of a 12-Sep 2017 image (MAE = 0.66 m) across three ecoregions in Minnesota, USA. A separate SD model for MSI was also developed using similar spectral bands present on the OLI sensor (SDsOLI) where cross sensor performance can be evaluated during coincident overpass events. SDsOLI applied to both MSI and OLI (SDOLI) models were further validated using two coincident overpass sets of imagery on 27-Sep 2017 (n = 18) and 13-Aug 2018 (n = 43), yielding a range of error from 0.25 to 0.67 m. Potential sources of model errors and limitations are discussed. Data derived from this multi-sensor methodology is anticipated to be used by researchers, lake resource managers, and citizens to expedite the pre-processing steps so that actionable information can be retrieved for decision making.

AB Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle, but the quantification of the spatial and temporal variations in photosynthesis is still largely uncertain. Our work aimed to investigate the potential of remote sensing to provide new insights into plant photosynthesis at a fine spatial resolution. This goal was achieved by exploiting high-resolution images acquired with the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) airborne demonstrator HyPlant. The sensor was flown over a mixed forest, and the images collected were elaborated to obtain two independent indicators of plant photosynthesis. First, maps of sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F), a novel indicator of plant photosynthetic activity, were successfully obtained at both the red and far-red peaks (r(2) = 0.89 and p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.77 and p < 0.01, respectively, compared to top-of-canopy ground-based measurements acquired synchronously with the overflight) over the forested study area. Second, maps of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) were derived using a customised version of the coupled biophysical model Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). The model was driven with airborne-derived maps of key forest traits (i.e., leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf area index (LAI)) and meteorological data providing a high-resolution snapshot of the variables of interest across the study site. The LCC and LAI were accurately estimated (RMSE = 5.66 mu g cm(-2) and RMSE = 0.51 m(2)m(-2), respectively) through an optimised Look-Up-Table-based inversion of the PROSPECT-4-INFORM radiative transfer model, ensuring the accurate representation of the spatial variation of these determinants of the ecosystem's functionality. The spatial relationships between the measured F and modelled BESS outputs were then analysed to interpret the variability of ecosystem functioning at a regional scale. The results showed that far-red F is significantly correlated with the GPP (r(2) = 0.46, p < 0.001) and APAR (r(2) = 0.43, p < 0.001) in the spatial domain and that this relationship is nonlinear. Conversely, no statistically significant relationships were found between the red F and the GPP or APAR (p > 0.05). The spatial relationships found at high resolution provide valuable insight into the critical role of spatial heterogeneity in controlling the relationship between the far-red F and the GPP, indicating the need to consider this heterogeneity at a coarser resolution.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from satellite remote sensing data has become a key parameter in research on global environmental change; therefore, the acquisition of accurate satellite-derived LST information is crucial for the diagnosis and analysis of global change. However, it is relatively difficult to obtain the true value of a pixel due to the scale mismatch between in situ measurements and satellite-based observations, especially for commonly heterogeneous and nonisothermal land areas, which greatly increases the difficulty in estimating pixel-representative LST values from in situ measurements for validation of satellite-based LST products. In this study, a supplemented radiance-based (SR-based) validation method was developed to evaluate the latest moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Level 2 daily LST/land surface emissivity (LSE) products over a heterogeneous and nonisothermal region of the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project, West China. In the SR-based framework, pixel-representative LST values are simulated by the MODTRAN model from the corresponding in situ measurements, such as LSE and atmospheric profile measurements, to evaluate the MODIS LST products. The validation results show that the MODIS daytime LST products from the Aqua satellite (MYD11_L2) have a greater accuracy than those from the Terra satellite (MOD11_L2). Analyses of the effect factors indicate a strong correlation between the errors in the MOD11_L2 LST product and the corresponding difference in the MODIS brightness temperature between bands 31 and 32. Although the requirement of synchronous or quasisynchronous in situ measurements for the validated LST products may limit the applicability of the SR-based method, it is still an effective and simple method for validating satellite-derived LST products over mixed pixels. Our method is an indispensable supplement for the validation methods of satellite-derived LST products, and it can be applied in West China and other areas with heterogeneous land surfaces.

AB The present study mainly focuses on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and adjoining areas, in the Arabian Peninsula, coming under the arid/semi-arid climatic conditions. The extremely intermittent rainfall strongly hinders the economic growth of this region. The freshwater primarily comes from the desalination of seawater along with other resources such as groundwater in the UAE region. Nevertheless, the declining groundwater reserves and expensive desalination approach have made to search for alternative sources for rain enhancement and one such approach is through the cloud seeding. However, there are barely few studies concentrated on the occurrence frequency of clouds and seasonal variability including their natural microphysics and dynamics that is crucial for precipitation augmentation through cloud seeding. Hence, the present study uses two geostationary satellites, namely, Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-10, due to their higher spatiotemporal observations in this region. The two geostationary satellites scan the UAE and adjoining regions in different view angles due to their positioning in different longitudes. Therefore, the Meteosat-8 has more advantage than Meteosat-10 in terms of the biases associated with the angular view and spatial resolution over the UAE and adjoining regions. Hence, the present study also evaluates the biases related to cloud occurrence due to different view angles.
   The winter (February March) and summer (June August) seasons indicate the frequent occurrence of clouds with distinct spatial distribution in these arid/semi-arid areas. The Arabian Gulf shows a higher percentage of clouds during winter while frequent convective clouds are noticed during summer over the Al Hajar Mountains. The evaluation of liquid and ice clouds also indicates that the warm cloud percentage is higher over the mountainous regions. However, the ice cloud distribution is higher over the Arabian Gulf during winter while they are highly confined along the Al Hajar Mountains in summer. The evaluation of cloud cover from Meteosat-10 and Meteosat-8 indicates the former shows higher occurrence percentage than the later. The significant biases are noted in warm cloud occurrence along the-mountainous regions from both the satellites. The fractional occurrence of rain is also estimated for different seasons based cloud liquid water path that provides key information to the seedable convective clouds. Therefore, the present study finds significant implications to the rain enhancement over arid and semi-arid regions in the Arabian Peninsula.

AB Evaporation from open surface water is a critical and continuous process in the water cycle. Globally, evaporation losses from reservoirs are estimated to be greater than the combined consumption from industrial and domestic water uses. However, this large volume of water loss is only coarsely considered in modern water resources management practices due to the complexities involved with quantifying these losses. By fusing remote sensing and modeling approaches, this study developed a novel method to accurately estimate the evaporation losses from 721 reservoirs in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Reservoir surface areas were extracted and enhanced from the Landsat based Global Surface Water Dataset (GSWD) from March 1984 to October 2015. The evaporation rate was modeled using the Penman Equation in which the lake heat storage term was considered. Validation results using in situ observations suggest that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated monthly reservoir evaporation rate. The evaporation losses were subsequently estimated as the product of the surface area and evaporation rate. This paper presents a first of its kind, comprehensively validated, locally practical, and continentally consistent reservoir evaporation dataset. The results suggest that the long term averaged annual evaporation volume from these 721 reservoirs is 33.73 x 10(9) m(3), which is equivalent to 93% of the annual public water supply of the United States (in 2010). An increasing trend of the evaporation rate (0.0076 mm/d/year) and a slightly decreasing trend of the total surface area (-0.011 x 10(9) m(2)/year) were both detected during the study period. As a result, the total evaporation shows an insignificant trend, yet with significant spatial heterogeneity. This new reservoir evaporation dataset can help facilitate more efficient water management practices.

AB Thermal images of water bodies often show a radiance gradient perpendicular to the banks. This effect is frequently due to mixed land and water thermal pixels. In the case of the Landsat images, radiance mixing can also affect pure water pixels due the cubic convolution resampling of the native thermal measurements. Some authors recommended a general-purpose margin of two thermal pixels to the banks or a minimum river width of three pixels, to avoid near bank effects in water temperature retrievals. Given the relatively course spatial resolution of satellite thermal sensors, the three pixel margin severely restricts their application to temperature mapping in many rivers. This study proposes a new algorithm to enhance the retrieval of stream surface temperature using Landsat 8 thermal data, although it is also applicable to Landsat 7 and Landsat 5. The aim is not to perform a subpixel radiance unmixing but to refine the selection of unmixed, reliable pixels for temperature mapping. For this purpose, the spatial arrangement of native Landsat thermal pixels is approximated, and pure water pixels in the downscaled thermal band are selected accordingly. The least-favourable cubic convolution near-bank radiance mixing is simulated on image basis. Only pure thermal water pixels unaffected by the simulated worst case resampling are selected. The algorithm allowed retrieving water surface temperature in reaches down to 120 m wide, clearly improving the existing three pixel, i.e. 300 m for Landsat 8, recommendation. The enhancing algorithm was applied to a reach in the Ebro River reach, Spain. It provided spatially distributed temperatures in narrow parts, upstream and downstream of a wide reservoir, offering new insight of the overall impact of the reservoir over the river thermal regime.

AB The thermal domain (TIR; 2.5-15 mu m) delivers unique measurements of plant characteristics that are not possible in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, these TIR measurements have largely been restricted to laboratory leaf level or coarse spatial resolutions due to the lack of suitable data from airborne and spaceborne instruments. The airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) provides an opportunity to retrieve high spectral resolution emissivity and land surface temperature (LST) that can be exploited for canopy level vegetation research. This study is a high spatial resolution analysis of plant species' emissivity and LST using HyTES imagery acquired in the Huntington Botanical Gardens on 2014 July 5 and 2016 Jan 25. Leaf and canopy emissivity variation was identified among 24 plant species and used to determine leaf to canopy scaling capabilities. HyTES LST patterns among species and dates were quantified and correlated to LiDAR derived tree canopy attributes. At the leaf scale, one third of the species showed distinct spectral separation from other species. However, at the canopy scale most species were not spectrally separable. Random forest classification demonstrates the high level of confusion between species with overall accuracies < 40%. LST data, derived from TIR measurements, showed that species exhibited significantly different distributions between dates and species. These distributions were largely explained by canopy structure (e.g. tree height and canopy density) and composition of neighboring pixels (e.g. presence of pavement versus trees). While species do not exhibit unique emissivity signatures at the canopy level, the LST variation among species provides a stronger understanding of LST variability in coarser resolution TIR imagery. This study represents the analysis of vegetation characteristics using the NASA's HyTES TIR sensor, opening the door for future remote sensing vegetation studies that include using the recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission.

AB Low-intensity tillage has become more popular among farmers in the United States and many other regions. However, accurate data on when and where low-intensity tillage methods are being used remain scarce, and this scarcity impedes understanding of the factors affecting the adoption and the agronomic or environmental impacts of these practices. In this study, we used composites of satellite imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and Sentinel-1 in combination with producer data from about 5900 georeferenced fields to train a random forest classifier and generate annual large-scale maps of tillage intensity from 2005 to 2016. We tested different combinations of hyper-parameters using cross-validation, splitting the training and testing data alternatively by field, year, and state to assess the influence of clustering on validation results and evaluate the generalizability of the classification model. We found that the best model was able to map tillage practices across the entire North Central US region at 30 m-resolution with accuracies spanning between 75% and 79%, depending on the validation approach. We also found that although Sentinel-1 provides an independent measure that should be sensitive to surface moisture and roughness, it currently adds relatively little to classification performance beyond what is possible with Landsat. When aggregated to the state level, the satellite estimates of percentage low- and high-intensity tillage agreed well with a USDA survey on tillage practices in 2006 (R-2 = 0.55). The satellite data also revealed clear increases in low-intensity tillage area for most counties in the past decade. Overall, the ability to accurately map spatial and temporal patterns in tillage should facilitate further study of this important practice in the United States, as well as other regions with fewer survey-based estimates.

AB Various aspects of the water qualities of the large lakes in the Yangtze Plain (YP) have been studied, while the efforts have been spent on one of the most important parameters-water transparency were only limited to several large lakes. Using in situ remote sensing reflectance and Secchi-disk depth (Z(sd)) datasets, we assessed the performance of a semi-analytical model recently proposed by Lee et al. (2015) for remote sensing of the Z(sd) (Z(sd), (Lee)). The results show that a linear scaling correction over Z(sd), (Lee) (Z(sd)', (Lee)) could lead to improved agreement between remote sensing estimates and field measurements (root mean square error < 35%) in the study region. The Z(sd)'(,) (Lee) scheme was then applied to MODIS/Aqua observations between 2003 and 2016 to obtain the spatial and temporal dynamics of water transparency in 50 large lakes in the YP. The long-term mean Z(sd) of the entire region was 0.39 +/- 1.17 m during the observation period, with high and low values occurring in warm and cold seasons, respectively. Of the 50 examined lakes, half demonstrated decreasing or increasing Z(sd) trends, and the number of lakes exhibiting significantly decreasing trends also comparable to the number exhibiting increasing trends. The relative contributions of the seven potential driving factors (from both human activities and natural processes) to the interannual changes in water clarity were quantified for each lake using a multiple general linear model regression analysis. The responses of Z(sd) to these drivers showed considerable differences among lakes, and human activities demonstrated significant roles in more lakes than those affected by natural variability, accounting for 50% (25/50) and 20% (10/50) of the lakes, respectively. This study provides the first comprehensive basin-scale estimate of the water transparency in the lakes in the YP, and the Z(sd) results and analysis of driving forces can provide important information for local water quality conservation and restoration.

AB Satellite ocean color datasets have vast potentials for assessing and monitoring of marine environments. However, with the MODIS sensor aging and the VIIRS sensor reaching maturity, it is important to continuously evaluate the quality of reflectance data from both instruments. Here, we critically assess the statistical performance of both MODIS and VIIRS, including analysis of two separate (and commonly used) VIIRS processing routines. In addition, we note variability in the literature as to the methods used to identify and remove low quality data during similar validation exercises. Although most studies use some implementation of satellite quality flags (L2 flags) and many exclude data based on spatial heterogeneity or large temporal gap from satellite overpasses, critical assessment of these methods indicates variable performance. Indeed, we found little improvement in validation statistics after implementation of these data culling techniques, with substantial variability in effectiveness between wavebands and sensors. Overall, these findings highlight the need to critically assess the impact (on both data quantity and quality) of exclusion criteria, towards more effective techniques to ensure quality and consistency of satellite ocean color datasets.

AB Due to its close link to the photosynthetic process, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) opens new possibilities to study dynamics of photosynthetic light reactions and to quantify CO2 assimilation rates. Although recent studies show that F is linearly related to gross primary production (GPP) on coarse spatial and temporal scales, it is argued that this relationship may be mainly driven by seasonal changes in absorbed photochemical active radiation (APAR) and less by the plant light use efficiency (LUE).
   In this work a high-resolution spectrometer was used to continuously measure red and far-red fluorescence and different reflectance indices within a sugar beet field during the growing season in 2015. Diurnal and seasonal developments were compared to eddy covariance derived GPP.
   Additionally, part of the time series coincided with a heatwave. The induced drought stress allowed us to observe F and its relationship to GPP under changing environmental conditions during the seasonal cycle.
   Across the season a strong linear relationship between GPP and F750 was found. This relationship however, was mainly driven by changes in APAR and was strongly reduced under drought conditions. We could show that far-red fluorescence yield can explain 59% of the diurnal and 79% of the seasonal variance in the light use efficiency. However, an even stronger relationship between FY760 and the structural vegetation index MTVI2 was found, implying that FY760 is affected by seasonal structural changes of the canopy. Nevertheless, the seasonally de-trended FY760 and PRI show that they share strong interdependencies with seasonal and diurnal LUE, in particular under drought stress conditions.

AB Agricultural land now exceeds forests as the dominant global biome. Because of their global dominance, and potential expansion or loss, methods to estimate biomass and carbon in agricultural areas are necessary for monitoring global terrestrial carbon stocks and predicting carbon dynamics. Agricultural areas in the tropics have substantial tree cover and associated above ground biomass (AGB) and carbon. Active remote sensing data, such as airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging), can provide accurate estimates of biomass stocks, but common plot-based methods may not be suitable for agricultural areas with dispersed and heterogeneous tree cover. The objectives of this research are to quantify AGB of a tropical agricultural landscape using a tree-based method that directly incorporates the size of individual trees, and to understand how landscape estimates of AGB from a tree-based method compare to estimates from a plot-based method. We use high-resolution (1.12 m) airborne LiDAR data collected on a 9280-ha region of the Azuero Peninsula of Panama. We model individual tree AGB with canopy dimensions from the LiDAR data. We apply the model to individual tree crown polygons and aggregate AGB estimates to compare with previously developed plot-based estimates. We find that agricultural trees are a distinct and dominant part of our study site. The tree-based approach estimates greater AGB in pixels with low forest cover than the plot-based approach, resulting a 2-fold difference in landscape AGB estimates between the methods for non-forested areas. Additionally, one third of the total landscape AGB exists in areas having < 10% cover, based on a global tree cover product. Our study supports the continued use and development of allometric models to predict individual tree biomass from LiDAR-derived canopy dimensions and demonstrates the potential for spatial information from high-resolution data, such as relative isolation of canopies, to improve allometric models.

AB Fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals are now routinely made from polar and geostationary instruments, providing a means to estimate fuel consumption and trace gas and aerosol emissions directly from remotely sensed observations. This study presents the first investigation of the impact of vegetation canopy structure (percentage canopy cover and leaf area index, LAI) on FRP retrievals, based on 3D radiative transfer model simulations. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is used to simulate above-canopy observations made through 3D vegetation canopies with different structural arrangements, under which a centrally positioned uniform landscape fire is burning. The vegetation canopy is modelled in two ways, as an opaque structure and as a hybrid turbid medium. The percentage canopy cover in each simulated scene is varied between 5 and 95%, and the FRP retrieved above the canopy is found to decrease in proportion to percentage canopy cover when the canopy is opaque, a finding that is in agreement with a series of small scale outdoor measurements conducted to evaluate the realism of the simulations. However, when the canopy is modelled as a turbid medium, which is in some ways a more realistic representation of a real 'gappy' vegetation canopy, the degree of FRP interception occurring at any particular canopy cover decreases by similar to 14%, due to some fire emitted thermal energy being transmitted through the canopy gaps. The simulations also reveal the impact of canopy LAI on above-canopy FRP retrievals, reducing these by 6% when both canopy cover and LAI are low (5% and < 1.0 respectively), but by up to 92% when canopy cover and scene LAI are high (95% and similar to 8 respectively). We use the derived relationships between FRP interception and canopy structure, along with MODIS LAI and percentage tree cover data, to adjust 2004-2012 fire radiative energy (FRE) estimates calculated from FRP data collected by the geostationary Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument. The adjusted annual FRE is on average 15% greater than estimated, and is characterized by low inter-annual variability as result of the majority of fire activity occurring in areas where percentage tree cover remains below 40%. Landscape burning occurs more frequently in areas of higher tree cover in southern hemisphere rather than northern hemisphere Africa, leading to a larger annual FRE adjustment (18.5% compared to 16.3%). This study illustrates the impact that canopy interception has on FRP for the first time at the satellite scale, and over Africa demonstrates a large but temporally consistent underestimation which can be accounted for using LAI and percentage tree cover metrics when estimating fuel consumption and atmospheric emissions from the FRP retrievals.

AB A semi-empirical model of the ocean surface is developed for the compact-polarimetry (CP) mode of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which will be a main product of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), scheduled for launch in November 2018. The fundamental mechanism for the semi-empirical model is the interactions between sea surface waves and the radar microwave. Sea surface waves are generated by ocean surface winds and may be modulated by precipitation or oceanic processes, such as surface currents, internal waves (IWs), and surfactants (e.g. oil spill, and sea ice). Model results for normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) induced by ocean winds are validated against a database we developed. The ocean wind vectors were observed by in situ buoys of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC); the RCM NRCSs are obtained from a "CP simulator", using composites of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol SAR images. We simulate the dependencies of the NRCSs on wind speeds and incidence angles, for up-wind (wind direction is 0 degrees) and cross-wind (wind direction is 90 degrees) conditions. And we report the potential abilities and limitations of ocean winds monitoring using the RCM CP mode, as well as suggest that the RV-pol should be suitable for hurricane monitoring in the future. As hurricanes containing high winds are generally associated with heavy rain conditions, we discuss the possible mechanisms for precipitation effects related to the RV- and RH-polarizations by simulating two effects on the ocean surface waves. Moreover, we suggest that the RCM CP mode is better able to monitor the ocean surface currents than the fully polarimetry SAR systems (e.g. RADARSAT-2), because of the associated large swath and the possible continuous images of three RCM satellites.

AB Simultaneous measurements of ocean surface current and wind vectors at the ocean submesoscale (O [1-10 km]) are needed to improve our understanding of upper ocean mixing, air-sea interactions, ocean biophysical processes and large-scale oceanic transports. A new satellite mission concept called SEASTAR aims to do just that. The concept is a Ku-band along-track interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system with two squinted beams pointing +/- 45 degrees from broadside and incidence angles around 30 degrees. The paper presents an inversion strategy to retrieve simultaneously ocean surface current and wind vectors and reports on the performance obtained with different wind/current conditions and instrument configurations. Results are based on numerical simulations using a Bayesian approach and existing geophysical model functions (GMFs) of the microwave Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) and Doppler shift.
   Using the baseline two-look instrument configuration and realistic instrument noise figures (radiometric resolution: k(p) = 5 and 12%; Delta df = 2 and 5 Hz), the root-mean square errors (RMSE) of the retrieved current and wind vectors are typically better than [0.1 m/s, 10 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 5 degrees] for wind. This inversion setup yields four ambiguous solutions within a current range of similar to 1 m/s. The addition of dual polarization (VV, HH) capability helps to discriminate these ambiguities. The retrieval performance depends weakly on geophysical parameters such as wind speed, current velocity or current direction, but is sensitive to wind direction because of its strong effect on current retrieval through the wind-wave induced artifact surface velocity (WASV). Larger retrieval errors are obtained when the wind is aligned with one of the antenna line-of-sight (LoS) directions, although errors remain typically below [0.2 m/s, 25 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 15 degrees] for wind. Improving the retrieval performance regardless of wind direction could be achieved either with lower noise figures sigma(0), or with higher incidence angles, or by including an additional third-look direction in azimuth (e.g. to achieve a configuration similar to Metop/ASCAT scatterometers) as per the SEASTAR mission concept submitted to EE10.

AB Precipitation products with high spatial resolution are important for basin-scale hydrological and meteorological applications. Downscaling techniques commonly used with satellite-derived rainfall data build statistical regression relationships between the precipitation and land surface characteristics to obtain rainfall estimates with improved spatial resolution. However, these relationships tend to be extended mistakenly from the regional scale to the hill slope scale. This paper introduces a quadratic parabolic profile (QPP) model for downscaling precipitation. The proposed technique uses a quadratic parabolic equation to express the rule for changes of precipitation with elevation. It is assumed that precipitation is the primary factor restricting vegetation growth during the growing season. Therefore, an ordinary least square regression method is used to fit an "elevation-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)" function to determine the parameters of the QPP model. This method was implemented in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) during the growing seasons of 2009-2013 for both monthly and total precipitation. The results indicated that the precipitation estimates downscaled using the QPP method had higher accuracies than those of commonly used exponential regression, multiple linear regression, and geographically weighted regression models. The average root mean square errors (RMSEs) and mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) of total precipitation during the growing season of the commonly used models were 17%-69% and 17%-92% higher, respectively, than those of the QPP model. Meanwhile, the precipitation downscaled using the QPP technique also had lower MAPEs and RMSEs than the PERSIANN-CCS, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP-RNL, and GSMaP-RNLG products. Downscaled precipitation estimates from the QPP model exhibited patterns with elevation that were more detailed and more reliable than from the commonly used downscaling methods and another four satellite products. In addition, the QPP model is insensitive to errors in the NDVI or elevation. These findings suggest the proposed approach could be implemented successfully to downscale both monthly and total precipitation of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product throughout the growing season in the TRHR.

AB A method to assess global land surface water (fw) inundation dynamics was developed by exploiting the enhanced fw sensitivity of L-band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The L-band fw (fw(LBand)) retrievals were derived using SMAP H-polarization brightness temperature (T-b) observations and predefined L-band reference microwave emissivities for water and land end-members. Potential soil moisture and vegetation contributions to the microwave signal were represented from overlapping higher frequency T-b observations from AMSR2. The resulting fw(LBand) global record has high temporal sampling (1-3 days) and 36-km spatial resolution. The fw(LBand) annual averages corresponded favorably (R = 0.85, p-value < 0.001) with a 250-m resolution static global water map (MOD44W) aggregated at the same spatial scale, while capturing significant inundation variations worldwide. The monthly fw(LBand) averages also showed seasonal inundation changes consistent with river discharge records within six major US river basins. An uncertainty analysis indicated generally reliable fw(LBand) performance for major land cover areas and under low to moderate vegetation cover, but with lower accuracy for detecting water bodies covered by dense vegetation. Finer resolution (30-m)fw(LBand) results were obtained for three sub-regions in North America using an empirical downscaling approach and ancillary global Water Occurrence Dataset (WOD) derived from the historical Landsat record. The resulting 30-m fw(LBand) retrievals showed favorable spatial accuracy for water (commission error 31.46%, omission error 30.20%) and land (commission error 0.87%, omission error 0.96%) classifications and seasonal wet and dry periods when compared to independent water maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery. The new fw(LBand) algorithms and continuing SMAP and AMSR2 operations provide for near real-time, multi-scale monitoring of global surface water inundation dynamics and potential flood risk.

AB With the maturation of methods for estimating aboveground forest biomass by remote sensing, researchers increasingly need test data, particularly ground reference data, that are large enough to fine-tune existing approaches and test their robustness under diverse conditions. In this context, realistic synthetic datasets present an interesting alternative to costly and limited field data. Here, we present a new approach to simulate realistic canopy height and cover type data by combining an individual-tree forest simulator with real LiDAR point clouds of individual trees.
   We demonstrate the utility of our approach by re-examining the influence of field plot size on the predictive power of remote-sensing models for biomass estimation. Our approach with a complete (wall-to-wall) field reference dataset and matching synthetic remote sensing data allowed us to not only perform internal cross-validations with field plots that were used to fit the model (as in studies with real data), but to also consider the quality of model predictions to a standardized spatial grid or to the entire region.
   Our results confirm earlier reports of smaller predictive errors with increased field plot sizes under internal model validation (RMSE of 125 t/ha at 10 m field plot size and RMSE of 40 t/ha for 50 m field plots). However, we show that this is mainly an artifact of comparing the models with the same data they were fit, thus with validation data of different scales. When validating on a grid with standardized scale, smaller field plots performed almost equally well as larger field plots (small RMSE decrease between 4 t/ha and 7 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots), and even outperformed them if we assumed that increasing the plot size means that fewer field plots can be obtained (small RMSE increase between 9 t/ha and 12 t/ha when going from 10 m to 50 m plots).
   We conclude that synthetic remote sensing datasets are a useful tool for method testing. The suggested approach may be used to reexamine our current methodological understanding, which is often based on tests with real data of very limited sizes, as well as to optimize workflows, model choices and data collection. A wider use of synthetic data could be instrumental in improving remote sensing methodology.

AB Recent studies have developed novel long-term records of surface water (SW) maps on continental and global scales but due to the spatial and temporal resolution constraints of available satellite sensors, they are either of high spatial and low temporal resolution or vice versa. In this study, we address this limitation by exploring two approaches for generating an 8-day series of Landsat resolution (30 m) SW maps for three floodplain sites in south-eastern Australia during the 2010 La Nina Floods. Firstly, we applied a generalized additive regression model (GAM) that empirically relates Landsat-based SW extent to in-situ river flow to then predict additional time steps. Secondly, we used the STARFM and ESTARFM blending algorithms for predicting the Open Water Likelihood at 8-daily intervals and 30 m resolution from Landsat and MODIS imagery. ESTARFM outperformed STARFM and best blending accuracies were achieved in the floodplain site with the slowest changes in inundation extent through time. There was good agreement between the blended and statistically-modeled 8-day SW series and both series provided new and temporally consistent information about changes in inundation extent throughout the flooding cycles. After careful consideration of accuracy limitations and model assumptions, these SW records hold great potential for assimilation into hydrodynamic and hydrological models as well as improved management of terrestrial freshwater ecosystems.

AB The clumping index (CI) characterizes the grouping of foliage relative to a random spatial distribution of leaves and is an important structural parameter for plant canopies that can influence canopy radiation regimes. Consequently, the CI is very useful for ecological and meteorological models. One method used to retrieve the CIs of plant canopies is to construct a linear relationship between the CI and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index. This method requires a particularly accurate reconstruction of hotspot signatures, which are difficult to measure. In this study, we propose a framework to retrieve CIs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, which are generally based on linear CI-NDHD equations. The main algorithm is designed to retrieve CIs in the closed interval [0.33, 1.00]. This range is derived from the CI-NDHD equations and is thus called as the physical range here, although a modified lower boundary can be implemented in the future if necessary. If CIs are outside of this range, then a backup algorithm is designed to reprocess these so-called outlier CIs. The hotspot-adjusted version of the RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) model (i.e., the RTCLSR model) is employed to reconstruct the hotspot signatures for the MODIS BRDF parameters. This method simplifies the hotspot reconstruction by using two hotspot parameters that are not distinctly scale-dependent particularly in the context of an inhomogeneous coarse spatial resolution. To evaluate this algorithm framework, we collect dozens of global field-measured CIs and calculate their determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias relative to MODIS CIs derived using both the main algorithm and the backup algorithm. Our results show that this framework can derive MODIS CIs with a high accuracy (i.e., R-2 = 0.80 (0.72), RMSE = 0.07 (0.12), bias = -0.03 (-0.10)) using the main (backup) algorithms and that it shows promise for various ecological applications, especially in combination with the leaf area index (LAI).

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Drought Severity Index (DSI) can be produced at a 1-km spatial resolution and can be used for a wide range of water-resource and ecological applications. This study aims to understand the robustness and sensitivity of the DSI in East Asia, and we investigate the performance of the annual DSI using different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. Additionally, the MODIS-based DSI is compared to other drought indices, including the DSI with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI (DSIAviiRR) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Three different drought indices are estimated in East Asia from 2000 to 2013 and compared via a correlation analysis based on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. Specifically, the correlation between the DSI and DSIAvHRR is relatively high (0.796), which suggests the potential use of the DSI based on combined products that include parameters such as the NDVI, although the DSI originally used only MODIS-based products. Characteristics such as the frequency and spatial extent of droughts based on the DSI are compared to those based on the SPEI using the drought classification schemes that were originally proposed for the SPEI and DSI, including mild, moderate, severe and extremely dry classes. Based on the results, we suggest a revised classification according to a comparison of the DSI and SPEI. The frequency and spatial extent results of the SPEI and DSI exhibit good agreement when using this classification. Moreover, the DSI from the revised classification is used to evaluate drought events in East Asia in 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Overall, this study shows the potential of using the DSI with datasets that differ from the originally suggested datasets; however, caution must be taken when classifying and identifying drought events.

AB In this paper, the decadal datasets available from the space-borne lidar, Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) are analyzed in order to understand the spatial and vertical distributions of aerosols at a global scale. Decadal (September 2006 August 2016) Level 3 night time Standard All-sky data products, created using quality controlled Level 2 datasets are utilized in the study. Columnar aerosol properties are discussed in conjugation with vertical properties of the three major aerosol types i.e. dust, polluted dust and smoke. It is found that the global mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) amounts to 0.10, with AOD values of 0.13 and 0.09 for land and ocean respectively, during the last decade. Mean aerosol extinction coefficients are also reported for four altitude bins i.e. 0-1 km, 1-2 km, 2-3 km and 3-4 km above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.). It is observed that dust and smoke particles have stronger vertical transport compared to polluted dust particles, which are generally found to be confined within the lower altitudes. In order to observe the changes in aerosol loading over different parts of the globe, de-seasonalized trends of AOD and vertical extinction coefficients are computed using linear regression technique. Globally, the total columnar particle load shows a significant negative trend during the last decade. In particular, trends of total particle loading (AOD and extinction) are decreasing over North America, South America, East China and Australia. However, the smoke emissions (columnar and vertically distributed) have increased over India, Russia, North America, Australia and Central Africa. This is of concern in the context of rising temperatures accompanied with increasing wildfires throughout the globe. Additionally, enhanced levels of polluted dust over the developing regions of Africa and Asia are also revealed.

AB Supraglacial debris complicates the melting state of debris-covered glaciers, and whether debris increases or decreases the rate of glacier melt is ambiguous according to different observations. In this paper, we aim to determine the potential factors that influence changes in thickness of debris-covered glaciers. First, we present the thickness changes of a large debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain using high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from three periods in 2000, 2009 and 2013. It is shown that the thickness changes differ greatly over the debris-covered portions of the glacier. These debris-covered regions can be divided into three parts along the glacier axis according to the rate of thickness change. Specifically, these parts include the zone of minimal change, the zone of heavy thinning, and the zone of slight thinning. Detailed information on the closely related factors, including the debris thickness, which was measured across the whole glacier during our field work, and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes detected on high-resolution satellite images, are combined to determine the reasons for the differences in melting state among the three zones. The results show that the thickness changes of the debris-covered glacier are jointly influenced by debris thickness and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes; moreover, the dominant factor differs among the different zones. The critical debris thickness, which mostly appears in the minimal change zone and accelerates glacier melting, as confirmed through field observations, is not associated with glacier thinning because its location is close to the accumulation zone. The regions where the rates of thinning are greatest coincide with the regions where the ice cliffs are densest. Where the debris is thicker than 1 m on average, the glacier is still thinning slightly due to the presence of ice cliffs and lakes. It is proven that the quantity and area of the ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes is the key to understanding the melting rate of debris covered glacier.

AB Remote sensing based geodetic observations can be used as alternatives data to map glacier height changes because the harsh environment complicates in situ observations. In this study, we analysed five pairs of X-band bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images from 2011 and 2014 for Mt. Everest (Qomolangma). Glacier height changes were derived using the D-InSAR method respect to SRTM DEM of 2000. An iterative D-InSAR method using multi -baseline bistatic SAR interferograms was employed, which increased reliability and accuracy of glacier height changing observations. From 2000 to similar to 2012, the geodetic glacier mass balance for the Mt. Everest and the surrounding region was - 0.38 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1). The spatial pattern of the glacier mass loss was heterogeneous. The regional heterogeneity may possibly reflect debris-covering rates, terminating type, temperature rising rates and glacier flow rates. Comparison to long-period geodetic glacier mass balance data provided by previous studies since 1970 revealed that our results showed more rapid increases in the glacier mass loss rates after 2000 in the area around Khumbu Glacier in the southern slope of the Mt. Everest, whereas glacier mass loss rates kept stable in the Rongbuk Catchment at its northern slope.

AB Shortwave radiation (0.3-3.0 mu m) is a dominant component of land surface all-wave radiation budget. Reliable estimation of shortwave radiation throughout the globe is particularly important for an in-depth understanding of global changes. Unfortunately, a large number of existing space-based algorithms ignore the effects of topography by simply assuming that the surface is ideally flat. As pointed out by many studies, such neglect toward topographic effects leads to significant errors in derived radiation. This study proposes a shortwave topographic radiation model (SWTRM) by quantifying solar direct radiation shielding, occlusion of sky radiation, reflected radiation from nearby terrain, and invisibility of certain targets. To drive the SWTRM, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was employed to generate multiple components of the shortwave radiation budget. The new model was run over the Tibetan Plateau region and used MODIS products coupled with digital elevation data (DEM). Topographically corrected shortwave fluxes were derived by coupling SWTRM and ANN outputs. The results show that: (1) the proposed SWTRM works well over mountainous regions; (2) the ANN-based shortwave model provides reasonable retrieval accuracy (RMSE < 60 W/m(2), bias < 13 W/m(2) for all shortwave radiation components). More importantly, the ANN model can simultaneously provide all radiation components that are indispensable for driving the SWTRM; (3) over mountainous areas, the induced error can exceed 600 W/m(2) for shortwave net flux. Hence, topographic effects cannot be neglected; and (4) topography and solar illumination angle are key modulators in deriving shortwave radiation from space, which control the magnitude and spatial distribution of shortwave radiation over mountainous regions.

AB A major issue in land cover mapping is classifier selection. Here we investigated classifier performance under different sample sizes, reference class distribution, and scene complexities. Twenty six 10 km x 10 km blocks with complete reference information across the continental US are used. Per-pixel classification took place using six spectral bands from Landsat imagery. The tested classifiers included Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap-aggregation ensemble of decision trees (BagTE), artificial neural network up to 2 hidden layers, and deep neural network (DNN) up to 3 hidden layers. For the entire block, our accuracy assessment indicated that all classifiers, with the exception of NB (a Maximum Likelihood variant), performed similarly. However, when we concentrated on edge pixels (pixels at the border of adjacent land cover classes), it was clear that the SVM and KNN offer considerable accuracy advantages, especially for larger reference datasets. Because of their relatively low execution times SVM and KNN would be recommended for classifications using Landsat's spectral inputs and Anderson's 11-level classification scheme. However, both SVM and KNN demonstrated substantial accuracy degradation during the parameter grid search. For this reason, an exhaustive parameter optimization process is suggested. While the ANN and DNN neural network variants did not perform as well, their performance may have been restricted by the lack of rich contextual information in our simple six band per-pixel input space. The effect of class distribution in the training dataset was also evident on the calculated accuracy metric. Gradual accuracy degradation as edge pixel presence increased was also observed. Future work could focus on data-rich classification problems such as change detection using Landsat stacks or expand in high spectral or spatial resolution sensors.

AB A consistent dataset delineating and characterizing changes in urban environments will be valuable for socio-economic and environmental research and for sustainable urban development. Remotely sensed data have been long used to map urban extent and infrastructure at various spatial and spectral resolutions. Although many datasets and approaches have been tried, there is not yet a universal way to map urban extents across the world. Here we combined a microwave scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset at similar to 1 km posting with percent impervious surface area (%ISA) data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) that was generated from Landsat data, and ambient population data from the LandScan product to characterize and quantify growth in nine major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend tests on backscatter time series from urban areas show significant expanding trends in eight of nine urban areas with p-values ranging 0.032 to 0.001. The sole exception is Houston, which has a substantial non-urban backscatter at the northeastern edge of the urban core. Strong power law scaling relationships between ambient population and either urban area or backscatter power (r(2) of 0.96 in either model) with sub-linear exponents (beta of 0.911 and 0.866, respectively) indicate urban areas become more compact with more vertical built-up structure than lateral expansion to accommodate the increased population. Increases in backscatter and %ISA datasets between 2001 and 2006 show agreement in both magnitude and direction for all urban areas except Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP), likely due to the presence of many lakes and ponds throughout the MSP metropolitan area. We conclude discussing complexities in the backscatter data caused by large metal structures and rainfall.

AB Remotely sensed (RS) data are becoming increasingly important as sources of auxiliary information in forest resource assessments. Data from several satellites providing moderate image resolution are freely available (e.g. Sentinel-2). In addition, very-high-resolution three-dimensional data are available due to the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The increasing availability of auxiliary data offers new opportunities for largescale forest surveys using UAVs. A recently developed hierarchical model-based mode of inference makes it possible to use hierarchically nested auxiliary data in estimating population properties, such as total or mean biomass or volume, and their corresponding uncertainties in a statistically appropriate manner. In this study, hierarchical model-based inference was used to estimate growing stock volume (GSV; m(3) ha(-1)) and its variance using a small sample of field data, a larger sample of UAV data, and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data in a study area in SE Norway. The main objective of the study was to compare the performance, in terms of precision, of hierarchical model-based inference (denoted Case C) against two alternative cases. These were (1) model-based inference based on field data and wall-to-wall data, collected either with airborne laser scanning (Case A.1) or Sentinel-2 data (Case A.2), and (2) hybrid inference using a small sample of field data and a larger sample of UAV data (Case B). A second objective was to assess the possibility of reducing the UAV sampling intensity when adopting Case C rather than 13, without decreasing the precision of the GSV estimates. The results, calculated as standard error as percentage of the mean ((SE) over cap (%)), indicated that in case C the precision was of similar magnitude ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.44%) as for Case A.1 ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.69%) and for Case B ((SE) over cap (%) = 3.58%). The standard error of Case A.2 was nearly twice as large ((SE) over cap (%) = 5.81%) as the rest of the cases. The results also indicated possibilities of reducing the UAV sampling intensity without losing precision in cases where wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data are available (Case C). The same precision for Case C with only five UAV samples was achieved as for Case B with 55 UAV samples. Thus, the study highlights the cost-efficiency of applications of UAV as in Case C and also provides first insights in the use of Sentinel-2 data for GSV estimation in boreal conditions.

AB Identifying the structure of a polycentric city is vital to various studies, such as urban sprawl and population movement dynamics. This paper presents an efficient and reliable method that uses multi-source geospatial big data, including nighttime light imagery and social media check-in maps, to locate the main center and sub-centers of a polycentric city. Unlike traditional methods that rely on statistical data categorized by administrative units, the proposed method can effectively identify the boundaries of urban centers, and the data source guarantees a timely monitoring and update. Four main procedures are involved: 1) a new observation unit is developed using object-oriented segmentation; 2) main centers are located using cluster analysis (Local Moran's I); 3) sub center candidates are selected using significant positive residuals from geographically weighted regression (GWR); and 4) final centers are filtered using global natural breaks classification (NBC). These steps can be reproduced in different regions. To evaluate the effectiveness, the method was applied to three rapidly developing Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing with different natural and economic characteristics. The performance of the proposed method has been carefully evaluated with qualitative and quantitative analyses. Comparative experiments were also conducted across different datasets to prove the benefits of combining a social media check-in map with remotely sensed imagery in a human environment study.

AB Remote imaging spectroscopy from 400 to 800 nm can use benthic reflectance signatures to map the composition and condition of shallow water ecosystems. We present a novel probabilistic approach to jointly estimate the seafloor reflectance and water properties while flexibly incorporating varied domain knowledge and in situ measurements. The inversion transforms remote radiance data with an atmospheric correction followed by a water column correction. Benthic reflectance and water optical properties are both represented by linear mixtures of endmember spectra. We combine remote measurements, prior knowledge and field data using a flexible Bayesian optimal estimation, solving for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) combination of water column properties, seafloor reflectance, and depth. We then demonstrate performance in controlled simulations and in overflights of a coral reef in Hawaii with coincident in situ measurements. The measurement approach helps lay a foundation for wide-area airborne mapping of the condition of threatened coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs.

AB Remote sensing technology has great potential to expand the observation of ground-level nitrogen deposition from local monitoring sites to a regional scale, with high spatial and temporal resolutions. A new methodology is developed to estimate the spatial distribution of monthly bulk nitrogen deposition on a regional scale, based on precipitation amounts and HNO3 and aerosol nitrate (NO3-) columns, derived from OMI NO2 columns and the relationship of NO2, HNO3 and NO3- from MOZART. The accuracy assessment shows that the proposed model has achieved a reasonably high predictive power for monthly NO3--N deposition (slope = 0.96, intercept = 035, R = 0.83, RMSE = 0.72) across China. The spatial NO3--N deposition shows a significant gradient from industrial areas to undeveloped regions, ranging from 0.01 to 26.76 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) with an average of 5.77 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) over China during 2010-2012. The bulk NO3--N deposition shows a clear seasonal variation, with high depositions occurring in the warm season (March-November) and peaking in July and August, and low bulk NO3--N deposition appearing in winter (December-February). This study proves for the first time that the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) HNO3 and NO3- columns and precipitation are powerful to predict the bulk nitrate deposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Agricultural land cover is characterized by strong variations within relatively short time intervals. These dynamics are challenging for land cover classifications on the one hand, but deliver crucial information that can be used to improve the classifiers performance on the other hand. Since up to date mapping of crops is crucial to assess the impact of agricultural land use on the ecosystems, an accurate and complete classification of crop types is of high importance. In the presented study, a new multitemporal data based classification approach was developed that incorporates knowledge about the phenological changes on crop lands. It identifies phenological sequence patterns (PSP) of the crop types based on a dense stack of Sentinel-1 data and accurate information about the plant's phenology. The performance of the developed methodology has been tested for two different vegetation seasons using over 200 ground truth fields located in northern Germany. The results showed that a dense time series of Sentinel-1 images allowed for high classification accuracies of grasslands, maize, canola, sugar beets and potatoes (F1-score above 0.8) using PSP as well as standard (Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood) classification method. The PSP approach clearly outperformed standard methods for cereal crops, especially for spring barley where the F1-score varied between zero and 0.43 for standard approaches, while PSP achieved values as high as 0.74 and 0.79 for both vegetation seasons. The PSP based approach also outperformed for oat, winter barley and rye. Furthermore, the PSP classification is more resilient to differences in farming management and conditions of growth since it takes information about each crop types' growing stage and its growing period into consideration. The results also indicate, that the PSP approach was more sensitive to subtle changes such as the proportion of weeds within a field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Incident solar radiation at the earth's surface (insolation) is the driving force for the earth's atmospheric and surface systems, including biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and the hydrologic cycle for land. This study details insolation estimates over four continuous seasons from a simple radiative transfer model, employing imager visible data from the geostationary GOES series of satellites, a model developed in the 1980s that has undergone continual upgrades and tests since that time. After an introduction explaining the physics and physical assumptions of this model, recent improvements in spatial and temporal resolution and other model modifications are detailed. Initially a set of current satellite insolation results from years 2014-2015 are compared to those produced for a set of 11 pyranometer measurement locations of the United States Climate Research Network (USCRN) for the years 2003-2004 (Otkin et al., 2005). It is found that the model improvements and modifications on average increase the accuracy of the satellite insolation estimates. Subsequently, insolation estimates from this satellite system are compared to USCRN pyranometer measurements from years 2014 and 2015 at an additional 34 USCRN measurement locations across the conterminous U.S. When satellite data are available for a USCRN location using data from both GOES-East and GOES-West, error statistics from the two satellite sources are compared. Distinctions are made between USCRN locations with differing topography and other relevant physical characteristics. Finally, plans for additional improvements and enhancements of the model are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A neural network (NN) soil moisture retrieval product computed from the synergy of AMSR-E brightness temperature and ASCAT backscatter observations is evaluated against in situ soil moisture observations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The skill of the NN retrieval is compared to that of the ESA-CCI soil moisture retrieval as well as modeled soil moisture fields from ERA-interim/land. The NN retrieval is able to capture the observed soil moisture temporal variations with a station-average correlation and anomaly correlation of 0.45 and 0.35, respectively. For most ground stations the model obtained a higher temporal correlation skill, with average correlation and anomaly correlation values of 0.53 and 0.46, respectively. For stations in data-sparse regions, the NN retrieval showed a slightly better performance than the model, illustrating the potential of soil moisture retrievals to inform models in data -sparse areas. A time series analysis further showed that the retrieval is well able to capture soil moisture variability outside of active precipitation phases, such as the soil moisture behavior during the dry down phase. Compared to the ESA-CCI retrieval, the NN methodology obtained higher correlations, as a result of its ability to use the complementary information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors. A global evaluation of the retrieval errors through a triple collocation analysis with SMOS and GLDAS soil moisture estimates showed that the errors are high in energy limited regions, where the NN retrieval appears to be lacking input information. In the data -sparse regions of Africa and South America, the triple collocation analysis confirmed the higher skill of the NN retrieval compared to the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present the first comparison of Sentinel-2A (S2) MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) and Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) data in the retrieval of forest canopy cover (CC), effective canopy cover (ECC), and leaf area index (LAI). We used S2 and L8 images obtained from Suonenjoki, Finland on 17 and 22 August 2015, respectively. A combination of airborne lidar data and field plots was used to calculate CC, ECC and LAI for a set of 746 systematically placed lidar plots. Generalized additive models were used to link these variables with various types of spectral indices. Our results indicated that instead of using the native image resolution, the model accuracies were better for 60 m lidar plots comprising of nine (S2) or four (L8) image pixels. The best case absolute root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEPs) (relative RMSEPs shown in parentheses) obtained from ten-fold cross validation of multivariate models for S2 CC, ECC and LAI were 0.126 (24.0%), 0.100 (20.8%), and 0.596 (19.6%), respectively. For L8, the corresponding RMSEPs were 0.128 (24.5%), 0.108 (22.4%), and 0.614 (20.2%). The marginally better performance of S2 models may be related to the 705 nm red edge band, which frequently occurred among the selected predictors. When testing indices that used bands available for both sensors, there were no systematic differences between S2 and L8. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is the critical forcing data in ecological and agricultural fields. Remote sensing can be utilized to derive spatiotemporally continuous PAR. Empirical algorithms can be used to quickly retrieve surface PAR data sets, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed in regions without local calibration. Physical algorithms generally incorporate all relevant physical processes and can be used globally, but their computational efficiency is often low. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is developed to calculate surface PAR by combining a clear-sky PAR model and the parameterizations for cloud transmittances. In the algorithm, the transmittances for water vapor, ozone, Rayleigh, aerosol, and cloud are each handled across the whole PAR band (400700 nm). In addition, the contribution of the multiple reflections between surface ground and the atmosphere are also expressly considered. The new algorithm is applied to estimate instantaneous PAR with inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products onboard both Terra and Aqua platforms. The daily PAR is estimated from these two instantaneous values by an upscaling method. The instantaneous and daily PAR estimates were validated with in situ data collected in the USA and China. The results indicate that the new algorithm, based on MODIS products, can effectively retrieve PAR with root mean square errors (RMSE) of about 40 W m(-2) and 15 W m(-2) at instantaneous and daily-mean time scales, respectively. These performances are generally better than those of previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The annual flood cycle of the Sudd wetland in South Sudan plays an important role in the Nile River Basin water balance. The wetland, however, is extensive and sparsely instrumented, which has inhibited credible understanding of regional flooding across space and time. Here we explore the potential to apply low resolution C-band ENVISAT Advanced SAR imagery for remote estimation of Sudd flooded area. Over a five year study period (2007-2011) the time-averaged flooded Sudd area was found to be 18,033 km(2) with an average annual high of 29,702 km(2) in late September and a low of 10,128 km(2) in early May. Annual peak flood area ranges considerably from 19,259 km(2) in 2009 to 36,649 km(2) in 2007, but we found no systematic trend over the five year study period. Derived flood frequency maps identify areas of open water and permanent flooding (12% of total area), seasonal flooding (29%), and intermittent flooding (48%). To evaluate the certainty of our results, we consider their consistency with (1) prior studies, (2) evapotranspiration estimates from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance algorithm, (3) watershed storage anomaly estimates from GRACE, (4) supervised classification of open water area using Landsat, and (5) a rough measure of water availability (antecedent precipitation). The analyses show reasonable temporal and spatial consistency with available lines of evidence. We conclude that low resolution C-band SAR imagery shows promise for study of Sudd wetland flood dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing observations are extensively used for analysis of environmental variables. These variables often exhibit spatial correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. Another feature in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. Both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory. We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model parameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

AB Soil hydraulic property information of the vadose zone is key to quantifying the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture, and for modeling water flow and contaminant transport processes in the near surface. This study deals with exploring the feasibility of using diffuse soil spectral information in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared range (350-2500 nm) to estimate coarse-scale soil hydraulic parameters and predict soil moisture profiles using a topography-based aggregation scheme in conjunction with a 1D mechanistic water flow model. Three different types of parametric transfer functions (so-called spectrotransfer functions, STFs; pedotransfer functions, PTFs; and spectral pedotransfer functions, SPTF5) were aggregated from the point scale to 1 km(2) pixel size. to provide coarse scale estimates of van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) hydraulic parameters. The coarse scale hydraulic parameters were evaluated by simulating soil water dynamics of the 1 km(2) pixels across the Zanjanrood River sub-watershed (ZRS) in northwest Iran. Resultant soil water states were compared with ground-truth measurements and advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) estimates of soil water content. The topography-based aggregation scheme was found to provide effective values of the VGM hydraulic parameters across the ZRS study site. The coarse scale STFs performed best in terms of simulating surface, near-surface and subsurface soil water dynamics, followed by the coarse scale SPTFs and PM, which performed similarly. The average simulated soil water contents of the surface layer closely correlated with ASAR estimates during relatively wet periods. Simulated subsurface soil water dynamics matched well with the ground-truth measurements. These findings indicate the feasibility of using spectral data to predict VGM hydraulic parameters and, ultimately, to predict soil water dynamics at the larger scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB In a 1988 study, a generalized non-linear SST algorithm was derived from the radiative transfer equation. An empirical approximation to this algorithm provided the simplified NLSST algorithm for computing sea surface temperatures with satellite radiometer data. It has remained a favorite of the remote sensing community for the past 25 years. However, a 1998 study demonstrated that the functional form of the generalized non-linear algorithm, which is here designated the GNLSST, is very much data dependent. In this paper we explore the various functional forms that the GNLSST may take. Rather than using actual satellite data, we model the effects of atmospheric absorption by water vapor, under saturation conditions, on the satellite split-window temperature difference, AT, in the 11-13 pm infra-red spectral region. The parameters used in the GNLSST algorithm are adjusted to demonstrate the various forms that the GNLSST can take. One key finding is that the familiar algorithms used for measuring SST, such as the MCSST, the NLSST and the QSST are all special solutions to the more general GNLSST algorithm. Additionally, the GNLSST may take other forms, which are described graphically.
   The simplifying assumptions which yield the NLSST solution represent an approximation to reality when working with actual satellite data. It is demonstrated that minor modifications to the regression procedures, which are used to derive the NLSST with satellite split-window data, may reduce the temperature errors resulting from these approximations. Alternative forms of the GNLSST algorithm may be useful for users of regional split-window satellite data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Clumping index (CI) describes the spatial distribution pattern of foliage, and is a critical parameter to characterize the terrestrial ecosystem and model land-surface processes. Global and regional scale CI maps have been generated from POLDER, MODIS, and MISR sensors based on an empirical relationship with the normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) index by previous studies. However, the hotspot, darkspot, and CI values can be considerably different from different bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models and solar zenith angles (SZA). In this study, we evaluated the effects of different configurations of BRDF models and SZA values on CI estimation using the NDHD method. CI maps derived from MISR and MODIS were compared with reference data at the VALERI sites. Results show that for moderate to least clumped vegetation (CI > 0.5), CI values retrieved with the observational SZA agree well with field measurements, while SZA = 0 degrees underestimates, and SZA = 60 overestimates. For highly clumped (CI < 0.5) and sparsely vegetated areas (FCOVER <25%), the Ross-Li model with 60 SZA is recommended for CI estimation. The best NDHD configuration was used to estimate a 15-year time series CI from MODIS BRDF data. The time series CI shows a reasonable seasonal trajectory, and varies consistently with the MODIS leaf area index (LAI). This study enables better usage of the NDHD method for CI estimation, and can be a useful reference for research on Cl validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) is a valuable tool for collecting large amounts of elevation data across large areas; however, the limited ability to penetrate dense vegetation with lidar hinders its usefulness for measuring tidal marsh platforms. Methods to correct lidar elevation data are available, but a reliable method that requires limited field work and maintains spatial resolution is lacking. We present a novel method, the Lidar Elevation Adjustment with NDVI (LEAN), to correct lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) with vegetation indices from readily available multispectral airborne imagery (NAIP) and RTK-GPS surveys. Using 17 study sites along the Pacific coast of the U.S., we achieved an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.072 m, with a 40-75% improvement in accuracy from the lidar bare earth DEM. Results from our method compared favorably with results from three other methods (minimum-bin gridding, mean error correction, and vegetation correction factors), and a power analysis applying our extensive RTK-GPS dataset showed that on average 118 points were necessary to calibrate a site -specific correction model for tidal marshes along the Pacific coast. By using available imagery and with minimal field surveys, we showed that lidar-derived DEMs can be adjusted for greater accuracy while maintaining high (1 m) resolution. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Although agricultural burning is banned in Russia, it is still a widespread practice. Accurately monitoring cropland burned area is an important task as these estimates are used in the calculation of cropland burning emissions, which are ultimately utilized in policy making decisions. In this paper we developed an independent estimate of cropland burning in Russia through assessing the capabilities of global burned area products (MCD45A1; Roy et al., 2008 and MCD64A1; Giglio et al., 2009) and our own custom Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Cropland Regional Area Burned (CRAB) product. An archive of cropland field state samples was generated from very high resolution (<5 m) imagery allowing us a unique perspective into the challenges of mapping cropland burned area through detailed analysis of the Russian agricultural practices. Our analysis showed all three burned area products were unable to map approximately 95% of burn validation samples, demonstrating that the current coarse resolution (defined here as >= 500 m) satellite capabilities are not adequate for accurately mapping burned area associated with agricultural fires. The transient nature of cropland burns and the climatological conditions of the region require multiple subsequent daily overpasses; however, the small spatial scale of the burns requires moderate (defined here as 10-50 m) spatial resolutions. Future opportunities to accurately map cropland burned area may arise with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat constellation missions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest inventories, with a probability sampling of a target variable Y and a potentially very large number of auxiliary variables (X) obtained from an aerial laser scanner or photogrammetiy, are faced with the issue of model and variable selection when a model for linking Y to X is formulated. To bypass this step we propose a generic functional regression model (FRM) for use in both a design- and a model-based framework of inference. We demonstrate applications of FRM with inventory data from France, Germany, and Norway. The generic FRM achieved results that were comparable to those obtained with more traditional approaches based on model and variable selections. The proposed FRM generates interpretable regression coefficients and enables testing of practically relevant hypotheses regarding estimated models. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Microwave remote sensing can be used to measure ocean surface winds, which can be used to detect tropical cyclone (TC) formation in an objective and quantitative way. This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition. This study suggests that the quantitative microwave-sensed dynamic ocean surface wind pattern and intensity recognition model provides a new method of detecting TC formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Existing forest biomass stock maps show discrepancies with in-situ observations in Mexico. Ground data from the National Forest and Soil Inventory of Mexico (INFyS) were used to calibrate a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to generate forest biomass (AGB), its associated uncertainty, and forest probability maps. The input predictor layers for the MaxEnt algorithm were extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) products, ALOS PALSAR L-band dual-polarization backscatter coefficient images, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model. A Jackknife analysis of the model accuracy indicated that the ALOS PALSAR layers have the highest relative contribution (50.9%) to the estimation of AGB, followed by MODIS-VI (32.9%) and SRTM (16.2%). The forest cover mask derived from the forest probability map showed higher accuracy (kappa = 0.83) than alternative masks derived from ALOS PALSAR (kappa = 0.72-0.78) or MODIS vegetation continuous fields (VCF) with a 10% tree cover threshold (kappa = 0.66). The use of different forest cover masks yielded differences of about 30 million ha in forest cover extent and 0.45 Gt C in total carbon stocks. The AGB map showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 173 t C ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.31 when validated at the 250 m pixel scale with inventory plots. The error and accuracy at municipality and state levels were RMSE = +/- 4.4 t C ha(-1), R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = +/- 2.1 t C ha(-1), R-2 = 0.94 respectively. We estimate the total carbon stored in the aboveground live biomass of forests of Mexico to be 1.69 Gt C +/- 1% (mean carbon density of 21.8 t C ha(-1)), which agrees with the total carbon estimated by FAO for the FRA 2010 (1.68 Gt C). The new map, derived directly from the biomass estimates of the national inventory, proved to have similar accuracy as existing forest biomass maps of Mexico, but is more representative of the shape of the probability distribution function of AGB in the national forest inventory data. Our results suggest that the use of a non-parametric maximum entropy model trained with forest inventory plots, even at the sub-pixel size, can provide accurate spatial maps for national or regional REDD+ applications and MRV systems.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has the potential to improve the predictive skill of land surface models through the assimilation of its observations. Several alternate products can be distinguished: the observed brightness temperature (TB) data at coarse scale, indirect estimates of soil moisture (SM) through the inversion of the coarse-scale TB observations, and fine-scale soil moisture through the a priori downscaling of coarse-scale soil moisture. The SMOS TB products include observations over a large range of incidence angles at both H- and V-polarizations, which allows the merit of assimilating the full set of multi-angular/polarization observations, as opposed to specific sub-sets of observations, to be assessed. This study investigates the performance of various observation scenarios with respect to soil moisture and streamflow predictions in the Murray Darling Basin. The observations are assimilated into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, coupled to the Community Microwave Emission Modeling (CMEM) platform, using the Ensemble Kalman filter. The assimilation of these various observation products is assessed under similar realistic assimilation settings, without optimization, and validated by comparison of the modeled soil moisture and streamflow to in situ measurements across the basin. The best results are achieved from assimilation of the coarse-scale SM observations. The reduced improvement using downscaled SM is probably due to a lower number of observations, as a result of cloud cover effects on the downscaling method. The assimilation of TB was found to be a promising alternative, which led to improvements in soil moisture prediction approaching those of the coarse-scale SM assimilation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Near-surface salinity data from the Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) system are used to understand various characteristics of satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) data from SMOS. The errors in the model fields are first estimated by comparing them to near-surface Argo salinity measurements, with RMS errors of less than 0.2 pss over most of the global oceans, except for regions of high variability in SSS such as boundary current regions and areas of large precipitation or river run-off. Regional biases are generally less than 0.05 pss but some regions such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the region to the north of the Gulf Stream extension have larger biases. Various different processing versions of the SMOS data are assessed, including different temporal and spatial averaging, and the daily 1 degrees resolution SMOS differences to FOAM are approximately 3-10 times larger than Argo FOAM differences. The spatial information in the SMOS data is also assessed by comparing spatial gradients in the satellite SSS data with those calculated from other datasets including satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and satellite altimeter sea surface height (SSH) data, as well as with the model's gradients. The SMOS data contain information about the underlying ocean dynamics in the summer months, in agreement with the SSH data, which are not present in the satellite SST data or in the model's SSS fields. This demonstrates that the data contains useful information which could be used to correct the model through data assimilation. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This research aims to test data obtained by level 2 retrieval algorithm of SMOS over land, in order to provide information regarding vegetation and soil moisture over forested areas. Results presented in this paper were obtained using the last 620 version of the algorithm.
   The correlation between the new vegetation optical depth (VOD) product and the height of the forest estimated by ICES at GLAS lidar on a global scale is investigated. Over South American and African forests a good correspondence between the two variables is observed, with saturation occurring above about 30 m height. Moreover, the comparison between the VOD and the height of the forest shows good spatial and temporal stability, and the r(2) correlation coefficient is within a 0.59-0.69 range. Conversely, discrepancies are observed in some Indonesian islands, particularly New Guinea. Over specific areas, the trends vs. forest height obtained with SMOS VOD are compared with the corresponding trends of AMSR-E VOD. Results are also validated at country-level scale. To this aim, accurate estimates of forest biomass derived from airborne lidar over selected forests of Peru, Columbia and Panama are used. Finally, the soil moisture retrieved over forests is investigated, reporting continental maps for Tropical areas and comparisons with ground measurements in selected forests of the US. Continental maps obtained with the new level 2 V620 algorithm cover almost all forest areas, and show seasonal variations which,are dependent on climatic zones. Comparisons between soil moisture retrievals in forests and ground measurements of the US SCAN network produce worse RMSE values with respect to low vegetation areas. Significant improvements however are achieved after averaging among close nodes of the ground network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Acquiring forest resources information for tropical developing countries is challenging due to financial and logistical constraints. Yet, this information is critical for enhancing management capability and engaging in international initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). The use of multi-source inventories (i.e., remote-sensing, field, and other data) in integrated models has shown increasing promise for accurately estimating forest attributes at lower costs. In this study, we compared the use of Landsat 8 OLI versus RapidEye satellite imagery in four modeling approaches (generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forests), with and without auxiliary information (e.g., soils characteristics, distance to roads, etc.) to estimate percent canopy cover by pixel for an similar to 1,000,000 ha area in Zambia. We derived plot-level canopy cover as the dependent variable, using field measured data collected according to current National Forest Inventory (NFI) protocol. Using cross-validation statistics, Landsat 8 OLI exhibited better results than RapidEye across modeling approaches likely due to the additional short-wave infrared bands which consistently improved model performance (average root mean squared prediction error = 10.1% versus 11.0%). The GAM approach was more precise, though more challenging to fit. For both remote sensing data sources and all modeling approaches, other auxiliary information improved the model; soil variables were commonly selected for inclusion using a Genetic Algorithm. Using a binomial GAM with Landsat 8 OLI and soil variables, and by applying the current FAO forest/non-forest definition (i.e., canopy cover >10% for a 0.5 ha area), we estimated the total forest area as 758,100 ha (95% bootstrapped confidence interval of +/- 3,953 ha). Overall, our research indicates that sufficiently accurate forest area estimates for Zambia can be obtained using canopy cover GAM models that incorporate NFI data and freely-available remote sensing imagery and soil information.

AB Seasonally continuous long-term information on surface water and flooding extent over subcontinental scales is critical for quantifying spatiotemporal changes in surface water dynamics. We used seasonally continuous Landsat TM/ETM + data and generic random forest-based models to synoptically map the extent and dynamics of surface water and flooding (1986-2011) over the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). The MDB is a large semi-arid basin with competing demands for water that has recently experienced one of the most severe droughts in the southeast of Australia. We used a stratified random probability sampling design with 500 sample pixels each observed across time to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. We further developed models to map flooded forest at a riparian site that experienced severe tree diebacic. Water indices and bands 5 and 6 were among the top 10 explanatory variables most important for mapping surface water. Surface water extent per season per year showed high inter-annual and seasonal variability, with low extent and variability during the Millennium Drought (1999-2009). Accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 99.9% (+/- 0.02% standard error) with 87% (+/- 3%) and 96% (+/- 2%) producer's and user's accuracy of water, respectively. User's and producer's accuracies of water were higher for Landsat 7 than Landsat 5 data. Both producer's and user's accuracies of water were lower in wet years compared to dry years. The approach presented here can be further developed for global application and is relevant to areas with competing water demands. Quantifying the uncertainty of the accuracy assessment and providing an unbiased accuracy estimate are imperative steps when remotely sensed products are intended to be used for follow on applications.

AB Monitoring long-term biomass dynamics in drylands is of great importance for many environmental applications including land degradation and global carbon cycle modeling. Biomass has extensively been estimated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of the vegetation greenness. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from satellite passive microwave observations is mainly sensitive to the water content in total aboveground vegetation layer. VOD therefore provides a complementary data source to NDVI for monitoring biomass dynamics in drylands, yet further evaluations based on ground measurements are needed for an improved understanding of the potential advantages. In this study, we assess the capability of a long-term VOD dataset (1992-2011) to capture the temporal and spatial variability of in situ measured green biomass (herbaceous mass and woody plant foliage mass) in the semi-arid Senegalese Sahel. Results show that the magnitude and peak time of VOD are sensitive to the woody plant foliage whereas NDVI seasonality is primarily governed by the green herbaceous vegetation stratum in the study area. Moreover, VOD is found to be more robust against typical NDVI drawbacks of saturation effect and dependence on plant structure (herbaceous and woody compositions) across the study area when used as a proxy for vegetation productivity. Finally, both VOD and NDVI well reflect the spatial and inter-annual dynamics of the in situ green biomass data; however, the seasonal metrics showing the highest degree of explained variance differ between the two data sources. While the observations in October (period of in situ data collection) perform best for VOD (r(2) = 0.88), the small growing season integral (sensitive to recurrent vegetation) have the highest correlations for NDVI (r(2) = 0.90). Overall, in spite of the coarse resolution, the study shows that VOD is an efficient proxy for estimating green biomass of the entire vegetation stratum in the semi-arid Sahel and likely also in other dryland areas.

AB Field surveys are often a primary source of data for aboveground biomass (AGB) and forest area estimates two fundamental parameters in forest resource assessments and for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD +). However, plot-based estimates of such parameters are often not sufficiently precise for their intended purposes, and especially so in developing and tropical countries in which implementation of extensive sample surveys can be cost-prohibitive or infeasible due to inaccessibility. Remotely sensed data can improve the precision of estimates and thereby reduce the need for field samples. To guide investment decision in MRV systems, comparative analyses of the contribution of different types of remotely sensed data to improve precision of estimates are required. The aim of the current study was to quantify the contribution of data from (1) airborne laser scanning (ALS), (2) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) derived from TanDEM-X, (3) RapidEye optical imagery, and global forest map products derived from (4) Landsat and (5) ALOS PALSAR L-band radar imagery to improve precision of AGB and forest area estimates beyond the precision that could be obtained by a pure field-based survey in miombo woodlands of Tanzania. Miombo woodlands is one among the most wide-spread vegetation types in eastern, central, and southern Africa, occupying about 9% of the entire African land area. A 365.6 km(2) region in Liwale district in Tanzania served as area of interest for this study. Eighty-eight ground plots distributed on 11 clusters of eight plots each according to a probability based single-stage cluster sampling design served as field data for regression model calibration used for mapping and estimation of AGB and forest area. Model-assisted estimators were used in the estimation. The relative efficiency (RE) of the ALS-assisted estimates of mean AGB per hectare (variance of the field-based estimate relative to the variance of the ALS-assisted estimate) was 3.6. Relative efficiency translates directly to the factor by which the sample size used for the ALS-assisted estimate would have to be multiplied to arrive at the same precision for a pure field-based estimate. RE values for InSAR and RapidEye were 2.8 and 33, while the global Landsat and PALSAR map products contributed only marginally to improve precision (RE = 13-1.4). For forest area estimation, ALS-assisted estimates showed an RE of 3.7-4.6, while InSAR, RapidEye, and global Landsat and PALSAR maps resulted in RE values of 1.0-13, 2.0-2.1,1.4-1.8, and 1.7, respectively.

AB The full potential of ALOS PALSAR L-band interferometric (InSAR) coherence data for the estimation of forest growing stock volume (GSV) in the boreal forest has rarely been investigated. Moreover, ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence have yet to be used together to delineate GSV. Due to the observation strategy and the high acquisition success rate over Eurasia, a large amount of high quality ALOS PALSAR L-band data is available over Siberia. Consequently, this paper investigates the capability of ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence for the estimation of GSV in Central Siberia, Russia. The potential of backscatter and coherence are directly compared using the same inventory data. Altogether, 87 PALSAR images are used and eleven forest inventory sites are investigated.
   Based on this large dataset it was observed that InSAR coherence acquired in frozen conditions offers the highest potential for GSVestimation. The saturation level for single coherence images was on average 230 m(3)/ha, with an average R-2 between coherence and GSV of 0.58. PALSAR backscatter acquired in unfrozen conditions could also estimate GSV; however, the saturation levels (75-100 m(3)/ha) and the average R-2 (0.42-0.48) were lower. HV backscatter offered only a slightly greater potential than HH backscatter.
   A simple inversion approach aiming at the delineation of forest GSV maps based on the multitemporal SAR data was developed and applied to five forest inventory sites. This approach combines HV backscatter data acquired in unfrozen conditions and InSAR coherence data acquired in frozen conditions. In general, the produced maps feature a corrected relative RMSEcorr of <30% which was similar to the accuracy of the forest inventory data. The R-2 between inventory data and SAR data based maps varied between 0.54 and 0.83. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB From top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, atmospheric correction for ocean color inversion aims at distinguishing atmosphere and water contributions. From a methodological point of view, our approach relies on a Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matters and colored dissolved organic matters on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and preestimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations.
   We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (OR). The mean gain value on the relative error for the 13 bands between 412 and 885 nm is of 57% compared with MEGS algorithm and 10% compared with the C2R. The water leaving reflectances are used in Ocean Color for the estimation of the chl-a concentration, the colored dissolved organic matters absorption and the suspended particulate matters concentration underlying the potential of such approach to improve the standard level 2 products in coastal areas. We further discuss the potential of MEETC2 for the incoming OLCl/Sentinel 3 mission that will be launched in December 2015. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Longwave radiation (5-100 mu m) is a critical component of the Earth's radiation budget. Most of the existing satellite-based retrieval algorithms are valid only for flat surfaces without accounting for topographic effects. This causes significant errors. Meanwhile, the fixed spatial resolution of remote sensing data makes it difficult to link the satellite-derived longwave radiation to different land models running on various scales. These deficiencies result in an urgent need for topographic modeling and spatial scaling studies of longwave radiation. In this paper, a longwave topographic radiation model (LWTRM) is proposed that quantifies all possible radiation-affecting factors over rugged terrain. For driving the LWTRM, a hybrid method for simultaneously deriving multiple components of longwave radiation from MODIS data is suggested based on artificial neuron networks (ANN) and the radiative transfer simulation. Topographically corrected longwave radiation is then derived by coupling the ANN outputs and LWTRM. Based on this, a general upscaling strategy for longwave radiation is presented. The results demonstrate that: (1) both the proposed LWTRM and the upscaling strategy are rather effective and work well over rugged areas; (2) the ANN-based retrieval method can produce longwave radiation with better accuracy(RMSE <23 W/m(2), bias <9 W/m(2)). More importantly, it can simultaneously derive multiple components of longwave radiation in a consistent manner; (3) over mountainous areas, the radiation cannot be accurately characterized in terms of either spatial distribution or specific values if topographic effects are neglected, for instance, the induced error can reach up to 100 W/m(2) for the longwave net flux; and (4) the topographic effects cannot be ignored below spatial scale of approximately 5 km in the selected study area.

AB Agricultural field size is indicative of the degree of agricultural capital investment, mechanization and labor intensity, and it is ecologically important. A recently published automated computational methodology to extract agricultural crop fields from weekly 30 m Web Enabled Landsat data (WELD) time series was refined and applied to a year of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhance Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) acquisitions for all of the conterminous United States (CONUS). For the first time, spatially explicit CONUS field size maps and derived information are presented. A total of 4,182,777 fields were extracted with mean and median field sizes of 0.193 km(2) and 0.278 km(2), respectively. The CONUS field size histogram was skewed; 50% of the extracted fields had sizes greater than or smaller than 0361 km(2), and there were four distinct peaks that corresponded closely to sizes equivalent to fields with 025 x 0.25 mile, 0.25 x 0.5 mile, 05 x 0.5 mile, and 0.5 x 1 mile side dimensions. There were discernible patterns between field size and the majority crop type as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cropland data layer (CDL) classification. In general, larger field sizes occurred where a greater proportion of the land was dedicated to agriculture, predominantly in the U.S. Wheat Belt and Corn Belt, and in regions of irrigated agriculture. The results were validated by comparison with field boundaries manually digitized from Landsat 5 and Google-Earth high resolution imagery. The validation was undertaken at 48 approximately 7.5 x 7.5 km sites selected across a gradient of field sizes in each of the top 16 harvested cropland areas in U.S. states that together cover 76% of harvested U.S. cropland. Conventional per-pixel confusion matrix based measures that assess pixel level thematic mapping accuracy, and object extraction accuracy measures, were derived. The overall per-pixel crop field classification accuracy was 92.7% and the overall crop field producer's and user's accuracies were 93.7% and 94.9%. Comparing all the reference and extracted field objects, 81.4% were correctly matched and the extracted field sizes were on average underestimated by 1.2% relative to the reference field objects.

AB Seasonality and drought in Amazon rainforests have been controversially discussed in the literature, partially due to a limited ability of current remote sensing techniques to detect its impacts on tropical vegetation. We use a multi-angle remote sensing approach to determine changes in vegetation structure from differences in directional scattering (anisotropy) observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with data atmospherically corrected by the Multi-Angle Implementation Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC). Our results show a strong linear relationship between anisotropy and field (r(2) = 0.70) and LiDAR (r(2) = 0.88) based estimates of LAI even in dense canopies (LAI <= 7 m(2) m(-2)). This allowed us to obtain improved estimates of vegetation structure from optical remote sensing. We used anisotropy to analyze Amazon seasonality based on spatially explicit estimates of onset and length of dry season obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). An increase in vegetation greening was observed during the beginning of dry season (across similar to 7% of the basin), which was followed by a decline (browning) later during the dry season (across similar to 5% of the basin). Anomalies in vegetation browning were particularly strong during the 2005 and 2010 drought years (similar to 10% of the basin). We show that the magnitude of seasonal changes can be significantly affected by regional differences in onset and duration of the dry season. Seasonal changes were much less pronounced when assuming a fixed dry season from June through September across the Amazon Basin. Our findings reconcile remote sensing studies with field based observations and model results as they provide a sounder basis for the argument that tropical vegetation growth increases during the beginning of the dry season, but declines after extended drought periods. The multi-angle approach used in this work may help quantify drought tolerance and seasonality in the Amazonian forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The feasibility of using optical remote sensing for crop monitoring has been widely studied over the past three decades. Considering the advantages offered with longer microwave wavelengths, most importantly an ability to collect data under cloudy conditions, the exploitation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for monitoring crop condition is of great interest. In this study, multi-polarization RADARSAT-2 (C-band) and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) CL-band) were used to investigate the potential of SAR to estimate Leaf Area Index (LA!), a strong indicator of crop productivity. A new LAI estimation approach based on coupling of two existing models has been developed. The coupled model was calibrated and validated for two economically important crops, corn and soybeans, using the data collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) over a site in the Canadian Prairies. The validation of the model generally showed high correlation coefficients (R) between ground measured and estimated LAI values, when dual like-cross polarizations were used (either HH-HV or VV-HV). At C-band, correlations were similar for both dual polarizations with corn R values of 0.83 and 0.81 for HH-HV and VV-HV, respectively; and with soybean R values of 0.80 for both HH-HV and VV-HV. L-band was less sensitive to corn LAI with R values ranging from 0.79 for HH-HV to 059 for VV-HV. Our method was not able to accurately estimate LAI for soybeans using UAVSAR. Errors of estimation (both root mean square error and mean average error) established that C-band for corn and soybeans canopies and L-band for corn canopies can be used to estimate LAI at accuracies similar to those reported in studies using satellite optical sensors. These optical satellite-based LAI measurements are currently used to correct estimates of yield and biomass from crop growth models. This study is important in that it demonstrates the capability of SAR to also estimate LAI but with an all-weather acquisition capability, offering an important advantage for operational crop growth monitoring.

AB Multi-temporal remote sensing information and spectral indices have been extensively used in studies to monitor ecosystem functioning and surface-energy budgets. However, most of these indices did not show good results in areas covered by sparse vegetation, like most of the Drylands. In these ecosystems, open spaces between plants are often covered by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), i.e. communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, mosses and other microorganisms growing in the uppermost millimeters of the soil. Due to their mostly dark color, biocrusts influence the spectral response of dryland surfaces, making it necessary to assess the sensibility of widely used spectral indices to variations in biocrusts cover. In this study we used spectra of biocrusts, bare soil and vegetation to analyze the effect of biocrust cover on the spectral response of heterogeneous areas. In a second approach we investigated the impact of biocrust water status on spectral characteristics. Based on spectral mixture analysis, we calculated the response of a wide range of vegetation/biocrust/bare soil landscape compositions, obtaining a total of 702 spectra. These were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Water Index (WI) and surface albedo, and the effect of biocrust cover and water status on these indices was analyzed. Biocrusts exerted a considerable effect on vegetation indices and surface albedo, whereas WI was mostly affected by vegetation type and cover. As biocrust cover increased, the value of NDVI and EVI also increased, whereas albedo decreased, and these effects were more important under low vegetation cover. Moreover, as biocrusts almost immediately turned dark after water pulses, the effect of biocrust cover on spectral indices increased already 30 min after wetting. Although these results varied depending on vegetation type, they demonstrate, that biocrusts largely affect the spectral response of dryland surfaces, and they illustrate how this effect is reinforced by water. Thus, biocrusts need to be considered in studies analyzing dryland phenology, productivity and water status. Moreover, in order to increase the accuracy of hydrological and climate forecast predictions, biocrust effects on surface albedo, both in a dry and wet stage, need to be included.

AB This study examines the potential of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission for monitoring the biomass and physiological condition of giant kelp forests on local to global scales. Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem found throughout the globe. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI's spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp biomass and physiological state. We analyze a 28-year time series of giant kelp biomass derived from Landsat satellite imagery in order to identify the dominant temporal modes of variability in giant kelp biomass using the California coast as a model region likely to be relevant to other regions of the globe. Temporal variability in California kelp canopy biomass is compared to the expected availability of cloud-free HyspIRI Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) views for regions of the world that contain giant kelp populations. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the physiological condition of giant kelp canopy are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We compare chlorophyll a to carbon ratios (Chl:C) of kelp fronds collected off the coast of California to laboratory and airborne measurements of hyperspectral reflectance in order to develop metrics of kelp physiological condition. The seasonal cycle dominates giant kelp canopy biomass temporal variability. However, the strength and timing of this cycle varies in both space and time. Our projections of cloud-free HyspIRI coverage indicate that the sensor will be able to capture at least 1 cloud free view each season for nearly all of the global giant kelp habitats, thereby illustrating that HyspIRI will resolve the dominant seasonal cycles in giant kelp biomass. A novel spectral index developed here from field observations explained 76% of the variance in Chl:C and was applied to hyperspectral aircraft observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and biophysiology of giant kelp.

AB C-band linear and polarimetric parameters derived from synthesis and decomposition of Radarsat-2 SAR data are analyzed and evaluated with respect to snow covers of variable thickness on smooth first year sea ice (SFYI). The study is conducted for two selected temperature conditions: 1) cold (-7.9 degrees C) and 2) warm (-0.4 degrees C). First, the polarimetric SAR response from the snow cover at cold conditions is analyzed with an objective to investigate the sensitivity of linear and polarimetric backscatter to snow thickness. Second, the changes in these sensitivities are examined as a function of change in surface air temperature (from -7.9 degrees C to -0.4 degrees C) through the changes manifested in snow geophysical properties. The dependence of linear and polarimetric backscatter response on radar incidence angle for different snow thicknesses is also evaluated.
   Our results demonstrate strong to weak relationships between the polarimetric parameters and snow thickness under cold conditions but virtually no relationship under warm conditions. The strength of this sensitivity varies with parameter type, radar incidence angle and snow geophysical properties. Under the cold conditions, fourteen polarimetric parameters demonstrate a positive relationship and nine demonstrate a negative relationship with snow thickness. This parameter sensitivity to snow thickness indicates an increase in volume or mixed scattering component with increase in snow thickness. The cause of this is primarily an increased microwave interaction with a greater number of dry snow grains, and/or more interaction with increased brine volumes in the brine-wetted snow and upper sea ice layer. A comparison of polarimetric signatures at warm conditions to that at cold conditions shows both an increase and a decrease in response for all snow thicknesses. For thin or medium snow cover, every time a polarimetric parameter response increases or decreases as a consequence of an increase in temperature there is always an opposite response in the same polarimetric parameter for thick snow cover. This is primarily due to the masking effect of moist-snow, likely caused by reduced penetration depth resulting in dominant surface scattering from the air/moist snow interface, and/or the dry snow-brine-wetted snow interface, as opposed to the snow-ice interface. Normal probability density functions (PDFs) employed to determine the snow thickness separation capability of polarimetric parameters show near overlapping signatures of all snow classes under warm conditions, suggesting that snow thickness estimation using snow thermodynamics at warm conditions is not possible.

AB Dry tropical forests are experiencing some of the highest rates of change among the globe's forests. In sub-Saharan Africa, gross (loss, gain) and net changes in dry tropical forest areas are difficult to quantify at sub-national scales because of high spatio-temporal variability in land cover conditions due to vegetation phenology and land use practices. In this project we developed new, field-validated remote sensing characterizations of dry season surface components to separate forest from non-forest land cover, and assessed forest changes from the 1990s-2010s in a Tanzanian Miombo Woodland landscape. Using a linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) approach with Landsat 5-8 data, we examined the hypothesis that higher proportions of substrate and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at non-forest regions distinguished them from forest cover against seasonally variable land cover conditions. Subsequently we evaluated the efficacy of multi-temporal classification and single-date image thresholding for identifying forest from non-forest cover. We found significantly greater proportions of substrate and NPV over non-forest compared to forest areas that enabled identification of forest cover across dry season images. Single-date, forest/non-forest maps based on an LSMA-derived metric attained overall accuracies of 81.0-85.3%, which approached multi-temporal unsupervised classifications (86.5% for forest/non-forest maps). Applying the LSMA-derived metric to study forest changes, our study region experienced a net 15.0% loss of 1995 forest area, and a 7.0% overall reduction in the total forest-occupied land cover from 1995-2011. Areas of gross forest gain were substantial, totaling 13.6% of the 1995 forest area. We found differing patterns in gross forest losses and gains among sub-regions and through time in our Tabora study area, which provide bases for testable hypotheses in future research on regional and localized drivers affecting forest cover. Our finding that non-green surface components distinguished forest from non-forest via an LSMA approach may be widely applicable to studying forest conversions in Miombo Woodlands and other dry tropical forests. This approach may also be useful for evaluating how land cover conditions change in response to potential land use or climate driving variables, or the impact of land changes for carbon balance and other ecosystem processes.

AB The Suomi NPP VIIRS Vegetation Index (VI) Environment Data Record (EDR) includes the Top Of the Atmosphere Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TOA NDVI) and the Top Of the Canopy Enhanced Vegetation Index (TOC EVI). TOC NDVI will be included in the VI EDR suite for the upcoming JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 missions. Currently, the VIIRS VI suite is undergoing extensive Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) activities to quantify product performance and to provide guidance for algorithm improvement In this study we utilized AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) based Surface Reflectance (SR) match-up data sets. Match-ups are pairs of VIIRS SR and SR derived from atmospheric correction of VIIRS TOA reflectances using AERONET ground measurements (aerosol and water vapor parameters) and ancillary data. Atmospheric correction is performed with the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code, the same code used in the operational VIIRS atmospheric correction. Daily time series January 1, 2013-March 31, 2014 of 101 x 101 pixel window match-up subsets at 375 m VIIRS Imagery resolution, centered at the selected AERONET site locations were used. The overall objective of the study was to characterize the performance of the VIIRS TOC VIs (TOC EVI and TOC NDVI) over AERONET sites as a function of accuracy of inputs of atmospheric correction algorithm (aerosol, water vapor and others) and quality control screening (cloud and snow masks). We performed three types of analyses: (I) analysis of overall performance of VI product over all sites, (2) analysis of time series over select sites representative of vegetation types, and (3) sensitivity analysis of VI to cloud, aerosols and snow contamination. Over the period of time series average Accuracy, Precision and Uncertainty statistics were 0.009, 0.035, and 0.038, respectively, for TOC NDVI and -0.004, 0.015, and 0.016, respectively, for TOC EVI. Those statistics were derived based on screening to retain only confidently clear, snow free, non-urban pixels. The reason for the substantial difference in the performance of VIs is a different sensitivity of VIs to residual atmospheric contamination. According to our study VIIRS cloud mask performed reasonably. However, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) was substantially overestimated in the vicinity of clouds, which resulted in overcorrection of VIIRS visible channels and ultimately overestimation of TOC NDVI. TOC EVI, on the other hand, remained largely unaffected, as an atmospherically resistant index. TOC EVI was also found to be less sensitive to residual snow contamination. Results of this study indicate the need to develop VI-specific quality control, which effectively screens data based on index sensitivity to atmospheric contamination. Monitoring VIIRS VIs over AERONET sites has been automated with a web-based STAR JPSS VI Monitor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Comparison of actual and simulated remotely sensed data is difficult if simulated data are not realistic in terms of both radiometry and geometry. This paper presents a modeling approach that considers the multi-directional acquisition within sensor field of view (FOV) in order to simulate realistic images of Earth surfaces, as acquired by passive sensor with a finite FOV. In this approach, the DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) 3-D radiative transfer model (RTM) is coupled with 3-D perspective projection. Current RTMs assume that all parts of the studied landscape are viewed along the same direction, although all passive imagers acquire energy in a FOV with a nonzero solid angle. In addition, they cannot account camera model and its image projection geometry (e.g., perspective projection for camera and parallel-perspective projection for cross-track imager). This situation is particularly problematic for airborne acquisition with low sensor altitude and wide FOV. Our new modeling approach solves this problem: rays that enter a sensor can come from various directions. For that during ray tracking, each passive sensor acquisition is simulated for the exact view direction, which is the instant vector from the scattering point to the sensor position. Camera and cross-track imager are both modeled for most classical configurations. With this implementation, DART provides original simulations and assessments for various research domains, including: 1. Passive sensor imaging; 2. Video captured by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); 3. Local hot spot (HS) effect in a RS image; 4. Pixel-wise comparison between simulated orthorectified perspective-projection images; and 5. Radiance variation among images acquired by airborne and spaceborne systems with different sensor altitudes. These 5 points are illustrated here. Accurate pixel-wise comparison between simulated and acquired RS data, for any configuration is another important application of this approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, multi-temporal topographic measurements from airborne laser scanning (ALS) have been increasingly used as a source of spatially explicit and accurate information to calculate geodetic glacier mass balances. Simultaneous to collecting topographic data, most ALS instruments record the backscanered intensity for each laser emission and therefore provide additional information on the reflectance characteristics of the surveyed surface. Along with air temperature, the surface albedo of snow and ice was identified as a major driving factor of glacier melt. Consequently, better knowledge on the spatial distribution of the glacier albedo could substantially improve energy balance based glacier melt modeling. In this study, we collected on-glacier spectro-radiometric and albedometer measurements to serve as a ground reference to radiometrically calibrate high resolution ALS intensity data into a distributed albedo proxy map. This method resulted in an albedo proxy with values between 0.6 on the glacier tongue and 0.9 on fresh snow in high altitudes. 99.6% of all values fell within the albedo boundary conditions, i.e. values between 0 and 1. Corrected near-infrared ALS intensity data provided a distributed product that allows simulating albedo in glacier energy and mass balance models more realistically. Remaining challenges are (i) a different surface albedo response in the visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum, (ii) the low radiometric resolution of the ALS system for higher intensity values, and (iii) an insufficient correction of the snow bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).

AB We mapped oil presence in the marshes of Barataria Bay, Louisiana following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Oil and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) have very similar spectra, differing only in two narrow hydrocarbon absorption regions around 1700 and 2300 nm. Confusion between NPV and oil is expressed as an increase in oil fraction error with increasing NPV, as shown by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to synthetic spectra generated with known endmember fractions. Significantly, the magnitude of error varied depending upon the type of NPV in the mixture. To reduce error, we used stable zone unmixing to identify a nine band subset that emphasized the hydrocarbon absorption regions, allowing for more accurate detection of oil presence using MESMA. When this band subset was applied to post-spill AVIRIS data acquired over Barataria Bay on several dates following the 2010 oil spill, accuracies ranged from 87.5% to 93.3%. Oil presence extended 10.5 m into the marsh for oiled shorelines, showing a reduced oil fraction with increasing distance from the shoreline. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel method for extracting the radiance from High Temperature Events (HTEs) recorded by geo-stationary imagers using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). We use ICA to decompose the image cube collected by the instrument into a sum of the outer products of independent, maximally non-Gaussian time series and images of their spatial distribution, and then reassemble the image cube using only sources that appear to be HTEs. Integrating spatially gives the time series of total HTE radiance emission. In this study we test the technique on a number of simulated HTE events, and then apply it to a number of volcanic HTEs observed by the SEVIRI instrument. We find that the technique performs well on small localised eruptions and can be used to correct for saturation. The technique offers the advantage of obviating the need for a priori knowledge of the area being imaged, beyond some basic assumptions about the nature of the processes affecting radiance in the scene, namely that (i) HTE sources are statistically independent from other processes, (ii) the radiance registered at the sensor is a linear mixture of the HTE signal and those from other processes, and (iii) HTE sources can be reliably identified for the reconstruction process. This results in only five free parameters the dimensions of the image cube, an estimate of the data dimensionality and a threshold for distinguishing between HTE and nonHTE sources. While we have focused here on volcanic HTEs, the methodology can, in principle, be extended to studies of other kinds of HTEs such as those associated with biomass burning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key input to physically-based retrieval algorithms of hydrological states and fluxes, and global measurements of LST are provided by many satellite platforms. Passive microwave (MW) observations offer an alternative to thermal infrared (TIR) LST retrieval approaches. Although MW has a lower spatial resolution, its temporal record is more complete as it is more tolerant to clouds. Moreover, merging TIR and MW LST with independent random errors should result in enhanced LST products. Despite these benefits, MW-based LST retrievals are not widely adopted for land applications except as an input to soil moisture retrieval algorithms. This research aims to facilitate expanded use of MW-based LST by formulating a model to explain the systematic differences in comparison to TIR-LST, and quantifying random errors in each datastream. To that end, we compile a 6-year dataset over the African continent, combining observations from seven intercalibrated low orbiting satellites equipped with suitable microwave radiometers. We compare the diurnal timing and amplitude of this dataset to TIR-LST time-series produced by LSA-SAF from the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellite. A third independent data source, the skin temperature as modeled by the Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) as produced at NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, is included in a triple collocation analysis to calculate the random error in the amplitude anomaly. Results suggest that the anomaly in diurnal LST amplitude over much of the African domain can be estimated from TIR and MW with similar levels of random error for clear sky days, except over dry sandy desert areas where the MW sensing depth extends too far below the surface. The temporal sampling advantage of MW, due to higher cloud tolerance in comparison with TIR retrievals, appears to be substantial but will need to be verified by follow-on studies. Overall the results of this study present a significant step forward in reconciling the systematic differences in LST, preparing the way for a global merger of MW and TIR LST time-series.

AB The Forest Light (FLIGHT) radiative transfer model was used to examine the uncertainty of vegetation structure measurements from NASA's planned ICESat-2 photon counting light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instrument across a synthetic Larix forest gradient in the taiga-tundra ecotone. The simulations demonstrate how measurements from the planned spaceborne mission, which differ from those of previous LiDAR systems, may perform across a boreal forest to non-forest structure gradient in globally important ecological region of northern Siberia. We used a modified version of FLIGHT to simulate the acquisition parameters of ICESat-2. Modeled returns were analyzed from collections of sequential footprints along LiDAR tracks (link-scales) of lengths ranging from 20 m-90 m. These link-scales traversed synthetic forest stands that were initialized with parameters drawn from field surveys in Siberian Larix forests. LiDAR returns from vegetation were compiled for 100 simulated LiDAR collections for each 10 Mg . ha(-1) interval in the 0-100 Mg . ha-1 above-ground biomass density (AGB) forest gradient. Canopy height metrics were computed and AGB was inferred from empirical models. The root mean square error (RMSE) and RMSE uncertainty associated with the distribution of inferred AGB within each AGB interval across the gradient was examined.
   Simulation results of the bright daylight and low vegetation reflectivity conditions for collecting photon counting LiDAR with no topographic relief show that 1-2 photons are returned for 79%-88% of LiDAR shots. Signal photons account for similar to 67% of all LiDAR returns, while similar to 50% of shots result in 1 signal photon returned. The proportion of these signal photon returns do not differ significantly (p > 0.05) for AGB intervals >20 Mg . ha(-1). The 50 m link-scale approximates the finest horizontal resolution (length) at which photon counting LiDAR collection provides strong model fits and minimizes forest structure uncertainty in the synthetic Larix stands. At this link-scale AGB >20 Mg . ha(-1) has AGB error from 20-50% at the 95% confidence level. These results suggest that the theoretical sensitivity of ICESat-2 photon counting LiDAR measurements alone lack the ability to consistently discern differences in inferred AGB at 10 Mg . ha-1 intervals in sparse forests characteristic of the taiga-tundra ecotone.

AB Phytoplankton biomass is important to monitor in lakes due to its influence on water quality and lake productivity. Phytoplankton has also been identified as sensitive to environmental change, with shifts in the seasonality of blooms, or phenology, resulting from changing temperature and nutrient conditions. A satellite remote sensing approach to retrieving and mapping freshwater phytoplankton phenology is demonstrated here in application to Lake Balaton, Hungary. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration mapping using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) allows new insights into such spatiotemporal dynamics for Lake Balaton as bloom start, peak and end timing, duration, maximum chl-a concentrations, spatial extent, rates of increase and decrease, and bloom chl-a concentration integral. TIMESAT software is used to extract and map these phenology metrics. Three approaches to time series smoothing are compared and mapped metrics are evaluated in comparison with phenology metrics of in situ chl-a. The high degree of both spatial and temporal variability is highlighted and discussed, as are methodological limitations and correlation between phenology metrics. Both the feasibility of and novel insights permitted through such phenology mapping are demonstrated, and priority topics for future research are suggested. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Practical approaches for the implementation of terrain type dependent radiometric slope correction for SAR data are introduced. Radiometric slope effects are modelled as the products of two models. The first is a simple physical model based on the assumption of a uniform opaque layer of isotropic scatterers, which is independent of terrain type, frequency and polarization. It accounts for the slope-induced variation in the number of scatterers per resolution cell. The second is a semi-empirical model, which accounts for the variation in scattering mechanisms, dependent on terrain type, frequency and polarization. PALSAR FBD (L-band, HH- and HV-polarization) data are used at two test sites in Brazil and Fiji. Results for the Brazilian area, which has slopes up to 25 degrees, show that remaining slope effects for the multi-model case are much smaller than 0.1 dB, for all land cover types. This is much better than the best single-model approach where remaining slope effects can be very small for forests but be as large as 1.77 dB for woodland in HH-polarization. Results for the Fiji area, which has different vegetation types, are very similar. The potential large improvement, using this multi-model approach, in the accuracy of biomass estimation for transparent or open canopies is discussed. It is also shown that biomass change on slopes can be systematically under- or overestimated because of associated change in scattering mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although ground-level monitoring can provide accurate PM2.5 measurements, it has limited spatial coverage and resolution. In contrast, satellite-based monitoring can provide aerosol optical depth (ACID) products with higher spatial resolution and continuous spatial coverage, but it cannot directly measure ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Observation-based and simulation-based approaches have been actively developed to retrieve ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD and sparse ground-level observations. However, the effect of aerosol characteristics (e.g., aerosol composition and size distribution) on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship is seldom considered in observation-based methods. Although these characteristics are considered in simulation-based methods, the results still suffer from model uncertainties. In this study, we propose an observation-based algorithm that considers the effect of the main aerosol characteristics. Their related effects on hygroscopic growth, particle mass extinction efficiency, and size distribution are estimated and incorporated into the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. The method is applied to quantify the PM2.5 distribution in China. Good agreements between satellite-retrieved and ground-observed PM2.5 annual and monthly averages are identified, with significant spatial correlations of 0.90 and 0.76, respectively, at 565 stations in China. The results suggest that this approach can measure large scale PM distributions with verified results that are at least as good as those from simulation-based estimations. The results also show the method's capacity to identify PM2.5 spatial distribution with high-resolution at national, regional, and urban scales and to provide useful information for air pollution control strategies, health risk assessments, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The analysis of temporal geospatial data has provided important insights into global vegetation dynamics, particularly the interaction among different variables such as precipitation and vegetation indices. Nevertheless, this analysis is not a straightforward task due to the complex relationships among different systems driving the dynamics of the observed variables. Aiming at automatically extracting information from temporal geospatial data, we propose a new approach to detect stochastic and deterministic patterns embedded into time series and illustrate its effectiveness through an analysis of global geospatial precipitation and vegetation data captured over a 14 year period. By knowing such patterns, we can find similarities in the behavior of different systems even if these systems are characterized by different dynamics. In addition, we developed a novel determinism measure to evaluate the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic patterns in a time series. Analyses showed that this measure permitted the detection of regions on the global map where the radiation absorbed by the vegetation and the incidence of rain occur with similar patterns of stochasticity. The methods developed in this study are generally applicable to any spatiotemporal data set and may be of particular interest for the analysis of the vast amount of remotely sensed geospatial data currently being collected routinely as part of national and international monitoring programs.

AB The accuracy of two satellite models of marine primary (PP) and new production (NP) were assessed against C-14 and N-15 uptake measurements taken during six research cruises in the northern North Atlantic The wavelength resolving model (WRM) was more accurate than the Vertical General Production Model (VGPM) for computation of both PP and NP. Mean monthly satellite maps of PP and NP for both models were generated from 1997 to 2010 using SeaWiFS data for the Irminger basin and North Atlantic. Intra- and inter-annual variability of the two models was compared in six hydrographic zones. Both models exhibited similar spatio-temporal patterns: PP and NP increased from April to June and decreased by August Higher values were associated with the East Greenland Current (EGC), Iceland Basin (ICB) and the Reykjanes Ridge (RKR) and lower values occurred in the Central Irminger Current (CIC), North Irminger Current (NIC) and Southern Irminger Current (SIC). The annual PP and NP over the SeaWiFS record was 258 and 82 gC m(-2) yr(-1) respectively for the VGPM and 190 and 41 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for the WRM. Average annual cumulative sum in the anomalies of NP for the VGPM were positively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the EGC, CIC and SIC and negatively correlated with the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) in the ICB. By contrast, cumulative sum of the anomalies of NP for the WRM were significantly correlated with NAO only in the EGC and CIC. NP from both VGPM and WRM exhibited significant negative correlations with Arctic Oscillation (AO) in all hydrographic zones. The differences in estimates of PP and NP in these hydrographic zones arise principally from the parameterisation of the euphotic depth and the SST dependence of photo-physiological term in the VGPM, which has a greater sensitivity to variations in temperature than the WRM. In waters of 0 to 5 degrees C PP using the VGPM was 43% higher than WRM, from 5 to 10 degrees C the VGPM was 29% higher and from 10 to 15 degrees C the VGPM was 27% higher.

AB Landsat-8 carries two separate sensors, namely the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Radiometer Suite (TIRS), that image the earth surface throughout the visible and thermal portions of the spectrum. Compared to Landsat heritage sensors, the OLI has enhanced features, which include its 12-bit radiometric resolution and the addition of a band centered at 443 nm. The dramatically improved data quality/quantity expands existing applications of Landsat imagery in aquatic sciences from the retrieval of bio-geochemical properties, such as near-surface concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS), to benthic mapping. This study offers analysis of OLI's absolute radiometric performance over bodies of water using benchmark observations, namely the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) ocean color observations and marine in situ radiometric measurements. Sensor-to-sensor comparisons are performed to derive gain factors (g(1)) from near-concurrent observations in TOA radiance and reflectance domains. The gains in the radiance domain were further validated/adjusted by determining a second set of gains (g(2)) via analysis of OLI-derived water-leaving radiance, i.e., L-w(lambda), against in situ measurements made either at the Ocean Color AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET-OC) sites or during field campaigns. The analyses yield the OLI calibration uncertainties that need to be accounted for when studying aquatic environments. It was found that, for the visible and near-infrared channels, the OLI radiometric responses, on average, are well in agreement (< 2 % discrepancies) with the TOA radiances estimated by ocean color satellites or those predicted by models based on measurements of aquatic and atmospheric properties. However, the TOA radiance at the new 443-nm band is found to be, on average, 3.4 % larger than the reference observations. The inter-sensor comparisons in the reflectance domain, however, indicated slightly different results with the OLI responses being low in the blue bands. To enhance the retrieval accuracy of aquatic-science products from OLI datasets, sets of temporally averaged gains (radiance and reflectance) are derived and recommended for use prior to the retrieval of in-water products.

AB In remote sensing image analysis, limited attention has been devoted to the isolation of fuzzy objects, namely those with inherently indeterminate boundaries, from continuous field data. This study develops a "region-shrinking" segmentation technique tailored specifically to the problem of fuzzy object identification, and applies it to the test case of oceanic eddy detection. The region-shrinking technique employs an evolutionary boundary definition procedure to simultaneously identify segments containing oceanic eddies, and refine the boundaries of these segments to correspond to eddy perimeters. This algorithm combines a Non-Euclidean Voronoi segmentation technique with insights from existing work on eddy detection from an oceanographic perspective, with the goal of improving the detection of eddy features through sea level anomaly imagery. It takes into account multiple criteria (vorticity, size, amplitude, the existence of local sea level extrema, concave or convex shape) to iteratively refine the identification and demarcation of oceanic eddies. The resulting polygons define tightly fitted eddy boundaries, and conform to the key rotational and cross-sectional height profile characteristics used by physical oceanographers to identify eddies.

AB This study examines the relationship between sea ice extent and ice surface temperature (IST) between 2000 and 2013 using daily IST products from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD1S) sensor. The empirical prediction of September sea ice extent using its trend and two climate variables IST and wind vorticity exhibits a statistically significant relationship (R = 0.97) with a time lag, where IST maximum in summer (June-July) corresponds to the sea ice extent minimum in September. This suggests that IST may serve as an indicator of the basin-wide heat energy accumulated in the Arctic by solar radiation and large-scale atmospheric heat transport from lower latitudes. The process of inducing higher IST is related to the change of atmospheric circulation over the Arctic. Averaged IST and 850 hPa relative vorticity of the polar region show a significant negative correlation ( 0.57) in boreal summer (June-August), suggesting a weakening of the polar vortex in the case of warmer-than-normal IST conditions. Weakening of the polar vortex is accompanied by above-normal surface pressure. Minimum sea ice extent in September was successfully predicted by both multiple linear regression and machine learning support vector regression using preceding summer IST and wind vorticity along with the trend of sea ice extent (R-2 similar to 0.95, cross validation RMSE of 3-4 x 10(5) km(2), and relative cross validation RMSE of 5-8%).

AB The objective of this study was to test the use of repeat flight, airborne laser scanning data (lidar) for estimating changes associated with low-impact selective logging (approx. 10-15 m(3) ha(-1) = 5-7% of total standing volume harvested) in natural tropical forests in the Western Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we investigated change in area impacted by selective logging, change in tall canopy (30 m +) area, change in lidar canopy structure metrics, and change in above ground biomass (AGB) using a model-based statistical framework. Ground plot measurements were only available from the time of the 2010 lidar acquisition. A simple differencing of the 2010 and 2011 lidar canopy height models identified areas where canopy over 30 m tall had been removed. Area of tall canopy dropped from 22.8% in 2010 to 18.7% in 2011, a reduction of 4.1%. Using a relative density model (RDM) technique the increase in area of roads, skidtrails, landings, and felled tree gaps was estimated to be 17.1%. A lidar-based regression model for estimating AGB was developed using lidar metrics from the 2010 lidar acquisition and corresponding AGB ground plot measurements. The estimator was then used to compute AGB estimates for the site in 2010 and 2011 using the 2010 and 2011 lidar acquisition data, respectively. A model-based statistical approach was then used to estimate the uncertainty of the changes in AGB between the acquisitions. Change in RDMs between lidar acquisitions was used to classify each 50 m cell in the study area as impacted or non-impacted by logging. The change in mean AGB for the entire study area was -9.1 Mg ha(-1) +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SD) (P-value < 0.0001). The change in mean AGB for areas newly impacted in 2011 was -17.9 +/- 3.1 Mg ha(-1) (P-value < 0.0001) while the change in mean AGB for non-impacted areas was significantly less at -2.6 +/- 1.1 Mg ha(-1) (P-value = 0.009). These results provide corroborating evidence of the spatial extent and magnitude of change due to low-intensity logging in tropical forests with heavy residual canopy cover.

AB In climate models, it is important to simulate the partitioning of the surface albedo into soil and vegetation albedo components because these latter address different processes that are time-scale dependent. Vegetation albedo primarily varies along with the growing season while soil albedo shows day-to-day variations caused by rainfall events. In this study, the objective is to disentangle soil albedo from surface albedo within the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) spectral bands of MODIS and SEVIRI sensors in order to yield a calibration with surface soil moisture (SSM). In a first step, we derive global static maps of soil and vegetation albedos from MODIS products at the resolution of 0.05 degrees over a 4-year period. In a second step, we estimate a daily MODIS white-sky albedo (WSA) by combining 8-day BRDF and TERRA/AQUA reflectance values for each orbit pass. These MODIS products are then projected on the SEVIRI grid of 4 km for further comparison. Then, a physical method is presented to get a daily soil albedo from both MODIS and SEVIRI data. Good correlations are obtained between satellite time series for 2007 and 2008 of retrieved soil albedo and in situ SSM measurements at the 12 SMOSMANIA stations located in southwestern France. A function of an exponential type between albedo and SSM, as supported by the theory, could be verified. As in the VIS domain, the goodness of fit r(2) is about 0.42 and 0.54 for Lahas and Condom, respectively. The Chi-Square test indicates that the relationship is significant with p-value <0.01. Finally, it is shown that most anomalies of soil albedo correlate with anomalies of soil wetness, which yields crucial importance for studying the energy budget.

AB In February 2010, the Mertz Ice Tongue (MIT) collapsed and generated a giant iceberg. However, parameters about this iceberg have not been calculated and published in detail. In this study, the freeboard map of this iceberg was generated for the first time using a time-series ICESat/GLAS data. Methods for producing the freeboard map of this iceberg are suggested. Field data for ice velocity were used to relocate the footprints collected by different campaigns. Cross-validation was conducted with freeboards extracted from crossovers observed within 30 days of each other. The precision of the freeboard extraction is approximately +/- 0.50 m, when taking one standard deviation as the precision. The freeboard varied from 23 m to 59 m with the mean of 41 m. With assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (assuming a snow layer, depth of 1 m, a snow density of 360 kg/m(3), an ice density of 915 kg/m(3) and a sea water density of 1024 kg/m(3)), the minimum, maximum and average ice thickness were calculated as 210 m, 550 m and 383 m respectively. The total ice loss is approximately 8.96 x 10(11) tons over an area, 34 km in width and 75 km in length, or approximately 2560 +/- km(2). These parameters extracted from remote sensing and altimetry data will provide additional information for studies of the evolution of iceberg, especially in iceberg tracking system.

AB Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and bacicscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.

In this study, two monthly MODIS 1 km ET products, MODIS global ET (MOD16) and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) ET, are validated over the conterminous United States at both point and basin scales. Point scale validation was performed using eddy covariance FLUXNET ET (FLET) data (2001-2007) aggregated by year, land cover, elevation and climate zone. Basin scale validation was performed using annual gridded FLUXNET ET (GFET) and annual basin water balance ET (WBET) data aggregated by various hydrologic unit code (HUC) levels. Point scale validation using monthly data aggregated by years revealed that the MOD16 ET and SSEBop Er products showed overall comparable annual accuracies. For most land cover types, both ET products showed comparable results. However, SSEBop showed higher performance for Grassland and Forest classes; MOD16 showed improved performance in the Woody Savanna class. Accuracy of both the Er products was also found to be comparable over different climate zones. However, SSEBop data showed higher skill score across the climate zones covering the western United States. Validation results at different HUC levels over 2000-2011 using GFET as a reference indicate higher accuracies for MOD16 ET data. MOD16, SSEBop and GFET data were validated against WBET (2000-2009), and results indicate that both MOD16 and SSEBop ET matched the accuracies of the global GFET dataset at different HUC levels. Our results indicate that both MODIS ET products effectively reproduced basin scale ET response (up to 25% uncertainty) compared to CONUS-wide point-based Er response (up to 50-60% uncertainty) illustrating the reliability of MODIS ET products for basin-scale Er estimation. Results from this research would guide the additional parameter refinement required for the MOD16 and SSEBop algorithms in order to further improve their accuracy and performance for agro-hydrologic applications.

AB Accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are inevitable inputs for mapping and analyzing areas subject to natural hazards. Topographic airborne laser scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth's surface: lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing for a fine reconstruction of the topography while preserving high frequencies of the relief. For flood hazard modeling, the key step, before going onto terrain modeling, is the discrimination of land and water areas within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shorelines, river banks, and inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar points, effective at large scales (>300 km(2)). For that purpose, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used as a classification framework and it is embedded in a workflow designed for our specific goal. First, a restricted but carefully designed set of features, based only on 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined as classifier input. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to a semiautomatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probability output by SVM is merged with contextual knowledge during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results show that a survey of hundreds of millions of points are labeled with high accuracy (>95% in most cases for coastal areas, and >90% for rivers) and that small natural and anthropic features of interest are still well classified even though we work at low point densities (0.5-4 pts/m(2)). We also noticed that it may fail in water-logged areas. Nevertheless, our approach remains valid for regional and national mapping purposes, coasts and rivers, and provides a strong basis for further discrimination of land-cover classes and coastal habitats.

AB Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) in the soil moisture anomaly time series obtained from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E; using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model) are estimated over a continental scale domain centered on North America, using two methods: triple colocation (RMSETC) and error propagation through the soil moisture retrieval models (RMSEEP). In the absence of an established consensus for the climatology of soil moisture over large domains, presenting a RMSE in soil moisture units requires that it be specified relative to a selected reference data set. To avoid the complications that arise from the use of a reference, the RMSE is presented as a fraction of the local time series standard deviation (fRMSE). For both sensors, the fRMSE(TC) and fRMSE(EP) show similar spatial patterns of relatively high/low errors, and the mean fRMSE for each land cover class is consistent with expectations. Triple colocation is also shown to be surprisingly robust to representativity differences between the soil moisture data sets used, and it is believed to accurately estimate the fRMSE in the remotely sensed soil moisture anomaly time series. Comparing the ASCAT and AMSR-E fRMSE(TC) shows that in general both data sets have good skill over low to moderate vegetation cover. Additionally, they have similar accuracy even when considered by land cover class, although the AMSR-E fRMSEs show a stronger signal of the vegetation cover. (c) 2013 The Authors.

AB Understanding the variability of fire events and their relationship to precipitation and changes in land use and land cover is essential in order to evaluate the susceptibility of Amazonian vegetation. Time series of hotspots, of deforested area and of rainfall (all derived from satellite data) were used to determine the temporal and spatial distributions of fire in Brazil's state of Amazonas in order to establish the seasonal patterns of each variable and interactions with biomass burning. From 2003 to 2012, 60% of the hotspots detected were in the southern part of the state, with high variability between different months and years. Between 95% and 99% of the hotspots were recorded during the period of greatest occurrence of burning (July to March) with peaks during the months of August, September and October (the months with the lowest precipitation), suggesting that fires in Amazonas are mainly initiated by humans. Deforestation activity occurs approximately three months before the start of the burning activity. The number of hotspots did not show a relationship with the area deforested but showed a strong inverse relationship with rainfall. There is marked seasonal and annual variability, with patterns changing over time. Over the last decade the hotspots detected in Amazonas are associated not only with changes in land use and cover, but also with the use of fire in managing deforested areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study investigates the capability of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate river discharge, even for ungauged sites. Because of its frequent revisits (as little as every 3 h) and adequate spatial resolution (250 m), MODIS bands 1 and 2 have significant potential for mapping the extent of flooded areas and estimating river discharge even for medium-sized basins. Specifically, the different behaviour of water and land in the Near Infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is exploited by computing the ratio (C/M) of the MODIS channel 2 reflectance values between two pixels located within (M) and outside (C), but close to, the river. The values of C/M increase with the presence of water and, hence, with discharge. Moreover, in order to reduce the noise effects due to atmospheric contribution, an exponential smoothing filter is applied, thus obtaining C/M-*.
   Time series of hourly mean flow velocity and discharge between 2005 and 2011 measured at four gauging stations located along the Po river (Northern Italy) are employed for testing the capability of C/M* to estimate discharge/flow velocity. Specifically, the meanders and urban areas are considered the best locations for the position of the pixels M and C, respectively. Considering the optimal pixels, the agreement between C/M-* and discharge/flow velocity is fairly good with values in the range of 0.65-0.77. Additionally, the application to ungauged sites is tested by deriving a unique regional relationship between C/M-* and flow velocity valid for the whole Po river and providing only a slight deterioration of the performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to the selection of the C and M pixels is investigated by randomly changing their location. Also in this case, the agreement with in situ observations of velocity is fairly satisfactory (r similar to 0.6). The obtained results demonstrate the capability of MODIS to monitor discharge (and flow velocity). Therefore, its application for a larger number of sites worldwide will be the object of future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID REMOTE-SENSING REFLECTANCE; TURBID WATERS; OCEAN; SURFACE
AB Hyperspectral remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) from above-surface (ir)radiance measurements is derived using a new, automated method that is suitable for use on moving platforms. The sensors are mounted on a rotating platform that compensates for changing solar and ship azimuth angles, optimizing the sensor azimuth for minimal contribution of sky radiance to measured water-leaving radiance. This sea-surface reflectance (rho(s)) lies in the order of 25-8% of sky radiance, and is determined through spectral optimization, minimizing the propagation of atmospheric absorption features to R-rs. Up to 15 of these gas absorption features are frequently recognized in (ir)radiance spectra under clear and overcast skies. R-rs was satisfactorily reproduced for a wide range of simulated Case 2 waters and clear sky conditions. A set of 13,784 in situ measurements collected with optimized viewing angles on the high-absorption, low-scattering Baltic Sea was collected in April and July 2010-2011. The processing procedure yielded a 22% retrieval rate of rho(s) for the field data. The shape of the subsurface irradiance reflectance measurements (R(0(-))) measured at anchor stations was well reproduced in above-surface R-rs in those cases where the algorithm converged on a solution for rho(s), except under unstable or weak illumination conditions. Clear-sky conditions resulted in the best correspondence of R-rs and R(0(-)) and gave the highest (>50%) retrieval rates of rho(s). Two indices, derived from the available sensor data, are given to describe illumination conditions, and are shown to predict the ability of the algorithm to retrieve R-rs. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB In this study, a Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) technique was applied to data acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over marine and terrestrial locations known to emit methane (CH4). At the Coal Oil Point marine seep field, prominent CH4 anomalies were consistent with advection from known areas of active seepage. For a region with natural CH4 and oil seepage located west of downtown Los Angeles, significant CH4 anomalies were identified for known sources at the La Brea Tar Pits and in close proximity to probable sources, including an office complex documented as venting CH4 continuously and hydrocarbon storage tanks on the Inglewood Oil Field. However, interpretation of anomalies was complicated by noise and false positives for surfaces with strong absorptions at the same wavelengths as CH4 absorption features. Segmentation of results identified 16 distinct locations of contiguous pixels with high CTMF scores and segments were classified into probable CH4 anomalies and confusers based on the spectral properties of the underlying surface over the full spectral range measured by AVIRIS. This technique is particularly well suited for application over large areas to detect CH4 emissions from concentrated point sources and should permit detection of additional trace gasses with distinct absorption features, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Thus, imaging spectrometry by an AVIRIS-like sensor has the potential to improve high resolution greenhouse gas mapping, better constraining local sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MODIS fire hotspots have been widely used to study fire occurrence at a global scale as they provide highly relevant information on fire events, on their spatial and seasonal trends. Nevertheless, they present some difficulties to estimate the actual magnitude of fire activity, as the relations between active fires and burned areas are not constant in space and time. Some previous studies have demonstrated that the total burned area can be estimated from the number of hotspots using regional models, but relations were established with coarse resolution data. We present in this paper a more detailed study on the relations between MODE hotspots and burned areas, as extracted from Landsat images, which are commonly considered as reference data for validation of global burned area products. The comparison has been conducted in nine study regions with significant fire activity and in a sample of sites with low fire occurrence. Our results show that MODIS hotspots are very reliable to detect true burned areas, with only 1.8% of them not associated to actual burned patches, except for urban areas where very high commission errors were observed. On the contrary, the number of burned patches not detected by MODIS hotspots was found relatively high considering all fires (36-86%), decreasing for burn patches with a larger size (0-20% for burned patches larger than 500 ha) and for areas with a lower grassland and shrubland cover. A linear relationship between the number of hotspots and the total burned area was observed within each study area. However, the slope of the regression varied strongly between study sites. It was observed that sites with a larger proportion of grass and shrub cover had a larger mean burned area associated to each hotspot. The results presented in this study improve the understanding of the spatial variability and characteristics of the hotspots and should help to use the hotspots in future research.

AB This study provides a theoretical/physical framework to quantify the vegetation scattering effects on radiometric microwave measurements of soil moisture. The model development and analysis is presented to assess the limitations of the existing tau - omega (tau-omega) model with respect to vegetated landscapes and thus to extend the usefulness of the tau - omega model to a wider range of vegetation conditions. An explicit expression is driven for an effective albedo of vegetated terrain from the zero- and multiple-order radiative transfer solutions. The formulation establishes a direct physical link between the effective vegetation parameterization and the theoretical description of absorption and scattering within the canopy. Evaluation of the derived albedo for corn canopies (stem-dominated vegetation) with data taken during the Huntsville 1998 field experiment (Hsv98) are shown and discussed. The simulation results are in good agreement with the data and show that the effective albedo values are significantly smaller than the single-scattering albedo values and increase monotonically as soil moisture increases. The model is also used to simulate effective albedo from a soybean canopy (leaf dominated vegetation) at L-band. Both results illustrate that the fitted albedo values, which are found in the literature, represent effective albedo values rather than the single-scattering albedo values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF-ABBA) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for geostationary wildfire detection whose results have been increasingly used in a range of environmental applications. At present, the WF-ABBA validation activities and, in general, fire product validation methodologies are at a markedly less advanced stage than the algorithm itself. Particularly, little is known about detection timeliness, despite the value of such information for assessing the potential of geostationary observations to improve tactical decision making of first responders. This paper contributes to reducing this gap in two ways. Firstly, we describe a new methodology that is suitable for evaluating geostationary satellite wildfire detection in terms of incidents with regard to both timeliness and reliability. This methodology utilizes available official multi-agency wildfire reporting information and multitemporal Landsat imagery. Secondly, we apply the proposed validation method to temporally filtered GOES-West WF-ABBA (ver. 6.1) detections for the 2006 fire season over the State of California and present incident-wise and pixel-wise performance information. The results indicate highly reliable pixel-wise performance of WF-ABBA, with about 75% of fire pixels (or more) corresponding to actual recorded active wildfires. A substantial portion of wildfires were detected during their first hour of activity, and a few incident-even before the initial reports from conventional sources. Although the WF-ABBA performs best at what it was designed for: consistently re-detecting (monitoring) active fires, we believe there is an additional potential for automated detection from current geostationary data to reduce wildfire ignition latencies in the Western U.S. Our results can serve as a guideline for algorithm developers and users of the WF-ABBA fire product.

AB Air surface temperature (T-air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T-air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and average air temperature (T-avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3 degrees C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2 degrees C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T-max, T-min and T-avg for a 10 year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 133 degrees C. Regarding T-max and T-min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74 degrees C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1 km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T-air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T-air estimations at a larger scale in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) products allow the quantification of total water storage (TWS) changes at global to regional scales. However, the quantity measured by GRACE represents mass signals integrated over vertical columns, requiring their separation into their original sources. Such a separation is vital for Australia, for which GRACE estimates are affected by leakage from the surrounding oceans. The independent component analysis (ICA) method that uses higher-order statistics, is implemented here to separate GRACE-derived water storage signals over the Australian continent from its surrounding oceans, covering from October 2002 to May 2011. The performance of ICA applied to GRACE is then compared to the ICA of WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and the ICA of the Australian Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) system. To study the influence of rainfall variability on the derived independent patterns. use is made of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data set, from January 2000 to May 2011. Implementing ICA on GRACE-INNS showed a remarkable improvement in separating the continental hydrological signals from the surrounding oceanic anomalies, which was not achievable using a conventional principle component analysis. Reconstructing the continental TWS changes using only those independent components of GRACE that were located over the continent showed a high correlation with WGHM-TWS and AWRA-TWS. Mass concentrations over the oceans and particularly 52 semi-diurnal aliased pattern were separated as independent modes. Correlation analysis between the independent components of GRACE and climate teleconnections showed that the mass anomalies over the northern ocean, Gulf of Carpentaria and north-eastern parts of Australia were significantly correlated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, while those over south and south-eastern parts of Australia were mainly linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole.

AB Urbanization process involving increased population size, spatially extended land cover and intensified economic activity plays a substantial role in anthropogenic environment changes. Remotely sensed nighttime lights datasets derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) provide a consistent measure for characterizing trends in urban sprawl over time (Sutton, 2003). The utility of DMSP/OLS imagery for monitoring dynamics in human settlement and economic activity at regional to global scales has been widely verified in previous studies through statistical correlations between nighttime light brightness and demographic and economic variables (Elvidge et al., 2001; Ghosh et al.. 2010). The quantitative relationship between long-term nighttime light signals and urbanization variables. required for extensive application of DMSP/OLS data for estimating and projecting the trajectory of urban development, however, are not well addressed for individual cities at a local scale. We here present analysis results concerning quantitative responses of stable nighttime lights derived from time series of DMSP/OLS imagery to changes in urbanization variables during 1994-2009 for more than 200 prefectural-level cities and municipalities in China. To identify the best-fitting model for nighttime lights-based measurement of urbanization processes with different development patterns, we comparatively use three regression models: linear, power-law and exponential functions to quantify the long-term relationships between nighttime weighted light area and four urbanization variables: population, gross domestic product (GDP), built-up area and electric power consumption. Our results suggest that nighttime light brightness could be an explanatory indicator for estimating urbanization dynamics at the city level. Various quantitative relationships between urban nighttime lights and urbanization variables may indicate diverse responses of DMSP/OLS nighttime light signals to anthropogenic dynamics in urbanization process in terms of demographic and economic variables. At the city level, growth in weighted lit area may take either a linear, concave (exponential) or convex (power law) form responsive to expanding human population and economic activities during urbanization. Therefore, in practice, quantitative models for using DMSP/OLS data to estimate urbanization dynamics should vary with different patterns of urban development, particularly for cities experiencing rapid urban growth at a local scale.

AB A new change detection algorithm for continuous monitoring of forest disturbance at high temporal frequency is developed. Using all available Landsat 7 images in two years, time series models consisting of sines and cosines are estimated for each pixel for each spectral band. Dropping the coefficients that capture inter-annual change, time series models can predict surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The Continuous Monitoring of Forest Disturbance Algorithm (CMFDA) flags forest disturbance by differencing the predicted and observed Landsat images. Two algorithms (single-date and multi-date differencing) were tested for detecting forest disturbance at a Savannah River site. The map derived from the multi-date differencing algorithm was chosen as the final CMFDA result, due to its higher spatial and temporal accuracies. It determines a disturbance pixel by the number of times "change" is observed consecutively. Pixels showing "change" for one or two times are flagged as "probable change". If the pixel is flagged for the third time, the pixel is determined to have changed. The accuracy assessment shows that CMFDA results were accurate for detecting forest disturbance, with both produce'r's and user's accuracies higher than 95% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of approximately 94%.

   mapping canopy height in boreal forest regions

AB Spatially explicit representations of vegetation canopy height over large regions are necessary for a wide variety of inventory, monitoring, and modeling activities. Although airborne lidar data has been successfully used to develop vegetation canopy height maps in many regions, for vast, sparsely populated regions such as the boreal forest biome, airborne lidar is not widely available. An alternative approach to canopy height mapping in areas where airborne lidar data is limited is to use spaceborne lidar measurements in combination with multiangular and multi-spectral remote sensing data to produce comprehensive canopy height maps for the entire region. This study uses spaceborne lidar data from the Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as training data for regression tree models that incorporate multi-angular and multi-spectral data from the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) to map vegetation canopy height across a 1,300,000 km(2) swath of boreal forest in Interior Alaska. Results are compared to in situ height measurements as well as airborne lidar data. Although many of the GLAS-derived canopy height estimates are inaccurate, applying a series of filters incorporating both data associated with the GLAS shots as well as ancillary data such as land cover can identify the majority of height estimates with significant errors, resulting in a filtered dataset with much higher accuracy. Results from the regression tree models indicate that late winter MISR imagery acquired under snow-covered conditions is effective for mapping canopy heights ranging from 5 to 15 m, which includes the vast majority of forests in the region. It appears that neither MISR nor MODIS imagery acquired during the growing season is effective for canopy height mapping, although including summer multi-spectral MODIS data along with winter MISR imagery does appear to provide a slight increase in the accuracy of resulting height maps. The finding that winter, snow-covered MISR imagery can be used to map canopy height is important because clear sky days are nearly three times as common during the late winter period as during the growing season. The increased odds of acquiring cloud-free imagery during the target acquisition period make regularly updated forest height inventories for Interior Alaska much more feasible. A major advantage of the GIAS-MISR-MODIS canopy height mapping methodology described here is that this approach uses only data that is freely available worldwide, making the approach potentially applicable across the entire circumpolar boreal forest region.

AB An approach to develop accurate local models for the estimation of chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) and spectral phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)(lambda)) from hyperspectral in situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) in an optically complex water body is presented. The models are based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of integral-normalised R-rs(lambda) spectra, and spectral normalisation was found to be key to the models' success. Accurate model estimates of both Chl a and a(ph)(lambda) were obtained, with le values in logic, space (N= 42) of 0.839 found for Chl a, and for a(ph),(lambda). R-2 values ranging from 0.771 (547 nm) to 0.910 (655 nm). A statistical resampling exercise to create training and test data sets showed that stable models could be built with similar to 15 training spectra and corresponding measurements of Chl a and a(ph)(lambda), providing important guidance for the implementation of this approach at other locations. The applicability of the models to a reduced-wavelength resolution (8 wavebands) dataset was tested, and showed that reduction in wavelength resolution had little impact on the models' skill, with R-2 values obtained within similar to 1% of the hyperspectral (101 wavelengths) R-2 values for both Chl a and a(ph)(lambda). That the reduced-wavelength resolution models performed as well as the hyperspectral models points to their potential utility for satellite sensors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10 km and 100 km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20 degrees (similar to 6 km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10 km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2-1 m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of similar to 0.57 K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB To extract information about the Earth's surface from Earth Observation data, a key processing step is the separation of pixels representing clear-sky observations of land or water surfaces from observations substantially influenced by clouds. This paper presents an algorithm used for this purpose specifically for data from the AATSR sensor on ENVISAT. The algorithm is based on the structure of the SPARC cloud detection scheme developed at CCRS for AVHRR data, then modified, calibrated and validated for AATSR data. It uses a series of weighted tests to calculate per-pixel cloud presence probability, and also produces an estimate of cloud top height and a cloud shadow flag. Algorithm parameters have been optimized for daytime use in Canada, and evaluation shows good performance with a mean daytime kappa coefficient of 0.76 for the 'cloud'/'clear' classification when compared to independent validation data. Performance is independent of season, and is a dramatic improvement over the existing AATSR L1B cloud flag for Canada. The algorithm will be used at CCRS for processing AATSR data, and will form the basis of similar processing for data from the SLSTR sensors on Sentinel-3. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Competition for limited water resources is one of the most critical issues being faced by irrigated agriculture in the United States. Site-specific irrigation applies irrigation water to match the needs of individual management zones within a field, significantly reducing water consumption, runoff, and nutrient leaching in ground water. Remote sensing for real-time and continuous soil moisture measurements at specific depths is essential for success of site-specific irrigation system.
   The overall objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a GPS-based sensor technology to determine site-specific information such as the soil moisture condition by recording the GPS signal reflected from the earth's surface. A modified GPS Delay Mapping Receiver (DMR) tracks and measures the direct, line-of-sight, Right-Hand-Circularly Polarized signal of a GPS satellite. It also simultaneously measures the delayed, earth-reflected, near-specular, Left-Hand-Circularly Polarized GPS signal. These measurements can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient and path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Over land, scattering coefficients can be used to estimate changes in soil moisture contents. Our results showed that the space-based technology has a great potential for determining soil volumetric moisture contents in the pursuit of site-specific irrigation management. There were strong correlations between the GPS reflectivity measurements and soil moisture contents. The GPS reflectivity increased as the soil moisture contents increased. Careful analysis of the test data showed very conclusively that the sensitivity of L-Band signal (1.575 GHz) to soil moisture contents changed with soil type and sampling depth. The sensitivity decreased with sampling depth in light soils and increased in heavy soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate assessment of temporal changes in gross primary production (GPP) is important for carbon budget assessments and evaluating the impact of climate change on crop productivity. The objective of this study was to devise a simple remote sensing-based GPP model to quantify daily GPP of maize. In the model. (1) daily shortwave radiation (SW), derived from the reanalysis data (North American Land Data Assimilation System; NLDAS-2) and (2) smoothed Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data, derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations were used as proxy variables of the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the total canopy chlorophyll content, respectively. The model was calibrated and validated by using tower-based CO2 flux observations over an 8-year period (2001 to 2008) for one rainfed and two irrigated sites planted to maize as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The results showed the temporal features of the product SW*WDRVI closely related to the temporal GPP variations in terms of both daily variations and seasonal patterns. The simple GPP model was able to predict the daily GPP values and accumulated GPP values of maize with high accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Effective leaf area index (LAI) retrievals from a scanning, ground-based, near-infrared (1064 nm) lidar that digitizes the full return waveform, the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI), are in good agreement with those obtained from both hemispherical photography and the Li-Cor LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. We conducted trials at 28 plots within six stands of hardwoods and conifers of varying height and stocking densities at Harvard Forest. Massachusetts, Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, and Howland Experimental Forest, Maine, in July 2007. Effective LAI values retrieved by four methods, which ranged from 3.42 to 5.25 depending on the site and method, were not significantly different (beta<0.1 among four methods). The LAI values also matched published values well. Foliage profiles (leaf area with height) retrieved from the lidar scans, although not independently validated, were consistent with stand structure as observed and as measured by conventional methods. Canopy mean top height, as determined from the foliage profiles, deviated from mean RH100 values obtained from the Lidar Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) airborne large-footprint lidar system at 27 plots by -0.91 m with RMSE = 2.04 m, documenting the ability of the EVI to retrieve stand height. The Echidna Validation Instrument is the first realization of the Echidna lidar concept, devised by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), for measuring forest structure using full-waveform, ground-based, scanning lidar.

AB Remote sensing can be considered a key instrument for studies related to forests and their dynamics. At present, the increasing availability of multisensor acquisitions over the same areas, offers the possibility to combine data from different sensors (e.g., optical, RADAR, LiDAR). This paper presents an analysis on the fusion of airborne LiDAR and satellite multispectral data (IRS 1C LISS III), for the prediction of forest stem volume at plot level in a complex mountain area (Province of Trento, Southern Italian Alps), characterized by different tree species, complex morphology (i.e. altitude ranges from 65 m to 3700 m above sea level), and a range of different climates (from the sub-Mediterranean to Alpine type). 799 sample plots were randomly distributed over the 3000 km(2) of the forested areas of the Trento Province. From each plot, a set of variables were extracted from both LiDAR and multispectral data. A regression analysis was carried out considering two data sources (LiDAR and multispectral) and their combination, and dividing the plot areas into groups according to their species composition, altitude and slope. Experimental results show that the combination of LiDAR and IRS 1C LISS III data, for the estimation of stem volume, is effective in all the experiments considered. The best developed models comprise variables extracted from both of these data sources. The RMSE% on an independent validation set for the stem volume estimation models ranges between 17.2% and 26.5%, considering macro sets of tree species (deciduous, evergreen and mixed), between 17.5% and 29.0%, considering dominant species plots, and between 15.5% and 213% considering altitude and slope sets.

AB Time-variable gravity data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission are used to study total water content over Australia for the period 2002-2010. A time-varying annual signal explains 61% of the variance of the data, in good agreement with two independent estimates of the same quantity from hydrological models. Water mass content variations across Australia are linked to Pacific and Indian Ocean variability, associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. From 1989, positive (negative) IOD phases were related to anomalously low (high) precipitation in southeastern Australia, associated with a reduced (enhanced) tropical moisture flux. In particular, the sustained water mass content reduction over central and southern regions of Australia during the period 2006-2008 is associated with three consecutive positive IOD events.

AB Surface subsidence associated with the construction of a headrace tunnel in the Swiss Alps at more than 2000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) has been detected at two locations with satellite differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. At the first location, a subsidence trough of about 4 cm in the satellite line-of-sight direction following the headrace tunnel axes has been measured between August 1995 and August 1996. Similar values from SAR data of ascending and descending orbits indicate displacements in the vertical direction of the movement. In the second case, a symmetric cone of depression with a maximum displacement of about 4 cm between 1995 and 1997 has been observed above the tunnel. Differences in the results from satellite SAR data of ascending and descending orbits indicate that the direction of displacement in this second case was not entirely vertical. Large-scale consolidation associated with pore-pressure reduction in the rock mass arising from tunnel drainage at about 200-400 m depth beneath the topographical surface is believed to be the contributing mechanism (Zangerl et al., 2008a, 2008b). Evidence for this process is based on pore pressure recordings in nearby deep wells. In both areas, the subsidence was followed by a small uplift of about one centimeter between 1997 and 1999, after the tunnel was cased with permeable concrete segments. This partial recovery is also visible in pore pressure records and can be related to the elastic components of rock mass deformation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the standard near-infrared (NIR) atmospheric correction algorithm for ocean color data processing, a high chlorophyll-a concentration patch was consistently observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua platform in the middle of the Yellow Sea during the spring (end of March to early May). This prominent patch was not observed in the historical ocean color satellite imageries in late 1970s to early 1980s, and a location corresponding to this patch has been used as a Korean dump site since 1988. At the same time, MODIS chlorophyll-a concentrations derived using the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm developed for the ocean color satellite data in turbid coastal or high-productive ocean waters were significantly reduced.
   Comparison between in situ and MODIS chlorophyll-a measurements shows that the chlorophyll-a from the MODIS-Aqua products using the standard-NIR atmospheric correction algorithm is significantly overestimated. The images of the MODIS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance spectra and water diffuse attenuation coefficient data using the NIR-SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach show that absorption and scattering by organic and inorganic matter dumped in the Korean dump site have strongly influenced the satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data. Therefore, the biased high chlorophyll-a patch in the region is in fact an overestimation of chlorophyll-a values due to large errors from the standard-NIR atmospheric correction algorithm. Using the NIR-SWIR algorithm for MODIS-Aqua ocean color data processing, ocean color products from 2002 to 2008 for the Korean dump site region have been generated and used for characterizing the ocean optical and biological properties. Results show that there have been some important changes in the seasonal and interannual variations of phytoplankton biomass and other water optical and biological properties induced by colored dissolved organic matters, as well as suspended sediments.

AB This study evaluates the performance of two fundamentally different approaches to achieve sub-pixel precision of normalised cross-correlation when measuring surface displacements on mass movements from repeat optical images. In the first approach, image intensities are interpolated to a desired sub-pixel resolution using a bi-cubic interpolation scheme prior to the actual displacement matching. In the second approach, the image pairs are correlated at the original image resolution and the peaks of the correlation coefficient surface are then located at the desired sub-pixel resolution using three techniques, namely bi-cubic interpolation, parabola fitting and Gaussian fitting. Both principal approaches are applied to three typical mass movement types: rockglacier creep, glacier flow and land sliding. In addition, the influence of pixel resolution on the accuracies of displacement measurement using image matching is evaluated using repeat images resampled to different spatial resolutions. Our results show that bi-cubic interpolation of image intensity performs best followed by bi-cubic interpolation of the correlation surface. Both Gaussian and parabolic peak locating turn out less accurate. By increasing the spatial resolution (i.e. reducing the ground pixel size) of the matched images by 2 to 16 times using intensity interpolation, 40% to 80% reduction in mean error in reference to the same resolution original image could be achieved. The study also quantifies how the mean error, the random error, the proportion of mismatches and the proportion of undetected movements increase with increasing pixel size (i.e. decreasing spatial resolution) for all of the three mass movement examples investigated.

AB The dynamics of coastal lagoons and estuarine areas is characterized by a delicate balance between biological and physical processes and the comprehension and monitoring of such processes require observations over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Remote sensing techniques in this context are very advantageous and potentially allow overcoming the spatial limitations of traditional in situ point observations, providing new opportunities for a better understanding of the relevant bio-geomorphological processes and for the calibration and validation of spatially-distributed hydrodynamic and transport models. Remote sensing of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in shallow waters must, however, overcome the difficulties associated with i) the influence of bottom reflection, which may interfere with an accurate retrieval; ii) the necessity of accurately knowing the optical properties of the suspended matter, and iii) the importance of providing an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the estimates produced. This work presents a method to estimate SPM concentration in lagoon/estuarine waters by use of a simplified radiative transfer model. We use a calibration/validation method based on cross-validation and bootstrap techniques to provide a statistically sound determination of model parameters and an evaluation of the uncertainty induced by their inaccurate determination as well as by the uncertain knowledge of the bottom sediment reflectance. The method is applied to the Venice lagoon, using observations from a network of turbidity sensors and from several multispectral satellite sensors (LANDSAT, ASTER and ALOS AVNIR). The bootstrap and cross-validation procedures employed show that consistent estimates of SPM concentration can indeed be retrieved from satellite remote sensing, provided that sufficient in situ ancillary information for appropriate calibration is available. The quantification of the estimation uncertainty shows that retrievals obtained from remote sensing are accurate, robust and repeatable. The SPM concentration maps produced show a general coherence with known features in the Venice lagoon and, together with suitable biological information, point to the role played by benthic vegetation in the stabilization of the bottom sediment.

AB The land cover fractions (LCFs) and spectral reflectance of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil were measured at 58 sites in semi-arid and arid regions of Mongolia in the summers of 2005 and 2006. These data sets allowed a detailed assessment of the impact of measurement geometry as represented by the solar zenith angle theta(s), sensor view zenith angle theta(v) and azimuth view angle in the estimation of LCF values by means of the spectral unmixing model (SUM). The bidirectional distribution function (BRDF) was fitted to the reflectance data and then used to produce reflectance at various measurement geometries. LCFs from these reflectance data for a given combination of theta(s), theta(v), and phi were compared with visually determined LCFs. It was found that theta(s) in the range of 30-45 degrees produced a better agreement of LCFs. For theta(v) the agreement is not very sensitive to the choice of angle for the range 30-70 degrees, although theta(v) = 50 degrees showed a slightly better performance. The azimuth view angle does not have strong influences to the LCF estimation, except for the case of phi = 180 degrees (view toward the sun), which does not allow precise fitting of BRDF function over a tall vegetation site. Overall, this study verified the results of earlier studies obtained mostly for the American continents that SUM is capable of producing LCF estimates accurately and also found that its accuracy was, in general, much better than that by the more traditional approach of the supervised classification method (SCM) applied to images of a digital camera.

AB Biomass burning in the Alaskan interior is already a major disturbance and source of carbon emissions, and is likely to increase in response to the warming and drying predicted for the future climate. In addition to quantifying changes to the spatial and temporal patterns of burned areas, observing variations in severity is the key to studying the impact of changes to the fire regime on carbon cycling, energy budgets, and post-fire succession. Remote sensing indices of fire severity have not consistently been well-correlated with in situ observations of important severity characteristics in Alaskan black spruce stands, including depth of burning of the surface organic layer. The incorporation of ancillary data such as in situ observations and GIS layers with spectral data from Landsat TM/ETM+ greatly improved efforts to map the reduction of the organic layer in burned black spruce stands. Using a regression tree approach, the R-2 of the organic layer depth reduction models was 0.60 and 0.55 (p<0.01) for relative and absolute depth reduction, respectively. All of the independent variables used by the regression tree to estimate burn depth can be obtained independently of field observations. Implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm improved the R-2 to 0.80 and 0.79 (p<0.01) for absolute and relative organic layer depth reduction, respectively. Independent variables used in the regression tree model of burn depth included topographic position, remote sensing indices related to soil and vegetation characteristics, timing of the fire event, and meteorological data. Post-fire organic layer depth characteristics are determined for a large (>200,000 ha) fire to identify areas that are potentially vulnerable to a shift in post-fire succession. This application showed that 12% of this fire event experienced fire severe enough to support a change in post-fire succession. We conclude that non-parametric models and ancillary data are useful in the modeling of the surface organic layer fire depth. Because quantitative differences in post-fire surface characteristics do not directly influence spectral properties, these modeling techniques provide better information than the use of remote sensing data alone.

AB The spatial and temporal characteristics of dust aerosols and their properties are assessed from satellite and ground-based sensors. The spatial distribution of total column aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRacho meter (MODIS) coupled with top of atmosphere Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) shortwave fluxes are examined from the Terra satellite over the Atlantic Ocean. These data are then compared with ACID from two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based sun photometer measurement sites for nearly six years (2000-2005). These two sites include Capo Verde (CV) (16 degrees N, 24 degrees W) near the Saharan dust source region and La Paguera (LP) (18 degrees N, 67 degrees W) that is downwind of the dust source regions. The AOD is two to three times higher during spring and summer months over CV when compared to LP and the surrounding regions. For a unit ACID value, the instantaneous TOA shortwave direct radiative effect (DRE) defined as the change in shortwave flux between clear and aerosol skies for CV and LP are -53 and -68 Wm(-2) respectively. DIRE for LP is likely more negative due to fall out of larger particles during transport from CV to LP. However, separating the CERES-derived DIRE by MODIS aerosol effective radii was difficult. Satellite and ground-based dust aerosol data sets continue to be useful to understand dust processes related to the surface and the atmosphere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eight helicopter flights were conducted, and more than 9000 aerial images were obtained during the Third Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition in 2008 in the Pacific Arctic Sector (PAS). Along the cruise tracks between 77 degrees N and 86 degrees N, area fractions of open water and ice cover varied from 0.96 to 0.12 and from 0.03 to 0.81, respectively, while the melt pond fraction varied between 0 and 0.2. The ice concentrations derived from aerial images and the AMSR-E/ASI products were comparable to each other, especially in the range of 50-90%. However, the satellite-derived data overestimated the aerial observations by 14 +/- 9% in areas with large ice concentrations (>90%), and nearly ignored those with very low ice concentrations (<20%). In addition, a significantly higher amount of melt ponds was observed in the PAS in the summer of 2008 as compared to five years ago. The areally averaged albedo increased from 0.09 in the marginal ice zone at 77 degrees N to 0.63 in the far north zone at 86 degrees N, where the ice concentration was 90%. The albedo was significantly smaller than those reported in earlier studies in the PAS for the same region because of an overall decrease in ice concentration. Compared with 2007 data, the lower ice concentration in 2008 may yield a smaller total ice-covered area, although the Arctic ice extent in 2008 was slightly larger than the record minimum in 2007.

AB In our increasingly urbanized world, monitoring and mapping of urban growth and thereby induced land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is of emergent importance. Remote sensing can reveal spatio-temporal growth trajectories of cities, which again allow a thorough understanding of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, the mapping of urban areas remains one of the most challenging tasks of remote sensing data analysis. This paper presents an approach to map urban growth from multi-sensoral data, exemplified for the Dhaka megacity region in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2006. The approach is globally applicable and can facilitate regional urban growth maps in arbitrary complex and dynamic environments.
   Dhaka's densified urban landscape, its deltaic locality and the highly dynamic monsoon-related phenology call for a sophisticated analysis approach that is able to separate intra-annual land-cover variations from actual urbanization. Imagery from the Landsat series of satellites is a great asset for such an analysis due to its synoptic coverage of large urban areas as well as its unique historical archives. In our approach, we solve problems of spectral ambiguities and seasonal phenological dynamics through incorporating multi-temporal imagery for each monitoring year (1990, 2000, and 2006) and by extending the spectral feature space with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The resulting datasets are heterogeneous and comprise measurements of unequal scaling. Non-parametric classification algorithms are required to delineate multi-modal and non-Gaussian class distributions of heterogeneous as well as temporally and spectrally complex land-cover classes of interest in such an extended feature space. We therefore used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and post classification comparison to reveal spatio-temporal patterns of urban land-use and land-cover changes. An SVM based forward feature selection procedure allowed deriving in-depth information about the individual contribution of different input bands.
   Our methodology delineated relevant land-cover classes and resulted in overall accuracies better than 83% for all years considered. Change analysis unveiled a profound expansion of urban areas at the expense of prime agricultural areas and wetlands. During the 1990s, change was primarily characterized by a densification of urban fabric, whereas more recent changes included vast in-filling of low lying land and an extensive industrial sprawl into Dhaka's peri-urban areas. Our multi-sensoral and multi-temporal mapping approach allowed for delineating temporally dynamic LULCC, which again allowed for an insightful characterization of land system changes in the megacity region of Dhaka.

AB This study reports results of a classification tree approach to mapping the wetlands of the Congo Basin, focusing on the Cuvette Centrale of the Congo River watershed, an area of 1,176,000 km(2). Regional expert knowledge was used to train passive optical remotely sensed imagery of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors, JERS-1 active radar L-band imagery, and topographical indices derived from 3 arc sec elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). All data inputs were resampled to a common 57 m resolution grid. A classification tree bagging procedure was employed to produce a final map of per-grid cell wetland probability. Thirty bagged trees were ranked and the median result was selected to produce the final wetland probability map. Thresholding the probability map at <0.5 yielded a proportion of wetland cover for the study area of 32%, equivalent to 360.000 km(2). Wetlands predominate in the CARPE Lake Tele-Lake Tumba landscape located in the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the south-eastern Republic of Congo, where they constitute 56% of the landscape. Local topography depicting relative elevation for sub-catchments proved to be the most valuable discriminator of wetland cover. However, all sources of information (i.e. optical, radar and topography) featured prominently in contributing to the classification tree procedure, reinforcing the idea that multi-source data are useful in the characterization of wetland land cover. The method employed freely available data and a fully automated process, except for training data collection. Comparisons to existing maps and in situ field observations indicate improvements compared to previous efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new methodology for establishing the spatial representativeness of tower albedo measurements that are routinely used in validation of satellite retrievals from global land surface albedo and reflectance anisotropy products is presented. This method brings together knowledge of the intrinsic biophysical properties of a measurement site, and the surrounding landscape to produce a number of geostatistical attributes that describe the overall variability, spatial extent, strength of the spatial correlation, and spatial structure of surface albedo patterns at separate seasonal periods throughout the year. Variogram functions extracted from Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) retrievals of surface albedo using multiple spatial and temporal thresholds were used to assess the degree to which a given point (tower) measurement is able to capture the intrinsic variability of the immediate landscape extending to a satellite pixel. A validation scheme was implemented over a wide range of forested landscapes, looking at both deciduous and coniferous sites, from tropical to boreal ecosystems. The experiment focused on comparisons between tower measurements of surface albedo acquired at local solar noon and matching retrievals from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V005) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo algorithm. Assessments over a select group of field stations with comparable landscape features and daily retrieval scenarios further demonstrate the ability of this technique to identify measurement sites that contain the intrinsic spatial and seasonal features of surface albedo over sufficiently large enough footprints for use in modeling and remote sensing studies. This approach, therefore, improves our understanding of product uncertainty both in terms of the representativeness of the field data and its relationship to the larger satellite pixel.

AB Interest in remote sensing (RS) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) by terrestrial vegetation is motivated by the link of F to photosynthetic efficiency which could be exploited for large scale monitoring of plant status and functioning. Today, passive RS of F is feasible with different prototypes and commercial ground-based, airborne, and even spaceborne instruments under certain conditions. This interest is generating an increasing number of research projects linking F and RS, such as the development of new F remote retrieval techniques, the understanding of the link between the F signal and vegetation physiology and the feasibility of a satellite mission specifically designed for F monitoring. This paper reviews the main issues to be addressed for estimating F from RS observations. Scattered information about F estimation exists in the literature. Here, more than 40 scientific papers dealing with F estimation are reviewed and major differences are found in approaches, instruments and experimental setups. Different approaches are grouped into major categories according to RS data requirements (i.e. radiance or reflectance, multispectral or hyperspectral) and techniques used to extract F from the remote signal. Theoretical assumptions. advantages and drawbacks of each method are outlined and provide perspectives for future research. Finally, applications of the measured F signal at the three scales of observation (ground, aircraft and satellite) are presented and discussed to provide the state of the art in F estimation.

AB Large-scale ecosystem disturbances (LSEDs) have major impacts on the global carbon cycle as large pulses of CO2 and other trace gases from terrestrial biomass loss are emitted to the atmosphere during disturbance events. The high temporal and spatial variability of the atmospheric emissions combined with the lack of a proven methodology to monitor LSEDs at the global scale make the timing, location and extent of vegetation disturbance a significant uncertainty in understanding the global carbon cycle. The MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI) algorithm is designed for large-scale, regular, disturbance mapping using Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Aqua/MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The MGDI uses annual maximum composite LST data to detect fundamental changes in land-surface energy partitioning, while avoiding the high natural variability associated with tracking LST at daily, weekly, or seasonal time frames. Here we apply the full Aqua/MODIS dataset through 2006 to the improved MGDI algorithm across the woody ecosystems of North America and test the algorithm by comparison with confirmed, historical wildfire events and the windfall areas of documented major hurricanes. The MGDI accurately detects the location and extent of wildfire throughout North America and detects high and moderate severity impacts in the windfall area of major hurricanes. We also find detections associated with clear-cut logging and land-clearing on the forest-agricultural interface. The MGDI indicates that 1.5% (195,580 km(2)) of the woody ecosystems within North America was disturbed in 2005 and 0.5% (67,451 km(2)) was disturbed in 2006. The interannual variability is supported by wildfire detections and official burned area statistics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remotely sensing instruments, both airborne and spaceborne, of sufficient spectral resolution. can be used to identify absorptions that occur at 2.20 mu m, which are indicative of AlOH minerals. In a pixel containing green and/or dry vegetation the depth of the AlOH feature at 2.20 mu m is decreased. Since the depth of the feature at 2.20 mu m is an indicator of the AlOH content it is desirable to correct the depth of the 2.20 mu m feature in such a manner as to remove, or negate, the obscuring effect of the vegetation. This is achieved by using a multiple linear regression model where the coefficients of the linear model are produced via forward modeling, and where the independent variables are continuum removed band depth (CRBD) that are used to detect the presence of green and dry vegetation and the uncorrected AlOH CRBD. The proposed vegetation corrected continuum depth (VCCD) method was tested with synthetic datasets as well as hyperspectral data (HyMap) collected at Mount Isa in Queensland, Australia. The results of using the VCCD method on the uncorrected HyMap data were validated with vegetation free samples collected from the Mount Isa region. Improvements in the R squared statistics of the corrected 2.20 mu m CRBD to the vegetation free CRBD, after application of the VCCD, were found to be 2-4 times greater than the uncorrected 2.20 mu m CRBD. Visual inspection of large survey areas demonstrated that the uncorrected CRBD in vegetated areas were lower, and did not match adjacent vegetation free areas, and also produced false positives of high AlOH content.

AB Snow is among the most "colorful" materials in nature, but most of the variability in snow reflectance occurs beyond 0.8 mu m rather than in the visible spectrum. In these wavelengths, reflectance decreases dramatically as the snow grains evolve and grow, whereas in the visible spectrum snow reflectance is degraded by contaminants such as dust, algae, and soot. From imaging spectrometer data, we can estimate the grain size of the snow in the surface layer, and thereby derive spectral and broadband albedo. We can also estimate the fraction of each pixel that is covered by snow, the liquid water content in the surface layer, and the amount of radiative forcing caused by absorbing impurities. Estimates of fractional snow-covered area and albedo dramatically improve the performance of spatially distributed snowmelt models that include net solar radiation as an input value, most significantly in locations and at times where incident solar radiation is high and temperatures low. Experience with imaging spectrometer data has allowed extension of the fractional snow-cover and albedo estimates to multispectral sensors, particularly MODIS, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer.

AB The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we assessed the accuracy of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) GPP (gross primary productivity) Collections 4.5, 4.8 and 5 along with Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), light use efficiency (LUE) and meteorological variables that are used to estimate GPP for a northern Australian savanna site. Results of this study indicated that the MODIS products captured the seasonal variation in GPP, LAI and fPAR well. Using the index of agreement (IOA), it was found that Collections 4.5 and 4.8 (IOA 0.89 respectively) agreed reasonably well with flux tower measurements between 2001 and 2006. It was also found that MODIS Collection 4.5 predicted the dry season GPP well (Relative Predictive Error (RPE) 4.17%, IOA 0.72 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.05 g C m(-2) day(-1)), whilst Collection 4.8 performed better in capturing wet season dynamics (RPE 1.11%, IOA 0.80 and RMSE of 0.91 g C m(-2) day(-1)). Although the wet season magnitude of GPP was predicted well by Collection 4.8, an examination of the inputs to the GPP algorithm revealed that MODIS fPAR was too high, but this was compensated by PAR and WE that was too low. Although LAI and fPAR estimated by Collection 5 were more accurate. GPP for this Collection resulted in a much lower value (RPE 25%) due to errors in other factors. Recalculation of MODIS GPP using site specific input parameters indicated that MODIS fPAR was the main reason for the differences between MODIS and tower derived GPP followed by WE and meteorological inputs. GPP calculated using all site specific values agreed very well with tower data on an annual basis (IOA 0.94, RPE 6.06% and RMSE 0.83 g C m(-2) day(-1)) but the early initiation of the growing season calculated by the MODIS algorithm was improved when the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) function was replaced with a soil water deficit function. The results of this study however, reinforce previous findings in water limited regions, like Australia, and incorporation of soil moisture in a LUE model is needed to accurately estimate the productivity.

AB For two decades, remotely sensed data from imaging spectrometers have been used to estimate non-pigment biochemical constituents of vegetation, including water, nitrogen, cellulose, and lignin. This interest has been motivated by the important role that these substances play in physiological processes such as photosynthesis, their relationships with ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and their use in identifying key plant species and functional groups. This paper reviews three areas of research to improve the application of imaging spectrometers to quantify non-pigment biochemical constituents of plants. First, we examine recent empirical and modeling studies that have advanced our understanding of leaf and canopy reflectance spectra in relation to plant biochemistry. Next, we present recent examples of how spectroscopic remote sensing methods are applied to characterize vegetation canopies, communities and ecosystems. Third, we highlight the latest developments in using imaging spectrometer data to quantify net primary production (NPP) over large geographic areas. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in quantifying non-pigment biochemical constituents of plant canopies from remotely sensed spectra. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history and have been stable for 2.5 billion years, providing prima facie evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to leaf functioning, greater effort is needed to determine whether individual pigments can be identified and quantified in vivo using high fidelity spectroscopy. We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for robust remote observation and quantification. New methods to identify and quantify individual pigments in the presence of overlapping absorption features would provide a major advance in understanding their biological functions, quantifying net carbon exchange, and identifying plant stresses.

AB The impact of mineral aerosol (dust) in the Earth's system depends on particle characteristics which are initially determined by the terrestrial sources from which the sediments are entrained. Remote sensing is an established method for the detection and mapping of dust events, and has recently been used to identify dust source locations with varying degrees of success. This paper compares and evaluates five principal methods, using MODIS Level 1B and MODIS Level 2 aerosol data, to: (a) differentiate dust (mineral aerosol) from nondust, and (2) determine the extent to which they enable the source of the dust to be discerned. The five MODIS LIB methods used here are: (1) un-processed false colour composite (FCC), (2) brightness temperature difference, (3) Ackerman's (1997: J.Geophys. Res., 102, 17069-17080) procedure, (4) Miller's (2003:Geophys. Res. Lett. 30, 20, art.no.2071) dust enhancement algorithm and (5) Roskovensky and Liou's (2005: Geophys. Res. Lett. 32, L12809) dust differentiation algorithm; the aerosol product is MODIS Deep Blue (Hsu et al., 2004: IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sensing, 42, 557-569), which is optimised for use over bright surfaces (i.e. deserts). These are applied to four significant dust events from the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. OMl Al was also examined for each event to provide an independent assessment of dust presence and plume location. All of the techniques were successful in detecting dust when compared to FCCs, but the most effective technique for source determination varied from event to event depending on factors such as cloud cover, dust plume mineralogy and surface reflectance. Significantly, to optimise dust detection using the MODIS L1B approaches, the recommended dust/non-dust thresholds had to be considerably adjusted on an event by event basis. MODIS L2 aerosol data retrievals were also found to vary in quality significantly between events; being affected in particular by cloud masking difficulties. In general, we find that OMI AI and MODIS AQUA L7 B and L2 data are complementary; the former are ideal for initial dust detection, the latter can be used to both identify plumes and sources at high spatial resolution. Overall, approaches using brightness temperature difference (BT10-11) are the most consistently reliable technique for dust source identification in the Lake Eyre Basin. One reason for this is that this enclosed basin contains multiple dust sources with contrasting geochemical signatures. In this instance, BTD data are not affected significantly by perturbations in dust mineralogy. However, the other algorithms tested (including MODIS Deep Blue) were all influenced by ground surface reflectance or dust mineralogy; making it impossible to use one single MODIS LIB or L2 data type for all events (or even for a single multiple-plume event). There is, however, considerable potential to exploit this anomaly, and to use dust detection algorithms to obtain information about dust mineralogy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The management of diverse biota within protected areas is affected by both land cover change within a protected area and habitat loss and fragmentation in the surrounding landscape. Satellite images provide a synoptic view of land cover patterns, but the use of such imagery requires careful consideration of sensor type, resolution, extent, and the metrics used to quantify ecologically significant change. We examined these factors for landscape monitoring applications in four small National Parks near Washington, DC: Antietam National Battlefield, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park and Rock Creek Park. Using 4 m Ikonos, 10 m SPOT, 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ and 30 m Landsat ETM+ imagery, the parks and surrounding areas were mapped to National Land Cover system classes. For each park, we examined four methods for defining map extent, including park administrative boundaries, two variable buffer widths, and watershed boundaries, and then analyzed patterns of forest habitat for the maps using a graph theoretic approach (critical dispersal threshold distance) and common landscape metrics (number of patches, percent forest, forest edge density, and forest area-weighted mean patch size). As expected, landscape metrics for maps derived at differing resolutions varied significantly, but map extent often yielded even larger differences. We found that for most applications, coarser scale data (e.g., 30 m Landsat) are adequate for characterizing landscape pattern, although ultimately data from multiple sensors may be appropriate or necessary based on different objectives of landscape monitoring (e.g., mapping single trees vs. forest stands) and the scale at which a resource of interest interacts with the larger landscape (e.g., birds vs. herptiles). Our results provide a strong caution regarding the practical issues associated with combining data sources from multiple satellite sensors for monitoring applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB A major focus of conservation is on protecting areas to ensure the persistence of biological diversity. Because such areas may be large, not easily accessible, subject to change, and sensitive to the surrounding landscape, remote sensing can be a valuable tool in establishing and managing protected areas. We describe three case studies to illustrate how remote sensing can contribute to setting priorities for conservation actions, monitoring the status of conservation targets, and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. In the Connecticut River watershed, remote sensing has been used to assess flood regimes and identify key areas of floodplain forests and their context for conservation planning. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, remote sensing has provided information to assess the effectiveness of management strategies to restore fire to the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem, control invasive species, and prioritize annual prescribed burns. In eastern US forests, remote sensing is being used to evaluate the ecological condition and changes at properties where direct access would be difficult.
   As the resolution and capacities of remote-sensing technology continue to develop, however, several issues are becoming increasingly important. It is essential that the spatial and temporal resolution of remotesensing data be matched to the relevant scales of biodiversity, major threats, and management actions. Data layers must be compatible, both in scale and in measurement properties, and key patterns must be distinguished from irrelevant detail, especially at the finer scales of application in local management. Combining remote sensing with ground surveys can expand the array of information used in management and contribute to the ecological interpretation of remote-sensing data. Because conservation funds are always limited, remote sensing also must be cost effective. This requires balancing the wealth of detail afforded by ever-finer resolution of remote-sensing data with what is actually needed to implement sound conservation and management. Remote sensing is a valuable tool, but it is not a panacea for all of the challenges of conservation monitoring and management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Land-cover maps are often used to compute land-cover composition (i.e., the proportion or percent of area covered by each class), for each unit in a spatial partition of the region mapped. We derive design-based estimators of mean deviation (MD), mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation (CORR) to quantify accuracy of land-cover composition for a general two-stage cluster sampling design, and for the special case of simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) at each stage. The bias of the estimators for the two-stage SRSWOR design is evaluated via a simulation study. The estimators of RMSE and CORR have small bias except when sample size is small and the land-cover class is rare. The estimator of MAD is biased for both rare and common land-cover classes except when sample size is large. A general recommendation is that rare land-cover classes require large sample sizes to ensure that the accuracy estimators have small bias. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The snow water equivalent (SWE) for the Red River basin of North Dakota and Minnesota was retrieved from data acquired by passive microwave SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) sensors mounted on the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, physiographic and atmospheric data by an artificial neural network called Modified Counter Propagation Network (MCPN), a Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR) and a nonlinear regression. The airborne gamma-ray measurements of SWE for 1989 and 1997 were used as observed SWE, and SSM/I data of 19 and 37 GHz frequencies, in both horizontal and vertical polarization, were used for the calibration (1989 data from DMSP-F8) and validation (1997 data from DMSP-F10 and F13 of both ascending and descending overpass times were combined) of the models. The SSM/I data were screened for the presence of wet snow, large water bodies like lakes and rivers, and depth-hoar. The MCPN model produced encouraging results in both calibration and validation stages (R 2 was about 0.9 for both calibration (C) and validation (V)), better than PPR (R-2 was 0.86 for C and 0.62 for V), which in turn was better than the multivariate nonlinear regression at the calibration stage (R-2 was 0.78 for C and 0.71 for V). MCPN is probably better than the linear and nonlinear regression counterparts because of its parallel computing structure resulted from neurons interconnected by a parallel network and its ability to learn and generalize information from complex relationships such as the SWE-SSM/I or other relationships encountered in geosciences.

AB The Lena River Delta, situated in Northern Siberia (72.0-73.8 degrees N, 122.0-129.5 degrees E), is the largest Arctic delta and covers 29,000 km(2). Since natural deltas are characterised by complex geomorphological patterns and various types of ecosystems, high spatial resolution information on the distribution and extent of the delta environments is necessary for a spatial assessment and accurate quantification of biogeochemical processes as drivers for the emission of greenhouse gases from tundra soils. In this study, the first land cover classification for the entire Lena Delta based on Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images was conducted and used for the quantification of methane emissions from the delta ecosystems on the regional scale. Nine land cover classes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the wetland dominated (72%) Lena Delta could be defined by this classification approach. The mean daily methane emission of the entire Lena Delta was calculated with 10.35 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Taking our multi-scale approach into account we find that the methane source strength of certain tundra wetland types is lower than calculated previously on coarser scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding the influence of within-pixel land cover heterogeneity is essential for the extrapolation of measured and modeled CO2 fluxes from the canopy to regional scales using remote sensing. Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) was used to estimate spatial and temporal variations of gross primary production (GPP) across a jack pine chronosequence of four sites in Saskatchewan, Canada for comparison with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product. This study utilizes high resolution canopy structural information obtained from airborne lidar to bridge gaps in spatial representation between plot, eddy covariance (EC), and MODIS estimates of vegetation GPP. First we investigate linkages between canopy structure obtained from measurements and light response curves at a jack pine chronosequence during the growing season of 2004. Second, we use the measured canopy height and foliage cover inputs to create a structure-based GPP model (GPP(Landsberg)) which was tested in 2005. The GPP model is then run using lidar data (GPP(Lidar)) and compared with eight-day cumulative MODIS GPP (GPP(MODIS)) and EC observations (GPP(EC)). Finally, we apply the lidar GPP model at spatial resolutions of 1 m to 1000 m to examine the influence of within-pixel heterogeneity and scaling (or pixel aggregation) on GPP(Lidar). When compared over eight-day cumulative periods throughout the 2005 growing season, the standard deviation of differences between GPP(lidar) and GPPMODIS were less than differences between either of them and GPP(EC) at all sites. As might be expected, the differences between pixel aggregated GPP estimates are most pronounced at sites with the highest levels of spatial canopy heterogeneity. The results of this study demonstrate one method for using lidar to scale between eddy covariance flux towers and coarse resolution remote sensing pixels using a structure-based Landsberg light curve model.

AB This paper examines the rationale for and implications of using a near-infrared band to estimate the absorption of visible light by vegetation canopies. The benefits of using near-infrared observations have already been documented extensively in the literature, notably in the context of applications based on vegetation indices. These include, for instance, a degree of normalization with respect to undesirable perturbing factors. Our intent here is twofold: provide the theoretical basis to justify using measurements outside the main absorption band of vegetation for the purpose of retrieving canopy properties, and uncover the implications of doing so. On the basis of simple radiation transfer considerations, we conclude that near-infrared observations are critical to ensure the accurate retrieval of absorption estimates in the visible domain, and that observations within the absorption band help control the perturbing effect of the soil background.
   The analytical approach implemented here is conceptually similar to a scale analysis which permits us assessing the most significant contributions to the absorption and scattering processes in the vast majority of geophysical situations. Our final conclusions derived from a series of intermediate steps that need to be performed first. To this end, we illustrate in Section 2 the fact that a suitably-defined one-dimensional radiation transfer model can always be setup to represent accurately the reflected, transmitted and absorbed fraction of vertical fluxes in any vegetation volume at medium spatial resolutions (100 m or lower), and this irrespective of the local variability exhibited by the canopy attributes. This finding is exploited throughout the paper to show that 1) measurements performed in the near-infrared band are needed to ensure a large dynamic range in albedo for dense canopy conditions, by contrast to the visible domain, 2) measurements in the visible domain are effective to remove the contribution due to the background below vegetation for low to intermediate LAI conditions. This is made possible thanks to the soil line concept and the spectral invariance of the interception process, and 3) the estimation of visible light absorption in a canopy on the basis of combinations of spectral bands (as implemented in traditional vegetation indices) hinges on spectral correlations between variables, most notably those controlling the absorbing and scattering properties of the soil and leaves. A series of implications and consequences is drawn from our analysis and, in particular. the suggestion to adopt modern interpretation techniques, superseding the commonly used vegetation index approaches. These advances allow us to improve on current approaches, in particular by lifting some of the hypotheses associated with approaches based on combinations of spectral bands. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Most remote sensing algorithms for phytoplankton in inland waters aim at the retrieval of the pigment chlorophyll a (Chl a), as this pigment is a useful proxy for phytoplankton biomass. More recently, algorithms have been developed to quantify the pigment phycocyanin (PC), which is characteristic of cyanobacteria, a phytoplankton group of relative importance to inland water management due to their negative impact on water quality in response to eutrophication.
   We evaluated the accuracy of three published algorithms for the remote sensing of PC in inland waters, using an extensive database of field radiometric and pigment data obtained in the Netherlands and Spain in the period 2001-2005. The three algorithms (a baseline, single band ratio, and a nested band ratio approach) all target the PC absorption effect observed in reflectance spectra in the 620 nm region. We evaluated the sensitivity of the algorithms to errors in reflectance measurements and investigated their performance in cyanobacteria-dominated water bodies as well as in the presence of other phytoplankton pigments.
   All algorithms performed best in moderate to high PC concentrations (50-200 mg m(-3)) and showed the most linear response to increasing PC in cyanobacteria-dominated waters. The highest errors showed at PC<50 mg m(-3). In eutrophic waters, the presence of other pigments explained a tendency to overestimate the PC concentration. In oligotrophic waters, negative PC predictions were observed. At very high concentrations (PC>200 mg m(-3)), PC underestimations by the baseline and single band ratio algorithms were attributed to a non-linear relationship between PC and absorption in the 620 nm region. The nested band ratio gave the overall best fit between predicted and measured PC. For the Spanish dataset, a stable ratio of PC over cyanobacterial Chl a was observed, suggesting that PC is indeed a good proxy for cyanobacterial biomass. The single reflectance ratio was the only algorithm insensitive to changes in the amplitude of reflectance spectra, which were observed as a result of different measurement methodologies.

AB Taking three snow seasons from November 1 to March 31 of year 2002 to 2005 in northern Xinjiang, China as an example, this study develops a new daily snow cover product (500 m) through combining MODIS daily snow cover data and AMSR-E daily snow water equivalent (SWE) data. By taking advantage of both high spatial resolution of optical data and cloud transparency of passive microwave data, the new daily snow cover product greatly complements the deficiency of MODIS product when cloud cover is present especially for snow cover product on a daily basis and effectively improves daily snow detection accuracy. In our example, the daily snow agreement of the new Product with the in situ measurements at 20 stations is 75.4%, which is much higher than the 33.7% of the MODIS daily product in all weather conditions, even a little higher than the 71% of the MODIS 8-day product (cloud cover of similar to 5%). Our results also indicate that i) AMSR-E daily SWE imagery generally agrees with MODlOAl data in detecting snow cover, with overall agreement of 93.4% and snow agreement of 96.6% in the study area: ii) AMSR-E daily SWE imagery underestimates the snow covered area (SCA) due to its coarse spatial resolution; iii) The new snow cover product can better and effectively capture daily SCA dynamics during the snow seasons, which plays a significant role in reduction, mitigation, and prevention of snow-caused disasters in pastoral areas.

AB The worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers has important consequences for the water, food, and power supply of large and densely populated areas in South and Central Asia. Successful mitigation of the hydrological impacts on societies as well as assessing glacier-related hazards require large-scale monitoring of glacier dynamics. However, detailed glaciological data from the Asian highlands are lacking, due to its size and difficult accessibility. We have applied a novel technique for precise ortho rectification, co-registration, and sub-pixel correlation of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery to derive surface velocities of Himalayan glaciers. Our approach allows for the correction of offsets due to attitude effects and sensor distortions, as well as elevation errors if a digital elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used for orthorectification. After post-processing, the error on the displacements is on the order of 2-4 m per correlation. Translated into annual velocities, this error is reduced (increased) when the correlated images are more (less) than a year apart. Through application of a filtering procedure and several quality tests, the consistency of the results is validated to provide confidence in the remotely sensed velocity measurements, despite the lack of ground control. This novel approach allows fast, easy, and economically viable acquisition of detailed glaciological data in areas of difficult access and provides a means for large-scale monitoring of glaciers in high mountainous terrain.

AB Recent studies of vegetation phenology of northern forests using satellite data Suggest that the observed earlier spring increase and peak amplitude of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are a result of climate warming. In addition to undergoing all increase in temperature, the northern forests of Canada have also seen a dramatic increase in area burned by wildfire over the same time period. Using the Canadian Large Fire Database, we analyzed the impact fire had oil the phenological dates derived from fitting a logistical model to yearly data from 2004 for several different subsets of both AVHRR-NDVI and MODIS LAI in wildfire dominated terrestrial ecozones. Fire had a significant but complex effect oil estimated phenology dates. The most recently burned areas (1994-2003) had later green-up dates in two ecozones for AVHRR data and all ecozones for MODIS. However, older forested (not burned during 1980-2003) had estimated green-up dates I to 9 clays earlier than the entire forested area in the MODIS LAI data. These data corroborate studies in Canada and demonstrate that fire history is influencing boreal forest phenology and growing season LAI. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The results of the first consecutive 12 months of the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global burned area product are presented. Total annual and monthly area burned statistics and missing data statistics are reported at global and continental scale and with respect to different land cover classes. Globally the total area burned labeled by the MODIS burned area product is 3.66 x 10(6) km(2) for July 2001 to June 2002 while the MODIS active fire product detected for the same period a total of 2.78 x 10(6) km(2), i.e., 24% less than the area labeled by the burned area product. A spatio-temporal correlation analysis of the two MODIS fire products stratified globally for pre-fire leaf area index (LAI) and percent tree cover ranges indicate that for low percent tree cover and LAI. the MODIS burned area product defines a greater proportion of the landscape as burned than the active fire product; and with increasing tree cover (>60%) and LAI (>5) the MODIS active fire product defines a relatively greater proportion. This pattern is generally observed in product comparisons stratified with respect to land cover. Globally, the burned area product reports a smaller amount of area burned than the active fire product in croplands and evergreen forest and deciduous needleleaf forest classes, comparable areas for mixed and deciduous broadleaf forest classes, and a greater amount of area burned for the non-forest classes. The reasons for these product differences are discussed in terms of environmental spatio-temporal fire characteristics and remote sensing factors, and highlight the planning needs for MODIS burned area product validation.

AB An accurate and globally representative forward radiative transfer model (RTM) is needed to explore improvements in sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals from spaceborne infrared observations. This study evaluates the biases in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperatures (BT) modeled with the moderate resolution transmission (MODTRAN4.2) band RTM, bounded by a Fresnel's reflective flat sea surface. This model is used to simulate global clear-sky Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) nighttime BTs from NOAA-15 through 18 and MetOp-A platforms for one full day of IS February 2007. Inputs to RTM (SST fields and vertical profiles of atmospheric relative humidity, temperature, pressure, and geopotential height) are specified from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data. Model BTs in AVHRR channels 3B (3.7 mu m), 4 (11 mu m), and 5 (12 mu m) are then compared with their respective measured counterparts, available in the NESDIS operational SST files. Ideally, the RTM should match the observations, but in fact, the modeled BTs are biased high with respect to the AVHRR BTs. The "Model minus Observation" (M - O) bias ranges from about 0 to 2 K, depending upon spectral band, view zenith angle, and sea and atmosphere state at the retrieval point. The bias asymptotically decreases towards confidently clear-sky conditions, but it never vanishes and invariably shows channel-specific dependencies on view zenith angle and geophysical conditions (e.g., column water vapor and sea-air temperature difference). Fuller exploration of the potential of the current RTM (e.g., adding global vertical aerosol profiles) or improvements to its input (NCEP SST and atmospheric profiles) may reduce this bias, but they cannot fully reconcile its spectral and angular structure. The fact that the M-O biases are closely reproducible for five AVHRR sensors flown onboard different platforms adds confidence in the validation approach employed in this study. We emphasize the need for establishing a globally adequate forward RTM for the use in SST modeling and retrievals. A first test of the RTM adequacy is its ability, when used in conjunction with the global fields from the numerical weather prediction models, to reproduce the TOA clear-sky radiances measured by satellite sensors.

AB Climatologically homogeneous regions in the Carolinas were delineated using a multi-step approach integrating in-situ and remotely-sensed data. We adopted a consensus clustering technique that obtains climate regions for precipitation and temperature separately. Both average linkage hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were used to create weather station clusters. Using the resulting precipitation and temperature clusters as training data, we performed a machine-learning decision tree classification of remotely-sensed data (i.e., MODIS and TRMM) to map five precipitation classes and seven temperature classes for the Carolinas. These data were intersected to produce 17 consensus clusters for the Carolinas, and 16 climate regions when summarized by counties.
   The resultant climate regions showed rational climate regionalization reflecting controls on Carolina climate including topography, latitude, storm tracks, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The use of remotely-sensed data effectively helped the delineation between weather station clusters and even detected consensus clusters that were not identified by intersecting weather station clusters grouped using only in-situ data. We compared the regions with the 15 existing National Climatic Data Center climate divisions using within- and between-cluster standard deviations for both in-situ and remotely-sensed data. Climate regions could improve the existing climate divisions in delineating climatologically homogeneous regions and in separating heterogeneous regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation and land use planning in humid tropical lowland forests urgently need accurate remote sensing techniques to distinguish among floristically different forest types. We investigated the degree to which floristically and structurally defined Costa Rican lowland rain forest types can be accurately discriminated by a non-parametric k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classifier or linear discriminant analysis. Pixel values of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model extracted from segments or from 5 x 5 pixel windows were employed in the classifications. 104 field plots were classified into three floristic and one structural type of forest (regrowth forest). Three floristically defined forest types were formed through clustering the old-growth forest plots (n=52) by their species specific importance values. An error assessment of the image classification was conducted via cross-validation and error matrices, and overall percent accuracy and Kappa scores were used as measures of accuracy. Image classification of the four forest types did not adequately distinguish two old-growth forest classes, so they were merged into a single forest class. The resulting three forest classes were most accurately classified by the k-nn classifier using segmented image data (overall accuracy 91 %). The second best method, with respect to accuracy, was the k-nn with 5 x 5 pixel windows data (89% accuracy), followed by the canonical discriminant analysis using the 5 x 5 pixel window data (86%) and the segment data (82%). We conclude the k-nn classifier can accurately distinguish floristically and structurally different rain forest types. The classification accuracies were higher for the k-nn classifier than for the canonical discriminant analysis, but the differences in Kappa scores were not statistically significant. The segmentation did not increase classification accuracy in this study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many current models of ecosystem carbon exchange based on remote sensing, such as the MODIS product termed MOD17, still require considerable input from ground based meteorological measurements and look up tables based on vegetation type. Since these data are often not available at the same spatial scale as the remote sensing imagery, they can introduce substantial errors into the carbon exchange estimates. Here we present further development of a gross primary production (GPP) model based entirely on remote sensing data. In contrast to an earlier model based only on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), this model, termed the Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, also includes the land surface temperature (LST) product from MODIS. In addition to its obvious relationship to vegetation temperature, LST was correlated with vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation. Combination of EVI and LST in the model substantially improved the correlation between predicted and measured GPP at 11 eddy correlation flux towers in a wide range of vegetation types across North America. In many cases, the TG model provided substantially better predictions of GPP than did the MODIS GPP product. However, both models resulted in poor predictions for sparse shrub habitats where solar angle effects on remote sensing indices were large. Although it may be possible to improve the MODIS GPP product through improved parameterization, our results suggest that simpler models based entirely on remote sensing can provide equally good predictions of GPP.

AB Radiometric measurements near 19 and 37 GHz have been used for estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) for many years. Most conventional SWE retrieval algorithms depend on the difference between the brightness temperatures (T-b's) at these frequencies. The effect of atmospheric absorption is generally assumed to be insignificant, and thus often not taken into account in such estimation. In this paper this effect is closely examined with the aid of AMSR-E and radiosonde data sets over two widely separated regions in the continental U.S.A. Results of the analysis show that even under a clear sky the atmospheric absorption could account for as much as similar to 25-50% to the estimation of SWE. For example, the AMSR-E estimated SWE of 10 cm would become about 13.6 cm when measured at the ground level under the same atmospheric condition; the estimation based on surface emission alone (i.e., no atmosphere) would be about 15.2 cm. There is some regional dependence of this atmospheric absorption effect, but the effect of seasonal variation is negligibly small. Under cloudy conditions, the impact of liquid cloud absorption is significant and it appears necessary to perform either cloud screening or quantify the cloud effects on SWE estimation from 19 to 37 GHz radiometric measurements at ground level or satellite altitudes.

AB Sustainable rangeland stewardship calls for synoptic estimates of rangeland biomass quantity (kg dry matter ha(-1)) and quality [carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio]. These data are needed to support estimates of rangeland crude protein in forage, either by percent (CPc or by mass (CPm). Biomass derived from remote sensing data is often compromised by the presence of both photosynthetically active (PV) and non-photosynthetically active (NPV) vegetation. Here, we explicitly quantify PV and NPV biomass using HyMap hyperspectral imagery. Biomass quality, defined as plant C:N ratio, was also estimated using a previously published algorithm. These independent algorithms for forage quantity and quality (both PV and NPV) were evaluated in two northern mixed-grass prairie ecoregions, one in the Northwestern Glaciated Plains (NGGP) and one in the Northwestern Great Plains (NGP). Total biomass (kg ha (-1)) and C:N ratios were mapped with 18% and 8% relative error, respectively. Outputs from both models were combined to quantify crude protein (kg ha(-1)) on a pasture scale. Results suggest synoptic maps of rangeland vegetation mass (both PV and NPV) and quality may be derived from hyperspectral aerial imagery with greater than 80% accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we present a new spectrogoniophotometer (SGP) dedicated to the assessment of plant leaf bidirectional optical properties. It consists of a mechanical apparatus coupled with an imaging spectrometer using a bidimensional CCD photodetector. Unpolarized light fluxes are sampled at high spectral and directional resolution to provide biconical reflectance and transmittance factors, every nanometer from 500 nm to 880 nm and at 800 source-sensor configurations (four illumination directions by 200 Viewing directions covering the whole sphere). From these calibrated measurements we derive the leaf Bidirectional Reflectance and Transmittance Distribution Functions (BRDF and BTDF). The angular-integrated quantities defined as the Directional Hemispherical Reflectance and Transmittance Function (DHRF and DHTF) are also calculated. The first three sections emphasize the instrumental and calibration issues, as well as the radiometric definitions. In the last section we present some experimental results acquired on various monocot and dicot leaves with special attention to surface reflection. The shape, position and magnitude of the specular lobe, which is a characteristic of many leaves in the forward direction, is investigated for beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and laurel (Prunus laurocerasits L.) using a leaf BRDF model. The width of the specular peak is very variable according to the species and the illumination angle, as well as its contribution to the directional -hemispherical reflectance. Finally, implications in plant physiology or remote sensing are broached. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A detailed understanding of the spatial patterns of burning is valuable for managing biodiversity and ecosystems. This research assesses the performance of several spectral indices derived from Landsat data when modelling fire occurrence probability by means of logistic regression. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the greenness and wetness components of the Tasseled Cap Transformation were tested. Landscape variables (topography, accessibility and structural vegetation) were also included as predictors in models development. Although fire fisk is closely related to weather and vegetation status at a given time, it is also strongly linked to fire history, and changes in predictor values in years previous to the fire were events also considered. The models generated correctly classified about 70% of the validation data set. The inclusion of pre-fire spectral indices improved models ability to predict fire occurrence. Although the NBR-based model was the most accurate, TCWetness and NDVI-based models showed similar results, while TCGreenness performed worst. Models with no spectral indices described the fire-proneness of the landscape structure, while the inclusion of spectral indices improved the recognition of particular spatial conditions. Slope and distance to the nearest path were also identified as valuable predictors. All the models identified the main fire risk zones in the study area. Their integration into a single, integrated model properly described fire-proneness and is suggested to be a valuable tool for the identification and management of fire risk. The method used is simple, describes the key variables and spatial pattern of the fire regime and is suited to operational use in Mediterranean ecosystems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The eddy covariance technique provides measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) Of CO2 between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, which is widely used to estimate ecosystem respiration and gross primary production (GPP) at a number Of CO2 eddy flux tower sites. In this paper, canopy-level maximum light use efficiency, a key parameter in the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), was estimated by using the observed CO2 flux data and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data from eddy flux tower sites in an alpine swamp ecosystem, an alpine shrub ecosystem and an alpine meadow ecosystem in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. The VPM model uses two improved vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectral radiometer (MODIS) data and climate data at the flux tower sites, and estimated the seasonal dynamics of GPP of the three alpine grassland ecosystems in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM model agreed well with estimated GPP from eddy flux towers. These results demonstrated the potential of the satellite-driven VPM model for scaling-up GPP of alpine grassland ecosystems, a key component for the study of the carbon cycle at regional and global scales.

AB While satellite images effectively show surface urban heat islands in urbanized areas, linking surface temperatures to actual ambient temperatures remains a research challenge. Microclimates in urbanized settings can vary tremendously in very short distances, making adequate climate interpolations across a large metropolitan area difficult, at best. This study links the coarse scale of satellite (ASTER) images to the fine scale of hand-held thermography as part of an in-depth suburban neighborhood climate study to determine if ASTER imaging can be used to adequately estimate neighborhood climate conditions in an urbanized area. The study utilizes day and night remotely-sensed and ground data from June, 2004 for Phoenix, Arizona. Microclimate conditions of three urban fringe neighborhoods with varying amounts of natural vegetation and development density were studied, along with ASTER remote sensing data, mobile climate transects, and spot infrared thermographic images.
   These neighborhoods, though variable, showed only minor differences, and the study indicates that daytime images (11:20 am) do not adequately rank observed conditions within these neighborhoods - the highest ASTER surface temperatures were recorded for the least-dense neighborhood with a natural desert landscaping, though lowest ambient temperatures were measured there. Daytime mean surface temperatures versus air temperatures were 50.4 degrees C (30.8 degrees C air temp); 53.5 degrees C (29.7 degrees C) and 50.6 degrees C (31.9 degrees C). It was found that nighttime (10:40 pm LST) differences among neighborhoods of surface and air temperatures were relatively consistent, with the most densely developed neighborhood having the highest ASTER surface temperatures (29.0 degrees C) and transect-derived air temperatures (30.0 degrees C). Issues of view angle, shadowing, emissivity, resolution, and wind conditions for daytime results with their relatively small mean differences observed across the neighborhoods may explain why the rank of ASTER thermal conditions versus observed ambient conditions was poor. However, following sunset, these issues of view angle, etc., are much less problematic. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (BUBBLE) is a joint European research project under the umbrella of COST (Cooperation Europeenne dans la domaine de la recherche Scientifique et Technique, COST 715: Meteorology applied to urban pollution problems). Besides very detailed field measurements of the structure and dynamics of the urban boundary layer, a series of satellite data has been analyzed and validated. Satellite data from MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR (14,15, and 16) and Landsat-ETM were used and recorded during June and July 2002 in parallel to the BUBBLE field campaign. MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR data represent day and nighttime surface radiation temperatures in 930 m and I 100 m grid size. Landsat-ETM offers a unique resolution on 60 m, but with only daytime imagery at about the same time of MODIS overpass is available. This enables the validation of satellite measurements from different sensors with ground measurements at locations with various degrees of spatial homogeneity/heterogeneity (urban/rural land use). Several different algorithms for NOAA-AVHRR data were compared with in-situ measurements. The results show a very high correlation of the long wave emissions measured by the satellite with the in-situ measurements showing an accuracy of +/- 3% to 5% on average, even in urban environments.

AB Reliable and repeatable field sampling methods are needed for monitoring ecosystem optical properties linked to carbon flux. Here we describe a tram system, consisting of a dual-detector spectrometer mounted on a robotic cart for mobile sampling of ecosystem spectral reflectance. To illustrate the application of this system for monitoring dynamic ecosystem activity, we illustrate how the tram can be used for exploring the multiple factors influencing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a measure of vegetation greenness and a key optical indicator of vegetation carbon dioxide assimilation. With this system, we collected five years of NDVI data for a chaparral ecosystem in Southern California subject to extreme disturbance. Key factors affecting NDVI at this site included snow cover, sky conditions (clear vs. cloudy), time of day, season, species composition, and environmental perturbations such as rainfall, drought and fire. Applications of this tram system include ecosystem monitoring, satellite validation, and developing surface-atmosphere flux models from remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud top heights as derived using measurements of two instruments (GOME and ATSR-2) onboard the ESA ERS-2 space platform are intercompared. It was found that cloud altitudes obtained using thermal IR measurements of ATSR-2 highly correlate with those obtained from top-of-atmosphere backscattered solar light measurements of GOME in O-2 A-band using both the semi-analytical cloud retrieval algorithm SACURA and the neural network cloud retrieval algorithm ROUNN. The average cloud top heights as obtained by these diverse techniques for the whole data set analyzed (931 GOME pixels) differ by 0.6 km on average, with larger values given by SACURA as applied to GOME data. We found that the standard deviation of SACURA-derived results for cloud top heights from those of ATSR-2 is equal to 1.8km, while the standard deviation of ROCINN-derived results is equal to 2.2km. The respective average deviations are 0.6km (SACURA) and -0.5km (ROCINN). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Patchiness is often considered a defining quality of ecosystems in and and semiarid regions. The spatial distribution of vegetation patches and soil nutrients coupled with wind and water erosion as well as biotic processes are believed to have an influence on land degradation. A geostatistical measure of spatial "connectivity" is presented to directly measure the size of patches in the landscape from a raster data set. Connectivity is defined as the probability that adjacent pixels belong to the same type of patch. Connectivity allows the size distribution of erodible patches to be quantified from a remote sensing image or field measurement, or specified for the purposes of modeling.
   Applied to high-resolution remote sensing imagery in the Jornada del Muerto Basin in New Mexico, the spatial distribution of plants indicates the current state of grassland-to-shrubland transition in addition to processes of degradation in this former grassland. Shrub encroachment is clearly evident from decreased intershrub patch size in coppice dunes of 27.8 m relative to shrublands of 65.2 m and grassland spacing of 118.9 m. Shrub patches remain a consistent 2-4m diameter regardless of the development of bush encroachment. A strong SW-NE duneland orientation correlates with the prevailing wind direction and suggests a strong aeolian control of surface geomorphology.
   With appropriate data sets and classification, potential applications of the connectivity method extend beyond vegetation dynamics, including mineralogy mapping, preserve planning, habitat fragmentation, pore spacing in surface hydrology, and microbial community dynamics.

AB The measurement of precipitation is fundamental to our understanding of the hydrological cycle. Increasingly, there exists the capacity to independently determine components of the hydrological cycle from remote sensing data. Developing techniques to combine effectively the multiple streams of information required for a water budget assessment provides a difficult challenge, particularly given the disparities in spatial and temporal scales between measurements and predictions. Two research groups, the Naval Research Laboratory Monterey (NRL) and the University of Arizona (UA), are using a combination of geostationary infrared and polar-orbiting microwave satellite data to derive 6-hourly precipitation estimates over a global 0.25 degrees grid. We examine the performance of these two algorithms for estimating the 24-h rainfall accumulation over India and Sri Lanka for the years 2002 and 2003. The derived values are compared with observations from a network of 39 national weather stations. In addition, two locations, Minicoy in the Laccadive Islands and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands were selected as being representative of the ocean environment to compare these satellite rainfall products against measurements from local rain gauges and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data. The NRL technique was accurate to within 25% of observed precipitation for only 33% of station locations, while the UA technique was accurate to within 25% of observed precipitation for about 47% of station locations.

AB A land surface vegetation index, defined as the difference of microwave land surface emissivity at 19 and 37 GHz, was calculated for a heavily forested area in north central Massachusetts. The microwave emissivity difference vegetation index (EDVI) was estimated from satellite SSM/I measurements at the defined wavelengths and used to estimate land surface turbulent fluxes. Narrowband visible and infrared measurements and broadband solar radiation observations were used in the EDVI retrievals and turbulent flux estimations. The EDVI values represent physical properties of crown vegetation such as vegetation water content of crown canopies. The collocated land surface turbulent and radiative fluxes were empirically linked together by the EDVI values. The EDVI values are statistically sensitive to evapotranspiration fractions (EF) with a correlation coefficient (R) greater than 0.79 under all-sky conditions. For clear skies, EDVI estimates exhibit a stronger relationship with EF than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, the products of EDVI and input energy (solar and photosynthetically active radiation) are statistically significantly correlated to evapotranspiration (R=0.95) and CO2 uptake flux (R=0.74), respectively.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 in single day surface reflectance (MOD09GQK) and 16-day composite gridded vegetation index data (MOD13Q1) were used to detect forest harvest disturbance between 2000 and 2004 in northern Maine. A MODIS multi-date Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forest change detection map was developed from each MODIS data set. A Landsat TM/ETM+ change detection map was developed as a reference to assess the effect of disturbed forest patch size on classification accuracy (agreement) and disturbed area estimates of MODIS. The MODIS single day and 16-day composite data showed no significant difference in overall classification accuracies. However, the 16-day NDVI change detection map had marginally higher overall classification accuracy (at 85%), but had significantly lower detection accuracy related to disturbed patch size than the single day NDVI change detection map. The 16-day composite NDVI data achieved 69% detection accuracy and the single day NDVI achieved 76% when the disturbed patch size was greater than 20 ha. The detection accuracy increased to approximately 90% for both data sets when the patch size exceeded 50 ha. The R-2 (range 0.6 to 0.9) and slope (range 0.5 to 0.9) of regression lines between Landsat and MODIS data (based on forest disturbance percent of township) increased with the mean disturbed patch size of each township. The 95% confidence intervals of forest disturbance percent estimate for each township were narrow with less than 1% of each township at the mean MODIS forest disturbance level. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study introduces a change detection model based on Neighborhood Correlation Image (NCI) logic. It is based on the fact that the same geographic area (e.g., a 3 x 3 pixel window) on two dates of imagery will tend to be highly correlated if little change has occurred, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Computing the piecewise correlation between two data sets provides valuable information regarding the location and numeric change value derived using contextual information within the specified neighborhood. Various neighborhood configurations (i.e., multi-level NCIs) were explored in the study using high spatial resolution multispectral imagery: smaller neighborhood sizes provided some detailed change information (such as a new patios added to an existing building) at the cost of introducing some noise (such as changes in shadows). Larger neighborhood sizes were useful for removing this noise but introduced some inaccurate change information (such as removing some linear feature changes). When combined with image classification using a machine learning decision tree (C5.0), classifications based on multi-level NCIs yielded superior results (e.g., using a 3-pixel circular radius neighborhood had a Kappa of 0.94), compared to the classification that did not incorporate NCIs (Kappa=0.86).

AB Hyperspectral imagery of the Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas was used to evaluate upwelling spectral radiance, prairie spectral reflectance and band ratios of each as potential indicators of vascular plant species richness in a mesic grassland. The extent to which spatial variability in these parameters related to plant species richness also was investigated. A 224 channel hyperspectral data cube acquired in June 2000 by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) provided complete coverage of the 400-2500 nm range at approximately 10 run per channel. After band deletions accounted for detector overlap and strong atmospheric attenuation features, 176 bands were retained for analysis and spanned the 404-2400 nm range. Prairie reflectance was estimated via radiative transfer modeling and scaling to a library spectrum of highway construction material. Data were sampled from pixels having a 19 m ground sample distance (GSD) to represent each of 93 vegetation sampling transects. Reflectance and radiance at mid-infrared wavelengths (e.g., 1553 nm), and band ratios that were based on atmospheric windows in the red, near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra estimated species richness to within 6 to 7 species per transect. The 856 to 780 nm radiance or reflectance ratio yielded maximum adjusted coefficients of determination (r(2)) of approximately 0.4 in regressions with richness when data from bison-grazed and ungrazed areas were combined. These regressions remained significant (p <= 0.001) when only ungrazed areas were assessed although r(2) reduced to approximately 0.2. Richness was related significantly also to the 433 to 674 nm reflectance ratio for grazed-plus-ungrazed and ungrazed-only areas. In contrast, the effectiveness of the 433 to 674 nm radiance ratio was reduced by atmospheric backscatter. Species richness did not correlate strongly or consistently with transect spatial variability (coefficient of variation or range) in radiance, reflectance or band ratio value, apparently as a consequence of the relatively small area sampled for each transect (approximately 0.5 ha). Relationships between richness and prairie spectral features were explained by the influence of soil exposure on both parameters. Richness and estimated soil exposure tended to increase from ungrazed lowlands, to ungrazed slopes, to ungrazed uplands to grazed areas. Remotely sensed estimates of soil exposure may be particularly useful in addressing plant species richness on grazed grasslands owing to an overall similarity in spectral reflectance among dominant plant species.

AB Multitemporal glacier area mapping is a key element in accurately determining fresh water reserves, as well as providing an indicator of climate change.
   In Peru, the first glacier inventory was based on visual interpretation of aerial photos, requiring several years of effort. Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, on the other hand, provides an increasingly employed alternative for the monitoring of changes in glacier area and in other glaciological parameters.
   By means of Nonnalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) computations on TM images, an estimate of the glacierized area in Cordillera Blanca (Peni) was carried out for 1987 (643 +/- 63 km(2)) and 1996 (600 +/- 61 km(2)). Compared to an estimate of 721 km(2) in 1970, it can be concluded that the glacier area has retreated in this massif by more than 15% in 25 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A feasible method for mapping the fraction of Snow Covered Area (SCA) in the boreal zone is presented. The method (SCAmod) is based on a semi-empirical model, where three reflectance contributors (wet snow, snow-free ground and forest canopy), interconnected by an effective canopy transmissivity and SCA, constitute the observed reflectance from the target area. Given the reflectance observation, SCA is solved from the model. The predetermined values for the reflectance contributors can be adjusted to an optional wavelength region, which makes SCAmod adaptable to various optical sensors. The effective forest canopy transmissivity specifies the effect of forests on the local reflectance observation; it is estimated using Earth observation data similar to that employed in the actual SCA estimation. This approach enables operationl snow mapping for extensive areas, as auxiliary forest data are not needed.
   Our study area covers 404 000 km(2), comprising all drainage basins of Finland (with an average area of 60 km(2)) and some transboundary drainage basins common with Russia, Norway and Sweden. Applying SCAmod to NOAA/AVHRR cloud-free data acquired during melting periods 2001-2003, we estimated the areal fraction of snow cover for all the 5845 basins. The validation against in situ SCA from the Finnish snow course network indicates that with SCAmod, 15% (absolute SCA-units) accuracy for SCA is gained. Good results were also obtained from the validation against snow cover information provided by the Finnish weather station network, for example, 94% of snow-free and fully snow-covered basins were recognized. A general formula for deriving the statistical accuracy of SCA estimates provided by SCAmod is presented, complemented by the results when the AVHRR data are employed. Snow melting in Finland has been operatively monitored with SCAmod in Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) since year 2001. The SCA estimates have been assimilated to the Finnish national hydrological modelling and forecasting system since 2003, showing a substantial improvement in forecasts. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Hyperspectral data acquired by the Hyperion instrument, on board the Earth Observing-1 (EO-I) satellite, were evaluated for the discrimination of five important Brazilian sugarcane varieties(RB72-454, SP80-1816, SP80-1842, SP81-3250, and SP87-365). The radiance values were converted into surface reflectance images by a MODTRAN4-based technique. To discriminate varieties with similar reflectance values, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) was applied over the data. To obtain an adequate discriminant function, a stepwise method was used to select the best variables among surface reflectance values, ratios of reflectance, and several spectral indices potentially sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, leaf water, and lignin-cellulose. Results showed that the five Brazilian sugarcane varieties were discriminated using EO-I Hyperion data. Differences in canopy architecture affected sunlight penetration and reflectance, resulting in a higher reflectance for planophile (e.g., SP81-3250) than erectophile (e.g., SP80-1842) sugarcane plants. The variety SP80-1842 presented lower reflectance values, deeper lignin-cellulose absorption bands at 2103 nm and 2304 nm, shallower leaf liquid water absorption bands at 983 nm and 1205 rim, and lower leaf liquid water content than the other sugarcane varieties. To discriminate this cultivar, a single near-infrared (NIR) band threshold was used. To discriminate the other four sugarcane varieties with similar reflectance values, MDA was used producing a classification accuracy of 87.5% for a hold-out set of pixels. The comparison between the ground truth data and the MDA-derived classification image confirmed the model' capacity to differentiate the varieties accurately. The best results were obtained for the cultivar SP87-365 that presented the lowest spectral variability in the discriminant space. Some misclassified areas were associated with the cultivars SP80-1816 and SP81-3250 that showed the highest spectral variability. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study evaluates the fusion of DEMs from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study area consists of high elevation glaciers draining through the rough topography of the Bhutan Himalayas. It turns out that the ASTER-derived and SRTM3 DEMs have similar accuracy over the study area, but the SRTM3 DEM contains less gross errors. However, for rough topography large sections of the SRTM3 DEM contain no data. We therefore compile a combined SRTM3-ASTER DEM. From this final composite-master DEM, we produce repeat ASTER orthoimages from which we evaluate the DEM quality and derive glacier surface velocities through image matching. The glacier tongues north of the Himalayan main ridge, which enter the Tibet plateau, show maximum surface velocities in the order of 100-200 in year(-1). In contrast, the ice within the glacier tongues south of the main ridge flows with a few tens of meters per year. These findings have a number of implications, among others for glacier dynamics, glacier response to climate change, glacier lake development, or glacial erosion. The study indicates that space-based remote sensing can provide new insights into the magnitude of selected surface processes and feedback mechanisms that govern mountain geodynamics.

AB Global temporal composites of surface reflectances are among the most commonly used products of wide field-of-view satellite-borne instruments such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VEGETATION. The multi-temporal and spatial consistencies of these composites are key elements for their usefulness. In this paper, we use two different criteria to evaluate the quality of existing and new temporal composite products in SPOT-VEGETATION imagery. The first criterion, based on variograms, analyses the spatial characteristics of composite images, and the second one evaluates the quality of the time series based on the analysis of simultaneous imagery from VEGETATION 1 and VEGETATION 2. Thanks to these criteria, we show that the standard deviation of the errors that affect the surface reflectances of current composite products can be reduced by a factor greater than 2 using improved algorithms detailed in this paper. Finally, we produce multi-instrument composites by integrating images from both VEGETATION instruments to further improve the composite products. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents the combined analysis of RADARSAT products of different spatial resolutions acquired under different incidence angles for mapping burnt scars on forested areas of Central Portugal. Prior to the SAR data analysis, a number of pre-processing procedures were carried out. Noise was eliminated by adaptive texture preserving filtering. A specific algorithm for the geocoding of SAR images, based on a range-Doppler approach, enabled precise geocoding of the SAR data by means of a single very accurate ground control point. A novel incidence-angle-normalization for SAR imagery was applied to analyze the backscatter coefficient to a given incidence angles. Further, a backscatter coefficient analysis was performed according to the slope on forested areas and fire disturbed areas. A qualitative and quantitative investigation of the backscattering as related to the slope angle and time changes was performed. As a result of this analysis, the scenes that allowed maximizing the discrimination of burnt areas were selected as the input for the neural network classification. The investigation on the effect of the SAR incidence angle in burnt area discrimination determined that low incidence angles are required for discriminating burnt areas in hilly regions. It was also demonstrated that topography influences the level of discrimination of burnt areas since areas affected by forest fires on face-slopes presents higher backscatter coefficient than those back-slopes. Therefore, SAR data can play a significant role for burnt area mapping in Europe in those areas where optical data cannot be used due to persistent cloud cover. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation structure is an important parameter in fire risk assessment and fire behavior modeling. We present a new approach deriving the structure of the upper canopy by segmenting single trees from small footprint LIDAR data and deducing their geometric properties. The accuracy of the LIDAR data is evaluated using six geometric reference targets, with the standard deviation of the LIDAR returns on the targets being as low as 0.06 m. The segmentation is carried out by using cluster analysis on the LIDAR raw data in all three coordinate dimensions. From the segmented clusters, tree position, tree height, and crown diameter are derived and compared with field measurements. A robust linear regression of 917 tree height measurements yields a slope of 0.96 with an offset of 1 m and the adjusted R-2 resulting at 0.92. However, crown diameter is not well matched by the field measurements, with R 2 being as low as 0.2, which is most certainly due to random errors in the field measurements. Finally, a geometric reconstruction of the forest scene using a paraboloid model is carried out using values of tree position, tree height, crown diameter, and crown base height.

AB The use of lidar data to estimate critical variables needed for modeling wildfire behavior was tested on a Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.) in central Spain. Lidar data accurately estimated crown bulk density at the plot level (r(2)= 0.80). Lidar data could be used to directly estimate crown volume (r(2) = 0.92) and foliage biomass (r(2) = 0.84), which together produced better results than directly fitting the lidar data to crown bulk density. Incorporating equations that relate tree diameter at breast height and other forest parameters improved estimates of foliage biomass. Individual tree level analyses were not completely successful due to difficulty in accurately assigning laser pulses to the correct tree (r(2) = 0.14). (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper investigated the application of MODIS data for mapping regional land cover at moderate resolutions (250 and 500 in), for regional conservation purposes. Land cover maps were generated for two major conservation areas (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem-GYE, USA and the Par State, Brazil) using MODIS data and decision tree classifications. The MODIS land cover products were evaluated using existing Landsat TM land cover maps as reference data. The Landsat TM land cover maps were processed to their fractional composition at the MODIS resolution (250 and 500 m). In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

AB A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are Valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior Of Such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to Simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content oil the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI 1, MTV12, and MCAR12) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTV12) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCAR12), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCAR12 and MTV12 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding RMSE for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud screening of satellite data for the remote sensing of atmospheric aerosols, ocean sediments, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton in the marine environment is a major problem in the absence of information from thermal channel. This is particularly the case with the data from some of the highly potential satellite sensors such as the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-on board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P4) and the SeaWiFS. Two main tests conventionally used for cloud screening of data from such satellite sensors are the threshold method applied to visible and near-IR bands and the visible to near-IR channel ratio method. These methods do not have the potential to eliminate the pixels with small cloud fractions, leading to overestimation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from satellite data, and might also identify the pixels with high values of AOD as cloudy. The purpose of this paper is to study the potential of Spatial Coherence Test (SCT) applied to the data from the near-IR bands for cloud screening of satellite data over the oceanic environment. We use here the data from IRS-P4 OCM. Though more computationally intensive, the SCT does not suffer from the serious limitations of the threshold and channel ratio methods and is found to be superior in identifying the clear sky pixels that are not affected by clouds. Although the SCT applied to near-IR channel data may be overestimating the number of cloud affected pixels, it neither leads to overestimation of AOD nor identifies the pixels with high AOD values as cloudy.

AB Algorithms were developed from LANDSAT 7 ETM+ data for the July 1, 2000 overpass and LANDSAT 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data for the September 27, 2000 overpass for Path 20 Row 31 (including Toledo, OH) to measure relative phycocyanin content (PC) and turbidity in the western basin of Lake Erie. Water samples were collected from discrete hydrographic stations arranged in a 20 x 4 km grid adjacent to the Ohio shoreline during a 6-h period spanning each of the two LANDSAT overpasses. The samples were analyzed for chlorophyll (chl) a content and turbidity. In addition, the concentration of phycocyanin, a light-harvesting pigment associated with cyanobacteria, was estimated from the ratio of phycocyanin/chl a in vivo fluorescence (IVPF/IVCF). A dark-object-subtracted, spectral ratio model derived from the July 1, 2000 data was found to be the most robust, when applied to the September 27, 2000 data. The same July 1, 2000 model (or algorithm) for PC was then applied to LANDSAT 7 ETM+ frames for July 16 and August 1, 2002 of the Path 19 Row 31 frame (including Cleveland, OH) and to the August 8, 2002 frame of Path 20 Row 31. Moderate, very low, and high PC values were detected in the western basin of Lake Erie on July 16, August, 1, and August 8, 2002, respectively. On September 17, 2002, local media reported a large Microcystis bloom in the western basin. The high PC values on August 8, 2002 may have represented early stage detection of the large Microcystis bloom that was reported 5 weeks later. The PC algorithm derived in this study will improve our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of cyanobacterial bloom formation in Lake Erie and other systems. It may also serve to alert municipalities to the presence of potentially toxic bloom events. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Land Cover Map of North and Central America for the year 2000 (GLC 2000-NCA), prepared by NRCan/CCRS and USGS/EROS Data Centre (EDC)' as a regional component of the Global Land Cover 2000 project, is the subject of this paper. A new mapping approach for transforming satellite observations acquired by the SPOT4/VGTETATION (VGT) sensor into land cover information is outlined. The procedure includes: (1) conversion of daily data into 10-day composite; (2) post-seasonal correction and refinement of apparent surface reflectance in 10-day composite images; and (3) extraction of land cover information from the composite images. The pre-processing and mosaicking techniques developed and used in this study proved to be very effective in removing cloud contamination, BRDF effects, and noise in Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR). The GLC 2000-NCA land cover map is provided as a regional product with 28 land cover classes based on modified Federal Geographic Data Committee/Vegetation Classification Standard (FGDC NVCS) classification system, and as part of a global product with 22 land cover classes based on Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The map was compared on both areal and per-pixel bases over North and Central America to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) global land cover classification, the University of Maryland global land cover classification (UMd) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global land cover classification produced by Boston University (BU). There was good agreement (79%) on the spatial distribution and areal extent of forest between GLC 2000-NCA and the other maps, however, GLC 2000-NCA provides additional information on the spatial distribution of forest types.. The GLC 2000-NCA map was produced at the continental level incorporating specific needs of the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fifty-three leaves were randomly sampled on different deciduous tree species, representing a wide range of chlorophyll contents, tree ages, and leaf structural features. Their reflectance was measured between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm,step, and their chlorophyll content determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra) was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate, and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices (published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices Using reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method). We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks. The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results: Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate indices. The "peak jump" and the multiple-peak feature observed on the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies' the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated RMSE = 2.1 mug/cm(2) on the experimental database). After calibration on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best 2 performances (RMSECV = 1.8 mug/cm(2) on the experimental database). The new Double Difference (DD) index, although not the best on the 2), 2 experimental database (RMSECV 2.9 mug/cm(2)), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE = 3.7 mug/cm(2)) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV = 4.5 mug/cm(2)). In This leaf-level study, the best indices are very near from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like, neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions will certainly be different for. a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based indices may perform significantly better than the other ones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB The effect of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is one of the most important factors in correcting the reflectance obtained from remotely sensed data. Estimation of BRDF model parameters can be deteriorated by various factors; contamination of the observations by undetected subresolution clouds or snow patches, inconsistent atmospheric correction in multiangular time series due to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters, slight variations of the surface condition during a period of observation, for example due to soil moisture changes, diurnal effects on vegetation structure, and geolocation errors [Lucht and Roujean, 2000]. In the present paper, parameter estimation robustness is examined using Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) data measured for paddy fields in Japan. We compare both the M-estimator and the least median of squares (LMedS) methods for robust parameter estimation to the ordinary least squares method (LSM). In experiments, simulated data that were produced by adding noises to the data measured on the ground surface were used. Experimental results demonstrate that if a robust estimation is sought, the LMedS method can be adopted for the robust estimation of a BRDF model parameter. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB A snow-cover mapping method accounting for forests (SnowFrac) is presented. SnowFrac uses spectral unmixing and endmember constraints to estimate the snow-cover fraction of a pixel. The unmixing is based on a linear spectral mixture model, which includes endmembers for snow, conifer, branches of leafless deciduous trees and snow-free ground. Model input consists of a land-cover fraction map and endmember spectra. The land-cover fraction map is applied in the unmixing procedure to identify the number and types of endmembers for every pixel, but also to set constraints on the area fractions of the forest endmembers. SnowFrac was applied on two Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with different snow conditions covering a forested area in southern Norway. Six experiments were carried out, each with different endmember constraints. Estimated snow-cover fractions were compared with snow-cover fraction reference maps derived from two Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired the same days as the MODIS images. Results are presented for non-forested areas, deciduous forests, coniferous forests and mixed deciduous/coniferous forests. The snow-cover fraction estimates are enhanced by increasing constraints introduced to the unmixing procedure. The classification accuracy shows that 96% of the pixels are classified with less than 20% error (absolute units) on 7 May 2001 when all forested and non-forested areas are included. The corresponding figure for 4 May 2000 is 88%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is conducting a study focused on developing methods for estimating changes in land-cover and landscape pattern for the conterminous United States from 1973 to 2000. Eleven landcover and land-use classes are interpreted from Landsat imagery for five sampling dates. Because of the high cost and potential effect of classification error associated with developing change estimates from wall-to-wall land-cover maps, a probability sampling approach is employed. The basic sampling unit is a 20 X 20 kin area, and land cover is obtained for each 60 X 60 in pixel within the sampling unit. The sampling design is stratified based on ecoregions, and land-cover change estimates are constructed for each stratum. The sampling design and analyses are documented, and estimates of change accompanied by standard errors are presented to demonstrate the methodology. Analyses of the completed strata suggest that the sampling unit should be reduced to a 10 X 10 kin block, and poststratified estimation and regression estimation are viable options to improve precision of estimated change.

AB The southeastern United States (SE-US) has undergone one of the highest rates of landscape changes in the country due to changing demographics and land use practices over the last few decades. Increasing evidence indicates that these changes have impacted mesoscale weather patterns, biodiversity and water resources. Since the Southeast has one of the highest rates of land productivity in the nation, it is important to monitor the effects of such changes regularly. Here, we propose a remote sensing based methodology to estimate regional impacts of urban land development on ecosystem structure and function. As an indicator of ecosystem functioning, we chose net primary productivity (NPP), which is now routinely estimated from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We used the MODIS data, a 1992 Landsat-based land cover map and nighttime data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) for the years 1992/1993 and 2000 to estimate the extent of urban development and its impact on NPP. The analysis based on the nighttime data indicated that in 1992/1993, urban areas amounted to 4.5% of the total land surface of the region. In the year 2000, the nighttime data showed an increase in urban development for the southeastern United States of 1.9%. Estimates derived from the MODIS data indicated that land cover changes due to urban development that took place during the 1992-2000 period reduced annual NPP of the southeastern United States by 0.4%. Despite the uncertainties in sensor fusion and the coarse resolution of the data used in this study, results show that the combination of MODIS products such as NPP with nighttime data could provide rapid assessment of urban land cover changes and their impacts on regional ecosystem resources.

ID SOIL; MODEL
AB Routine (i.e., daily to weekly) monitoring of surface energy fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration (ET), using satellite observations of radiometric surface temperature has not been feasible at high pixel resolution (i.e., similar to 10(1)-10(2) m) because of the low frequency in satellite coverage over the region of interest (i.e., approximately every 2 weeks). Cloud cover further reduces the number of useable observations of surface conditions resulting in high-resolution satellite imagery of a region typically being available once a month, which is not very useful for routine ET monitoring. Radiometric surface temperature observations at similar to 1- to 5-km pixel resolution are available multiple times per day from several weather satellites. However, this spatial resolution is too coarse for estimating ET from individual agricultural fields or for defining variations in ET due to land cover changes. Satellite data in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, used for computing vegetation indices, are available at resolutions an order of magnitude smaller than in the thermal-infrared, and hence provide higher resolution information on vegetation cover conditions. A number of studies have exploited the relationship between vegetation indices and radiometric surface temperature for estimating model parameters used in computing spatially distributed fluxes and available moisture. In this paper, the vegetation index - radiometric surface temperature relationship is utilized in a disaggregation procedure for estimating subpixel variation in surface temperature with aircraft imagery collected over the US Southern Great Plains. The disaggregated surface temperatures estimated by this procedure are compared to actual observations at this subpixel resolution. In addition, a remote sensing-based energy balance model is used to compare output using actual versus estimated surface temperatures over a range of pixel resolutions. From these comparisons, the utility of the surface temperature disaggregation technique appears to be most useful for estimating subpixel surface temperatures at resolutions corresponding to length scales defining agricultural field boundaries across the landscape.

AB Ground-based data on total phytomass were collected in 1998 and 1999 from four sampling domains, each nearly 1000 kin, within the and shrubland of Western Australia. These data were used in models relating rainfall and landscape characteristics to total phytomass to provide landscape-scale estimates of total phytomass and rainfall-use efficiency for 1992-1999 (referred to as RUEp). These modelled estimates were compared with remotely sensed estimates of total phytomass (I-NDVI) and rainfall-use efficiency (I-NDVI/annual rainfall; referred to as RUEN) using data from NOAA satellites.
   There was good agreement between ground-based and remotely sensed estimates of total phytomass but less agreement between estimates of rainfall-use efficiency. Partitioning the landscape on the basis of landscape resilience did not improve the amount of variance accounted for in RUEp or RUEN and there were conflicting relationships between landscape-scale indicators of landscape function and RUEN. There was, however, evidence to suggest that temporal change in RUEN may provide a useful broad-scale indicator of landscape degradation or recovery over decadal time intervals. Recommendations are made for broad-scale application of this indicator based on temporal trends in RUEN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon flux can be partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (R). The contribution of remote sensing and modeling holds the potential to predict these components and map them spatially and temporally. This has obvious utility to quantify carbon sink and source relationships and to identify improved land management strategies for optimizing carbon sequestration. The objective of our study was to evaluate prediction of 14-day average daytime CO2 fluxes (F-day) and nighttime CO2 fluxes (R-n) using remote sensing and other data. F-day and R-n were measured with a Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) technique in a sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-steppe ecosystem in northeast Idaho, USA, during 1996-1999. Micrometeorological variables aggregated across 14-day periods and time-integrated Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (iNDVI) were determined during four growing seasons (1996 - 1999) and used to predict F-day and R-n. We found that iNDVI was a strong predictor of F-day (R-2=0.79, n=66, P<0.0001). Inclusion of evapotranspiration in the predictive equation led to improved predictions of F-day (R-2=0.82, n = 66, P < 0.0001). Crossvalidation indicated that regression tree predictions of F-day were prone to overfitting and that linear regression models were more robust. Multiple regression and regression tree models predicted R-n quite well (R-2 = 0.75 - 0.77, n = 66) with the regression tree model being slightly more robust in crossvalidation. Temporal mapping of F-day and R-n is possible with these techniques and would allow the assessment of NEE in sagebrush -steppe ecosystems. Simulations of periodic F-day measurements, as might be provided by a mobile flux tower, indicated that such measurements could be used in combination with iNDVI to accurately predict Fday. These periodic measurements could maximize the utility of expensive flux towers for evaluating various carbon management strategies, carbon certification, and validation and calibration of carbon flux models.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of bio-optical properties were studied in the Northern Gulf of Mexico during cruises in April and October of 2000, a year during which the discharge volume from the Mississippi River was unusually low. Highly variable surface Chl a concentrations (0.1 to 17 mg m(-3)) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption (0.07 to 1.1 m(-1) at 412 nm) were observed in the study region that generally decreased with increasing salinity waters, being highest nearshore and decreasing at offshore stations. The optical properties of absorption, scattering, and diffuse attenuation coefficients reflected these distributions with phytoplankton particles and CDOM contributing to most of the spatial, vertical, and seasonal variability. The diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) and spectral remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) were linear functions of absorption and backscattering coefficients a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) through the downward average cosine mu(d) and the ratio of variables f/Q at the SeaWiFS wavebands for waters with widely varying bio-optical conditions. Although various R-rs(lambda) ratio combinations showed high correlation with surface Chl a concentrations and CDOM absorption at 412 nm, power law equations derived using the R-rs(490)/R-rs(555) and R-rs(510)/R-rs(555) ratios provided the best retrievals of Chl alpha concentrations and CDOM absorption from SeaWiFS reflectance data.

TI Optimal conditions for wet snow detection using RADARSAT SAR data

DT Article
ID WETNESS; FOREST; COVER
AB This paper presents simulation results of the backscattering coefficient, in order to discriminate between wet snow and dry snow covers sensed at 5.3 GHz by the RADARSAT Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor. Snow-field measurements coinciding with the RADARSAT SAR overpasses are used to explore and set out optimal conditions for wet snow detection, as a function of the sensor incidence angles. The conditions concern wet snow surface characteristics, mainly the roughness represented by the surface slope m and the volumetric liquid water content, snwc (vol.%). Based on the 3-dB threshold value used in several wet snow detection algorithms, the results show that in order to be discriminated from dry snow covers, wet snow surfaces must be characterized as: (a) m less than or equal to 0.058 and snwc less than or equal to 1.1, if the sensor operates in the S 1 mode (20-27degrees incidence angle range), and (b) m less than or equal to 0.082 and snwc less than or equal to 3.0, if the observations are made in the S7 mode (45 -49degrees incidence angle range). For the identification of a very wet snow, it is also shown that the S7 mode of RADARSAT SAR sensor is more suitable than the S I mode. The latter, however, provides better discrimination for low values of the snow liquid water content. Furthermore, for wet snow detection based on modeling, the present paper demonstrates the importance of using the appropriate methodology to assess the dielectric constant of the background medium.

AB Motivated by the importance to weather and climate of the Indo-Pacific seas, we present a new calibration of the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) on the geostationary meteorological satellite, GMS-5. VISSR imagery has significant potential for exploring the dynamics of the ocean and air-sea interactions in this poorly characterized region, by virtue of the VISSR's surface temperature retrieval capability and hourly sampling. However, the calibration of the thermal imagery supplied by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) is inconsistent with the spectral characteristics of the channels, and published details of the JMA calibration procedure are scant. We use the well-characterized Along-Track Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR-2) as a reference, and determine calibration corrections for GMS-5 VISSR. We obtain more credible VISSR brightness temperatures and demonstrate sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval that validates well against in situ measurements (bias similar to0.3 and scatter similar to0.4 K). Comparison with a widely used sea surface temperature analysis shows that the GMS-5 VISSR SST fields capture important spatial structure, absent in the analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Estimation of canopy biophysical variables from remote sensing data was investigated using radiative transfer model inversion. Measurement and model uncertainties make the inverse problem ill posed, inducing difficulties and inaccuracies in the search for the solution. This study focuses on the use of prior information to reduce the uncertainties associated to the estimation of canopy biophysical variables in the radiative transfer model inversion process. For this purpose, lookup table (LUT), quasi-Newton algorithm (QNT), and neural network (NNT) inversion techniques were adapted to account for prior information. Results were evaluated over simulated reflectance data sets that allow a detailed analysis of the effect of measurement and model uncertainties. Results demonstrate that the use of prior information significantly improves canopy biophysical variables estimation. LUT and QNT are sensitive to model uncertainties. Conversely, NNT techniques are generally less accurate. However, in our conditions, its accuracy is little dependent significantly on modeling or measurement error. We also observed that bias in the reflectance measurements due to miscalibration did not impact very much the accuracy of biophysical estimation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RESOLUTION; VALIDATION; INDEX; COVER; EARTH
AB The correct interpretation of scientific information from global, long-term series of remote sensing products requires the ability to discriminate between product artifacts and changes in the Earth processes being monitored. A suite of global land surface products is made from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument data. Quality assessment (QA) is an integral part of this production chain and focuses on evaluating and documenting the scientific quality of the products with respect to their intended performance. This paper describes the QA approach adopted by the MODIS Land (MODLAND) Science Team and coordinated by the MODIS Land Data Operational Product Evaluation (LDOPE) facility. The described methodology represents a new approach for assessing and ensuring the performance of land remote sensing products that are generated on a systematic basis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The NDVI method utilized non-normalized (raw) imagery data, while the MID method required normalized imagery. Image normalization techniques included both automatic scattergram-controlled regression (ASCR) and localized relative radiometric normalization (LRRN) techniques. Change/no-change thresholds for each method were optimized using calibration curves developed from reference data and a series of method-specific binary change masks. Cover class-specific thresholds were derived for each of the four methods using a previously developed NRB-LC classification (1998-1999) to support data stratification. An independent set of accuracy assessment points was selected using a disproportionate stratified sampling strategy to support the development of error matrices. Area-weighted conditional probability accuracy statistics were calculated based on the areal extent of change and no change for each cover class. All methods tested exhibited acceptable accuracies, ranging between 80% and 91%. However, change omission errors for woody cover types were unacceptably high, with values ranging between 60% and 79%. Overall commission errors in the change category were also high (42-51%) and strongly affected by the agriculture class. There were no significant differences in the Kappa coefficient between the NDVI, MID ASCR, and LRRN normalization methods. The MID non-normalized method was inferior to both the NDVI and MID ASCR methods. Stratification by major LC type had no effect on overall accuracies, regardless of method.

AB Leafy spurge, Euphorbia esula L. is an adventive, perennial weed that infests approximately 1.2 million ha of land in North America. It often forms dense stands that displace native vegetation and useful forage plants on rangelands and in riparian habitats. Leafy spurge is a good candidate for detection via remote sensing because the distinctive yellow-green color of its bracts is spectrally unique when compared to co-occurring green vegetation. During 1999, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery was acquired in northeastern Wyoming and ground cover data were collected. Mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF), a specialized type of spectral mixture analysis, was used to estimate leafy spurge canopy cover and map leafy spurge distribution. Overall performance of MTMF for estimating percent cover of leafy spurge for all sites was good (r(2) = 0.69) with better performance in prairie areas (r(2) = 0.79) and poorer performance occurring on wooded sites (r(2) = 0.57). However, results demonstrated that in open canopies with leafy spurge in the understory, the spectral signature is sufficiently distinct to be detectable. The techniques presented here could be used for constructing leafy spurge distribution and abundance maps with satellite hyperspectral data for larger regional areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The northern Arabian Sea is a semienclosed sea with high primary productivity and a complicated flow pattern consisting of several eddies. This paper reports on phytoplankton blooms, which were associated with a cold eddy in the northern Arabian Sea during November 1996, inferred from Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) and Sea-view Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)-derived chlorophyll a (Chl-a hereafter), AVHRR sea surface temperature (SST), and other available oceanography data. The blooms emerged at 100 km from both coasts in the Gulf of Oman (60.5degreesE, 24.5degreesN) where the depth is about 3000 m. The Chl-a concentrations patch first appeared on November 2 and decayed after about 4 weeks (December 3, 1996). The high Chl-a concentrations patch was about 100 km in diameter and it was located at 60.3-61.3degreesE, 23.5-24.5degreesN. The bloom, having a mean Chl-a concentration of 6.8 mg m(-3) on November 6, was located in a cold SST eddy, which was accompanied by another feature, an anticyclone eddy (of 100 km in diameter) with high SST and low Chl-a concentrations to the southwest (61.5degreesE, 22.5degreesN). An SST drop occurred around November 14, which coincides with a peak of the vertical pumping velocity derived from NSCAT-derived wind stress. Two SeaWiFS-derived Chl-a images obtained in November 1998 and 1999 show good agreement in terms of the locations and features with those described above through the OCTS observations. The possible mechanism for this newly identified Chl-a patch is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RESOLUTION DERIVATIVE SPECTRA; COVER; SYSTEM
AB This paper aims to determine the optimal procedure for classifying salt marsh vegetation from hyperspectral data and to establish relationships between airborne and ground measurement properties. The study is carried out on data collected in the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). Spectral angle mapping proves to be a reliable classification procedure, and spectral differentiation is seen to improve separability of vegetation types. Further, scaling relationships are derived to link the value of the variance of data aggregated at different scales, allowing the deteremination of data variability at course resolution on the basis of ground measurements. The comparison between the theoretical, upscaled, values of standard deviation and those computed from remote sensing data shows a good agreement supporting the derived relations. Finally, a scaling relationship is established for spectral angles, which may be useful in determining an optimal threshold angle from ground data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne scanning laser ranging provides rapid measurements of the ocean wave topography. In addition to active ranging, the scanning optics can obtain passive measurements of the surface emissivity, yielding a digital image of the surface brightness. The brightness data contain information on the statistics and spatial distribution of whitecaps. Combining active measurements of the 3D surface topography and passive brightness data, the phase distribution of breaking events along a wave profile can be examined. From the phase distribution analysis, it is found that in deep water, the whitecap coverage in the windward phase is slightly higher than that in the leeward phase (51 +/- 17% vs. 49 +/- 14%), and more whitecaps are found on the crests than in the troughs (57 +/- 13% vs. 44 +/- 16%). Such quantitative information on wave breaking and whitecap coverage is important to remote sensing applications and air-sea interaction studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A key to the continuation of quantitative data from the Landsat series of sensors is the radiometric understanding of the sensor. Vicarious calibration methods are one approach that has been used successfully for the absolute radiometric calibration of Thematic Mapper (TM). One of these vicarious methods is the reflectance-based approach that is applied here to the radiometric calibration of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor on the Landsat 7 platform. This method is described for application to ETM+. Results from ground-based measurements of atmospheric conditions and surface reflectance made at Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada, Roach Lake Playa, Nevada, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico are presented including descriptions of the test sites. The gains derived from four dates using these sites spanning the period from June 1999 to October 1999 agree to within 5% of each other and to better than 7% with the prelaunch, laboratory-derived gains. This is within the combined 5% uncertainty of the prelaunch values and the estimated 3-5% uncertainty of the reflectance-based method. The gains determined from the reflectance-based method are all lower than the prelaunch values for bands 1-5 and the values for band 7 exceed the prelaunch gains. These biases could be caused by errors in the treatment of atmospheric aerosols at shorter wavelengths and uncertainties in the assumed solar irradiances used to convert the relative radiances to absolute values at longer wavelengths.

AB Spectral information on soil is not easily available as vegetation and farm works prevent direct observation of soil responses. However, then is an increasing need to include soil reflectance values in spectral unmixing algorithms or in classification approaches. Zn most cases, the impact of soil moisture on the reflectance is unknown and therefore ignored. The objective of this study was to model reflectance changes due to soil moisture in a real field situation using multiresolution airborne Spot data. As the direct observation of soils is only possible in the absence of vegetation, the effective remote sensing of soil moisture is limited to a few days each year. III such a favorable time window, modeling the soil moisture-reflectance relationships was found possible. The proposed exponential model was not valid when all soil categories were considered together. However, when fitted to each category, the RMS error on moisture estimates ranged from 2.0% to 3.5% except for silty soils with crusting problems (6%). Results also indicated that, when the soils have similar colors (i.e. same hue), soil categories can be partly grouped and the model can be simplified, using the same intercept coefficients. This study has potential application for;he definition of a more generalized model of the soil reflectance. It shows that the impact of soil moisture on reflectance could be higher than differences in reflectance due to the soil categories. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Historical remote measurements are used for the synthesis of a complex Theory-Information Model (TIM) describing the combined water regimes of the Aral-Caspian System (ACS) including the consideration of aquatic and climatic natural processes. The problem of stabilizing the sea levels of these two water bodies is modeled, and a solution is obtained through implementation of an expert system (including the TIM), remote measurements database, data processing sub-block, surface cover recognition sub-block, and user interface. A set of scenarios to control the ACS water regime is investigated. The role of remote sensing methods for the estimation of water balance components and synoptic situations is also evaluated. The results of this research indicate that there is a regime for ACS water control under which it Is possible to stabilize the Amb and Caspian Sea levels at their 1960 level within 10 to 12 years. This would be implemented by the transport of water from the open portion of the Caspian Sea into saline lowlands and the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf, located on its eastern shore, thus facilitating rapid evaporation followed by the movement of atmospheric moisture into the Aral Sea basin.

AB The seasonal transition of the land surface between frozen and nonfrozen conditions affects a number of terrestrial processes that cycle between wintertime dormant and summertime active states. The relatively short (2.14 cm) K-u-band of the space-borne NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) is sensitive to changes in dielectric properties, associated with large-scale shifts in the relative abundance and phase (frozen or thawed) of canopy and surface water. We used a temporal change detection analysis of NSCAT daily radar backscatter measurements to classify surface freeze/thaw state across a 1.4 million km(2) region of Alaska from January to June 1997. In the spring, radar backscatter measurements showed pronounced decreases (1.6-4.9 dB) relative to reference frozen state conditions, which corresponded with sustained maximum daily air temperature measurements above 0.0 degreesC and total decreases in measured snow depths from 28% to 61% of seasonal maximum values. We classified the daily frozen and nonfrozen area for the region based on the sign (+/-) of the radar backscatter temporal difference relative to frozen and nonfrozen reference conditions. These results compared favorably (e.g., r(2) = 0.881; p less than or equal to 0.0001) with frozen area estimates derived from the regional weather station network. NSCAT-derived estimates of the timing and spatial variation in regional thaw during spring were also generally consistent with seasonal increases in river discharge for five major Alaska basins. The NSCAT sensor appears to be responsive to changes in dielectric properties associated with surface freeze/thaw transitions over broad boreal and arctic landscapes. Further study involving longer time-series information, alternative radar wavelengths, and finer spatial scales is needed, however, to resolve the various components (i.e., soil, vegetation, snow) of the regional radar freeze/thaw signature for improved monitoring of the circumpolar high latitudes.

AB Biomass burning releases significant amounts of trace gases and smoke aerosol into the atmosphere. This has an impact on the Earth's radiation budget, the magnitude of which has not yet been well quantified. Satellite remote sensing is well suited to assessing the area of biomass burning, a prerequisite for estimating emissions at regional and global scales. Commonly used satellite-based techniques for measuring burned areas include thermal hotspot detection and multitemporal NDVI analysis, each having several limitations. Here we present a new, hybrid approach for boreal burned area mapping called HANDS, or hotspot and NDVI differencing synergy. The automated technique was tested using satellite data covering Canada for the 1995 and 1996 fire seasons, and comparing results with official burned area statistics and conventional fire surveys. HANDS computed a national burned forest area of 6.8 million ha in 1995 and 2.0 million ha in 1996, corresponding favorably to Canadian Forest Service estimates of 7.1 million ha and 1.9 million ha, respectively. Moreover, in most cases, the technique accurately delineated the boundaries of individual burns and identified some burns that were missed with conventional mapping. When employed in conjunction with NOAA-AVHRR imagery, HANDS provides a consistent means of mapping large burns (>10 km(2)), which are characteristic for the boreal forest. New generation sensors (e.g., SPOT VEGETATION, Terra MODIS) should enable its successful application to a wider range of environments. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Parametrizing soil reflectance spectra with variables related to specific shape characteristics of the spectral profile permits organic carbon concentrations in soils to be estimated on the basis of regionally validated regression models. An important feature of the approach is that it can not only be applied to continuous spectra but, without notable loss in accuracy, also to the spectral resolution of operational earth observation satellites such as the Landsat-TM or -ETM systems. Using this type of imagery, it can also be shown that soil organic matter is positively correlated to growth conditions for cereal crops in dryland agriculture. Strong correlations with qualitative erosion indicators that can be derived through spectral unmixing approaches demonstrate that soil organic matter is an important indicator for assessing land degradation processes in dry ecosystems from space.

AB The recent strong 1997-1998 Nino and the following 1998-1999 La Nina disturbed weather, environment, economy, and human lives worldwide. The total impact of these events (ENSO) on societies is estimated in billions of dollars and consequences include famine, human health problems, loss of life, property damage, and destruction of the environment. Areas sensitive to ENSO have been identified in some world areas from climatic historical records and recently from the normalized difference vegetation index. This paper examines the last 15-year association between monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and vegetation health (condition) index for the entire world. The vegetation health (condition) index, derived from a combination of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based normalized difference vegetation index and 10-mum to 11-mum thermal radiances, was designed for monitoring moisture and thermal impacts on vegetation health (greenness and vigor). Two types of responses were identified. In boreal winter, ecosystems of northern South America, southern Africa, and Southeast Asia experienced severe moisture and thermal stress during El Nino and favorable conditions during La Nina years. In Argentina and southwestern United States/Mexico regions, the response was the opposite. World ecosystems are less sensitive to SSTs during boreal summer, except for the areas in northern Brazil and Southeast Asia, where vegetation conditions deteriorate/improve during the warm/cold water cycle in the tropical Pacific. In some areas, ENSO impacts on ecosystems are clearly identified from satellites and not from in situ data (or vice versa). During the boreal winter, these discrepancies occurred in Central America, northern Brazil, and southeastern United States; during the boreal summer, the discrepancies occurred in the sub-Sahara Africa and in the northern part of South America. In the course of the 1997-1999 ENSOs, world vegetation generally responded in accordance with the vegetation health/SST teleconnection patterns. However, in southern Africa, January-March 1998 vegetation stress was not as severe and widespread as in other El Nino years. Similarly, no stress was recorded in Argentina during the 1998-1999 La Nina. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB When faced with developing, testing, and delivering a remote sensing system or product that is "optimal" for a specific coastal environment and monitoring or modeling problem, an objective and replicable framework to guide these operations is essential. A framework has been developed for coastal environments, combining concepts from remote sensing and landscape ecology to provide remotely sensed data users with an objective basis for selecting "optimal" data sets and processing techniques. The framework was applied to case studies in: coastal wetlands of southern California; coastal wet-dry tropical wetlands in Northern Territory, Australia; and a rapidly urbanizing coastal catchment in southeast Queensland, Australia. Results established for each case study demonstrated that the framework functioned effectively in different coastal environments and provided more accurate results than ad hoc solutions.

ID REMOTE; DENSITY
AB In this study we investigate the use of local maximum (LM) filtering to locate trees on high spatial resolution (1-m) imagery. Results are considered in terms of commission error (falsely indicated trees) and omission error (missed trees). Tree isolation accuracy is also considered as a function of tree crown size. The success of LM filtering in locating trees depends on the size and distribution of trees in relation to the image spatial resolution. A static-sized 3x3 pixel LM filter provides an indication of the maximum number of trees that may be found in the imagery, yet high errors of commission reduce the integrity of the results. Variable window-size techniques may be applied to reduce both the errors of commission and omission, especially for larger trees. The distribution of the error by tree size is important since the large trees account for a greater proportion of the stand basal area than the smaller trees. An investigation of the success of tree identification by tree crown radius demonstrates the relationship between image spatial resolution and LM filtering success. At an image spatial resolution of 1 m, a tree crown radius of 1.5 m appears to be the minimum size for reliable identification of tree locations using LM filtering. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The aim of this article is to show that a watershed hydrological index could be derived from ERS/SAR measurements. Indeed, it is well known that, over bare soil, the SAR signal is a function of the geometric and dielectric surface properties. The problem to estimate soil moisture is to free from the effects of the space and time fluctuations of soil roughness and from the vegetation cover attenuation and scattering. The methodology presented here is based on the selection of land cover types or "targets," for which the SAR signal is mainly sensitive to soil water content variations, and for which the vegetation and the roughness effects (in SAR signal) can be estimated and removed if needed. This method has been validated over an agricultural watershed in France. We show that the accuracy of the retrieved soil moisture is +/-0.04-0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), except during May and June, when vegetation cover is too dense to get reliable soil information.

AB Ecologists frequently employ classifications derived from satellite imagery and aerial photography to interpret patterns of the composition and distribution of vegetation. Such maps can be used in conjunction with ecological data to extend locally intensive analyses to the landscape and watershed scale and beyond. In many cases, however, the field data used to produce and validate map classifications are not designed for ecological applications. The objective of this study is to present the fuzzy similarity index assessment method for evaluating the accuracy of maps of natural vegetation based upon methods in plant ecology. Using an example classification and associated data from field plots, a similarity index is employed to compare validation data against the defined composition for each map class, thereby producing a quantitative measure of the similarity of each observation to all classes. Fuzzy membership among classes is quantitatively evaluated using the differences in similarity between validation plots and all classes in the classification. The nature of the gradients in vegetation composition among the map classes can therefore be identified. Consequently, some classes are interpreted as compositionally distinct while others may share traits with many classes. Additional analyses determined the detail of field data collection necessary to produce consistent results using the fuzzy similarity index assessment method. Complete inventories of the presence and abundance of species are not required; rather, a field sampling method biased toward the 12 to 20 most important species in a given class is acceptable.

ID MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES; VEGETATION
AB Many applications in remote sensing require fusing low-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral images with high-resolution panchromatic images to idenfify and may materials at high resolution. A number of methods are currently used to produce such hybrid imagery. Until note, these methods have only been evaulated independently, and have not been compared to one another to determine an optimum approach. Two different operations are involved in creating high-resolution material maps. One task is to unmix hyperspectral images into the constituent materials (endmembers). The other task is to fuse low-resolution imagery containing spectral detail with high-resolution image(s) containing fine spatial information. This research performs a quantitative test of three image fusion procedures. The first method is to fuse, then unmix. One sharpens low-resolution multispectral data using a panchromatic image, producing a set of high-resolution multispectral images. These images are then separated into a series of high-resolution endmember maps, locating the materials within the scene. The second method is to unmix, then fuse. In this approach, one first separates the low-resolution multispectral data into a series of material maps using a recently developed adaptive unmixing algorithm. These maps are fused with the panchromatic image in a stage called sharpening to produce high-resolution material maps The final method is also an unmix-then-fuse approach. Here, the low-resolution material maps are created using traditional image-wide spectral unmixing methods. The resulting images are fused with the panchromatic image to produce sharpened material maps. In this paper, the three image fusion procedures described above are evaluated for their radiometric and unmixing accuracy. The results show that the adaptive unmixing algorithm is superior to the traditional imagewide methods. Difference between quantitative and visual evaluations indicate an improved Error metric must be developed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADA
AB Image classification of geological units in vegetated granite-gneiss terrain from multispectral data is hampered cl by vegetation cozier and limited spectral contrast of its lithological variations. In this paper an alternative methodology is presented, employing airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and magnetic data. The methodology includes the selection of combinations of data channels and their transformations to enhance the discriminative power of the lithology classification. An analysis of the training set compiled from 2,795 field stations showed that the potassium, thorium, and uranium gamma-ray spectrometry and total and residual magnetic field channels provided an overall classification success rate of 65% for a total of 10 lithological units. Parametric classifications based on this training set yielded 67% coincidence with the geological map, whereas a neutral network classified provided only 23% coincidence. Exploiting the spa spatial autocorrelation of the geophysical signatures by adding averaged filtered channels slightly improved the coincidence percentage to 70% and enhanced the continuity of linear enclaves within larger lithological units. nle contribution of magnetic data to the classification depends on the extent to which the anomaly spectrum and its processed derivatives reflect surface geology. We found that both rite short and long wavelengths in the spectrum contributed to the classification performance. This is explained by the geological structure of the area, where both broad and narrow units extend downward subvertically. A comparison of our results to regional geological map patterns identified targets for map refinement and exploration. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

The algorithm was tested using a MAS scene over the Bering Sea near St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, USA, acquired 8 April 1995. Clouds were masked with the University of Wisconsin cloud masking algorithm. Ice surface temperature was estimated with a split-window technique. Sea ice extent and generalized type of sea ice were identified based on reflective characteristics and estimated ice surface temperature using a grouped criteria technique. Resulting maps were consistent with visual interpretation and with sea ice extent and type information reported in prior studies of the region. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Nocturnal lighting is a primary method for enabling human activity. Outdoor lighting is used extensively world-wide in residential, commercial, industrial, public facilities, and roadways. A radiance calibrated nighttime lights image of the United States has been assembled from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). The satellite observation of the location and intensity of nocturnal lighting provide a unique view of humanities presence and can be used as a spatial indicator for other variables that are more difficult to observe at a global scale. Examples include the modeling of population density and energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The potential of airborne radar systems as tools for collecting information in support of the assessment of tropical primary forests and derived cover types was examined. SAR systems operating with high spatial resolutions and different wavelengths (i.c., X-, C-, L- and P-band) acquired data in Guyana and Colombia. Three fundamentally different information sources from the radar return signal were considered in the study: its strength or backscatter, polarization and phase, and spatial variability or texture. Radiometric, polarimetric, and textural attributes were computed from predefined image regions selected to represent five types of primary forest, selectively logged forest, secondary forest, and a mixture of nonforest cover types. Texture was found to be the most important source of information in high resolution X- and C-band images. Textural attributes computed per region made modest to good bases for automated classifications of the land cover types studied. Primary forests and logged-over forests were found to display particularly distinctive textural patterns. Backscatter values computed per region from L- and P-band radar images also made modest to good classification bases. Backscatter measurements in either a single L- or P-band channel enabled accurate classification of nonforest cover types. Reliable identification of secondary forests and logged-over forests generally asked for measurements in a minimum of two C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels. Similarly, reliable assessment of primary forest types required observations in a minimum of three C-, L-, and/or P-band radar channels. (C)1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The transition from atmosphere-limited to soil-limited evaporation is manifested in increasing surface temperature and albedo, as well as a steadying of near-surface moisture content. Each of these changes can be inferred to varying degree from ground-based and satellite-based remote sensing measurements. An evaporation model (derived for bare soil conditions) that depends on the time (t(d)) between rainfall and this transition was tested on three interstorm periods during the first International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project field experiment in 1987 and 1989. In general, t(d) calculated from spatially averaged ground-based measurements of albedo, surface temperature, and surface soil moisture fell within 2 to 4 days of the t(d) estimated from the best fit of the model to the measured evaporation rates. For the dry down spanning mid-September to mid-October 1987, albedo and daytime temperature differences estimated from geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES) data yielded similar transition times. The effects of vegetation on model utility and on the ability to determine t(d) from remote sensing are discussed in the context of densely and sparsely vegetated sites within the FIFE experimental area.

AB With the goal of applying derivative spectral analysis to analyze high-resolution, spectrally continuous remote sensing data, several smoothing and derivative computation algorithms have been reviewed and modified to develop a set of cross-platform spectral analysis tools. Emphasis was placed on exploring different smoothing and derivative algorithms to extract spectral details from spectral data sets. A modular program was created to perform interactive derivative analysis. This module calculated derivatives using either a convolution (Savitzky-Golay) or finite divided difference approximation algorithm. Spectra were smoothed using one of the three built-in smoothing algorithms (Savitzky-Golay smoothing, Kawata-Minami smoothing, and mean-filter smoothing) prior to the derivative computation procedures. Laboratory spectral data were used to test the performance of the implemented derivative analysis module. An algorithm for detecting the absorption band positions was executed on synthetic spectra and a soybean fluorescence spectrum to demonstrate the usage of the implemented modules in extracting spectral features. Issues related to smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing or derivative computation algorithms were also observed and are discussed. A scaling effect, resulting from the migration of band separations when using the finite divided difference approximation derivative algorithm, can be used to enhance spectral features at the scale of specified sampling interval and remove noise or features smaller than the sampling interval.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID AVIRIS; IMAGERY
AB Water depth, bottom reflectance, inherent optical properties of the water column (scattering, absorption, and fluorescence), and illumination conditions combine to determine the upwelling spectral radiance of coastal waters. If these complex optical relationships could be quantified, it would be possible to extract coastal information from spectral radiance data. We use data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) in a neural network system to establish quantitative, empirical relationships between one of these parameters, depth, and remotely sensed spectral radiance. Data are analyzed for two areas: the western coast of Florida in the Tampa Bay area and the Florida Keys between Upper Matecumbe and Plantation Keys. The neural network approach results in retrieval of reasonable depths from spectral radiance in both cases over a depth range of 0 to 6 m. Retrieved depths for Tampa Bay are accurate to a RMS error of 0.84 m relative to depths in the National Ocean Survey (NOS) Hydrographic Database, and the Keys retrievals have an RMS error of 0.39 m relative to a bathymetric survey conducted to support this study. A neural network trained on a combination of the two data sets results in a combined RMS error of 0.48 m, nearly the same performance as neural networks trained individually. The ability of the neural network to generalize, producing algorithms with some degree of universality among diverse coastal environments is, thereby, demonstrated. The result of the generalization analysis is of practical importance because it indicates that the neural network may not require an extensive training set of water depth data in order to the "tuned" for each location where depth retrievals are desired. While empirical the neural network is in some sense a model of the inversion of the radiative transfer problem within the marine environment. The neural network approach, therefore, operates on a higher level than more traditional statistical curve fitting solutions for retrieval of remotely sensed information.

   which combines meteorological, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR), and Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data. Thus, the maximum evapotranspiration for each crop, ETm, is obtained from in situ measurements carried out in a meteorological station; the temperature difference between each pixel and the pixel that has the maximum evapotranspiration, T-s-T-sm, is calculated for each crop from NOAA-AVHRR data; and the crop distribution in the area is known through a Landsat TM image. The semi-empirical coefficient B is derived for each crop in two ways: (1) experimentally and (2) by the identification of crop structure parameters. We have applied the proposed method to the Barrax region, Albacete, whose main crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and barley (Ordeum vulgare L.), cover a 10 km x 10 km area. With Penman's method as the standard, a method validation was conducted and an acceptable precision was obtained (+/-0.8 mm day(-1) and +/-1.0 mm day(-1) for barley and maize, respectively). Finally, actual evapotranspiration images are supplied. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB As shown in previous studies, outgoing-longwave radiation (OLR) can be in error by similar to 7% when evaluated from directional measurements by applying time-averaged angular distribution models (ADMs) to account for the emission anisotropy. In order to develop an insight into the problem of assessing hemispheric emission from directional measurements, we formulate the directional (monochromatic) greenhouse factor g(d), specified as the ratio of a longwave radiance measured above the atmosphere to that emitted from the surface at the same zenith angle theta(r). The explicit expressions for g(d) involve two atmospheric parameters, the optical thickness and the temperature-profile parameter. Oar analysis indicates that under clear conditions a narrow-band radiance, if measured at theta(v) approximate to 57 degrees in atmospheric windows (low values of optical thickness) and at theta(v) approximate to 47 degrees in absorption bands, determines the hemispheric-average radiance to within about 1%. For broad spectral bands, whether under clear or cloudy (solid cover, or ''randomly scattered'' clouds) conditions, the same finding applies at theta(v) approximate to 50 degrees. Thus, the zenith angle of equivalence theta(eq) varies by about +/-5 degrees for different values of the optical thickness; it varies only slightly for different temperature profiles (even though different temperature profiles produce quite different patterns of radiance us. theta(v), that is, different ADMs apply). Measurements at or near theta(eq) therefore constitute direct assessment of OLR, without resorting to ADMs to adjust for the variations of emission with view angle (anisotropy). The existing OLR data should be reexamined accepting measurements only within the range 45-60 degrees of view zenith angles. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The ERS-1 Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) provides frequent shortwave and longwave infrared radiance data of every terrestrial volcanic region, at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). By adopting a simplified model that assumes that any observed active lava flow is composed of two distinct thermal components, toe present techniques that allow subpixel lava flow areas to be estimated from the ATSR spectral radiance data. Such estimates are especially useful in documenting effusive volcanic activity occurring in remote regions, where ground observations may be sparse or completely lacking. We use a time-series ATSR dataset to document the 1995 eruption of Fernandina Volcano, an important but isolated volcanic island in the Galapagos archipelago. We estimate that in 1995 Fernandina produced a 6 km(2) lava flow field with a volume of around 20 million m(3), a similar magnitude to previously studied Fernandina eruptions. This is the first time-series analysis of art active Galapagos lava flow produced using remotely sensed data. Previous Fernandina flows have been investigated many months or years after the activity had ceased. The current and future availability of frequent, low-spatial resolution infrared radiance data from spaceborne sensors such as the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) should ensure that adaptations of these techniques can be used to document future volcanic eruptions occurring in similarly isolated regions.

AB In this work, we describe the statistical techniques used to analyze images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer for the calculation and mapping of surfaces affected by large forest fires in Spain in 1993 and 1994. Maximum value normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites (MVCs) were generated for every ten-day period over the two years of the study. Two techniques, one regression analysis and the other differenc ing, were applied to the NDVI-MVCs both before and after each fire event to determine detection thresholds of change and to delineate and objectively evaluate the burned surfaces. The comparison between the single-fires bu med areas predicted by the techniques and that provided by the Spanish Forestry Service (ground based) showed that the regression algorithm was more reliable, giving rise to virtually no bins (-0.9%) and a root mean square error (RMS) of 20.3%, both calculated as a percentage of the mean bw med area of the whole sample. The technique of differencing provided worse results with a 3.2% bias and a 23.5% RMS error. Likewise, a comparison between the perimeters of the large fires supplied by official data (GPS-based) and those obtained by the regression method confirmed the validity of the technique not only for calculating fire size, but also for mapping of large forest fires.

Multivariate analysis techniques show that two soils belonging to the same series and a third soil belonging to a different, but related series can be discriminated at a high level of accuracy using reflectance data from AVIRIS or from laboratory measurements. It is also shown that wavelengths important in discriminating soils were highly correlated between AVIRIS and laboratory data. The distribution of variance and weighting functions also show consistent patterns between these data sets.

ID REFLECTANCE
AB The objective of this study was to develop a robust method for Identifying contaminated pixels from AVHRR composite data sets intended for biospheric studies. Of particular interest were land pixels partially contaminated by clouds, smoke, or other atmospheric aerosols, as well as pixels with partial snow or ice cover. The method developed for this purpose, dubbed CECANT (cloud elimination from composites using Albedo and NDVI trend), uses Channel 1 surface reflectance to identify fully cloud-, snow-, and ice-covered pixels; and two parameters (R, Z) to distinguish bright (in Channel 1), clear-sky pixels from intrinsically darker but partly contaminated pixels. R and Z are based on the seasonal NDVI trajectory. Three thresholds are required to apply this approach; they are obtained from the histograms of Channel 1, R and Z. The thresholds are adjusted separately for each compositing period. Tests with multidate histograms and single-date images indicated the consistency and robustness of the method in an area where most seasonal NDVI trajectories have a single peak. An application of the CECANT procedure to AVHRR composites over Canada for 1993 showed that an average 51% of the land pixels were fully or partly contaminated (37% +/- 5% in June to August period), with a range from 31% (midsummer) to 91% (October). The method should be applicable to other geographic regions where seasonal AVHRR composite data sets (minimum is Channel 1 and NDVI for each composite period) are available.

AB Forest canopy changes can be detected by a variety of methods of analysis of multitemporal satellite images. Issues surrounding the use of remote sensing in operational forest monitoring include which change detection method is most appropriate, and to what extent scenes should be preprocessed for the minimization of irrelevant interdate differences. Results indicate better performance for principal component analysis and a multitemporal Kauth-Thomas transformation as compared to the Cramm-Schmidt orthogonalization process. There is little evidence to suggest that preprocessing beyond simple DN matching methods improves results. Relationships between change components and mortality are found to be specific to the particular image data being used and the particular forest type under study. Canopy change can be detected reliably, but precise estimates of mortality levels require calibration using field data in all new situations. Change in Kauth-Thomas wetness is the most reliable single indicator of forest change.

ID TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; COVER
AB Methodologies using the 1 km resolution data of the NOAA AVHRR instrument were developed for tropical forest spectral discrimination and mapping at a regional scale. Tropical Southeast Asia was selected as a case study using a multitemporal AVHRR data set of 1990-1992. This study documents first the relevance of AVHRR data to assess the extent of seasonal and dense forest and, moreover, reports on the derivation of a specific fragmented/disturbed forest class. A geographically dependent methodology is developed: For continental Southeast Asia, where generally good cloud-free images are available during the dry season and seasonal vegetation formations are present, multitemporal AVHRR mosaics were produced before the classification process. For insular Southeast Asia, which is particularly affected by the cloud cover and where only humid vegetation formations are present, a multitemporal set of single-date AVHRR images was first classified, and then the classifications were mosaicked together using a combination of two criteria (image quality and maximum occurrence). Unsupervised classifications using NDVI and Channel 3 radiance were processed in both cases. The classifications were labeled using the spectral typology derived from the spectral analysis of the dataset. For evaluation of the labeled classifications, comparisons were made at a regional level with a digital forest map database. Verification of the AVHRR class assignment was carried out locally using a few high spatial resolution satellite images. It highlights the sources of misclassification.

ID VEGETATION INDEX; SCATTERING
AB The objective of this article is to present a methodology for modeling shortwave satellite measurements over crops. This step is a prerequisite before we can apply inversion techniques of satellite data in order to retrieve crop yields. Temporal profiles of satellite data were simulated for an agricultural area, at field (20 m, SPOT HRV) and regional (4 km, NOAA AVHRR) scales, using a vegetation process model (AFRCWHEAT2) and a radiative transfer model (SAIL). Reflectances for individual winter wheat fields observed in SPOT HRV scenes on five dates during the cereal growing season were simulated accurately. Leu; resolution NOAA AVHRR data used for the regional study included various vegetation blages. The fractional area for each type of vegetation and its reflectances were taken into account. Winter cereals reflectances were simulated by the methods validated at the field scale and empirically modeled reflectances were used for other species. Although an AVHRR pixel consists of the intermingled signals characteristic of several vegetation categories, the simulated and observed NOAA AVHRR scale reflectances agreed well.

TI ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF LANDSAT SYNTHETIC STEREO PAIR FOR THE

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Considerable enhancement of Landsat imagery for geologic and morphotectonic interpretation can be obtained through generation of a synthetic stereo pair, by means of the integration of the spectral data with a digital elevation model. Photointerpretation of the enhanced Landsat images allows one to detect morphotectonic landforms of regional extension and to analyze their geomorphic characteristics at a small scale. Field geologic and structural surveys are then extensively used to crosscheck the image interpretation and to establish the relationships between location, orientation, and estimated age of the regional structures, and the local evidences of active tectonics. An application of Landsat stereo pair creation and interpretation is presented for an area characterized by high rates of tectonic activity in Central Italy. The work results in the definition of the location and extension of an active seismotectonic source, whose geomorphic expression at the surface strongly suggests that it is capable of generating earthquakes of magnitude 7.

AB An approach for combining remote sensing spectral measurements with an ecosystem model was presented in an accompanying article (Mougin et al., 1995). The sahelian grassland ecosystem STEP model developed for that purpose was also described and validated. In order to fulfill a prerequisite for using coarse resolution optical satellite data with the STEP model, the present paper presents i) a modeling of the reflectance which is adapted to the sahelian landscape and ii) a study based on the coupled ecosystem-reflectance modeling to assess the potential of vegetation indices for inferring vegetation. parameters. The modeling of the landscape reflectance is based on existing soil and canopy reflectance models, and considers area-weighted contributions from green and dry vegetation, and bare soil components. The ecosystem model provides the landscape reflectance models with inputs like vegetation cover fraction. (f(v)) and leaf area index (LAI) to characterize the vegetation present. Atmospheric effects are also accounted for using an existing simplified radiative transfer model. Simulated top of the atmosphere reflectances confronted to real satellite data during a growing season indicate that the modeling is adequate to reproduce temporal profiles of vegetation indices when atmospheric conditions are not prohibitive. Simulated vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, GEMI, SR) compared to vegetation characteristics show that a good tracking of the evolution of LAI and f(v) during the growing season is possible before maturation. A sensitivity study of the four VIs to green biomass, soil brightness, and atmospheric water vapor is carried out for the specific case of the Sahel. The SAVI and NDVI are both found to be adequate if atmospheric effects are minimized. NDVI integrated over the growing season is compared to net primary productivity (NPP) for different sites, regions, and growing seasons. A near-linear relationship is found, but the same relationship may not be applicable to different regions or growing seasons, On the whole, the results suggest that vegetation indices contain information which are useful for the ecosystem model, despite the fact that perturbating factors make the retrieval of these informations difficult. The possibility of using satellite data to drive the STEP model, or control its simulations will be assessed in a forthcoming article.

AB We discuss the observed C- and L-band polarimetric signatures of thin bead ice in one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Image based on the expected ice properties and results from a scattering model. In this article, we focus on thin ice with thicknesses in the range of 0-10 cm. The layered scattering model used here allows for the inclusion of surface and volume scattering contributions from a slush layer, an ice layer, and roughness at the interfaces. The sensitivity of the signatures to the model parameters is explored. A highly saline surface skim formed on the top surface during ice growth significantly affects the electromagnetic properties of the medium and helps to explain the magnitude of the copolarized returns at high incidence angles. Based on these model predictions, tee demonstrate an approach to retrieve the ice thickness from polarimetric SAR observations. The approach includes the training of a neural network with model predictions and using this neural network to estimate the ice thickness distribution using polarimetric observations from SAR data. The results from this ice thickness retrieval process are discussed.

AB Satellite remote sensing allows estimation, at a global scale, of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed (APAR) by the vegetation. Current estimates are based on retrieving the fraction (f(APAR)) of PAR absorbed by the canopy from spectral vegetation indices (SVI) derived from combinations of spectral reflectance measurements. We show that currently used SVI are strongly affected by the soil reflectance as well as the sun/view geometry, which yields large uncertainties on the SVI-f(APAR) statistical relationships. However, the errors can be reduced using optimal geometries and new SVI less affected by the soil reflectance. Such an approach yields an improvement of the f(APAR) assessment down to less than 5% of relative standard error. It is relevant for monitoring of the interannual variations of the net primary productivity (NPP) and its analysis to understand the climate sensitivity of the present ecosystems. These will perm it more detailed studies of seasonal and regional biospheric carbon sources and sinks that affect the global distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

AB Several different techniques have been proposed for estimating the net longwave radiation at the Earth's surface from satellite observations Many of these show considerable promise over ocean surfaces, although their accuracies are limited to the order to 20-30 W m(-2) for individual satellite observations given the current uncertainties in satellite estimates of the vertical distribution of coater vapor, cloud cover, cloud base altitude, and near-surface temperatures. The uncertainties over land surfaces are higher due to the larger uncertainties in estimating the surface temperature and emissivity. All of the flux estimation techniques suffer from an absence of absolute calibration, and little information is available to estimate the uncertainties of surface longwave radiation budgets over extended times for large areas. Nevertheless, this is an area of active research, and a narrowing of the uncertainties is expected to occur with the results of current and planned field programs.

The effect of weathering on the rock reflectance varied with rock type. However, all the lichen-affected spectra, which included four different species, exhibited the same five diagnostic absorption features in the high resolution spectra. More general changes in curve characteristics were also evident in the lichen-affected spectra. The diagnostic absorption. features were evident in spectra from samples with less than 50% lichen cover. Certain mineralogic features remained evident in the spectra despite the surface lichen cover.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated from reflected red and near-infrared radiation, has been related to various vegetation properties, including leaf area index, light absorption capacity, and photosynthetic potential. In an experiment with miniature canopies of 1-m-tall Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings, we modified leaf area index, light absorption capacity, and photosynthetic potential by altering the concentration of chlorophyll in foliage and by controlling the density of seedlings. We measured canopy photosynthesis and light transmission in controlled-environment chambers and then transferred seedlings to a hemispheric illumination system where we measured canopy reflectance. We found that altering the visible band used for computation of a normalized vegetation index substantially changed the correlations between the index and canopy properties. For example, the normalized index was best correlated to light absorption capacity when we used a narrow red band (671-674 nm; R2 = 0.71), and least correlated when we used a narrow green band (565-575 nm; R2 = 0.27). On the other hand, the index computed with the 565-575 nm band was best correlated with the photosynthetic potential of canopies grown in sunlight (R2 = 0.84), and the correlation was lower when a narrow red band was used (R2 = 0.37). The cause of these differences is chlorophyll. The green regions of reflectance spectra were much more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll concentration compared with the red or near-infrared regions. Increased chlorophyll concentration was also related to increased photosynthetic potential when canopies had been grown under full sunlight. However, we found no statistically significant relationship between leaf chlorophyll concentration and canopy light absorption.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article describes the error sources for three in-flight sensor calibration methods used by the Remote Sensing Group of the Optical Sciences Center at the University of Arizona. The three methods are the reflectance-, improved reflectance-, and radiance-based methods, which all reference the earth-atmosphere system. The sources of error or uncertainty for each method are discussed, and an estimate of the percent uncertainty associated with each source is made for conditions similar to those actually used for calibrations at White Sands, New Mexico. The results of in-flight calibrations are compared to those of the on-board lamp calibration system for a SPOT HRV camera.

TI ASSESSING THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF MULTISOURCE REMOTE-SENSING DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
AB Classification accuracy has traditionally been expressed by the overall accuracy percentage computed from the sum of the diagonal elements of the error, confusion, or misclassification matrix resulting from the application of a classifier. This article assesses the adequacy of the overall accuracy measure and demonstrates that it can give misleading and contradictory results. The Kappa test statistic assesses interclassifier agreement and is applied in assessing the classification accuracy of two classifiers, a neural network and a decision tree model on the same data set. The Kappa statistic is shown to be a more discerning statistical tool for assessing the classification accuracy of different classifiers and has the added advantage of being statistically testable against the standard normal distribution. It gives the analyst better interclass discrimination that the overall accuracy measure. The authors recommend that the Kappa statistic be used in preference to the overall accuracy as a means of assessing classification accuracy.

AB High spectral resolution data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) acquired over several forest stands in west-central Oregon were analyzed with respect to variations in forest canopy biochemical content (kg ha-1), foliar biochemical concentration (mg cm2 leaf area), and leaf area index (LAI). The Lowtran-7 atmospheric radiative transfer code was used to convert AVIRIS at-sensor radiance into reflectance factor The correlation of reflectance factor and first-difference AVIRIS spectra with total nitrogen (TN), lignin, starch, total chlorophyll content (kg ha-1), and LAI is presented. Correlogram structure in the 1200-2400 nm region is compared with the occurrence of known absorption features associated with organic molecular bonds which comprise foliar biochemical constituents. Regression equations relating the first-difference AVIRIS data to chemical variables and LAI were developed. The chlorophyll red edge spectral region was strongly related to LAI, canopy TN content, and canopy chlorophyll content. Generally good correspondence was found between wavelength selections for TN and lignin (concentration and content) and overtones of fundamental C-H and N-H absorptance features. The AVIRIS data were not significantly correlated with either starch concentration or starch content, although wavelength selections for starch were consistent with those made in previous laboratory-based studies.

ID VEGETATION INDEXES; AVHRR DATA
AB The use of satellite-derived vegetation indices for crop-monitoring and yield estimate and forecast is of key importance for those organizations in charge to monitor the agrarian season. This study intends to investigate the potential use of AVHRR/NDVI data for wheat monitoring in Italy. The time frame chosen is the 4-year span between 1986 and 1989, and the study region considered is Emilia Romagna. Two scales of study have been used: micro-scale and mesoscale. The first scale corresponds to the limits of NOAA satellite spatial resolution, and' has been used in the study of the vegetation index on restricted test sites, which, nevertheless, revealed a large number of data, including ground coverage. A wider scale has been considered to extend the results obtained in the microlevel analysis to the lowland section of the Emilia Romagna region. Good correlations were found with ground, simulated and collected crop parameters. In particular, NDVI has been found to be highly representative of plant photosynthetic capacity and efficiency. Using these results, a simple linear, regression model has been derived for wheat yield estimate and forecast based on NDVI integration during the wheat grain filling period. The results obtained, compared with official data, show their usefulness for a cheap and real-time crop monitoring.

AB The POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) instrument provides polarized reflectance measurements that can be used to distinguish atmospheric and surface contributions to reflectance. Polarized reflectance measurements can then be used for an accurate aerosol estimation overland. The POLDER instrument was flown for the first time on 17 June 1990 over the ''La Crau'' site, in southern France and the results are presented in this article. The POLDER instrument is scheduled for launch in 1995 on the Japanese ADEOS (ADvanced Earth Observing System) platform. Surface based atmospheric optic measurements (spectral optical thickness, sky radiance) are used to estimate the aerosol refractive index and size distribution. The corresponding aerosol model is then used in a radiative transfer model to simulate POLDER polarized measurements. The correlation between the observations and the simulations is good for the 550 nm and 650 nm wavelengths, but the simulation is biased for the 850 nm wavelength. These results indicate that, compared with the atmospheric contribution to the polarized reflectance, the surface contribution can be neglected at shorter wavelengths, but not so in near infrared wavelengths. The POLDER instrument allows multidirectional reflectance measurements. A surface target bidirectional reflectance, therefore, can be sampled at various viewing angles. In this article, we investigate the angular variations of the surface reflectance of various surface covers. The main observed variations are: i) a limb brightening, ii) a larger reflectance in the backscattering direction; iii) a local maximum in the forward direction for the shorter wavelengths, indicating specular reflection by the leaves. A very simple empirical model is proposed to quantify the main reflectance angular variations.

AB A sea ice mapping scheme based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting satellites has been developed and applied to daylight images taken between November 1989 to january 1990 and November 1990 to january 1991 over the Weddell and the Ross Seas. After masking the continent and ice shelves, sea ice is discriminated from clouds and open sea using thresholds applied to the multidimensional space formed by AVHRR Channel 2, 3, and 4 radiances. Sea ice concentrations in cloud-free regions are then computed using the tie-point method. Results based on the analysis of more than 70 images show that the proposed scheme is capable of properly discriminating between sea ice, open sea, and clouds, under most conditions, thus allowing high resolution sea ice maps to be produced during the austral summer season.

TI REMOTE-SENSING APPLICATION TO THE MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE
   WATER IN SEVERELY ARID REGION - A CASE-STUDY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Note
AB Al-Hassa Irrigation and Drainage Project, with an irrigated area of 7096 ha, is one of the main agricultural areas in Saudi Arabia. About 111 x 10(6) m3/year of agricultural drainage water is collected by 1641 km of earthen drainage network and during winter it is mostly discharged into two evaporation lakes located outside the project area. Landsat data were used to map the monthly and seasonal changes in the boundaries of the lakes and the drainage canals in the sand dune areas. Landsat images for Al-Hassa Oasis during summer and winter months between 1972 and 1987 were produced from Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper data. The images show that the drainage water has formed large water courses in the sand dunes and is being wasted by flowing into the Arabian Gulf during winter season. They also show that the water ceases to flow into the Gulf, and that the water courses dry up during the summer, This information is new, and has changed the previous concept that used to indicate that the drainage water remains in the lakes for the purpose of aquifer recharge and cattle drinking. These findings are very important and valuable in developing new plans for drainage water management and utilization in the oasis. It was found feasible to store 75% of the drainage water in two large semiburied surface reservoirs in the sites of the two lakes lined and covered with flexible membrane material. The stored drainage water can be used to satisfy the water shortages and to irrigate new areas during summer.

TI A COMPARISON OF TECHNIQUES FOR EXTRACTING EMISSIVITY INFORMATION FROM
   THERMAL INFRARED DATA FOR GEOLOGIC STUDIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGES; SCANNER
AB This article evaluates three techniques developed to extract emissivity information from multispectral thermal infrared data. The techniques are the assumed Channel 6 emittance model, thermal log residuals, and alpha residuals. These techniques were applied to calibrated, atmospherically corrected thermal infrared multispectral scanner (TIMS) data acquired over Cuprite, Nevada in September 1990. Results indicate that the two new techniques (thermal log residuals and alpha residuals) provide two distinct advantages over the assumed Channel 6 emittance model. First, they permit emissivity information to be derived from all six TIMS channels. The assumed Channel 6 emittance model only permits emissivity values to be derived from five of the six TIMS channels. Second, both techniques are less susceptible to noise than the assumed Channel 6 emittance model. The disadvantage of both techniques is that laboratory data must be converted to thermal log residuals or alpha residuals to facilitate comparison with similarly processed image data. An additional advantage of the alpha residual technique is that the processed data are scene-independent unlike those obtained with the other techniques.

AB In-flight calibrations of SPOT1 were performed in 1989 using a French site located in La Crau (southeastern France). A full description of the procedure is presented which includes both the characterization of the ground and of the atmosphere. To predict the radiance at the satellite level, we take into account the nonlambertian properties of the test site and the surrounding contribution. A detailed error budget is carefully conducted; the overall error of the method is around +/- 3%. The three calibrations performed are self-consistent and are in close agreement with calibration data obtained by CNES for XS2 and XS3. A discrepancy of 8% is observed for XS1 and its origin is under study.

DT Article
AB Classification possibilities of agricultural crops were studied using multitemporal, airborne radar data in ERS-1 and JERS-1 SAR configuration.  The radar data were collected with the DUTSCAT scatterometer during the Agriscatt campaign over an agricultural test site in The Netherlands in 1988.  In both ERS-1 and JERS-1 configuration, winter wheat, potato, sugar beet, and grass were differentiated in combinations of early-middle and early-late season observations.  The distance between the centers of the clusters of these crops (in the early-middle and the early-late season combinations) varied between 1.6 dB and 9.3 dB in the ERS-1 and between 3.1 dB and 9.7 dB in the JERS-1 configuration.  The average standard deviation of the crop-type clusters was 0.7 dB in the ERS-1 and 1.2 dB in the JERS-1 configuration.  In the ERS-1 configuration, pea, stem bean, and onion were likely to be confused with sugar beet and grass, but more fields were needed to derive firm conclusions.  In the JERS-1 configuration, stem bean and onion were well discriminated, and rapeseed and pea were confused with winter wheat and beet.  The combination of data in the ERS-1 and the JERS-1 configuration increased the classification possibilities for all crops.

AB Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) includes plant litter, senesced leaves, and crop residues. NPV plays an essential role in terrestrial ecosystem processes, and is an important indicator of drought severity, ecosystem disturbance, agricultural resilience, and wildfire danger. Current moderate spatial resolution multispectral satellite systems (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) have only a single band in the 2000-2500 nm shortwave infrared "SWIR2" range where non-pigment biochemical constituents of NPV, including cellulose and lignin, have important spectral absorption features. Thus, these current systems have suboptimal capabilities for characterizing NPV cover. This research used simulated spectral mixtures accounting for variability among NPV and soils to evaluate globally-appropriate hyperspectral and multispectral indices for estimation of fractional NPV cover. The Continuum Interpolated NPV Depth Index (CINDI), a weighted ratio index measuring lignocellulose absorption near 2100 nm, was found to produce the lowest error in estimating NPV cover. CINDI was less sensitive to variability in soil spectra and green vegetation cover than competing indices. While CINDI was sensitive to the relative water content of soil and NPV, this sensitivity allowed for correcting error in estimated NPV cover as water content increased. CINDI bands were less capable than Dual Absorption NPV Index (DANI) bands for maintaining continuity with the heritage Landsat SWIR2 band, but combining multiple CINDI bands demonstrated adequate continuity. Three SWIR2 bands with band centers at 2038, 2108, and 2211 nm can provide superior capabilities for future moderate resolution multispectral/superspectral systems targeting NPV monitoring, including the next generation Landsat mission (Landsat Next). These bands and the associated CINDI index provide potential for global NPV monitoring using a constellation of future superspectral sensors and imaging spectrometers, with applications including improving soil management, preventing land degradation, evaluating impacts of drought, mapping ecosystem disturbance, and assessing wildfire danger.

AB The ice phenology of freshwater lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere has undergone important climateinduced shifts over the past century. In Canada's North, where freshwater lakes and wetlands cover 15 to 40% of the landscape, monitoring ice phenology is vital to understand its impacts on climate, socio-economic, ecological, and hydrological systems. The rapid and dynamic nature of ice phenology events has restricted monitoring efforts to the use of satellite sensors with frequent revisit times (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR), but their low resolution (e.g., > 500 m) limits observations to larger water bodies. However, the increased abundance of highresolution open-access satellite imagery combined with the rise of cloud-computing technologies has provided opportunities to reduce the trade-off between temporal (i.e., revisit time) and spatial (i.e., pixel size) resolution allowing for lake ice monitoring over broad scales. In this study, we present the Open Pixel-based Earth eNgine Ice (OPEN-ICE) algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), which classifies imagery from multiple open-access optical sensors, then combines them to construct dense annual time series of ice-water observations and estimate pixel spring breakup dates at a 30-m resolution. Using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI scenes over lakes spanning northern latitudes, we build reference datasets to train decision trees that discriminate between ice, water, and clouds. We combine ice-water classifications from each sensor into annual time series and remove misclassifications with a temporal filter applied using a pixel-wise logistic regression. We then detect the sequence of transition from ice to water in each pixel's time series to estimate the occurrence of breakup each year. We deploy the OPEN-ICE algorithm over all freshwater pixels of Canada for the period of 2013 to 2021. Spring ice phenology events estimated by OPEN-ICE show high accuracy when compared to whole-lake breakup dates measured by the Canadian Ice Service in 105 lakes across 9 years, with mean bias errors of -1.10 and - 0.69 days for breakup start and end, respectively. We apply the OPEN-ICE algorithm to 4000 lakes across Canada and evaluate differences in breakup dates across ecozones and lake sizes. Our new OPEN-ICE tool provides accurate estimates of annual spring breakup events applicable across all boreal and arctic regions to monitor the rapid changes taking place in these vulnerable ecosystems.

ID CANOPY HEIGHT; EXPANSION; SOIL
AB Oil palm is the most efficient oil-producing crop but its extension leads to increased deforestation in Southeast Asia. Oil palm height enables the quantitative estimation for carbon stock or palm oil yield. Nevertheless, there are still no accurate characterization of oil palm height providing information for the tradeoff between forest damage and carbon stock of oil palm in Southeast Asia. The new generation of spaceborne LiDAR provides large-extent canopy height samples, offering an opportunity for mapping the oil palm height at the regional scale yet with challenge to extrapolate the footprint heights to spatially coherent maps. Here, we proposed a new method by combining Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) footprint data with stand age that is closely related to tree height. We first developed a semi-automatic filtering algorithm to filter the low-quality ICESat-2 data, and used a change detection algorithm to optimize the planting year map of oil palm. Then, an empirical age-height model was derived by linking ICESat-2 footprint canopy height with oil palm age that was used to estimate spatially and temporally oil palm height for the whole Peninsular Malaysia. A validation with inde-pendent ICESat-2 footprint data suggests a high agreement for the height estimates in 2020 from the age-height model (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 1.64 m) with a bias within & PLUSMN;3 m for >90% of the height estimates. Using the age-height model and planting year map of oil palm, we produced the first comprehensive wall-to-wall maps of long-term yearly oil palm height at a spatial resolution of 30 m in Peninsular Malaysia during 2001 through 2020. Our results suggest that the mean height of oil palm in all and regionally-disturbed areas have increased by 10.82 m and 9.29 m respectively during the last two decades in Peninsular Malaysia. Our results indicate that combining stand age and ICESat-2 footprint data has great potential in spatially-explicit mapping regional oil palm height that contributes to a better quantification for regional plantation carbon stock.

AB Aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) measuring the ratio of scattering to extinction is a critical parameter in determining aerosol radiative effect. However, the retrieval of SSA from satellite platforms is limited because most existing passive satellite sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) only provide the measurements of reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which are only capable of retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the basis of assumed SSA. In this study, we develop a machine learning based algorithm to retrieve SSA using joint surface visibility and satellite radiation measurements. With ancillary information such as meteorological condition, surface visibility can be regarded as a proxy of column AOD. By combining MODIS measured TOA apparent reflectance with ground visibility as well as other auxiliary parameters, we retrieve SSA at over 6000 visibility stations worldwide. The validation results during the period from 2010 to 2019 show high consistency with AERONET retrieved SSA, with daily, monthly, and seasonal retrievals all exhibiting high correlations of 0.68, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Daily, monthly, and seasonal RMSE values are 0.044, 0.012, and 0.011, respectively. The mean absolute bias (MAB) of daily retrievals is 0.031 and 62% of the samples fall within the uncertainty interval of & PLUSMN;0.03. Monthly and seasonal MAB values decrease to below 0.01. Over 97% of the monthly and seasonal retrievals are within the error envelope of & PLUSMN;0.03. Our work generates a global aerosol SSA dataset with extensive coverage over land, which can be used for validating and improving climate models and the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing.

AB Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for ecosystem conservation, but ground data collection is limited by cost, time, and scale. Remote sensing is a convenient approach providing frequent, near-real-time information with fine resolution over wide areas. According to the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), spectral diversity (SD) is an effective proxy of environmental heterogeneity, which ultimately relates to plant diversity. So far, studies testing the relationship between SD and biodiversity have reported contradictory findings, calling for a thorough investigation of the key factors (i.e., metrics applied, habitat type, scale, and temporal effects) and conditions under which such a relationship exists. This study investigates the applicability of the SVH for monitoring plant diversity at the landscape scale by comparing the performance of three types of SD metrics. Species richness and functional diversity were calculated for >2000 grid cells of 5 ' x 3 ' covering the Czech Republic. Within each cell, we quantified SD using a Landsat-8 "greenest pixel" composite by applying (i) the standard deviation of NDVI, (ii) Rao's Q entropy index and (iii) the richness of "spectral communities". Habitat type (i.e., land cover) was included in the models of the relationship between SD and ground biodiversity. Both species richness and functional diversity showed positive and significant relationships with each SD metric tested. However, SD alone accounted for a small fraction of the deviance explained by the models. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship depended significantly on habitat type and was highest in natural areas with transitional bushy and herbaceous vegetation. Our results underline that despite the stability of the significance of the relationship between SD and plant diversity at this scale, the applicability of SD for biodiversity monitoring is contextdependent and the factors mediating such a relationship must be carefully considered to avoid misleading conclusions.

AB Atmospheric emissions of reactive nitrogen in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3) worsen air quality and upon deposition, dramatically affect the environment. Recent infrared satellite measurements have revealed that NH3 emitted by industries are an important and underestimated emission source. Yet, to assess these emissions, current satellite sounders are severely limited by their spatial resolution. In this paper, we analyse measurement data recorded in a series of imaging surveys that were conducted over industries in the Greater Berlin area (Germany). On board the aircraft were the Telops Hyper-Cam LW, targeting NH3 measurements in the longwave infrared at a resolution of 4 m and the SWING+ spectrometer targeting NO2 measurements in the UV-Vis at a resolution of 180 m.Two flights were carried out over German's largest production facility of synthetic NH3, urea and other fertilizers. In both cases, a large NH3 plume was observed originating from the factory. Using a Gaussian plume model to take into account plume rise and dispersion, coupled with well-established radiative transfer and inverse methods, we retrieve vertical column densities. From these, we calculate NH3 emission fluxes using the integrated mass enhancement and cross-sectional flux methods, yielding consistent emissions of the order of 2200 t yr-1 for both flights, assuming constant fluxes across the year. These estimates are about five times larger than those reported in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) for this plant. In the second campaign, a co-emitted NO2 plume was measured, likely related to the production of nitric acid at the plant.A third flight was carried out over an area comprising the cities of Stassfurt and Bernburg. Several small NH3 plumes were seen, one over a production facility of mineral wool insulation, one over a sugar factory and two over the soda ash plants in Stassfurt and Bernburg. A fifth and much larger plume was seen to originate from the sedimentation basins associated with the soda ash plant in Stassfurt, indicating rapid volatilization of ammonium rich effluents. We use the different measurement campaigns to simulate measurements of Nitrosat, a potential future satellite sounder dedicated to the sounding of reactive nitrogen at a resolution of 500 m. We demonstrate that such measurements would allow accurately constraining emissions in a single overpass, overcoming a number of important drawbacks of current satellite sounders.

AB Time series algorithms for soil moisture retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have steadily increased in popularity over the past decade due to the feasibility of decoupling the effect of other surface variables, and the increasing availability of dense time series SAR data. While soil moisture inversion from time series data can utilize more independent observations, the value of further constraints on the inversion process are widely acknowledged. However, how to constrain a time series retrieval for global soil moisture mapping is still unresolved. In this study, three kinds of time series constraints were further developed and evaluated, including the use of 1) temporal behavior of soil moisture and soil moisture bounds; 2) temporal behavior of vegetation or time-invariant vegetation; and 3) time series ensemble skill. The effect of these constraints was investigated using 4 years (2016-2019) C-band Sentinel-1 data collected over 547 worldwide stations from 17 networks available on the international soil moisture network (ISMN) and intensive ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5). While the effect of these temporal retrieval skills varies in time and space, the global validation yielded four general suggestions: 1) the assumption of time-invariant vegetation contributed negatively even for a short retrieval period of <= 12 days; 2) reliable soil moisture bounds of each retrieval period can substantially improve the retrieval statistics at the cost of an underestimated soil moisture range; 3) the temporal constraints of soil moisture and vegetation need to be used together with the soil moisture bounds for reliable estimation; 4) the use of an ensemble retrieval could partly remove the retrieval uncertainties at the expense of underestimating soil moisture variation. The use of these constraints resulted in a competitive correlation coefficient (R: 0.64), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.072 m3/ m3) and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE: 0.052 m3/m3) at a spatial grid of 100 m, with similar performance achieved across a retrieval window up to 132 days.

AB This work presents stationary and mobile retroreflector-based remote sensing techniques for methane leak localization and quantification using chirped laser dispersion spectroscopy equipped with a custom laser transceiver capable of continuous tracking of a flying drone and coupled with inverse atmospheric gas dispersion modeling. The techniques demonstrate the ability to localize leaks as low as 0.13 g CH4 center dot s(-1), which are up to 25 times smaller than those typically observed at natural gas facilities, as well as actively track a moving retroreflector mounted on a lightweight (similar to 250 g) drone to enable spatial plume reconstruction. This system exhibited a 2.3 ppm-m sensitivity over pathlengths of 40-150 m. Source localization to within +/- 7 m is demonstrated using a modified horizontal radial plume mapping technique with a stationary retroreflector grid. Meanwhile, the mobile system utilizing a drone-mounted retroreflector is able to localize a controlled release within +/- 1 m of its source location and estimate leak rates using inversion techniques assuming type B Gaussian plume stability class within +/- 30% error with respect to the actual low flow rate releases.

AB Timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice cultivation is needed for maintaining sustainable rice production, ensuring food security, and monitoring water usage. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in the continuous monitoring and mapping of rice cultivation in cloudy regions since it is not affected by weather conditions. To date, most SAR imagery-based rice mapping methods rely on prior knowledge (e.g., the planting date) and empirical thresholds for specific regions, which limits their applications in large spatial scales. To tackle this limitation, this study proposed a new SAR-based Paddy Rice Index (SPRI) to quantify the probability of land patches planted paddy rice. SPRI fully uses unique features of paddy rice during the transplanting-vegetative period in the Sentinel-1 VH backscatter time series. With the assistance of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, SPRI can be calculated for each cropland object with adaptive parameters. Then, SPRI values of cropland objects can be converted to paddy rice maps using the binary-classification threshold. The proposed SPRI method was tested at five sites with diverse climate conditions, landscape complexity and cropping systems. Results show that the SPRI was able to produce an accurate classification map with an overall accuracy of over 88% and an F1 score of over 0.86 at all sites. Compared with the existing SAR-based rice mapping methods, our method performed much better in heterogeneous agricultural areas where rice is mosaiced with other crops. As SPRI does not need any prior knowledge, reference samples and many predefined parameters, it has high flexibility and applicability to support paddy rice mapping in large areas, especially for cloudy regions where optical remote sensing data is often not available.

AB Land subsidence, known to have occurred in many parts of Gulf Coast of the United States (GC) as a consequence of complex geological conditions, high-intensity resource exploitation and land use. This subsidence has caused extensive damage to buildings and other infrastructures. By exploiting 1650 images from 33 ALOS-1 paths during 2007-2011 using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) techniques, we have constructed, for the first time, a deformation map over 500,000 km2 of the 1900-km-long GC, with an RMSE of <10 mm/yr. The GC is generally stable, but numerous land deformation zones have been discovered, including at least 30 subsidence patterns and 14 uplift features. The maximum rate of subsidence measured is about 56 mm/yr at Stratton Ridge Oil Field, Texas. Most of the identified ground instabilities are newly discovered as a result of this study. The land deformation along GC is caused by both regional geological conditions and human activities that have influenced natural surroundings and consequentially exacerbated ground instability. Depressurization of petroleum reservoirs and aquifer compaction related to groundwater withdrawal are the principal impactors on observed subsidence. Other processes, including wastewater injection, sulfur/salt mining, dewatering, oxidation, and construction work, also contributed to the InSAR-mapped ground instability. Our large-scale deformation mapping will help the scientific community and relevant agencies better understand land deformation rates and extents, identify the processes responsible for the coastal deformation, and provide a critical dataset for hazard prediction and mitigation in the GC.

AB Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. The diurnal variation in photosynthesis provides key information on the responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers, but there is a critical gap in the large-scale estimation of diurnal photosynthesis. In the last decade, satellite estimates of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have been found to mimic the seasonality of photosynthesis. Recently, the deployment of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) on the International Space Station has provided the opportunity to retrieve SIF at different times of the day. Here we utilized OCO-3 measurements to estimate and analyze diurnal cycles of SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at the global scale. We first mitigated the sun-sensor geometry effects on nadir-mode OCO-3 SIF (SIFnadir) at the sub-diurnal scale (hourly) by deriving the total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal) using radiative transfer theory. Next, we generated the spatially and temporally continuous hourly SIFnadir and SIFtotal using artificial neural networks under clear-sky conditions, whose extrapolation ability was evaluated using the data from independent years. Compared with SIFnadir, the diurnal relationship between clear-sky SIFtotal and GPP from 38 homogeneous flux sites had smaller variations in the slope (the coefficient of variation was 0.07 vs 0.19). In addition, a correction to account for the bias between clear-sky and overcast conditions was used to estimate all-sky GPP from clear-sky SIFtotal and the resulting GPP was strongly correlated with tower GPP (R2 = 0.75; RMSE = 3.53 mu mol/m2/s). Our results demonstrated that the new OCO-3 SIF trained GPP product (GPPSIF) was able to depict the diurnal pattern of photosynthesis globally, capturing also the physiologically hysteresis or afternoon depression of photosynthesis. By doing so, hourly GPPSIF has the potential to improve the modeling of terrestrial photosynthesis and the projection of the global carbon cycle under climate change.
