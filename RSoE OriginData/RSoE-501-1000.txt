AB Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) models mixed spectra as a linear combination of endmembers that are allowed to vary in number and type on a per pixel basis. For modeling an image using MESMA, a parsimonious set of endmembers is desirable for computational efficiency and operational simplicity. This paper presents a method of selecting endmembers from a spectral library for use in MESMA. Endmember average root mean square error (EAR) uses MESMA to determine the average error of an endmember modeling spectra within its land cover class. The minimum EAR endmember is the most representative endmember for a land cover class within the spectral library and can be used to model the larger image.
   These techniques were used to map land cover, including four dominant vegetation species, soil, and senesced grass, in the Santa Ynez Mountains above Santa Barbara, CA, USA. Image spectra were extracted from a 20-m resolution airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance image using reference polygons and combined into a library of 915 spectra. Possible confusion between land cover classes was determined using the class average RMSE (CAR). EAR was used to select the single most representative endmember within each land cover class. The six minimum EAR endmembers were used to map the AVIRIS image. Land cover class accuracy was assessed at 88.6%. Using a fractional accuracy assessment, undermodeling of dominant land cover classes and overmodeling of absent land cover classes was found at the pixel scale. Land cover mapped using the minimum EAR endmembers represents a substantial improvement in accuracy over previous efforts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The inversion of physically based reflectance models is increasingly efficient for extracting vegetation variables from remote sensing images. It requires a vegetation reflectance model and an inversion method that are accurate and efficient. Usually, the complexity of reflectance models implies to use specific inversion methods (e.g., look-up table and neural network). Unfortunately, these methods are valid only for the view-sun directions for which they are designed. A developed look-up table based inversion method avoids this limitation: it generalizes any look-up table for any view-sun direction, and more generally for any input parameter value. It uses a look-up table made of c(i) coefficients of any analytical expression h that fits a set of reflectance values simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Interpolation on coefficients ci allows h to give reflectance values for any input parameter value. We settled some options of the inversion method with sensitivity studies: tree covers are simulated with 4-tree scenes, expression h has six coefficients c(i) and the interpolation is the continuous first derivative interpolation method. Moreover, the robustness of the inversion method was validated. The ability to generalize a took-up table for any view-sun direction was successfully tested with the inversion of SPOT images of Fontainebleau (France) forest. LAI maps proved to be as accurate (i.e., RMSE approximate to 1.3) as those obtained with classical relationships that are calibrated with in situ LAI measurements. Here, the advantage of our inversion method was to avoid this calibration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This research determined the potential for wavelet-based analysis of hyperspectral reflectance signals for detecting the presence of early season pitted morningglory when intermixed with soybean and soil. Ground-level hyperspectral reflectance signals were collected in a field experiment containing plots of soybean and plots containing soybean intermixed with pitted morningglory in a conventional tillage system. The collected hyperspectral signals contained mixed reflectances for vegetation and background soil in each plot. Pure reflectance signals were also collected for pitted morningglory, soybean, and bare soil so that synthetically mixed reflectance curves could be generated, evaluated, and the mixing proportions controlled. Wavelet detail coefficients were used as features in linear discriminant analysis for automated discrimination between the soil + soybean and the soil + soybean + pitted morningglory classes. A total of 3 6 different mother wavelets were investigated to determine the effect of mother wavelet selection on the ability to detect the presence of pitted morningglory. When the growth stage was two to four leaves, which is still controllable with herbicide, the weed could be detected with at least 87% accuracy, regardless of mother wavelet selection. Moreover, the Daubechies 3, Daubechies 5, and Coiflet 5 mother wavelets resulted in 100% classification accuracy. Most of the best wavelet coefficients, in terms of discriminating ability, were derived from the red-edge and the near-infrared regions of the spectrum. For comparison purposes, the raw spectral bands and principal components were evaluated as possible discriminating features. For the two-leaf to four-leaf weed growth stage, the two methods resulted in classification accuracies of 83% and 81%, respectively. The wavelet-based method was shown to be very promising in detecting the presence of early season pitted morningglory in mixed hyperspectral reflectances. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

[Remote Sens. Environ. 82 (2002) 238] in which the nonsphericity of dust particles was taken into account. The retrieved optical thicknesses were then compared with those derived from the sunphotometer and the skyradiometer measurements. The mean and the standard deviation of the optical thickness difference, GMS minus radiometers, were - 0.03 and 0. 17, respectively, for 85 samples where the optical thickness ranges from 0.25 to 1.07.

AB Much of Russia north of the treeline is grazed by reindeer, and this grazing has materially altered the vegetation cover in many places. Monitoring vegetation change in these remote but ecologically sensitive regions is an important task for which satellite remote sensing is well suited. Further difficulties are imposed by the highly dynamic nature of arctic phenology, and by the difficulty of obtaining accurate official data on land cover in arctic Russia even where such data exist. We have approached the problem in a novel fashion by combining a conventional multispectral analysis of satellite imagery with data on current and historical land use gathered by the techniques of social anthropology, using a study site in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO). A Landsat-7 ETM+ image from the year 2000 was used to generate a current land cover classification. A Landsat-5 TM image was used to generate a land-cover classification for 1988, taking due account of phenological differences and between the two dates. A cautious comparison of these two classifications, again taking account of possible effects of phenological differences, shows that much of the study area has already undergone a notable transformation to grass-dominated tundra, almost certainly as a result of heavy grazing by reindeer. The grazing pattern is quite heterogeneous, and may have reached unsustainable levels in some areas. Finally, we suggest that this situation is unlikely to be unique to our study area and may well be widespread throughout the Eurasian tundra zone, particularly in the west.

AB Remote sensing is an important tool for mapping and monitoring vegetation. Advances in sensor technology continually improve the information content of imagery for airborne, as well as space-borne, systems. This paper investigates whether vegetation associations can be differentiated using hyperspectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range, and how well species can be separated based on their spectra. For this purpose, the field reflectance spectra of 27 saltmarsh vegetation types of the Dutch Waddenzee wetland were analysed in three steps. Prior to analysis, the spectra were smoothed with an innovative wavelet approach.
   In the first stage of the analysis, the reflectance spectra of the vegetation types were tested for differences between type classes. It was found that the reflectance spectra of saltmarsh vegetation types are statistically significantly different for various spectral regions.
   Secondly, it was tested whether this statistical difference could be enhanced by using continuum removal as a normalisation technique. For vegetation spectra, continuum removal improves the statistical difference between vegetation types in the visible spectrum, but weakens the statistical difference of the spectra in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared part of the spectrum.
   Thirdly, after statistical differences were found, it was determined how distant in spectral space the vegetation type classes were from each other, using the Bhattacharyya (BH) and the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance measures. We selected six wavelengths for this, based on the statistical analysis of the first step. The potential of correct classification of the saltmarsh vegetation types using hyperspectral remote sensing is predicted by these distance measures.
   It is concluded that the reflectance of vegetation types is statistically different. With high quality radiometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, it is anticipated that vegetation species may be identified from imagery using spectral libraries that were measured in the field during the time of image acquisition.

TI A generalized soil-adjusted vegetation index
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Operational monitoring of vegetative cover by remote sensing currently involves the utilisation of vegetation indices (VIs), most of them being functions of the reflectance in red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands. A generalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (GESAVI), theoretically based on a simple vegetation canopy model, is introduced. It is defined in terms of the soil line parameters (A and B) as: GESAVI=(NIR - BR - A)/(R + Z), where Z is related to the red reflectance at the cross point between the soil line and vegetation isolines. As Z is a soil adjustment coefficient, this new index can be considered as belonging to the SAVI family. In order to analyze the GESAVI sensitivity to soil brightness and soil color, both high resolution reflectance data from two laboratory experiments and data obtained by applying a radiosity model to simulate heterogeneous vegetation canopy scenes were used. VIs (including GESAVI, NDVI, PVI and SAVI family indices) were computed and their correlation with LAI for the different soil backgrounds was analyzed. Results confirmed the lower sensitivity of GESAVI to soil background in most of the cases, thus becoming a very efficient index. This good index performance results from the fact that the isolines in the NIR-R plane are neither parallel to the soil line (as required by the PVI) nor convergent at the origin (as required by the NDVI) but they converge somewhere between the origin and infinity in the region of negative values of both NIR and R. This convergence point is not necessarily situated on the bisectrix, as required by other SAVI family indices. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A haze optimized transformation (HOT) is developed and assessed for the detection and characterization of haze/cloud spatial distributions in Landsat scenes. The transformation is derived from an analysis of a visible-band space where spectral response to diverse surface cover classes under clear-sky conditions is highly correlated, but spectral response to haze is highly sensitive to both optical wavelength and haze optical depth. The robustness of the detection algorithm is demonstrated through its application to visible band imagery of seven Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes that encompass diverse surface cover and atmospheric characteristics. A methodology for utilizing the transformed image to radiometrically compensate visible band imagery is presented and quantitatively tested in the correction of an example ETM+ scene.

AB Estimates of forest area were obtained for the states of Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri in the United States using stratified analyses and observations from forest inventory plots measured in federal fiscal year 1999. Strata were created by aggregating the land cover classes of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD), and strata weights were calculated as proportions of strata pixel counts. The analyses focused on improving the precision of unbiased forest area estimates and included evaluation of the correspondence between forest/nonforest aggregations of the NLCD classes and observed attributes of forest inventory plots, evaluation of the utility of the NLCD as a stratification tool, and estimation of the effects on precision of image registration and plot location errors. The results indicate that the combination of NLCD-based stratification of inventory plots and stratified analyses increases the precision of forest area estimates and that the estimates are only slightly adversely affected by image registration and plot location errors.

AB We report the results of a modeling study on the sensitivity of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface reflectance to differences in instrument spectral response functions (SRF) for various Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellites NOAA-6-16 as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Vegetation sensor (VGT), and the Global Imager (GLI). Modeling results were validated against real satellite observations employing AVHRR/NOAA-14 and -15 and MODIS, with a very good agreement. It is shown that for identical atmospheric state and similar surface spectral reflectance, the NDVI and spectral reflectances are sensitive to the sensor's SRF. Relative to a reference SRF for AVHRR/NOAA-9, the differences in reflectance among the AVHRRs range from - 25% to 12% for visible channel (red) and from - 2% to 4% for near-infrared (NIR) channel. Absolute change in NDVI among various AVHRRs ranged from - 0.02 to 0.06. The most significant difference was observed for the AVHRR/3. Consistent results were obtained with the AVHRR sensors aboard the following afternoon satellites: NOAA-9, -11, and -12, whereas important discrepancies were found for other AVHRRs aboard NOAA-6 and -10 and especially those launched more recently (NOAA-15 and -16). Reflectance and NDVI measured by MODIS channels I and 2 also exhibit significant differences (up to 30-40%) relative to AVHRR. GLI and VGT have some specific features that should be taken into account when intercomparing surface or top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance as well as NDVI. Sensitivity of the SRF effect to variable atmospheric state (water vapor, aerosol, and ozone) was also investigated. Polynomial approximations are provided for bulk spectral correction with respect to AVHRR/NOAA-9. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An error and sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the capabilities of the atmospheric resistant vegetation indices (VIs) for minimizing "residual aerosol" effects. The residual aerosol effects result from the assumptions and characteristics of the dark target (DT) approach used to estimate aerosol optical properties in the atmospheric correction scheme (referred to as the dark target-based atmospheric correction, DTAC). The performances of two atmospheric resistant VIs, the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were evaluated and compared with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The atmospheric resistant VIs successfully minimized the residual aerosol effects, resulting in a 60%, reduction of the errors from the NDVI and SAVI when a proper aerosol model was used for the estimation and correction of aerosol effects. The reductions were greater for thicker aerosol atmosphere (larger aerosol optical thickness, AOT). The atmospheric resistant VIs, however, resulted in having larger bias errors than the NDVI and SAVI when an improper aerosol model was used. The application of atmospheric resistant VIs to the DTAC-derived surface reflectances is exactly what is being carried out by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) VI algorithm. These results raise several issues for the effective, operational use of the DTAC algorithm and atmospheric resistant VIs, which are addressed in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A radiometric color model relating the color of optically complex (non-Case 1) waters to the organic and inorganic color-producing agents (CPA) responsible for that color has been previously applied to the waters of Lake Ontario. Canada and Lake Ladoga, Russia. Additional underwater optical measurements and water quality data from Lakes Erie and Michigan and several boreal takes in northern Ontario, as well as comparable data from the European takes Krasnoye, Zug, and Lucerne are utilized to illustrate both the validity of the model, as well as the universality of its application. It was found that, due to the limited availability of specific spectral scattering and absorption properties (optical cross-section spectra) for CPA indigenous to natural water bodies on a global scale, the use of optical cross-section spectra appropriate to the CPA indigenous to Lake Ontario and those appropriate to the CPA indigenous to Lake Ladoga provided a more-than-adequate surrogate for the water bodies considered herein (inclusive of river systems in the British Columbia Canadian Cordillera for which results of a study relating river water color to hydrographic basin features are also revisited). Similarities among the optical cross-section spectra pertinent to freshwater biota and similarities among the optical cross-section spectra pertinent to freshwater dissolved organic matter would appear to allow such a liberal use of site-specific aquatic optical properties. However., greatest discrepancies in indigenous inland water CPA optical cross-section spectra are consequences of global geologic diversities. A compensation for geologic diversities is illustrated by the use of Lake Ladoga cross-section spectra with the European lakes and the Lake Ontario cross-section spectra with the North American lakes., also providing validation of both the radiometric model and its universality. Such geologic similarities could alleviate labor-, time-, and cost-intensive determinations of optical cross-section spectra for many inland water bodies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB During a combined in situ and airborne remote sensing exercise off Oceanside, CA? a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) observed alongshore lineations: which were associated with an internal soliton packet accompanying a tidally generated internal solitary wave (solibore). The soliton packets were most evident in the images at green wavelengths, which penetrate the deepest into the water column. and only weakly evident at optical wavelengths with shallower penetration. We believe that this is the first observation of internal soliton packets determined from remotely sensed upwelled radiance. We hypothesize that the lineations were produced by changes in the upwelling radiance from the interior of the water column: not by changes in surface reflectance. Using a simulation, it is demonstrated that such lineations carl be produced by vertical modulation of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) during the passage of the internal soliton packet. Since surface manifestations ale not always present, this opens the potential for broadly based inventories of internal solitons in coastal waters. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

TI Atmospheric and spectral corrections for estimating surface albedo from
   satellite data using 6S code
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

ID BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; RETRIEVAL; LANDSAT
AB Surface albedo is one of the most important physical parameters for climate models, because it governs the exchange of radiation between the land surface and the atmosphere. Therefore? accuracy of the measurement of surface albedo directly affects the results of a climate model. Satellite remote sensing techniques provide a more accurate pixel-level estimation of surface: albedo for climate models than traditional field measurements. However, atmospheric effects and band pass limits of satellite sensors are two factors that limit accurate estimation of surface albedo from satellite data. Furthermore, comparative or global studies require a physically based model that is not optimized on one specific satellite scene, test site, and object class. Atmospheric code 6S can play this important role. Therefore, this payer develops a method for making atmospheric and spectral corrections for estimating surface albedo from satellite data using 6S code. The reliability of this method was tested in Kushiro Mire, Japan using comparisons of estimated and observed albedos. The results show that the satellite-inferred albedos agree well with the field-observed albedos, with the average error found to he about 6%. For spectral-to-broadband albedo conversion (spectral correction), results show that compensated band pass limits are better than extended bond pass limits; thp average error was reduced from 25% to 6%. Results also indicate that a higher spectral resolution sensor is necessary? to more accurately estimate surface albedo. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. Ail rights reserved.

AB The paper examines the selection of parameters for the nonparametric k-NN estimation method that is used in the Finnish multisource National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The MS-NFI utilises NFI field plot data, optical area satellite images and digital maps and produces forest variable estimates from the single pixel level up to the national level. The most important parameters to be selected are: the distance metric, the number of the nearest neighbours, ii, parameters related to the digital elevation model, stratification of the image data, as well as the width of the moving geographical horizontal and vertical reference areas (HRAs and VRAs). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) and significance of biases at pixel level were evaluated in order to find optimal parameters. A leave-one-out cross-validation method was applied. The emphasis is placed on the search for moving geographical HRAs and VRAs, as well as in the stratification of the field plots and the satellite images on the basis of auxiliary data. Stratification reduces the bias of the estimates significantly within each strata. With the current sampling intensity of the Finnish national forest inventory, a geographical HRA with a radius of 40-50 km was found optimal for the total volume estimates and for volumes by tree species in the mineral land map stratum. On the average, there was a sufficient number of field plots to cover the variation of forest variables within the image area to be analysed. The inclusion of field plot data beyond this area introduced bias to the estimates. For the peatland strata, a wider reference area, 60-90 km, was needed. A VRA together with topographic correction of the digital values of images, reduced the standard error of the volume estimates in Northern Finland. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study sought to develop a modified change vector analysis (CVA) using normalized multidate data from Landsat TM to examine spruce-fir ecosystems. The introduction of the balsan woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) to the Great Smoky Mountains in the late 1950s resulted in widespread mortality of Fraser fir (Abies fraseri), prompting the need for research on disturbance and regeneration. Drawing from methods in spherical statistics, the extended CVA technique measured absolute angular changes and total magnitude of Tasseled Cap indices (brightness, greenness, and wetness). Polar plots and spherical statistics summarized change vectors to quantify and visualize both magnitude and direction of change. Results separated vectors for forest stands by extent a,ld time interval since infestation, as found along the crest of Smokies Range. Changes in the greenness-wetness plane improved prediction of fir class more than brightness-greenness change. Linear discriminant functions found that magnitude and vector angles combined to predict change class 72% correct with three classes and 57% correct in six spruce-fir classes. The technique demonstrates the ability of change vectors in multiple biophysical dimensions to differentiate forest disturbance and regeneration trends as an alternative to nominal forest or land cover classifications.

TI Selecting representative high resolution sample images for land cover
   studies. Part 2: Application to estimating land cover composition
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID TROPICAL FOREST AREA; CALIBRATION; CLASSIFICATIONS; MODELS
AB We tested the effectiveness of the Purposive Selection Algorithm (PSA, described in the companion first article) to accurately estimate land cover composition over a large area. The knowledge of land cover distribution over large areas is increasingly more important for numerous scientific and policy purposes. Unless a complete detailed map is necessary, a sampling approach is the best strategy for determining the relative proportions of individual cover types because of its cost-effectiveness and speed of application. With coarse resolution land cover maps at continental or global scales increasingly becoming available, the possibility arises of using such maps synergistically with a sample Of high resolution satellite coverage. The goal of such synergy would be to obtain accurate estimates of land cover composition over large areas as well as the knowledge of local spatial distribution. We evaluated PSA performance for sample selection over a 136,432 km(2) area (domain) in the BOREAS Region Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. Two maps were prepared for the domain, one based on NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, 1 km pixels) and one on LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM, 30 m). After dividing the area into 134 tiles, a PSA sample was selected using the AVHRR tiles. A random sample was also selected for comparison. The domain AVHRR cover type fractions were then corrected using TM maps for the selected tiles, following the method of Walsh and Burk (1993). The land cover composition obtained through the combined "domain AVHRR/sample TM" data was then compared with the domain TM coverage. We found that PSA provided a representative sample to correct the AVHRR map, particularly for small sample sizes. Compared to the random selection, PSA yielded more accurate results at all tested sampling fractions (up to 30% of all tiles). With a PSA sample of 7% (18%), the average absolute difference per class between the correct and the estimated fraction was 0.058% (0.043%). For the same sample fractions, the average relative error per class runs 16.1% (9.8%) for PSA and 24.5% (18.7%) for random selection. The difference between PSA and random selections was significant at the 0.001 probability level. It is concluded that the PSA strategy is an effective way to combine coarse and fine resolution satellite data to obtain expedient and cost-effective land cover information over large areas. An important benefit of the synergistic combination of the two maps is knowledge of land cover distribution at the landscape level. This is because the coarse resolution map provides the overall distribution patterns across the domain, while the fine resolution map supplies the average composition of the coarse resolution pixels in each cover type. Thus, each coarse pixel can be statistically divided into the component high resolution classes. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the retrieval performances of several biophysical variables from the accumulation of large swath satellite data, the VEGETATION/SPOT4 sensor being taken as an example. This included leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and chlorophyll content integrated over the canopy (C-ab.LAI), gap fraction in any direction [P-0(theta)], or in particular directions (nadir [P-0(0)], sun direction [P-0(theta)(s)], or 58 degrees [P-0(58)degrees] for which the gap fraction is theoretically independent of the LAI). A database of top of canopy BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) of homogeneous canopies was built using simulations by the SAIL, PROSPECT, and SOILSPECT radiative transfer models for a large range of input variables (LAI, mean leaf inclination angle, hot spot parameter, leaves and soil optical properties, date and latitude of observations) considering the accumulation of observations during an orbit cycle of 26 clays. Walthall's BRDF model was used to estimate nadir (rho(0)) and hemispherical reflectance (rho(h)). Results showed that rho(0) and rho(h) were estimated with a good accuracy (RMSE = 0.02) even when few observations within a sequence were available due to cloud masking. The rho(0) and rho(h) estimates in the blue (445 nm), the red (645 nm), near-infrared (835 nm), and middle infrared (1665 nm) were then used as inputs to neural networks calibrated for estimation of the canopy biophysical variables using part of the data base. Performances evaluated over he rest of the database showed that variables such as nadir gap fraction (approximate to P-0(58 degrees)approximate to P-0(theta(s))approximate to fAPAR) were accurately estimated by neural networks (relative RMSE<0.05). Results of the estimation of LAI (approximate to LAI.Cab) was less satisfactory since the level of reflectance saturates for high values of LAI (relative RMSE<0.08). The estimation of the directional variation of the gap fraction tons not accurate because the amount of directional information contained in the input variables of the neural network was not sufficient. We also investigated the problem of mixed pixels due to the low spatial resolution associated with large swath sensors. Results showed that variables such as nadir gap fraction were not as sensitive to high levels of heterogeneity in pixels as variables such as leaf area index. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Insect defoliation is a major disturbance force in forested ecosystems. Monitoring outbreaks, and estimating the areas affected, is therefore important for both forest managers and forest ecologists. The objective of our study teas to classify jack pine budworm defoliation levels in Landsat TM imagery recorded precious to and during the 1990-1995 outbreak In our 450,000 ha study area in northwestern Wisconsin (USA). Many precious studies correlated insect defoliation and remotely sensed imagery with moderate to good success, but it often remained unclear if actual defoliation effects or other forest attributes correlated with defoliation were defected. For example, a larger deciduous component in mixed jack pine stands will limit budworm populations and thereby defoliation. The deciduous component in stands is a determining factor for insect defoliation, whereas needle discoloration and tree mortality are their effect. We used pre-outbreak Landsat TM data (1987) to identify determining factors for jack pine budworm population levels and peak-outbreak imagery (1993)for detecting actual defoliation. Our satellite data were atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer model (5S). Spectral mixture analysis was performed using spectrometer measurements of jack pine needles and bark as representations of surface materials ("endmembers"), The explanatory power of the resulting fraction images was evaluated using jack pine budworm population data collected at 33 sampling points. Near-infrared reflectance (NIR) increased in defoliated stands between 1987 and 1993, but single date NIR in each year was negatively correlated with budworm levels in 1993 (r= -0.69 and -0.47). This was because hardwood trees within jack pine stands caused higher NIR reflectance but limited jack pine budworm populations. The 10% NIR difference between pure and mixed jack pine stands outweighed the 3-5% increase in NIR due to defoliation and necessitated stratification of the satellite data by tree species. Spectral mixture analysis performed on pure jack pine stands resulted in a strong negative correlation between the 1993 green needle fraction and the 1993 budworm population data (r=-0.94). This study was, to our knowledge, the first that applied spectral mixture analysis for forest damage detection, and also the first to use insect population measurements as independent field data. These methods and the separation of determinants and effects of jack pine budworm defoliation, enabled us to detect actual defoliation with high accuracy. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Plant ecologists have long recognized the importance of aerial photographs as a data source for studies of vegetation dynamics. Recent advances in computer-aided technology (digital photogrammetry, computerized image processing, and geographical information systems) have opened new possibilities for the extraction of data on vegetation changes from aerial photographs. In this study we describe a computer-based approach for studying landscape-scale, long-term vegetation dynamics, using historical aerial photographs as a major data source. The method we employ consists of four main steps: 1) image scanning and preprocessing (rectification, georeferencing, spectral corrections and mosaicking), 2) image classification and construction of vegetation maps, 3) field validation, and 4) statistical analysis of vegetation changes. We applied our approach by analyzing changes in tree cover over a period of 32 years in a mountainous landscape dominated by Mediterranean maquis in northern Israel and discuss the main limitations and potential error sources of each stage of our analysis. We conclude that digital processing of historical aerial photographs may serve as a powerful tool for the detection, quantification, and analysis of landscape-scale patterns of vegetation dynamics. This conclusion is a important because aerial photographs provide the largest source of information available today for research of long-term vegetation dynamics, and are the only source of information on vegetation dynamics that combines high spatial resolution, large spatial extent, and long-term coverage.

AB Remotely sensed estimates of the foliar biochemical content of vegetation canopies could be used to derive indicators of ecosystem functioning at regional to global scales. In the past decade, the number of studies have reported strong correlations between the reflectance spectra of vegetation canopies and their foliar biochemical content. However, these studies have commonly employed multiple regression techniques or spectral indices to determine biochemical content, which have been found to be highly sensitive to variation in canopy architecture [such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure] and understory. To date, these effects combined with the low signal-to-noise ratios of airborne spectrometers have inhibited the development of robust and portable spectral techniques for the estimation of canopy biochemical content. This paper reports on a theoretical study in which a leaf model, LIBERTY (leaf incorporating biochemicals exhibiting reflectance and transmittance yields), characterized specifically for conifer needles, was coupled with a hybrid geometric/radiative transfer bidirectional reflectance distribution function FLIGHT (forest light) model. By varying leaf biochemical content, LAI, canopy closure and understory, we analyzed the simulated canopy reflectance spectra to determine if the biochemical adsorption features in leaf spectra were preserved at the canopy scale. Absorption features or wavelength regions that were both related to a specific biochemical of interest (water, lignin-cellulose) and persistent at the scale of both the leaf and the canopy were identified at a number of wavelengths or wavelength regions.

AB Passive microwave satellite data provide an extended time series for monitoring of polar processes, such as variability in sea ice extent. To ensure consistent data sets Sor tame series analysis of sea ice cover, differences between ice concentration estimates from similar sensors on successive spacecraft mist be understood. In this study, the effects of changing from the SSM/I F11 to the F13 satellite are examined for a 5-month overlap period. In terms of hemispheric averages of mean ice concentration, the biases introduced by the switch from F11 to F13 are slight and are not statistically significant in most areas, although relatively large and significant differences are seen in some regions. Furthermore, differences in sea ice extent and total ice covered area between the two platforms were found to be statistically significant. Previous efforts to reduce such differences in geophysical parameters between earlier SSM/Is have focused on, Establishing relationships between the brightness temperatures. However, we find the relations between the F11 and F13 brightness temperatures to be highly sensitive to the region chosen for the analysis. Consequently, the choice of sample has a substantial effect on the sensor-to-sensor adjustment and on the resulting sea ice concentrations. Furthermore, analysis of ice concentrations between F8 and F11 and between F11 and F13 shows that current attempts at a relative calibration of the true instruments do not offer a significant improvement in corresponding ice fractions.

AB This paper describes a boreal ecosystems productivity simulator (BEPS) recently developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing to assist in natural resources management and to estimate the carbon budget over Canadian landmass (10(6)-10(7) km(2)). BEPS uses principles of FOREST biogeochemical cycles (FOREST-BGC) (Running and Coughlan, 1988) for quantifying the biophysical processes governing ecosystems productivity, but the original model is modified to better represent canopy radiation processes. A numerical scheme is developed to integrate different data types: remote sensing data a 1-km resolution in lambert conformal conic projection, daily meteorological data in Gaussian or longitude-latitude gridded systems, and soil data grouped in polygons. The processed remote sensing data required int he model are leaf area index (LAI) and land-cover type. The daily meteorological data include air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, precipitation, and humidity. The soil-data input is the available water-holding capacity. The major outputs of BEPS include spatial fields of net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration. The NPP calculated by BEPS has been tested against biomass data obtained in Quebec, Canada. A time series of LAI over the growing season of 1993 in Quebec was derived by using 10-day composite normalized difference vegetation index images acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer at 1-km resolution (resampled). Soil polygon data were mosaicked, georeferenced, and rasterized in a geographic information system (ARC/INFO). With the use of the process-based model incorporating all major environmental variables affecting plant growth and development, detailed spatial distributions of NPP (annual and four seasons) in Quebec are shown in this paper. The accuracy of NPP calculation is estimated to be 60% for single pixels and 75% for 3x3 pixel areas (9 km(2)). The modeled NPP ranges from 0.6 kg C/m(2)/year at the southern border to 0.01 kg C/m(2)/year at the northern limit of the province. The total annual NPP in Quebec is estimated top be 0.24 Gt C in 1993, which is about 0.3-0.4% of the global NPP. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Two ERS-1 SAR scenes have been acquired over Mt. Pinatubo, before and during the rainy season, respectively on 9 July and 13 August 1993. The last one is coeval with typhoon and subsequent lahar activity. From field observations and consideration of physical properties of lahar surfaces, we decipher keys to detect areas covered by recent and active lahars. The main physical characteristics to consider are surface roughness, soil moisture, and morphology. Color compositions show differences between the two dates. Recently deposited lahars may have high or low roughness at the surface and are wet. Running lahars have a tumultuous rough surface. Recently deposited or running lahars have high backscatter values which differ from low values of more ancient flat smooth-surfaced dry lahar sediments or lahars covered by shallow quiet water. Shallow quiet waters covering more ancient rough lahar surfaces are also detected. Anastomotic streams, fanlike patterns, closure or infilling of lakes, and migration of streams are also morphologic expressions of lahar deposits. Flooded areas during typhoons can be recognized from their location in large coastal plains, while lahars occur along main river beds and nearby. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB This review addresses ha potential of image-based remote sensing to provide spatially and temporally distributed information for precision crop management (PCM). PCM is an agricultural management system designed to target crop ann soil inputs according to within-field requirements to optimize profitability and protect the environment. Progress in PCM has been hampered by a lack of timely, distributed information an crop and soil conditions. Based on a review of the information requirements of PCM, eight areas were identified in which image-based remote sensing technology could provide in formation that is currently lacking or inadequate. Recommendations were made for applications with potential for near-term implementation with available remote sensing technology and instrumentation. We found that both aircraft- and satellite-based remote sensing could provide valuable information for PCM applications. Images from aircraft-based sensors have a unique role for monitoring seasonally variable crop/soil conditions and for time-specific and time-critical crop management; current satellite-based sensors have limited, but important, applications; and upcoming commercial Earth observation satellites mall provide the resolution, timeliness, and high quality required for many PCM operations. The current limitations for image-based remote sensing applications are mainly due to sensor attributes, such as restricted spectral range, coarse spatial resolution, slow turnaround time, and inadequate repeat coverage. According to experts in PCM, the potential market for remote sensing products in PCM is good. Future work should be focused on assimilating remotely sensed information into existing decision support systems (DSS), acid conducting economic and technical analysis of remote sensing applications with season-long pilot projects.

AB The processing of remote-sensing data requires simple but accurate models of directional reflectance of the vegetation canopy. In this study, a reflectance model for a homogeneous canopy is evaluated over an extensive set of radiometric measurements performed on sugar beet canopies. The model corresponds to the Scattering by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves (SAIL) model (Verhoef, 1984) in which the term for first order scattering is corrected for hot-spot and leaf specular reflectance. Leaf optical properties are calculated using the PROSPECT model (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990). Experimental data correspond to a two-year experiment and express a large variability of leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration and soil background optical properties. In the first data set, reflectance was measured about midday under vertical viewing in five optical Thematic Mapper bands. In the second data set, bath vertical and oblique measurements (zenith angle 45 degrees, four azimuth angles) were performed from sunrise to sunset in the three SPOT bands. Except for leaf cuticle reflectance, structure and optical variables were measured in the field or adjusted to field measurement, independently of reflectance calculations. Although the structure of sugar beet canopies departs strongly from a turbid medium, a good agreement with measurements was obtained in the case of vertical, north and south view directions. However, the model underestimated the measurements close to the hot-spot direction. In the near infrared, there was also some underestimation of canopy reflectance in the opposite direction to the hot-spot. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.

TI Application of Shannon information theory to a comparison between L- and
   C-band SIR-C polarimetric data versus incidence angle
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this article is to present a quantitative measurement of the redundancy, or mutual information, between two different images of the same site. It is based on Shannon and Wiener information theory. In the case of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images, we propose to compute redundancy either at the radiometric level, according to the error bar on measurement, or at the class level, according to supervised or unsupervised classification results. The advantage of the comparison at the class level is that both polarimetric information and spatial neighborhood information are considered, and therefore the comparison is performed at a higher level of information.
   This measurement has been applied to the study of redundancy between L and C bands from spaceborne imaging radar C images of the Orgeval test site, located in the east of Paris (France), versus incidence angle. It is shown that the redundancy between the two bands increases from about 20% to 30% when incidence angle increases from 44 degrees to 57 degrees. Based on the analysis of classification results in terms of redundancy with ground truth, an interpretation of this result is proposed. Finally, the great complementarity between the two bands is used to improve classification results, by performing data fusion between the two bands. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Recent day/night land surface temperature (LST) algorithms can recover both emissivity and temperature but require some assumptions about the relative optical properties of natural materials in the thermal infrared. We constructed a goniometer and measured the spectral, angular emissivity, and bidirectional reflectance of sands and soils in the 3-14 mu m range. In this paper, we present the results for five diverse surfaces and examine the validity of the LST assumptions. We conclude that the change in emissivity with angle was small across the entire range for all of the materials except sand. In addition, for all of the materials, the measured variation in bidirectional reflectance anisotropy with wavelength was small enough to neglect. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Ferruginous fluvial sediments deposited on the banks and on the floodplain of the Coeur d'Alene River in northern Idaho have been contaminated by trace metals released by mining activities in and around the town of Kellogg, Idaho. These ferruginous sediments are amenable to detection and mapping by remotely sensed data. Data collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were analyzed both to map exposed concentrations of these sediments and also to consider their mineralogic variability. The processing tool used to map the ferruginous sediments was the recently developed constrained energy minimization (CEM) technique, which on a pixel-by-pixel basis maximizes the response of the target signature and suppresses the response of undesired background signatures. CEM abundance images, produced using both laboratory and image data as the target signatures, were thresholded to produce a set of spectra dominated by the ferruginous sediment spectral response. Spectral subsections of this data set were analyzed using principal components analysis, and endmember image spectra representing, in most cases, known mineral phases were identified.

AB Two Everest 4000A radiometers were used to measure sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean from the RSV Aurora Australis during the periods 7 August 1993-9 October 1993 and 1 January 1994-1 March 1994. On four separate occasions, the radiometers were calibrated under controlled laboratory conditions using a Thermos(TM) 60-L cooler; a cool room and a Contherm(TM) unit. The calibration results were best when the radiometers and calibration target were allowed to come to equilibrium at a set temperature, with root-mean-square differences of 0.1 degrees C between the measured and actual target temperatures. When the radiometers were operated under conditions of rapid temperature change, the root-mean-square differences were found to be as large as 0.6 degrees C. The bias error of the radiometers was found to have changed subsequent to each of their deployments in the Southern Ocean, and this underlines the importance of monitoring changes in the offset of the radiometers in the field.

AB The biochemical concentration (total protein, cellulose, lignin, and starch) of 73 plant leaves has been related to their optical properties through statistical relationships. Both fresh and dry plant material, leaves and needles, were used in this study. Stepwise multiple regression analyses have been performed on reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance values (individual leaves) as well as on reflectance values of optically thick samples (stacked leaves + needles), on measured values and on transformations of them such as the first derivative or the logarithm of the reciprocal of the reflectance. They underscored good prediction performances for protein, cellulose, and lignin with high squared multiple correlation coefficients (r(2)) values. Starch, whose concentration in the leaf was smaller compared to the other components, was estimated with less accuracy. As expected, dry material and optically thick samples provided respectively stronger correlations than fresh material and individual leaves.

TI ROAD DUST AS AN INDICATOR FOR AIR-POLLUTION TRANSPORT AND DEPOSITION -
   AN APPLICATION OF SPOT IMAGERY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SOLAR
AB A simulation model for atmospheric diffusion and dry deposition of coarse dust particles developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute was recently applied to calculate the dispersion and deposition of road-generated dust from the Dalton Highway, which is a high-speed gravel road in arctic Alaska traveled mainly by large vehicles. The propelled dust is deposited on the adjacent vegetation where it may cause detrimental effects to the plants of the highly fragile tundra. During a field experiment in 1991, all meteorological parameters as well as the size distribution of the deposited dust particles were measured. This data was used to calculate the dust distribution pattern and the amount of dust transferred into the vegetation at specific locations along the Dalton highway. The scope of this article is to identify and, as far as possible, to quantify this dust deposition pattern along the Dalton Highway by multispectral SPOT imagery. The Spatial distribution of the dust on both sides of the road is distinctly visible in the XS3 channel (0.79-0.89 mu m) of a SPOT satellite image. On the basis of the ground reflectance and the reflectances of pure dust and pure vegetation, the dust load can be calculated. The dust load depends on the particle size distribution, which can be derived from the size spectra measured in the field experiment. The spatial dust load obtained from the SPOT data is compared with the distribution computed with the simulation model. As the simulation is based on only a limited number of days, the dust load scaling is arbitrary. Taking this fact into account, the general shapes of the two distributions agree remarkably well within a strip of about 1 km width along the road. Apart from this application on a local scale, suspended dust might also be detected on larger scales, for example, as volcanic ash or as tropospheric or stratospheric aerosols.

AB The 85.5 GHz vertically and horizontally polarized channels of the Special Sensor Microwave Inagers (SSM/1) aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft offer the potential to map sea ice with a spatial resolution of 12.5 km, a factor of two improvement over the popular National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Team algorithm, but with the limitation of increased atmospheric influence on the sea ice signal. Application of an algorithm for estimating total ice concentration from 85.5 GHz data, which exploits the large polarization for open water versus the small polarization for most ice types, reveals agreement with the NASA Team algorithm typically within. a standard deviation of +/- 3% for nearly cloud-free winter conditions. The uncertainty increases to a standard deviation of +/- 6% for cloudy winter conditions. In winter, volume scattering from multiyear ice has a noticeable impact on the 85.5 GHz brightness temperatures. By employing a polarization corrected temperature variable previously defined to isolate precipitation in mid-latitude DMSP imagery, it is possible to exploit the large differences in 85.5 GHz emissivity between first year and multiyear ice to interpret an 85.5 GHz image in terms of both total ice and multiyear ice concentration. Preliminary results, for nearly cloud-free winter conditions, reveal agreement between these interpretations and the NASA Team algorithm to within a standard deviation of +/- 6%, with slightly better agreement at Low multiyear ice concentration.

AB Remote sensing of water status and biochemical components of vegetation can have important applications in the fields of agriculture and forestry. Reflectance of fresh, green vegetation in the 1.0-2.5 mu m region is dominated by liquid water absorption and also weakly affected by absorption due to biochemical components, such as protein, lignin, and cellulose. We have developed both the nonlinear and linear least squares spectrum-matching techniques for deriving equivalent water thickness (EWT) of vegetation from AVIRIS data in the 1.0 mu m and 1.6 mu m regions. EWT values are compared with in situ canopy measurements in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Seasonal variations of EWTs over an agricultural area in Greeley, Colorado are determined. EWTs from the 1.0 mu m region are generally greater than those from the 1.6 mu m region. This is because the absorptivity of water near 1.0 mu m is much less than that at 1.6 mu m-resulting in a greater mean absorption path length in the 1.0 mu m region. After fitting the AVIRIS data with a reflectance spectrum of water, a weak lignin-cellulose absorption feature centered at 1.72 mu m is seen in the difference spectra. We map the depth of the 1.72-mu m feature, which can be considered as an index of abundance of those compounds in the canopy. AVIRIS data for the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts were analyzed and compared with laboratory chemical analysis of the foliage. The results obtained with the linear least squares spectrum-matching technique are comparable to the stepwise linear regression results obtained from first difference spectra.

AB The PROSPECT leaf optical properties and SAIL canopy reflectance models were coupled and inverted using a set of 96 AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) equivalent spectra gathered in afield experiment on sugar beet plots expressing a large range in leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration, and soil color. In a first attempt, the model accurately reproduced the spectral reflectance of vegetation, using six variables: chlorophyll a+b concentration (C-ab), water depth (C-w), leaf mesophyll structure parameter (N), leaf area index (LAI), mean leaf inclination angle (theta(l)), and hot-spot size parameter (s). The four structural parameters (N, LAI, theta(l) and s) were poorly estimated, indicating instability in the inversion process; however, the two biochemical parameters (C-ab and C-w) were evaluated reasonably well, except over very bright soils. In a second attempt, three of the four structure variables were assigned a fixed value corresponding to the average observed in the experiment. Inversions performed to retrieve the remaining structure variable, leaf area index, and the two biochemical variables showed large improvements in the accuracy of LAI, but slightly poorer performance for C-ab and C-w. Here again, poor results were obtained with very bright soils. The compensations observed between the LAI and C-ab or C-w led us to evaluate the performance of two more-synthetic variables, canopy chlorophyll content or canopy water content; for these the inversions produced reasonable estimates. The application of this approach to Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data provided similar results, both for the spectrum reconstruction capability and for the retrieval of canopy biophysical characteristics.

AB Digital images of soybean canopies [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] were obtained within selected narrow wavebands (6-10 nm bandwidths) to determine their capability for early detection of plant stress. Images and physiological measurements of stress were acquired 2 days, 4 days, and 7 days following application of control, drought, and herbicide [(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea, or DCMU] treatments. As a result of frequent rainfall, drought stress never occurred. However, exposure to herbicide rapidly induced plant stress. By day 4, the ratio of variable to maximum of leaf fluorescence (F-v/F-m) decreased and leaf water potentials (psi(w)) increased in the herbicide treated soybean, indicating damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and stomatal closure. Also, Munsell leaf color had increased from approximately 5GY 4.6/5.7 to a lighter green-yellow value. Canopy reflectances at 670 nm , 694 nm, and in the 410-740 nm band (R(vis)), as well as reflectance at 694 nm divided by reflectance at 760 nm (R(694)/R(760)), detected stress simultaneously with the physiological measurements and increased consistently with stress through day 7. Reflectances at 420 nm and 600 nm, together with R(600)/R(760) and R(vis)/R(760), did not increase until leaves were yellow or brown and wilted and canopies had begun to collapse on day 7. None of the reflectance or reflectance ratio images detected stress prior to visible color changes. This was attributed primarily to the rapid inducement of chlorosis by the herbicide. Reflectance in narrow wavebands within the 690-700 nm region and its ratio with near-infrared reflectance should provide earlier detection of stress-induced chlorosis compared with broad band systems or narrow bands located at lesser wavelengths.

AB The effects of heightened sea state on the computation of chlorophyll concentration from satellite radiance data are modeled for Case 1 waters. Errors in estimating chlorophyll can result when increasing winds create an increasingly whitecapped air-sea interface. The resulting errors in estimating chlorophyll concentration are shown for a range of windspeeds of 0-25 m/s and for a range of chlorophyll concentrations of 0-20 mg/m(3). Model results are furnished for correcting remotely sensed chlorophyll for varying sea states provided that some estimate of surface wind fields is available.

AB Mediterranean forests are regularly subjected to a large number of fires; 537,000 ha were burned during the severe European drought of 1990. The French Ministries of Environment, Interior, and Agriculture are trying to implement efficient methods to prevent forest fires and to reduce their incidence. Fire risk is composed of human, ecological, and climatic factors that are already accounted for in prevention methods. However, the importance of biophysical factors, especially the water status of forest trees, bushes, grasses, and litter should also be considered. In a first step, thermal infrared data from NOAA-AVHRR daily images covering an 18-month period were used to estimate temporal variations of forest evapotranspiration through an energy budget-based relationship. Results were related to statistics on fire starts, in order to derive a fire risk index that can be used for a real-time regional alarm.

ID VEGETATION CANOPIES; ALBEDO
AB Aircraft imagery and ground measurements acquired for a spruce forest stand in Howland, Maine as part of the 1990 Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Multisensor Aircraft Campaign (FEDMAC) are used to validate the Li-Strahler geometric-optical forest canopy reflectance model and to demonstrate that both spectral bidirectional reflectance factors and hemispherical reflectance can be estimated with some success.  With the geometric-optical model, a vegetated surface is treated as an assemblage of partially illuminated tree crowns of ellipsoidal shape, and through geometric-optics and Boolean set theory, the proportion of sunlit and shadowed canopy and background is modeled as a function of view angle.  The model is driven by ground measurements of spectral reflectance and tree crown shape, size, and spacing.  Atmospherically corrected multiangular radiance measurements of the FEDMAC spruce site from the Advanced Solid State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) were found to fit the shape of the modeled reflectance function quite well along the principal and cross-principal planes.  Furthermore, integration of the modeled reflectance functions yielded spectral surface albedos (hemispherical reflectance), which, when extended to the full solar spectrum, were found to agree closely with pyranometer measurements obtained at the spruce site.

DT Article
ID AVHRR DATA; SURFACE; NAVIGATION; COVER
AB The imagery from the AVHRR on board NOAA polar orbiting satellites allows a description of cloud cover, oceanic, and continental surfaces that is used by Meteo-France for nowcasting activities and as input for numerical weather prediction models (NWP). A real-time processing scheme has been designed at the Centre de meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) in Lannion to extract cloud cover and surface parameters from NOAA-11 AVHRR imagery received at CMS. The key step of this scheme is cloud detection. It is based upon threshold tests applied to different combinations of channels. Its main originality is its complete automation by the computation of the 11 mu m infrared threshold from a monthly sea surface temperature (SST) climatology over the oceans and from air temperature (near the surface) forecast by NWP over land. A special test has been implemented to detect cloud edges and subpixel clouds over continental su?faces during daytime. It is applied daily in deferred time only to compute normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This scheme has been used operationally since February 1990, and its quality has been checked. It has enabled the routine production of various products. A nighttime cloud classification is sent to all French forecasters; NDVI values are computed daily and used to map the vegetation cover; and SST and thermal fronts are derived operationally from nighttime imagery.

TI WATER-QUALITY MONITORING IN ESTUARINE WATERS USING THE LANDSAT THEMATIC

LA English
DT Article
ID BAY
AB Due to the impacts of rural and urban development on southwestern Australian estuaries, and the general isolation of these water bodies, there is a need to develop water quality monitoring systems that are both repetitive and cost-effective. The literature suggests that Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has spectral and spatial characteristics that are suited to monitoring small coastal water bodies. This study examined the potential for the satellite-based TM sensor to serve as a regular monitoring tool. Atmospherically corrected TM digital data acquired on four dates over summer 1990/91 and concurrent field measurements collected at the time of the satellite over-pass over the Peel-Harvey Estuarine System (32 degrees 30'S lat. 115 degrees 40'E long.) were used to obtain multitemporal, empirical algorithms for predicting pigment concentration, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and salinity. Highly significant, predictive algorithms were developed for these parameters. It is concluded that Landsat TM has the resolution and accuracy to be a potentially very useful monitoring tool. However, cloud cover and delays in data acquisition seriously diminish its usefulness for monitoring an anything less than a seasonal basis. Laboratory-based radiometric studies also indicated that Landsat TM was unlikely to be useful in determining the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters.

AB High-spectral resolution reflectance data were acquired in the laboratory for four species of Sphagnum (peat moss): S. cuspidatum, S. papillosum, S. fallax, and S. capillifolium. All four species had different spectral reflectance properties. Species differences were noted especially in the visible portion of the spectrum from 0.45 mum to 0.70 mum; some major spectral differences were also noted in the near infrared (0.70-1.3 mum). Samples analyzed had much lower reflectance than typical green vegetation in the midinfrared region of the spectrum from 1.30 mum to 2.40 mum. In addition, Sphagnum had very pronounced water-related absorption features at about 1.00 mum and 1.20 mum, unlike typical green vegetation. Spectral data acquired as samples were dried indicated large spectral increases with increasing dryness, especially in the midinfrared. Simulated Landsat Thematic Mapper 5/4 band ratio data were linearly related to the log of wet weight/dry weight.

ID OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; WATER
AB It is important to develop a remote sensing technique for reliable detection of oil slicks for reasons of both oil exploration and environmental protection. Yet, unambiguous detection has proven an elusive goal. This article presents new thermal infrared spectra of oil slicks made from five different crude oil samples with a wide range of API gravities and compositions. After a brief outgassing phase, all oil slick spectra are quite similar and little affected by thickness, extended exposure to air or sunlight, and even by emulsification with seawater (mousse formation). Thus, oil slicks provide a remarkably unvarying spectral signature as remote sensing targets in the thermal infrared compared to other regions of the spectrum. This spectral signature in the 8-14 mum atmospheric window is flat, with an average reflectance of 4%. Seawater, on the other hand, has a spectrum that varies in reflectance with wavelength in the 8-14 mum window from 0.90 to 3.65%. In addition, we show that sea foam displays a reflectance spectrum quite similar to that of seawater in the 8-14 mum region, because the very high absorption coefficient of water in this wavelength region prevents volume scattering in foam bubbles. This results in a relatively uniform spectral background, against which oil slicks can be detected, based on their different spectral signature. Thus, thermal infrared multispectral remote sensing appears to offer a simple and reliable technique for aircraft or satellite detection of oil slicks.

TI THE MIDINFRARED REFLECTANCE OF MINERAL MIXTURES (7-14-MU-M)
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB There is growing interest in the mid-infrared spectral region (8-14 mum) as both a laboratory and a remote sensing tool in geology, because this portion of the spectrum contains the characteristic, fundamental, molecular vibration bands for silicates and other mineral groups. However, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the spectra of mineral mixtures and those of individual minerals in the mixture in order to completely interpret and predict mineral abundances from infrared data. Results of this study show quantitatively for the first time that the spectra Of particulate mixtures of silicate minerals in this wavelength region combine linearly by volume within a very small error, as long as particles are much larger than the wavelength so that volume scattering is insignificant compared to surface scattering. Results here apply specifically to mineral samples in the 75-250 mum size range. They imply that we can predict the spectral response of a rock if the constituent minerals and their abundances are known. More importantly, our results indicate that the relative quantities of minerals in simple mixtures can be predicted to within 12% in the worst case, and more typically to within 5%. Consequently, geologists should be able to unmix the composite spectra Of rocks to determine mineral abundances. This is important for both laboratory rock identification and remote sensing applications. By better understanding how component mineral spectra mix in the spectrum of a rock, we can also better choose spectral band positions and resolutions in infrared remote sensing for compositional identification.

ID OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SYSTEM; OCEAN
AB The goals of the study were a) to investigate whether the addition of brightness to standard X and Y chromaticity coordinates would reduce confusion between the effects of suspended minerals (SM) and those of chlorophyll (C) and yellow substance (YS) in water quality analyses and b) to explain the V-shaped curve of the XY chromaticity locus for SM in Chilko Lake, British Columbia. To address these issues, 'a theoretical optical model was used to simulate Landsat MSS data, upon which chromaticity analyses were performed. The model was calibrated for Chilko Lake materials, and was tested using water samples taken at the same time as two MSS images of the lake. The study showed that the use of brightness and chromaticity X separated the effect of SM from that of C and YS, but that C and YS could not be separated because their absorption spectra were similar. Thus it may be possible to measure SM and a combined C and YS variable (CYS) simultaneously, but it is not possible to measure all three variables simultaneously using MSS imagery. The study also showed that the V-shaped locus, which is unlike those previously reported, is the natural consequence of a SM gradient as it approaches zero when atmospheric radiance is included in the image signal. The shape of the locus is not unique to Chilko Lake, but probably has not been reported before because most chromaticity studies have not encountered such low SM concentrations. Classified maps for SM and CYS were produced for Chilko Lake. As expected, highest SM concentrations were found at the months of creeks carrying glacial meltwater. Highest CYS concentrations were associated with known sites of high YS or with the western shore and south end of the lake. One interpretation for the latter is that hypolimnial water caused an increase Of nutrients and consequently C in the area, though the suggestion cannot be confirmed.

ID SOIL PROPERTIES; OPTIMAL INTERPOLATION; SAMPLING STRATEGY; VARIOGRAMS;

AB The soil and crop cover of agricultural land vary spatially in a way that is both random and autocorrelated. This enables them to be estimated and mapped from sparse sample data by kriging. These properties (primary variables) are usually related to the radiation they reflect: They are coregionalized with it. In many circumstances the primary variables can be estimated more precisely by measuring, in addition, the radiation sparsely, using a ground-based radiometer and combining the two by cokriging. The coregionalization must be formalized in a coherent set of variograms, one for the primary variable, one for each variable derived from the radiometry, and the cross variograms between all pairs of variables involved in the estimation. Given this set, it is possible to determine estimation variances for any configuration of sampling and to design an optimal scheme that will achieve a desired precision for least effort. The formulae for cokriging are presented, as are the conditions for a coherent model of the coregionalization, and the article shows how these can be used to design sampling schemes that combine survey of the primary variables and radiation to best advantage. Three examples from intensive agriculture in Britain illustrate the technique. In one example where the aim was to estimate and map the cover of clover in pasture, cokriging using measured radiation was nine times as efficient as kriging the cover alone.

TI POLYNOMIAL TREND-SURFACE ANALYSIS APPLIED TO AVHRR IMAGES TO IMPROVE
   DEFINITION OF ARCTIC LEADS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID POLYNYAS
AB Polynomial trend surface analysis was applied to three AVHRR images to determine whether regional trends in image radiance can be removed with this procedure. Results suggest that trend surface techniques can be effective in removing region-scale variation in image radiances that are related to uneven illumination, intermittent cloud cover, and variation in the surface temperature field. The dominant effects of illumination in Channel 2 (visible) data, caused by variable sun angle and proximity of the scene to the terminator, can be minimized by removing (subtracting) the first- and second-order trend surfaces from the raw image. These low-order surfaces also remove regional variation in the surface temperature field, which leads to marginal improvement in binary images derived from Channel 4 (infrared) data. Optimum results for both Channel 2 and Channel 4 data are achieved when the third- and fourth-order surfaces are subtracted to remove local temperature and illumination anomalies that occur at smaller spatial scales, primarily in the vicinity of clouds. Application of higher order surfaces fails to improve image quality. There is some indication that the topography of these higher-order surfaces in part maps regional variation in lead density. Use of a best fit criterion based on a strict variance technique (such as the least-squares method) to define the trend surface limits the effectiveness of the technique in this application. Criteria that allow for data to be weighted based on their distance from the plane about which they cluster are more appropriate to the structure of AVHRR radiance data typical of images that show sea ice. A criterion that incorporates a rule system based on fuzzy logic offers an alternative means of assessing goodness-of-fit that might prove appropriate in this application.

TI PHOTON INTERACTION CROSS-SECTIONS FOR AGGREGATIONS OF FINITE-DIMENSIONAL
   LEAVES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Note
AB The plate turbid medium theory developed by Ross abstracts the leaf canopy as a gaseous mixture of oriented planar nondimensional plates randomly distributed in the configuration space.  This theory fails to explain the hot spot effect that is characteristic of all layered media that contain finite-dimensional scattering centers.  The dimensions of the scatterer was included in a new formalism recently developed by Myneni et al. (1991).  However, the arguments used in the derivation of the cross sections were intuitive and lack a basis in rigorous theory.  In this paper, using the concept of particle distribution functions, the interaction cross sections are derived.

AB The effect of variable tree canopy cover, shadows, and topography on Thematic Mapper (TM) data was examined for blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland and wooded grassland on rugged terrain in central California. Thematic Mapper data were analyzed from September 1986 (trees in leaf, grass understory senescent) and December 1984 (trees leafless, grasses emerging). Tree cover measured in 84 60 m x 60 m field plots was strongly negatively correlated with TM radiances (excluding Band 6) on both dates, and was positively correlated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in September. TM Band 3 was most highly correlated with canopy cover. The Li-Strahler geometric-optical canopy reflectance model was used to predict the projected cover of shadow cast by the trees based on crown and illumination geometry. The spectral model was aggregated to two components; figure (tree plus shadow) and background (understory), and the pixel radiances modeled as a function of the cover of the figure. Simulated shadow cover was high at intermediate cover values, and was nonlinearly related to canopy cover. Modeled figure cover in the sample plots at the time of the satellite overpasses was more highly correlated with TM Band 3 than measured tree cover in both September (regression r2 of 0.76 vs. 0.69) and December (r2 of 0.59 vs. 0.53). Slope illumination explained an additional 11% of the variance in the December data. The remaining unexplained variance probably resulted from spatial variation in understory and canopy reflectances.

TI THE EFFECT OF A RED LEAF PIGMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RED EDGE
   AND CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WHEAT CANOPIES; VEGETATION; SHIFT
AB The point of maximum slope in a reflectance spectrum of vegetation occurs at the boundary between red and near infrared wavelengths and is known as the "red edge."  There is a strong relationship between the red edge and the chlorophyll concentration of leaves and canopies.  The aim of this research was to determine the effect of a second leaf pigment, red amaranthin, on the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration.  The red edge, chlorophyll concentration, and amaranthin concentration were recorded for 163 amaranth leaves in the laboratory.  Experimental treatments with nitrate and salts caused a very concentration (0-20 mg / g), and amaranthin concentration (0-0.47 mg / g).  There was a near-linear relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration for leaves with low amaranthin concentration (< 0.075 mg / g).  This relationship was strongest for leaves from vegetative plants and was similar in form to that observed for a canopy.  By contrast the red edge was at longer wavelengths and independent of chlorophyll concentration for leaves with high amaranthin concentration (> 0.075 mg / g), as a result of the strong absorption of visible light by amaranthin and the resultant movement of the red / near infrared boundary to longer wavelengths at higher amaranthin concentrations.  This is the first reported study on the effect of a second leaf pigment on the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration.  The results suggest that the presence of a second leaf pigment would limit the use of a remotely sensed red edge for the estimation of chlorophyll concentration.

AB Satellite altimetry has been widely used for inland water monitoring and modeling in the present decade. In this paper, the availability, data quality, and quantity of a number of spaceborne radar altimetry missions (including Topex/Poseidon (TP), ERS-2, Envisat, Jason-1/-2/-3, CryoSat-2, Saral, and Sentinel-3) are investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to investigate the influences of onboard trackers, satellite flying directions, and land contamination on Level-1 waveforms and Level-2 measurements over large mountainous lakes. The analyses were conducted over eight Tibetan lakes, which are of varying sizes from ca. 93 to 1046 km2 and are sampled by multiple altimeters. From the results presented in this paper, it is demonstrated that the previous generation of altimeters, such as TP, Jason-1, ERS-2, and Envisat, shows a higher percentage of data unavailability and lower valid observation rates. Investigations of Level-1 waveforms show onboard tracker failing in locking on the lake surface, resulting in data loss or invalid measurements. In addition, the onboard tracking systems are sometimes unstable, resulting in larger along-track standard deviations (SD) (SD > 15 cm). In contrast, the recent generation of altimeters, i.e., Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 with open-loop tracking mode, significantly increases the data availability (> 90% passes and > 60% individual observations) and delivers higher precision measurements (SD around 10 cm). Moreover, the waveform leading edge is very consistent, indicating more stable onboard tracking. Higher quality Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 data allow monitoring of sub-and quasi-monthly lake variations, which are not revealed by e. g., TP and ERS-2 data due to poorer signal-to-noise ratios. Exceptionally, Saral Ka-band altimeter, operated in closed-loop tracking mode, is less affected by flying directions and land contamination (topography and land-scapes), delivering high quality measurements (SD around 7 cm for 40 Hz).This study provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple altimeters in monitoring lakes in mountainous areas, and demonstrates the substantial improvements achieved in the past decades. However, care has to be taken when merging data from old generation altimetry missions over mountainous lakes. The lessons learned from these Tibetan lakes can be taken across to other mountain lakes.

AB Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the leading environmental risk factor for mortality globally. Satellite-derived estimates of surface PM2.5 developed from a combination of satellites, simulations, and ground monitor data are relied upon for health impact studies. The ability to develop satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates requires the continued availability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) sources. This work examines the impact of the addition or loss of satellite AOD data sources on global PM2.5 estimation and the impact of continuing the longterm record with AOD from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-National Polar orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite after the loss of the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. We find that the addition of VIIRS S-NPP AOD products to geophysical PM2.5 estimates from satellites and simulations causes regional differences that correspond to differences in the VIIRS and MODIS Deep Blue AOD algorithms and sampling. Changes in long-term trends and timeseries due to the addition or loss of AOD data sources are generally within their uncertainties. Statistical fusion with ground monitor data partially corrects for changes due to sampling differences when introducing the VIIRS AOD products, but uncertainty remains over desert regions where ground monitor coverage is sparse. This work provides promise for the sustained development of global satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates, despite discontinuities in instruments and retrieval methods.

However, mountain settlements are often omitted from global land cover analyses due to the low spatial resolution of satellite images, which cannot resolve the small scale of mountains settlements. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of deep learning to detect human settlements in mountains at the sub-pixel level, based on Landsat satellite imagery. We hypothesized that adding spatial and temporal features could improve the detection of mountain settlements since spectral information alone led to inaccurate results. For spatial features, we compared a U-shaped neural network (U-Net), a deep learning algorithm that automatically learns spatial features, with a simple random forest (RF) algorithm. Then, we assessed whether temporal features would increase accuracy by comparing two input datasets, multispectral imagery and temporal features from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We evaluated each method by calculating the accuracies of (1) the binary settlement footprint, (2) the subpixel estimates of impervious surfaces, and (3) urban growth. We tested the accuracies using visually interpreted datasets from time-series Google Earth images across the Hindu Kush Himalaya that were not used for training to evaluate model transferability. The U-Net successfully improved mountain settlement mapping compared to the random forest, with a substantial discrepancy in small settlements. The time-series results from the U-Net successfully captured long-term urban growth but fewer short-term changes. Contrary to expectations, the CCDC temporal features reduced the accuracy of mountain settlement mapping due to frequent cloud cover in hilly areas. Our subpixel analysis reveals that the built-up area of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has expanded at a rate of 61 km2 per year from 1990 to 2020, which is about twice the estimate of the Global Human Settlement Layer using binary urban/non-urban classifications.

AB Estimating the three geophysical variables significant wave height (SWH), sea surface height, and wind speed from satellite altimetry continues to be challenging in the coastal zone because the received radar echoes exhibit significant interference from strongly reflective targets such as sandbanks, sheltered bays, ships etc. Fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) processing exhibits a theoretical along-track resolution of up to less than half a metre. This suggests that the application of FF-SAR altimetry might give potential gains over unfocused SAR (UF-SAR) altimetry to resolve and mitigate small-scale interferers in the along-track direction to improve the accuracy and precision of the geophysical estimates.
   The objective of this study is to assess the applicability of FF-SAR-processed Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) coastal altimetry data to obtain SWH estimates as close as possible to the coast.
   We have developed a multi-mission FF-SAR processor and applied the coastal retracking algorithm CORALv2 to estimate SWH. We assess different FF-SAR and UF-SAR processing configurations, as well as the baseline Level-2 product from EUMETSAT, by comparison with the coastal, high-resolution SWAN-Kuststrook wave model from the Deltares RWsOS North Sea operational forecasting system. This includes the evaluation of the correlation, the median offset, and the percentage of cycles with high correlation as a function of distance to the nearest coastline. Moreover, we analyse the number of valid records and the L2 noise of the records. The case study comprises five coastal crossings of S6-MF that are located along the Dutch coast and the German coast along the East Frisian Islands in the North Sea.
   We observe that accurate and precise SWH records can be estimated in the nearshore zone within 1-3 km from the coast using satellite SAR altimetry. We find that the FF-SAR-processed dataset with a Level-1b posting rate of 140 Hz shows the greatest similarity with the wave model. We achieve a correlation of similar to 0.8 at 80% of valid records and a gain in precision of up to 29% of FF-SAR vs UF-SAR for 1-3 km from the coast. FF-SAR shows, for all cycles, a high correlation of greater than or equal to 0.8 for 1-3 km from the coast. We estimate the decay of SWH from offshore at 30 km to up to 1 km from the coast to amount to 26.4% +/- 3.1%.

AB Extreme precipitation can trigger various natural hazards, causing catastrophic losses worldwide. As global warming accelerates, it is widely acknowledged that extreme precipitation will become more frequent and intense, calling for more accurate historical and projected precipitation estimation. Identifying extreme pre-cipitation events is understudied particularly on the global scale, given that most studies only focus on pixel-by -pixel characteristics while ignoring the space-time continuity and evolution of extreme events. This study utilizes an object-based tracking method to track the precipitation system objects in time, extracting spatiotemporal attributes of precipitation events and investigates variable definitions of extremes for a better understanding of the performance of existing precipitation datasets. Five satellite and two reanalysis precipitation products (IMERG, GSMaP, PERSIANN-CCS, TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, ERA5, and ERA-Interim) are involved to investigate (1) the difference and similarity of those datasets in depicting the global pattern of extreme precipitation, (2) the impact of various definitions of extreme events, and (3) the trend of global extreme precipitation events. Results show that the object-based method can capture the motion of precipitation events. Different extreme definitions have a large impact on the distribution, trend, and features of extreme precipitation. The inter-comparison of extreme precipitation events from different products shows low correlation, indicating that accurately capturing the evolution of extreme events is still challenging. Reanalysis product-based analysis shows variable trends (magnitudes and signs) based on different attributes of precipitation objects and notable scale effect. Satellite precipitation products exhibit distinct inter-annual variability which could affect their hydrometeorological applications. In summary, this study leverages the object-based tracking method for comprehensive extreme precipitation analysis from the multi-dataset, multi-scale, and multi-definition perspectives, which can advance the understanding of the status and trend of global extreme precipitation.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long-term leaf area index (LAI) products have significantly contributed to global energy fluxes, climate change, and biogeochemistry research. However, the maximum fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (Max-FPAR) compositing strategy of the Collection 6 (C6) products dictates that the main or backup algorithm is always triggered by observations of different quality, which indirectly causes the observed instability in the LAI time-series. Based on MODIS daily LAI retrievals, this study develops a prior knowledge time-series compositing algorithm (PKA) using a linear kernel driven (LKD) model. Our results show that the newly proposed PKA can significantly improve the LAI composites compared to the Max-FPAR strategy using ground-based observations for validation. We found that the PKA performs better than Max-FPAR in various aspects (different sites, seasons, and retrieval index (RI) ranges), with R2 increasing from 0.69 to 0.76 and root means square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.01 to 0.84 compared to GBOV ground truth. The same improvement was shown for the ground truth LAIs measured at the Honghe and Hailun sites in northeastern China, with R2 increasing from 0.23 to 0.41 and RMSE decreasing from 1.27 to 1.25. In addition, three newly proposed temporal uncertainty metrics (time-series stability, TSS and time -series anomaly, TSA and reconstruction error metric, RE (the proximity to the main RT-based retrievals)) were applied to compare the stability of LAI time-series before and after PKA implementation. We found that the time series stability of PKA LAI was improved, the time series anomalies were reduced, and the retrieval rates of the main algorithm were also greatly enhanced compared to Max-FPAR LAI. A case intercomparison for Max-FPAR-MODIS, Max-FPAR-VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite), and PKA-MODIS LAIs in the Amazon Forest region showed that the PKA is also effective in improving the LAI retrieval over large regions with few qualified observations due to poor atmospheric conditions (RE decreased from 2.37/2.35 (Max-FPAR-MODIS/Max-FPAR-VIIRS) to 2.25 (PKA-MODIS) and RI increased from 61.94%/59.62% to 66.88%). The same improvement was seen in the BELMANIP 2.1 sites for almost all biomes except deciduous broadleaf forest, where the RE decreased from 1.85/2.13 to 1.15 overall. We note that the PKA has the potential to be easily implemented in the oper-ational algorithms of subsequent MODIS and MODIS-like LAI Collections.

AB Irregularly flooded wetlands are found above the mean high water tidal datum and are exposed to tides and saltwater less frequently than daily. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as providing habitat for fish and wildlife, enhancing water quality, ameliorating flooding impacts, supporting coastal food webs, and protecting upslope areas from erosion. Mapping irregularly flooded wetlands is challenging given their expansive coverage and dynamic nature. Furthermore, coastal wetlands are expected to change over the coming century due to sea-level rise and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme storms. Consequently, coastal managers need baseline information on the spatial distribution of wetlands along with efficient and repeatable methods for observing changes. In this study, we used coastal wetlands from existing land use land cover data, best available lidar-derived digital elevation models, and Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate elevation un-certainty to create a probabilistic map of irregularly flooded wetlands along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast (USA). Our approach integrated findings from a review of coastal wetland elevation error in lidar datasets and an analysis of spatial autocorrelations of wetland elevation. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.563, p < 0.0001) when comparing the probability estimated from a digital elevation model and in situ elevation observations. The differences in probability had a mean bias error of-0.04 (i.e., digital elevation model-based probability tends to be slightly lower), a mean absolute error of 0.20, and a root mean square error of 0.26. Beyond this overall validation, we explored error metrics for land cover classes and lidar collection details. To quantify areal coverage of the probabilistic output, we classified the probability values into equal bins using an interval of 0.33. The areal coverage of the lowest probability bin ("unlikely"; probability <= 0.33) was separated into the upper and lower portions of the irregularly flooded wetland zone. Of the coastal wetlands along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast about 38% were classified as unlikely and low with the greatest coverage in south Louisiana and the Ev-erglades and around 33% were classified as unlikely and high with the greatest coverage in the Everglades and Texas. The relative coverage within the highest probability bin ("likely"; probability >0.66) covered around 13%, with the greatest coverage in south Florida, south Louisiana, and Texas. The framework developed in this study can be transferred to other coastal wetland areas and updated to observe changes with sea-level rise.

AB Historical land use strongly influences current landscapes and ecosystems making maps of historical land cover an important reference point. However, the earliest satellite-based land cover maps typically date back to the 1980s only, after 30-m Landsat data became available. Our goal was to develop a methodology to automatically map land cover for large areas using high-resolution panchromatic Corona spy satellite imagery for 1964. Specifically, we a) conducted a comprehensive analysis on the feature selection and parameter setting for largearea classification processes for 2.5-m historical panchromatic Corona imagery for a full suite of land cover classes, b) compared the pixel-based and object-oriented methods of classifying the land cover, and c) examined the benefits of adding a digital elevation model for the pixel-based and object-oriented land cover classifications. We mapped land cover in parts of the Caucasus Mountains (158,000 km2), a study area with great variability in land cover types and illumination conditions. The overall accuracies of our pixel-based and object-oriented land cover maps were 63.0 & PLUSMN; 5.0% and 67.3 & PLUSMN; 4.0%, respectively, showing that object-oriented classifications performed better for Corona satellite data. Incorporating the digital elevation model improved the overall accuracy to 75.3 & PLUSMN; 3.0% and 78.7 & PLUSMN; 2.5%, respectively. The digital elevation model was especially useful for differentiating forest and snow-and-ice from lakes in mountainous areas affected by cast shadows. Our results highlight the feasibility of accurately and automatically classifying land cover for large areas based on Corona spy satellite imagery for the 1960s. Such land cover maps predate the earliest 30-m Landsat land cover classifications by two decades, and those from high-resolution satellite imagery by four decades. As such, we demonstrate here that Corona imagery can make important contributions to global change science.

AB Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl) datasets have been invaluable for esti-mating the oceanic primary production, air-sea heat exchange, and the spatial and seasonal patterns in their variability. However, data gaps, resulting from clouds and other factors, reduce coverage unevenly (to just about 20%) and make it difficult to analyze the temporal variability of Chl and SST on sub-seasonal time scales. Here, we present a MOving Standard deviation Saturation (MOSS) method to enable the analysis of sparse time series (with as little as 10% of the data). We apply the method to identify the dominating (sub-annual) timescales of variability, zd, for SST and Chl in every region. We find that zd values for Chl and SST are not consistent or correlated with each other over large areas, and in general, SST varies on longer timescales than Chl, i.e. zd(SST) >zd(Chl). There is a threefold variability in zd for SST and Chl even within regions that are traditionally considered to be biogeographically homogeneous. The largest zd for Chl is generally found on the equatorial side of the trade wind belts, whereas the smallest zd are found in the tropical Pacific and near coasts, especially where upwelling is common. If the temporal variability in Chl and SST were driven largely by ocean dynamics or advection by the flow, regional patterns of zd for SST and Chl should co-vary. This is seen in coastal upwelling zones, but more broadly, the lack of coherence between zd(Chl) and zd(SST) suggests that biological processes, such as phytoplankton growth and loss, decouple the timescales of Chl variability from those of SST and generate shorter term variability in Chl.

AB The monitoring of flood and wetland dynamics at global scale is hampered by several limitations, including a reduced data availability in tropical areas due to the presence of clouds affecting visible and infrared imagery, or low spatial and/or temporal resolutions affecting passive and active microwave Earth Observation (EO) data. As a consequence, surface water extent estimates and their temporal variations remain challenging especially in equatorial river basins. Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) L-band signals recorded onboard Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission, composed of 8 Low Elevation Orbit (LEO) satellites, provide infor-mation on surface properties at high temporal resolution from 2017 up to now. CYGNSS bistatic observations were analyzed for detecting permanent water and seasonal floodplains over the full coverage of the mission, from 40 degrees S to 40 degrees N. We computed CYGNSS reflectivity associated to the coherent component of the received power, that was gridded at 0.1 degrees spatial resolution with a 7-day time sampling afterwards. Several statistical metrics were derived from CYGNSS reflectivity, including the weighted mean and standard deviation, the median and the 90th percentile (respectively rmean, rstd, rmedian and r90%) in each pixel. These parameters were clustered using the K -means algorithm with an implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure. They were compared to static inundation maps, and to dynamic estimations of surface water extent both at the global and regional scales, using the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and MODIS-based products. The difference between r90% and rmedian shows the best sensitivity to the presence of water. The river streams and lakes are correctly detected, and a strong seasonality is identified in CYGNSS reflectivity over the largest floodplains, with the exception of the Cuvette Centrale of Congo which is covered by dense vegetation. This seasonal reflectivity signal correlates well with inundation maps: Pearson's correlation coefficient between rmedian and surface water extent from both GIEMS and MODIS is over 0.8 in the largest floodplains. The spatial patterns of reflectivity are consistent with static inundation maps: at the time of maximum flooding extent, a spatial correlation coefficient around 0.75 with rmedian is obtained for several basins. We also evaluated the dependence of CYGNSS-derived clusters and reflectivity on the dominant land cover type and on the density of Above Groud Biomass (AGB) in the pixel. On the one hand, misclassifications of flooded pixels were observed over vegetated regions, probably due to uncertainties related to the attenuation by the vegetation in both CYGNSS and reference datasets. On the other hand, flooded pixels with a mean AGB up to similar to 300 Mg/ha were correctly detected with the clustering. High reflectivity values are also observed over rocky soils in arid regions and create false alarms. Finally, strong winds on large lakes cause surface roughness, and lower reflectivity values are observed in this case which weaken the detection of open water. While these constraints are to be taken in account and corrected in a future model, a pan-tropical mapping of surface water extent dynamics using CYGNSS can be envisaged.

AB The Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) instrument onboard the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) can provide wave spectra using its off-nadir beams. Although SWIM shows a reasonable performance for capturing spectral peak, the accuracy of mean wave periods (MWPs) computed directly from the SWIM spectra is not satisfying due to the high noise level of the spectra. SWIM can also provide good-quality simultaneous wind speed (U10) and significant wave height (SWH) like an altimeter. The MWP can also be estimated using a U10-SWH look-up table presented in previous studies. However, the accuracy of this method is also limited as the U10-SWH look-up table is only applicable for wind-sea-dominated conditions. The two MWP retrieval methods are independent of each other, and their error properties are complementary to each other. Therefore, this study further presents a merged MWP retrieval model combining the nadir U10-SWH and the MWP from the off-nadir spectrum of SWIM using a simple artificial neural network. After training against some buoy data, the model reaches unprecedented accuracy for MWP retrievals (RMSEs of similar to 0.36 s for zero up-crossing periods, similar to 0.41 s for mean periods, and similar to 0.60 s for energy periods), demonstrating the usefulness of SWIM in the studies of ocean waves.

AB As an efficient mode of modern agriculture, plastic greenhouse (PG) has significantly increased crop yields, but it is also criticized for changing the agriculture landscape and posing a threat to the environment. Accurate and timely information on PG distribution is essential for the strategic planning of modern agriculture as well as the projection of the environmental impacts. However, PG mapping over a large area has been a long-term challenge. Compared with classifier-based methods, index-based methods have the advantages of fast speed and convenience, which are very suitable for rapid large-scale mapping. The existing PG indices face the diversity of PG types and background environments, and the seasonal variation of PG spectra. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel spectral index using Sentinel-2 images, namely the Advanced Plastic Greenhouse Index (APGI), to map PGs at a large scale. Four typical PG planting regions in the world, including Almeria (Spain), Anamur (Turkey), Weifang (China), and Nantong (China), were selected as study areas. Based on the spectral analysis, some common spectral characteristics of PGs (i.e., high reflectance in NIR wavelengths and strong absorption in red and SWIR2 wavelengths) were observed and used in the APGI for highlighting PG areas. Besides, the coastal aerosol band and the red band were selected as optimal indicators to distinguish PG from other land covers which share similar spectral characteristics with PG. The experimental results indicate that the APGI has obvious advantages in enhancing PG information and suppressing non-PG backgrounds in various scenes compared with the existing indices. The APGI achieved the PG mapping accuracy with an OA of 90.63% 97.50% and an F1 score of 80.56% - 96.20% in all study cases. Furthermore, the APGI also showed its robustness in seasonal variations and different datasets.

AB Accurate atmospheric correction (AC) is a prerequisite for quantitative ocean colour remote sensing and remains a challenge in particular over coastal waters. Commonly AC algorithms are validated by establishing a mean retrieval error from match-up analysis, which compares the satellite-derived surface reflectance with concurrent ground radiometric observations. Pixel-based reflectance uncertainties however, are rarely provided by AC algorithms and those for the operational Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) marine reflectance product are not yet recommended for use. AC retrieval errors and uncertainties directly determine the quality with which ocean colour products can be estimated from the marine surface reflectance. Increasingly there is also the need for reflectance uncertainty products to be used as data assimilation inputs into biogeochemical models.
   This paper describes the development of a new coastal AC algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI that provides pixel based estimation of the inherent model inversion uncertainty and sensor noise propagation. The algorithm is a full-spectral model-based inversion of radiative transfer (RT) simulations in a coupled atmosphere-ocean system using an ensemble of artificial neural networks (ANN) that were initialized differently during the training process, but composed of the same network architecture. The algorithm has been validated against in-situ radiometric observations across a wide range of optical water types, and has been compared with the latest EUMETSAT operational Level 2 processor IPF-OL-2 v7.01.
   In this analysis we found that the ensemble ANN showed improved performance over the operational Level 2 processor with a band-averaged (412-708 nm) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 16% compared to 37% and a four-times lower band-averaged bias of -0.00045 sr(-1).
   In the ensemble inversion process we account for three uncertainty components: (1) the total model variance that describes the variance of the data from the different ANNs, (2) the prediction variance of the mean, which is based on calculations of the RT simulations and (3) the instrument noise variance of the mean by propagating the OLCI spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To study algorithm performance and to quantify the contribution of the different uncertainty components to the total uncertainty, we applied the algorithm to an optically complex full resolution (FR) test scene covering coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The uncertainties associated with the instrument noise variance were found to be two orders of magnitude lower than the uncertainty components of the prediction and total model variances. The overall largest uncertainty component in our uncertainty framework is attributed to the total model inversion error from averaging the responses of the slightly different adapted networks in the ensemble. The algorithm is made publicly available as a Python/C plugin for the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).

AB In recent years, the growing availability of global satellite-derived burned area (BA) products has led to the development of methods and protocols to rigorously estimate their accuracy metrics. These protocols are based on design-based inference and provide unbiased estimators of various dimensions of accuracy. Current procedures consider the spatial and temporal dimension when obtaining the independent reference data used to assess accuracy, commonly based on the Landsat imagery archive as the basic source. The protocol in which the temporal dimension is addressed in the reference data impacts the accuracy metrics. For example, the 8-16-day sampling units usually recommended in Stage 3 BA validation protocols may result in confounding of spatial and temporal classification errors. However, both errors have different implications from a user's perspective, depending on whether the spatial detection or the temporal dating are relevant. While maintaining the fundamentals of current validation protocols, this study presents a new approach based on long temporal reference units (> 48 days) to diminish the influence of temporal reporting (i.e., dating errors) on the spatial accuracy estimates. This methodology is applied to estimate the accuracy of several global BA products for the period 2017-2019, including two European BA products, the FireCCI51 and C3SBA10, and NASA's standard BA product, the MCD64A1 collection 6 (MCD64C6). Global estimates showed similar performance for the three products; BA commission errors ranged from 17.2% +/- 1.1% for C3SBA10 to 19.4% +/- 1.1% for FireCCI51, and BA omission errors ranged from 43.1% +/- 1.9% for FireCCI51 to 49.3% +/- 2.2% for MCD64C6 (+/- values are one standard error). The total burned area was consistently underestimated in all products. These errors are much lower relative to those obtained in recent Stage 3 validation exercises based on short temporal reference units, which estimated global commission and omission errors greater than 40% and 70%, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrates that using long reference units provides a method to address the impact of BA product dating errors on estimates of spatial accuracy metrics, particularly for those products with lower temporal resolution or for areas with greater cloud coverage. Validation methods developed in this study may contribute to improving future protocols adopted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) subgroup.

TI Incorporating interpreter variability into estimation of the total

AB Area estimates of land cover and land cover change are often based on reference class labels determined by analysts interpreting satellite imagery and aerial photography. Different interpreters may assign different reference class labels to the same sample unit. This interpreter variability is typically not accounted for in variance estimators applied to area estimates of land cover. A simple measurement model provides the basis for an estimator of the total variance (V-Total) that takes into account both sampling variance and interpreter variance. This method requires two or more reference class interpretations (i.e., repeated measurements) obtained by analysts, working independently of each other, for the full sample or a random subsample of the full sample. Estimators of the total variance ((V) over cap (Total)) and the variance component attributable to interpreters ((V) over cap (1)) were obtained for the case of two reference class interpretations per repeated sample unit. To evaluate the effect of interpreter variability on variance estimation, we used land cover reference data interpreted by seven analysts who each interpreted the same 300 sample pixels from a region of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. From these data, we estimated the contribution of interpreter variance to the total variance (i.e., (V) over cap/(V) over cap (Total)) and the relative bias of the standard simple random sampling variance estimator ((V) over cap (stand)) as an estimator of V-Total, defined as 100%*((V) over cap (stand) - (V) over cap (Total))/(V) over cap (Total). For each of five land cover classes, we computed (V) over cap (1), (V) over cap (Total), and (V) over cap (stand) using the sample data from each of the 21 possible pairwise combinations of the seven interpreters, and then calculated the mean of (V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total) and the mean of the estimated relative bias of (V) over cap (stand) over these 21 pairs. Based on the mean of (V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total) per class, interpreter variance contributed from 25% (cropland) to 76% (grass/shrub) of the total variance, indicating that interpreter variance was a non-negligible component of the total variance. Typically, the standard variance estimator, (V) over cap (stand), underestimated the total variance with the mean estimated relative bias ranging from 3% (cropland) to 33% (grass/shrub). Classes with greater inconsistency between pairs of interpreters had larger contributions of interpreter variance to the total variance ((V) over cap (1)/(V) over cap (Total)) and larger negative estimated relative bias of (V) over cap (stand). Given that interpreter variance can contribute substantially to the total variance, the repeated measurements approach offers a practical way to incorporate this variability into an estimator of the total variance.

AB Tidal wetlands, the global hotspots of biodiversity and carbon stocks, are currently experiencing widespread modifications in their composition due to human disturbances and changing climate. Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub -continental-or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential input for modeling the processes of energy exchange and balance of the earth's surface. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is considered to be the most efficient way to obtain accurate LST, both regionally and globally. Currently, many LST retrieval algorithms have been developed, including the up-to-date SW-TES (SW: split window; TES: temperature-emissivity separation) method, which is claimed to be able to accurately derive LST without the need for atmospheric information and land surface emissivity (LSE) based on the selected multiple TIR channel configuration. However, this hybrid method is actually not applicable to observations with large viewing angles and was only preliminarily evaluated in Australia. In this study, this method was extended for application to global TIR measurements with different viewing angles. Additionally, the performance of this extended SW-TES method was assessed globally for different seasons by using the MODIS LST product as a reference, and was also validated using in-situ LST measurements from the SURFRAD (SURFace RADiation budget network) sites. The results showed that the LST retrievals using the extended SW-TES method were comparable to the MODIS LST product, with discrepancies of <2.7 K and < 1.8 K for global daytime and nighttime observations, respectively. Validations based on the SURFRAD in-situ LST measurements indicated that the extended method could be used to retrieve LST accurately with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 3.6 K during the daytime and 2.4 K during the nighttime. However, special attention should be paid when applying the extended method to daytime observations on grasslands and shrublands during hot seasons, considering the relatively large discrepancy when using this method compared with that obtained with the MODIS LST product (>4.0 K). Overall, in this study, the SW-TES method was extended, and the performance was comprehensively evaluated at the global scale, which may help in facilitating its potential applications.

AB Perennial commodity crops, such as coffee, often play a large role globally in agricultural markets and supply chains and locally in livelihoods, poverty reduction, and biodiversity. Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical "coffee belt," hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural infor-mation and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences.

AB The accuracy of earthquake catalogs limits the reliability of earthquake hazard assessment and the comprehensive understanding of earthquake mechanisms. Current seismic catalogs are based on the inversion of seismic wave data. The accuracy of their source parameters, which reflect the quantity and layout of seismic stations, and the crustal velocity model used, are often highly uncertain. The open source and popularization of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data offer the potential to provide more accurate source parameters for earthquake catalogs. In this study, we used same-source InSAR data and a consistent processing approach (i.e., the same sampling, inversion algorithm, and processing flow) to obtain the fault slip models and source parameters of 56 earthquakes, covering most of earthquakes observed by the Sentinel-1 since 2014; these were then used to form a unified InSAR earthquake catalog (U-InSAR). We then compiled a second InSAR earthquake catalog (C-InSAR) based on the source parameters of an additional 164 earthquakes inverted using InSAR deformation data from various sources by previous studies, among which 45 earthquakes included additional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. The C-InSAR catalog was used to evaluate the impact of data sources and processing approach on the consistency of InSAR catalogs; we found no significant differences between the U-and C-InSAR catalogs. Secondly, the combined U-and C-InSAR catalogs were compared with seismological catalogs, and showed significantly improved seismic source locations, depths, moment magnitudes, fault strikes, fault dips, and fault rakes. Our results confirm the rationality and feasibility of constructing earthquake catalogs using source parameters from a variety of InSAR data sources and inversion algorithms. We emphasize that InSAR catalogs can provide an important supplement, improvement, and/or correction to seismological catalogs, and can provide important basic data for more refined and reliable research on earthquake mechanisms and hazard assessments. Finally, we set up a preliminary sharing and distribution system for InSAR-based catalogs.

AB Medium resolution satellite-derived fractional cover estimates of bare soil (f(BS)), photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)), and non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) provide a powerful means to study arid ecosystem dynamics. This paper employed remote sensing estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) from five case study sites from Australia's vegetated dunefields to observe (a) vegetation growth response to rainfall 'pulses' and subsequent transition to nonphotosynthetic dormancy or senescence; (b) multiple time scales of antecedent climatic influence on vegetation cover; (c) the susceptibility of dunes to wind-blown sand drift during periods of low cover; and (d) the implications of image resolution choice when ground cover is heterogeneous.
   A spectral unmixing model for Australia's arid zone (termed 'AZN') was first developed by generating endmembers from a dataset of 1405 field surveys; Landsat time series estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) were subject to a Seasonal-Trend decomposition by Loess (STL); Time series components were correlated with rainfall (P) and aridity at various accumulation periods; Fire maps were used to compare the climatic response of unburnt and burnt vegetation; Landform maps were used to isolate dune vegetation cover from the adjacent interdunes; and Landsat estimates of erodible area were compared with Sentinel-2 and WorlView-3 data.
   The new AZN model yielded Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) estimates of 14.5% (f(BS)), 6.5% (f(PV)) and 15.8% (f(NPV)) during cross validation. The AZN model also compared favourably to an existing continental-scale model when evaluated with independent reference data. Rainfall pulse responses of dune vegetation were detected initially as f(PV), and 3-9 months later as a peak in f(NPV). Components of f(PV) responded to P accumulated over 3-9-months (intra-annual), and 12-15-months (trend). The long-term build-up of f(NPV), if left unburnt, was influenced by rainfall patterns over the preceding 45-114 months. Fires reduced both the depth and strength of antecedent rainfall's influence on vegetation, and vegetation was often more sensitive to P than to aridity. Erodibility (total cover <14%) and partial erodibility (cover <35%) were more common at the driest sites but did not universally match aridity levels, due to fires and differing vegetation. The targeting of dune crest regions highlighted their enhanced susceptibility to sand drift (in most cases), and, given their occurrence on relatively narrow ridges (similar to 30 m), the importance of estimating cover at Landsat resolutions or better (e.g. Sentinel-2).

AB The U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (USGS LCMAP) has released a suite of annual land cover and land cover change products for the conterminous United States (CONUS). The accuracy of these products was assessed using an independently collected land cover reference sample dataset produced by analysts interpreting Landsat data, high-resolution aerial photographs, and other ancillary data. The reference sample of nearly 25,000 pixels and the accompanying 33-year time series of annual land cover reference labels allowed for a comprehensive assessment of accuracy of the LCMAP land cover and land cover change products. Overall accuracy (+/- standard error) for the per-pixel assessment across all years for the eight land cover classes was 82.5% (+/- 0.2%). Overall accuracy was consistent year-to-year within a range of 1.5% but varied regionally with lower accuracy in the eastern United States. User's accuracy (UA) and producer's accuracy (PA) for CONUS ranged from the higher accuracies of Water (UA = 96%, PA = 93%) and Tree Cover (UA = 90%, PA = 83%) to the lower accuracies of Wetland (UA = 69%, PA = 74%) and Barren (UA = 43%, PA = 57%). For a binary change/no change classification, UA of change was 13% (+/- 0.5%) and PA was 16% (+/- 0.6%) for CONUS when agreement was defined as a match by the exact year of change. UA and PA improved to 28% and 34% when agreement was defined as the change being detected by the map and reference data within a +/- 2-year window. Change accuracy was higher in the eastern United States compared to the western US. UA was 49% (+/- 0.3) and PA was 54% (+/- 0.3) for the footprint of change (defined as the area experiencing at least one land cover change from 1985 to 2017). For class-specific loss and gain when agreement was defined as an exact year match, UA and PA were generally below 30%, with Tree Cover loss being the most accurately mapped change (UA = 25%, PA = 31%). These accuracy results provide users with information to assess the suitability of LCMAP data and information to guide future research for improving LCMAP products, particularly focusing on the challenges of accurately mapping annual land cover change.

AB As an extension of wave period inversion models based on altimetry data by an artificial neural network approach, a Deep Neural Network approach (DNN) mean wave period model is developed by introducing new parameters as DNN inputs. In addition to conventional altimeter-derived parameters such as significant wave height (SWH) and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) sigma0, the spatial (along-track) SWH gradient and SWH standard deviation (STD) for standard 1-s altimetry data are assumed to be responsible for random wave field dynamics and, thus, for the observed characteristic mean wave period. A comparison with in situ measurements of wave buoys shows higher accuracy of the novel DNN models by using these new parameters. The wave period estimation from DNN model is also consistent with the latest wave reanalysis and indicates less bias when compared to the buoys. The global mean wave steepness distribution from the DNN model shows good agreement with those provided by the wave reanalysis. The sensitivity of input variables sigma0, SWH, SWH gradient, and SWH STD on the results of the DNN model are also investigated. Perspectives on the DNN method for developing universal mission-independent wave period models are discussed. Objectives of the work: The mean wave period is an important parameter for characterizing wave properties and can be retrieved from altimeter observations. Considering random wave field dynamics, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model for mean wave period retrieval by introducing the SWH gradient and standard deviation as the inputs. The mean wave period estimation of the DNN model shows good agreement with the latest wave reanalysis and less bias compared to buoys. In an attempt to make the DNN mean wave period retrieval model universal, a method of applying DNN model cross-altimetry missions is presented.

AB The most prevalent global surface models are derived from space-based technologies. The spatial and temporal coverage of radar and imaging systems have significant advantage over other sensors and platforms. However, these systems are often are challenged in certain environmental conditions to produce accurate elevations as compared to what might achieved with laser altimetry. Radar derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model) elevation accuracy is often less in vegetated regions, as the wavelengths associated with radar mapping missions do not fully penetrate the canopy. Elevation errors are also substantial over dynamic topography. Correction models using airborne lidar reference datasets can be effective for localized studies to improve the DEM but often the data is not readily available or seasonally/temporally irrelevant. This work presents an automated method for correcting digital terrain models derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation products using NASA's newest Earth observing laser altimeter, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 elevations, in concert with Landsat 8 (global imagery), create a model based correction strategy for the SRTM derived elevations using geographically correlated canopy cover and surface slope information. The results are validated at the study site using high-resolution, high fidelity airborne lidar datasets as a reference surface. The application of the correction model on the radar measurements results in nearly 50% improvement in elevation accuracy for this region. Additionally this established proof of concept provides a starting point for further research in how this method, with ICESat-2 data, can be extended to other environmental regions, other radar or image derived elevation products and inform future techniques for similar application at the global scale.

AB Remote sensing-based measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are useful for assessing plant functioning at different spatial and temporal scales. SIF is the most direct measure of photosynthesis and is therefore considered important to advance capacity for the monitoring of gross primary production (GPP) while it has also been suggested that its yield facilitates the early detection of vegetation stress. However, due to the influence of different confounding effects, the apparent SIF signal measured at canopy level differs from the fluorescence emitted at leaf level, which makes its physiological interpretation challenging. One of these effects is the scattering of SIF emitted from leaves on its way through the canopy. The escape fraction (f(esc)) describes the scattering of SIF within the canopy and corresponds to the ratio of apparent SIF at canopy level to SIF at leaf level. In the present study, the fluorescence correction vegetation index (FCVI) was used to determine f(esc) of farred SIF for three structurally different crops (sugar beet, winter wheat, and fruit trees) from a diurnal data set recorded by the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant. This unique data set, for the first time, allowed a joint analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics of structural effects and thus the downscaling of far-red SIF from canopy (SIF760canopy) to leaf level (SIF760leaf). For a homogeneous crop such as winter wheat, it seems to be sufficient to determine f(esc) once a day to reliably scale SIF760 from canopy to leaf level. In contrast, for more complex canopies such as fruit trees, calculating f(esc) for each observation time throughout the day is strongly recommended. The compensation for structural effects, in combination with normalizing SIF(760 )to remove the effect of incoming radiation, further allowed the estimation of SIF emission efficiency (epsilon(SIF)) at leaf level, a parameter directly related to the diurnal variations of plant photosynthetic efficiency.

AB The comprehensive evaluation of model-and satellite-based surface soil temperature (ST) products is a prerequisite for applications of these datasets in hydrology, ecology, and climate change, as well as in passive microwave soil moisture retrieval algorithms. Distinguished from existing regional validations, this study used ground soil temperature observations of approximately 800 stations from 5 sparse and 15 dense networks worldwide to fully assess six model-and satellite-based surface ST products from April 2015 to December 2017. The products consist of five model-based ST from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 Forward Processing (GEOS-5 FP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah, the ERA-Interim and the newly released ERA5 produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and one satellite-based ST retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) by using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The accuracy of these products was comprehensively assessed per availability of ground networks, soil temperature interval, soil moisture interval, land cover, climate zone, and elevation. The results show that the GEOS-5 exhibits the smallest averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 1.84 K among all the surface ST products. All model-based products show a high skill in capturing the temporal trend of ground observations with an averaged correlation coefficient larger than 0.97. The ERA5 surface ST obtains visible improvements compared to its predecessor ERA-Interim by showing smaller ubRMSD and absolute bias values. All model-based surface ST products generally show lower values than ground ST, while their bias tends to be warmer as soil temperature and soil moisture increase except for the highest temperature and moisture conditions. Moreover, unstable performance of most model-based products in shrubland and grassland, tropical, arid and cold climate, and high elevation regions is also demonstrated by larger ubRMSD values. The averaged ubRMSD of the satellite-based LPRM ST is 3.04 K, and more attentions should be paid to the impacts of elevations and underlying surfaces on improving this product. These new findings will be valuable for future refinement of ST datasets, algorithms used to estimate soil moisture from satellite data, and applications in various disciplines.

AB Vegetation optical depth (VOD), as a microwave-based vegetation index for vegetation water and biomass content, is increasingly used to study the impact of global climate and environmental changes on vegetation. Currently, VOD is mainly retrieved from passive microwave data and few studies focused on VOD retrievals from active microwave data. The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) provides long-term C-band backscatter data at Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization. In this study, a new ASCAT INRAE Bordeaux (IB) VOD (hereafter, IB VOD), was developed based on the Water Cloud Model (WCM) coupled with the Ulaby linear model for soil back scattering. The main features of IB VOD are that (i) the ERA5-Land soil moisture (SM) dataset was used as an auxiliary SM dataset in the retrievals, (ii) pixel-based soil model parameters were mapped using Random Forest (RF), and (iii) the vegetation model parameter was calibrated for each day. The IB VOD product was retrieved over Africa during 2015-2019, and its performances were evaluated in space and time by comparing with aboveground biomass (AGB), lidar tree height (TH), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and leaf area index (LAI). Results were inter-compared with three other VOD products at the same frequency. In terms of spatial correlation with AGB (R = 0.92) and TH (R = 0.89), IB VOD outperforms the other VOD products, suggesting IB VOD has a strong ability to capture spatial patterns of AGB and TH. By comparing all VOD products against NDVI, EVI and LAI, we found that the highest temporal correlation with NDVI (EVI, LAI) was obtained with IB VOD over 29.94% (36.65%, 30.19%) of the study region. Considering all three vegetations indices, highest temporal correlation values with IB VOD could be particularly noted for deciduous broadleaf forests, woody savannas and savannas.

AB Accurate monitoring of grassland aboveground fresh biomass (called AGB in the study) and its spatial-temporal dynamics is indispensable for sustainable grassland management. The most common method used in estimating AGB with remotely sensed data is based on the relationship between field AGB measurements and vegetation indices (VIs); however, the existing VIs do not deliver adequate results due to the soil background and spatial, temporal and sampling size variability. In this study, the AGB estimation model with the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) was evaluated in terms of model robustness and spatial and temporal scalability based on comparisons with the widely used ratio vegetation index (RVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The field measurements of AGB of the natural grassland in Inner Mongolia, China, collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products were used for analysis. The results based on training and independent validation data showed the following: (1) The R2 value between AGB and the NDPI was the highest (0.73) among all VIs, followed by soil-line-adjusted VIs, while the R2 values of the RVI and DVI were the lowest; (2) The NDPI-based model had the best robustness for different sampling sizes; (3) The NDPI-based model also had superior spatial and temporal scalability. The results from simulation experiments using the PROSAIL model also support the superiority of the NDPI in estimating AGB. The simulation analysis further reveals that the overall superiority of the NDPI originates from the fact that the NDPI overcomes the adverse impacts of the heterogeneity of the soil background and accounts for changes in the leaf water content that contribute substantially to AGB in grassland. These findings suggest that the NDPI-based AGB estimation model is advantageous for monitoring AGB in large grasslands with significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity.

AB Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be - due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates - insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.

AB A comprehensive in situ dataset of chlorophyll a (Chl a; N = 18,001), net primary production (NPP; N = 165) and net community production (NCP; N = 95), were used to evaluate the performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-A) algorithms for these parameters, in the South Atlantic Ocean, to facilitate the accurate generation of satellite NCP time series. For Chl a, five algorithms were tested using MODISA data, and OC3-CI performed best, which was subsequently used to compute NPP. Of three NPP algorithms tested, a Wavelength Resolved Model (WRM) was the most accurate, and was therefore used to estimate NCP with an empirical relationship between NCP with NPP and sea surface temperature (SST). A perturbation analysis was deployed to quantify the range of uncertainties introduced in satellite NCP from input parameters. The largest reductions in the uncertainty of satellite NCP came from MODIS-A derived NPP using the WRM (40%) and MODIS-A Chl a using OC3-CI (22%).
   The most accurate NCP algorithm, was used to generate a 16 year time series (2002 to 2018) from MODIS-A to assess climate and environmental drivers of NCP across the South Atlantic basin. Positive correlations between wind speed anomalies and NCP anomalies were observed in the central South Atlantic Gyre (SATL), and the Benguela Upwelling (BENG), indicating that autotrophic conditions may be fuelled by local wind-induced nutrient inputs to the mixed layer. Sea Level Height Anomalies (SLHA), used as an indicator of mesoscale eddies, were negatively correlated with NCP anomalies offshore of the BENG upwelling fronts into the SATL, suggesting autotrophic conditions are driven by mesoscale features. The Agulhas bank and Brazil-Malvinas confluence regions also had a strong negative correlation between SLHA and NCP anomalies, similarly indicating that NCP is forced by mesoscale eddy generation in this region. Positive correlations between SST anomalies and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the SATL, indicated the influence of El Nino events on the South Atlantic Ocean, however the plankton community response was less clear.

AB Accurate knowledge of the distribution, breadth and change in agricultural activity is important to food security and the related trade and policy mechanisms. Routine observations afforded by spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) allows for high-fidelity monitoring of agricultural parameters at the field scale. Here we evaluate the approach to be used for generating NASA's upcoming NASA ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission's L-band cropland product using Sentinel-1C-band data. This study uses all ascending Sentinel-1A/B data collected over the conterminous United States in 2017 to compute the coefficient of variation (CV) at 150 m x 150 m resolution and evaluates the overall accuracy (OA) of CV-based crop/non-crop classifications at 100 one-by-one degree tiles. We calculate accuracies using two approaches: (a) using a literature-recommended constant CV threshold of 0.5 (CVthr_0.5) and (b) determining optimal CV thresholds for every tile using Youden's J statistic (YJS), CVthr_YJS. These accuracy comparisons are important for determining (1) the viability of using a computationally inexpensive and straightforward approach for cropland classification over large spatial scales/diverse land covers (i. e., can accuracies >= 80% be routinely achieved?), (2) how closely OA0.5 compares to the performance ceiling (OAYJS). This information will help determine whether approach (a) is appropriate and how much potential room of improvement there could be in modifying it. Results for OA0.5 and OAYJS are 81.5% and 86.8%, respectively. A breakdown by census geographic region, showed that OA0.5 (OAYJS) exceeded 80% (90%) in the South and Midwest, but was only 76.1% (73.5%) in the West. The improvement in OAYJS mainly stems from tiles with >40% crop prevalence having about 10% greater OA values. To better examine the potential of the approach for land cover classification, results of approach (b) were also stratified by crop. Approach (b) accurately detected most non-crop classes as non-crop (>80%), but with low OAYJS values for grasslands/pasture, especially in the West. CV values for crop were distinct from non-crop indicating that the approach is suitable for crop/non-crop classifications. Because results CV values have substantial overlap within crop/non-crop classes, indicating the approach is poorly suited for land cover classifications. We also detected a strong geographic dependence of CVthr_YJS: values ranged from about 0.2 at the coasts and gradually increase to about 0.6 in the Central United States, most often falling close to 0.3 and 0.5.

AB Substantial land surface greening has been observed globally over the last few decades. This greening has been primarily attributed to climate change and CO2 concentrations, but recent research studies have emphasized the large role of human land use in this process, especially agricultural land abandonment (ALA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term gradual greening of agricultural land can aid in mapping abandoned land across Poland. Trend estimation and temporal segmentation were applied to the 1986-2019 annual Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series to detect periods of long-term greening and to assess its relationship with actual information on ALA. The results show that long-term greening is widespread in Poland (covering up to 60% of its territory), regardless of former and current land uses, most of which has stemmed from modifications within stable land use classes (as they cover 91% of Poland). The highest greening rates and intensities were observed due to conversions from agricultural to non-agricultural land use, which strongly suggests land abandonment and the proceeding succession. However, some proportion of managed agricultural land has also experienced high-intensity greening, and a large proportion of abandoned agricultural land is not greening intensively. Thus, setting an exact greening intensity threshold allowing to clearly distinguish the status of land was not possible. This study also presents the consistency of the Landsat annual time series and its good performance for long-term greening detection, indicating that temporal segmentation may better capture ALA patterns than trend estimation

AB Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) are adequate sensors for mapping water bodies from space as they can be used to acquire data of equal quality both day and night and practically regardless of weather conditions. Furthermore, the global coverage of SAR data provides an opportunity to generate global scale flood records that are essential for improving our understanding of flood risks worldwide and of how these risks are changing over time. In this study, we introduce an automatic change-detection based method that allows global-scale flood records to be generated using the readily and freely available ENVISAT-ASAR data collection. It consists of the following three steps: (i) flood image identification; (ii) reference image selection; (iii) floodwater detection. As a test case, this study uses all available ENVISAT-ASAR images from eight different orbital tracks that were acquired over the United Kingdom over the period 2005?2012. Due to a lack of large-scale ground truth data, the evaluation of the results is carried out using different data sources. First, subsets of the flood maps over the Severn River basin are evaluated using a flood extent map that was manually digitized from very high-resolution aerial imagery. According to our results, the overall accuracy of both flood maps? subsets is higher than 85% while the user accuracy of the flood class is above 88%. Next, for the regions and images without available ground truth data, a visual inspection is carried out using simulations generated by the hydraulic model LISFLOOD-FP, as well as LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images obtained with a 30 m spatial resolution. Meanwhile, by comparing the acquisition dates of identified flood SAR images, the LISFLOOD-FP model results and optical data, a good agreement has been found. The experimental results over the United Kingdom indicate that the proposed method has strong potential for the generation of a global flood data record from the ENVISAT-ASAR archive.

AB While the quality and availability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data has dramatically improved in recent years, InSAR analysis and interpretation remain challenging in actively deforming regions with extensive agricultural activities, where vegetation changes and soil moisture variability can degrade data quality or introduce confounding signals. Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015-2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time intervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, interpolation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recovered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to similar to 3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.

AB Following past studies to quantify decadal trends in global carbon monoxide (CO) using satellite observations, we update estimates and find a CO trend in column amounts of about-0.50 % per year between 2002 to 2018, which is a deceleration compared to analyses performed on shorter records that found-1 % per year. Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.

AB To further improve the accuracy of regional crop yield estimation based on data assimilation, a novel EnSRF assimilation algorithm based on a variable time window and four-dimensional extension (VW-4DEnSRF) was proposed. In this research, taking Hengshui City of Hebei Province as the study area and winter wheat as the research crop, based on the WOFOST crop model and the proposed VW-4DEnSRF algorithm, a crop yield assimilation system was successfully constructed after parameter sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration of the crop model. Supported by the field-measured crop yield data and based on the effective validation of the yield assimilation system at a single point scale and in a typical experimental area, the scale optimization of grid size for regional yield estimation was effectively selected. Finally, combining the WOFOST model and inverted remotely sensed LAI, the regional winter wheat yield simulation under the optimal grid size of 500 m was carried out effectively through comparison with the field-measured yield data and official statistical yield data at the county level. Among them, the R-2, adjusted R-2 and RMSE between the simulated yield and ground-measured yield were 0.481, 0.471 and 801.4 kg.ha(-1), respectively. The mean value of the estimated yield of winter wheat in Hengshui City was 6787 kg.ha(-1), and the RMSE and RE between the estimated yield and official yield were 416.7 kg.ha(-1) and 4.56%, respectively. These above results showed that the crop yield assimilation system based on the WOFOST model and proposed VW-4DEnSRF algorithm had good performances at both the single-point level and regional level, which proved that the proposed algorithm was feasible and effective at simulating crop yield over a large area

AB A satellite-derived hysteresis model is presented for estimate heat storage in urban areas. Storage heat flux, one of the dominant terms in the urban surface energy budget (USEB), is largely unknown despite its critical relationship to various urban environmental processes. This study introduces a novel technique for quantifying heat storage by relating multispectral satellite radiances and geophysical properties to ground-truth residual heat storage computed with flux instruments. Gradient-boosted regression trees serve as the method of maximizing the relationship between satellite data and flux measurements. Several flux networks are used to train and validate the model over varying land cover types, which strengthens the robustness of the model. The model performs well under variable weather conditions such as cloudy rainy days. In comparison with other studies, the RMSE and MAE values were found to be lower than some ground-to-ground studies, and is one of few satellite-derived methods that computes direct comparison over a range of different land cover types.

AB Dozens of spatiotemporal fusion methods have been developed to reconstruct vegetation index time-series data with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage for monitoring land surface dynamics. Although several studies comparing the different fusion methods have been conducted, selecting the suitable fusion methods is still challenging, as inevitable influential factors tend to be neglected. To address this problem, this study compared six typical spatiotemporal fusion methods, including the Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), Linear Mixing Growth Model (LMGM), Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation), One Pair Dictionary-Learning method (OPDL), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), based on simulation experiments and theoretical analysis considering three influential factors between sensors: geometric misregistration, radiometric inconsistency, and spatial resolution ratio. The results indicate that Fit-FC achieved the best performance with the strongest tolerance to geometric misregistration when radiometric inconsistency was negligible; thus, it is the first recommended algorithm for blending normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) imagery. Instead, the FSDAF could generate the best results if radiometric inconsistency was non-negligible. These findings could help users determine the method that is appropriate for different remote sensing datasets, and provide guidelines for developers in the future development of novel methods.

AB Over the past four decades, satellite systems and land surface models have been used to estimate global-scale surface soil moisture (SSM). However, in areas such as densely vegetated and irrigated regions, obtaining accurate SSM remains challenging. Before using satellite and model-based SSM estimates over these areas, we should understand the accuracy and error characteristics of various SSM products. Thus, this study aimed to compare the error characteristics of global-scale SSM over vegetated and irrigated areas as obtained from active and passive satellites and model-based data: Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). We employed triple collocation analysis (TCA) and caluclated conventional error metrics from in-situ SSM measurements. We also considered all possible triplets from 6 different products and showed the viability of considering the standard deviation of TCA-based numbers in producing robust results.
   Over forested areas, it was expected that model-based SSM data might provide more accurate SSM estimates than satellites due to the intrinsic limitations of microwave-based systems. Alternately, over irrigated regions, observation-based SSM data were expected to be more accurate than model-based products because land surface models (LSMs) cannot capture irrigation signals caused by human activities. Contrary to these expectations, satellite-based SSM estimates from ASCAT, SMAP, and SMOS showed fewer errors than ERA5 and GLDAS SSM products over vegetated conditions. Furthermore, over irrigated areas, ASCAT, SMOS, and SMAP outperformed other SSM products; however, model-based data from ERA5 and GLDAS outperformed AMSR2. Our results emphasize that, over irrgated areas, considering satellite-based SSM data as alternatives to model-based SSM data sometimes produces misleading results; and considering model-based data as alternatives to satellite-based SSM data in forested areas can also sometimes be misleading. In addition, we discovered that no products showed much degradation in TCA-based errors under different vegetated conditions, while different irrigation conditions impacted both satellite and model-based SSM data sets.
   The present research demonstrates that limitations in satellite and modeled SSM data can be overcome in many areas through the synergistic use of satellite and model-based SSM products, excluding areas where satellite-based data are masked out. In fact, when four satellite and model data sets are used selectively, the probability of obtaining SSM with stronger signal than noise can be close to 100%.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is increasingly needed for studying the functioning of the Earth's surface at local to global scale. Radiative transfer (RT) models that simulate top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance are essential tools to derive accurate LST from thermal infrared (TIR) signals of Earth observation (EO) satellites. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive three-dimensional models that simulate RT in the Earth-atmosphere system. Up to version 5.7.3, the mean absolute error (MAE) of DART atmospheric TIR radiance of six standard atmospheres (USSTD76, TROPICAL, MIDDLATSUM, MIDDLATWIN, SUBARCSUM, SUBARCWIN) over 3.5 mu m 20 mu m was 3.1 K compared to the reference atmospheric RT model MODTRAN, which is much larger than the 1 K accuracy needed by most LST applications. Also, the radiance error reached 2.6 K for some TIR bands whereas the noise equivalent differential temperature (NeDT) of satellite TIR sensor is usually less than 0.4 K. Recently, the DART atmospheric RT modelling was greatly improved by (1) introducing the equivalent absorption cross-section of five most absorbing gases (H2O, CO2, O-3, CH4, N2O), and (2) implementing a double-layer thermal emission method. The MAE of DART atmospheric TIR radiance of six standard atmospheres and actual atmospheres over France and the Mediterranean Sea is now better than 1.0 K. The band radiance error is less than 0.2 K in the EO satellite TIR bands. DART is still accurate if the temperature profiles of standard atmospheres are offset by less than 6 K and if the viewing zenith angle is less than 50 degrees. In short, the improved DART meets the requirements of both LST applications, and present and future TIR EO satellite missions. It is already available to scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

AB Global lake evaporation is a critical component of the terrestrial water cycle. Accurate quantification of lake evaporation dynamics is of high importance for understanding lake energy budgets, land-atmosphere interactions, as well as regional water availability. However, the accurate quantification of lake evaporation has been hindered by the complexity involved with addressing the heat storage of water bodies. In this study, a new model-the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM)-was developed to simulate lake water temperature profiles, which were then used to calculate heat storage changes and evaporation rates. Inputs for the LTEM include the meteorological and bathymetric data, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water surface temperature (WST)-which is the land surface te`mperature (LST) over water. The MODIS WST was leveraged to constrain the hydrodynamic simulations. Model results over 11 lakes around the world show robust performance of LTEM. The long term average temperature biases range from-0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, and the evaporation rate biases range from-0.19 mm/day to 0.28 mm/day. In particular, it is found that LTEM significantly improves the simulation of the seasonality of lake evaporation rates. The validation results suggest that the averaged coefficient of determination (R2) for the evaporation rate is 0.84, which is 0.28 higher than that obtained when the conventional Penman equation (without heat storage) is used. The volumetric evaporation time series was then calculated as a product of the monthly evaporation rate and lake surface area (derived from MODIS near-infrared image classifications). This study provides an end-to-end framework for quantifying volumetric evaporation for the world's lakes and reservoirs. It also provides the capability to investigate the thermal dynamics of lake systems, and thus can benefit the various water resources applications across scales.

AB Satellite remote sensing offers an effective remedy to challenges in ground-based and aerial mapping that have previously impeded quantitative assessments of global seagrass extent. Commercial satellite platforms offer fine spatial resolution, an important consideration in patchy seagrass ecosystems. Currently, no consistent protocol exists for image processing of commercial data, limiting reproducibility and comparison across space and time. Additionally, the radiometric performance of commercial satellite sensors has not been assessed against the dark and variable targets characteristic of coastal waters. This study compared data products derived from two commercial satellites: DigitalGlobe's WorldView-2 and Planet's RapidEye. A single scene from each platform was obtained at St. Joseph Bay in Florida, USA, corresponding to a November 2010 field campaign. A reproducible processing regime was developed to transform imagery from basic products, as delivered from each company, into analysis-ready data usable for various scientific applications. Satellite-derived surface reflectances were compared against field measurements. WorldView-2 imagery exhibited high disagreement in the coastal blue and blue spectral bands, chronically overpredicting. RapidEye exhibited better agreement than WorldView-2, but overpredicted slightly across all spectral bands. A deep convolutional neural network was used to classify imagery into deep water, land, submerged sand, seagrass, and intertidal classes. Classification results were compared to seagrass maps derived from photointerpreted aerial imagery. This study offers the first radiometric assessment of WorldView-2 and RapidEye over a coastal system, revealing inherent calibration issues in shorter wavelengths of WorldView-2. Both platforms demonstrated as much as 97% agreement with aerial estimates, despite differing resolutions. Thus, calibration issues in WorldView-2 did not appear to interfere with classifi-cation accuracy, but could be problematic if estimating biomass. The image processing routine developed here offers a reproducible workflow for WorldView-2 and RapidEye imagery, which was tested in two additional coastal systems. This approach may become platform independent as more sensors become available.

AB Rock glaciers are an important component of the cryosphere and are one of the most visible manifestations of permafrost. While the significance of rock glacier contribution to streamflow remains uncertain, the contribution is likely to be important for certain parts of the world. High-resolution remote sensing data has permitted the creation of rock glacier inventories for large regions. However, due to the spectral similarity between rock glaciers and the surrounding material, the creation of such inventories is typically conducted based on manual interpretation, which is both time consuming and subjective. Here, we present a novel method that combines deep learning (convolutional neural networks or CNNs) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) into one workflow based on freely available Sentinel-2 optical imagery (10 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data, and a digital elevation model (DEM). CNNs identify recurring patterns and textures and produce a prediction raster, or heatmap where each pixel indicates the probability that it belongs to a certain class (i.e. rock glacier) or not. By using OBIA we can segment the datasets and classify objects based on their heatmap value as well as morphological and spatial characteristics. We analysed two distinct catchments, the La Laguna catchment in the Chilean semi-arid Andes and the Poiqu catchment in the central Himalaya. In total, our method mapped 108 of the 120 rock glaciers across both catchments with a mean overestimation of 28%. Individual rock glacier polygons howevercontained false positives that are texturally similar, such as debris-flows, avalanche deposits, or fluvial material causing the user's accuracy to be moderate (63.9-68.9%) even if the producer's accuracy was higher (75.0-75.4%). We repeated our method on very-high-resolution Pleiades satellite imagery and a corresponding DEM (at 2 m resolution) for a subset of the Poiqu catchment to ascertain what difference image resolution makes. We found that working at a higher spatial resolution has little influence on the producer's accuracy (an increase of 1.0%), however the rock glaciers delineated were mapped with a greater user's accuracy (increase by 9.1% to 72.0%). By running all the processing within an object-based environment it was possible to both generate the deep learning heatmap and perform post-processing through image segmentation and object reshaping. Given the difficulties in differentiating rock glaciers using image spectra, deep learning combined with OBIA offers a promising method for automating the process of mapping rock glaciers over regional scales and lead to a reduction in the workload required in creating inventories.

AB The ability to accurately detect and quantify the presence of invasive plants is integral in their management, treatment, and removal. Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPASs) are becoming an important remote sensing tool for mapping invasive plants. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) is highly invasive in North America. This study developed and evaluated a novel method for analysis of multispectral data to map the relative cover of spotted knapweed in a heterogeneous grassland community. The method developed in this work, termed metapixel-based image analysis, segments the image into a grid of metapixels for which grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based statistics can be computed as descriptive features. Using RPAS-acquired multispectral imagery and plant species inventories performed on 1m(2) quadrats, a random forest classifier was trained to predict the qualitative degree of spotted knapweed ground cover within each metapixel. The best mean cross-validation score achieved was 71.3% when describing relative ground cover of spotted knapweed, with an accuracy of 66.0% when applied to an independent validation dataset. Analysis of the performance of metapixel-based image analysis on this study site suggests that feature optimization, including feature subset selection, and the use of GLCM-based texture features is of critical importance for achieving an accurate classification.

TI New insights into SMOS sea surface salinity retrievals in the Arctic

ID WATER; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; MISSION
AB Since 2010, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission monitors the earth emission at L-Band. It provides the longest time series of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from space over the global ocean. However, the SSS retrieval at high latitudes is a challenge because of the low sensitivity L-Band radiometric measurements to SSS in cold waters and to the contamination of SMOS measurements by the vicinity of continents, of sea ice and of Radio Frequency Interferences. In this paper, we assess the quality of weekly SSS fields derived from swath ordered instantaneous SMOS SSS (so called Level 2) distributed by the European Space Agency. These products are filtered according to new criteria. We use the pseudo-dielectric constant retrieved from SMOS brightness temperatures to filter SSS pixels polluted by sea ice. We identify that the dielectric constant model and the sea surface temperature auxiliary parameter used as prior information in the SMOS SSS retrieval induce significant systematic errors at low temperatures. We propose a novel empirical correction to mitigate those sources of errors at high latitudes.
   Comparisons with in-situ measurements ranging from 1 to 11 m depths spotlight huge vertical stratification in fresh regions. This emphasizes the need to consider in-situ salinity as close as possible to the sea surface when validating L-band radiometric SSS which are representative of the first top centimeter.
   SSS Standard deviation of differences (STDD) between weekly SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity significantly decrease after applying the SSS correction, from 1.46 pss to 1.28 pss. The correlation between new SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity reaches 0.94. SMOS estimates better capture SSS variability in the Arctic Ocean in comparison to TOPAZ reanalysis (STDD between TOPAZ and in-situ SSS = 1.86 pss), particularly in river plumes with very large SSS spatial gradients.

AB Winter cover crops such as barley, rye, and wheat help to improve soil structure by increasing porosity, aggregate stability, and organic matter, while reducing the loss of agricultural nutrients and sediments into waterways. The environmental performance of cover crops is affected by choice of species, planting date, planting method, nutrient inputs, temperature, and precipitation. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) oversees an agricultural cost-share program that provides farmers with funding to cover costs associated with planting winter cover crops, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) have partnered with the MDA to develop satellite remote sensing techniques for measuring cover crop performance. The MDA has developed the capacity to digitize field boundaries for all fields enrolled in their cover crop programs (> 26,000 fields per year) to support a remote sensing performance analysis at a statewide scal,e and has requested assistance with the associated imagery processing from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, scripts were developed to process Landsat 5/7/8 and Harmonized Sentinel-2 imagery to measure winter cover crop performance. We calibrated cover crop performance models using linear regression between satellite vegetation indices and USGS / USDA-ARS field sampling data collected on Maryland farms between 2006 and 2012 (1298 samples). Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed significant correlation with the natural logarithm of cover crop biomass (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.56) and with observed percent vegetative ground cover (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.68). The GEE scripts were used to composite seasonal maximum NDVI values for each enrolled cover crop field and calculate performance metrics for the winter and spring seasons of three enrollment years (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2017-18) for four Maryland counties. Results from winter 2017-18 demonstrate that rye and barley fields had higher biomass than wheat fields, and that early planting, along with planting methods that increase seed-soil contact, increased performance. The processing capabilities of GEE will support the MDA in scaling up remote sensing performance analysis statewide, providing information to evaluate the environmental outcomes associated with various agronomic management strategies. The tool can be modified for different seasonal cutoffs, utilize new sensors to capture phenology in winter and spring, and scale to larger regions for use in adaptive management of winter cover crops planted for environmental benefit.

Currently, the p-value is estimated indirectly, such as converted from the spherically averaged silhouette to total area ratio ((STAR) over bar) or canopy transmittance measurements. In this work, we first validate the theoretical considerations of the p concept at the crown level (e.g., its relationship with (STAR) over bar), and then provide the first method to directly estimate photon recollision probability using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data. The proposed geometric method is data-driven and avoids explicit reconstructions of tree structures. The p-value estimated here is the average recollision probability over spatial locations. We showed that the average recollision probability can be interpreted as the local spherical openness on phytoelement (leaf or needle) surfaces, which enabled a simple visibility calculation by avoiding explicit ray tracing. The developed method was tested on synthetic crowns of needle-leaved tree species, for which the reference p-values were known. Results confirmed the validity of the p-(STAR) over bar relationship at the crown level, and showed that p-values can be accurately estimated from TLS point clouds with a relative root measure square error of less than 10%. This study displays the distinct advantage of TLS in delineating detailed tree crown structures and highlights its potential in studies of forest reflectance modeling.

AB Land surface temperature (LST), as an effective indicator measuring urban thermal environment, is significantly influenced by a range of human and natural factors at different scales. However, the scale-dependence of LST influencing factors has not been fully explored, due to relatively discrete scales or single factor used in previous studies. It is a great challenge to explore the approach to prioritizing research scales in view of the influencing factors of LST. Taking the urban group of Xi'an City and Xianyang City in Western China as a case study area, this study proposed a wavelet coherence approach to identifying the prioritizing LST influencing factors and research scales. Based on the sample transects, the results showed that around 1 km could be used as the prioritizing research scale for simultaneously exploring multiple LST influencing factors. And the normalized difference build-up index was the dominant influencing factor with the strongest multi-scale stability. The coherence relationships with LST of the area percentage of blue land, and the mean patch area of blue land represented high spatial heterogeneity, with multi-scale stability in the area of widespread water body. The normalized difference vegetation index should also be highlighted due to the multi-scale stability and stable medium coherence with LST. This study proposed a wavelet coherence approach to exploring spatial heterogeneity and scale-dependence of the relationship between LST and multiple influencing factors.

AB Multi-temporal remote sensing imagery has been regarded as an effective tool to monitor cropland. But optical sensors often miss key stages for crop growth because of clouds, which poses challenges to many studies. The synergistic of SAR and optical data is expected to lift this problem, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. However, due to the different characteristics of optical and SAR sensors, it is difficult to build a relationship between the two with most existing methods, let alone construct the long-time correlations to fill optic observation gaps using SAR data. Inspired by deep learning, this study presents a novel strategy to learn the relationship between optical and SAR time series based on the sequence of contextual information. To be specific, we extended the conventional CNN-RNN to build Multi-CNN-Sequence to Sequence (MCNN-Seq) model, and formulate the correlation between the optic and SAR time series sequences. We verified the MCNN-Seq model and found that the accuracy of the predicted optical image was determined by crop types and phenological stages, both in the spatial and temporal domain, respectively. For several crops, such as onion, winter wheat, corn, and sugar beet, our predictions are fitting well with R2 0.9409, 0.9824,0.9157, and 0.9749, respectively. Compared to CNN and RNN, the simulation accuracy achieved by the MCNN-Seq model is much better in terms of R2 and RMSE. In general, results demonstrate that deep learning models have the potential to synergize SAR and optical data and provide replaceable information when the optical data has a long data gap due to the persistent clouds.

AB Decision-making that impacts sustainability occurs at national and subnational levels, highlighting the need for multi-scale Earth observations (EO) and geospatial data for assessing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EnviroAtlas, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and partners, provides a collection of web-based, interactive maps of environmental and socio-economic data relevant to the SDGs. EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets.

AB Generalized assessments of the accuracy of spectroscopic estimates of ecologically important leaf traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) are still lacking for most ecosystems, and particularly for non-forested and/or seasonally dry tropical vegetation. Here, we tested the ability of using leaf reflectance spectra to estimate LMA and LDMC and classify plant growth forms within the cerrado and campo rupestre seasonally dry non-forest vegetation types of Southeastern Brazil, filling an existing gap in published assessments of leaf optical properties and plant traits in such environments. We measured leaf reflectance spectra from 1648 individual plants comprising grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees, developed partial least squares regression (PLSR) models linking LMA and LDMC to leaf spectra (400-2500 nm), and identified the spectral regions with the greatest discriminatory power among growth forms using Bhattacharyya distances. We accurately predicted leaf functional traits and identified different growth forms. LMA was overall more accurately predicted (RMSE = 8.58%) than LDMC (RMSE = 9.75%). Our model including all sampled plants was not biased towards any particular growth form, but growth-form specific models yielded higher accuracies and showed that leaf traits from woody plants can be more accurately estimated than for grasses and forbs, independently of the trait measured. We observed a large range of LMA values (31.80-620.81 g/m(2)) rarely observed in tropical or temperate forests, and demonstrated that values above 300 g/m(2) could not be accurately estimated. Our results suggest that spectroscopy may have an intrinsic saturation point, and/or that PLSR, the current approach of choice for estimating traits from plant spectra, is not able to model the entire range of LMA values. This finding has very important implications to our ability to use field, airborne, and orbital spectroscopic methods to derive generalizable functional information. We thus highlight the need for increasing spectroscopic sampling and research efforts in drier non-forested environments, where environmental pressures lead to leaf adaptations and allocation strategies that are very different from forested ecosystems. Our findings also confirm that leaf reflectance spectra can provide important information regarding differences in leaf metabolism, structure, and chemical composition. Such information enabled us to accurately discriminate plant growth forms in these environments regardless of lack of variation in leaf economic traits, encouraging further adoption of remote sensing methods by ecologists and allowing a more comprehensive assessment of plant functional diversity.

AB Underground mining activities usually induce large surface displacements thus causing serious safety hazards and potential ecological damage. The capability of conventional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions and city subsidence has been fully demonstrated, but its application to mining subsidence is limited because of the failure caused by localized surface displacements with strong spatial gradients. In this paper, a new method is presented to utilize SAR pixel Offset Tracking (OT) with a single pair of SAR images to resolve three-dimensional (3D) large surface displacements caused by underground coal mining. Coal mining subsidence theory is utilised to analytically separate the vertical and horizontal components. This method is applied to the Daliuta coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, where a dense GPS network is available. Results show the RMS differences of OT derived displacements against GPS in both horizontal and vertical directions are in the sub-centimeter level. In addition, a prediction of mining-induced ground movements is performed with the Support Vector Regression algorithm and RMS differences of 12.4, 13.1 and 14.4 cm are observed compared to GPS, in the vertical, easting and northing directions respectively. The framework demonstrated in this paper is not only able to derive the evolution of the 3D large surface displacements with multi-temporal SAR images in a single-geometry, but also has a potential for short-term predication, which can provide early warnings and promote strategic decision-making for engineering management in the process of coal mining.

AB Suspended particulate matter (SPM) consists both of an organic (OSPM) and an inorganic fraction (ISPM) and the latter can be used as an indicator for coastal influence in the Baltic Sea. The concentration of SPM can be derived from particle scatter if the specific scattering properties of the respective water body are known. In this paper we show that likewise, ISPM can be derived reliably from remotely sensed particle scatter. An empirical algorithm between particle scatter (AC9 data) and ISPM concentration (measured gravimetrically) was derived from in-water measurements. This regional algorithm was then applied to the iop_bpart level 2 product (i.e. the particle scatter measured at 443 nm) derived from OLCI data on Sentinel-A (S3A) using the C2RCC neural network and validated against an independent data set. The standard error of the derived OLCI match-up data was 10%, and was thus within the goal of the mission requirements of Sentinel-3.
   The generated S3 composite images from spring and autumn 2018 show that in the Baltic Sea most of the ISPM falls out rather close to the shore, whereas only a very small proportion of ISPM is carried further off-shore. This is also supported by in situ ISPM transects measured in the coastal zone.
   The ISPM images clearly highlight the areas that are most strongly influenced by terrestrial matter. Differences between the NE Baltic and the SE Baltic proper can be explained by the difference in hydrology and coastal influence as well as bathymetry and wind-wave stirring. The method is of interest for coastal zone management and for assessing the effect of seasonal changes in terrestrial run-off and wind-driven resuspension of sediments. It can also be used to evaluate the effect of climate change which has led to an increase of extreme storm and flooding events that are usually accompanied by increased erosion and run-off from land. Last but not least, turbidity caused by particles influences the light conditions in inner coastal areas and bays, which has a profound effect on pelagic productivity, the maximum growth of macroalgae as well as fish behaviour.

AB Spatio-temporal image fusion methods have become a popular means to produce remotely sensed data sets that have both fine spatial and temporal resolution. Accurate prediction of reflectance change is difficult, especially when the change is caused by both phenological change and land cover class changes. Although several spatio-temporal fusion methods such as the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) directly derive land cover phenological change information (such as endmember change) at different dates, the direct derivation of land cover class change information is challenging. In this paper, an enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF) is proposed. By directly deriving the sub-pixel land cover class fraction change information the proposed method allows accurate prediction even for heterogeneous regions that undergo a land cover class change. In particular, SFSDAF directly derives fine spatial resolution endmember change and class fraction change at the date of the observed image pair and the date of prediction, which can help identify image reflectance change resulting from different sources. SFSDAF predicts a fine resolution image at the time of acquisition of coarse resolution images using only one prior coarse and fine resolution image pair, and accommodates variations in reflectance due to both natural fluctuations in class spectral response (e.g. due to phenology) and land cover class change. The method is illustrated using degraded and real images and compared against three established spatio-temporal methods. The results show that the SFSDAF produced the least blurred images and the most accurate predictions of fine resolution reflectance values, especially for regions of heterogeneous landscape and regions that undergo some land cover class change. Consequently, the SFSDAF has considerable potential in monitoring Earth surface dynamics.

AB Understanding long-term underwater sandbars dynamics is a key element for optimal coastal zone management, but this endeavour is often held back by data availability. In order to increase the spatial and temporal resolution, availability and quality of sandbars observations, this study proposes and evaluates a new approach for automatic extraction of sandbars positions from freely available satellite imagery, using a case study of complex waters located on the Danube Delta coast, Black Sea. Validation of the satellite extracted sandbars locations against 4 in-situ measurements between 2016 and 2018 shows a very good correlation between the two datasets, demonstrating the high accuracy of satellite-derived data in revealing the underwater morphology of the upper shoreface along large areas and with high temporal resolution. The obtained sandbars positions were then integrated into an automatic workflow able to accurately represent the seasonal and multi-annual sandbars dynamics and also to give an insight about the sandbars alongshore behavioural changes. The results are similar to the ones previously suggested by other studies, which empowered different methods. These prove the high potential of the newly proposed algorithm to be used for the automatic extraction of the positions of underwater features in the surf zone on other sites worldwide, after proper tuning of parameters in accordance with local conditions. The main constraints of the proposed approach are represented by the omission of sandbars position that imprint a low signal on the satellite image due to increased water depth (especially for the outer bar), high turbidity (mostly for the inner bar) or any other noise generation situation (sun glint, small wind waves). The main advantages of the described algorithm are related to the simplicity of implementation and adaptability to other areas of interest and other types of satellite data.

AB The Sudanian Savanna (SS) of West Africa is characterized by tropical savannas and woodlands. Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS.

AB The availability of satellite optical information is often hampered by the natural presence of clouds, which can be problematic for many applications. Persistent clouds over agricultural fields can mask key stages of crop growth, leading to unreliable yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery which can potentially overcome this limitation, but given its high and distinct sensitivity to different surface properties, the fusion of SAR and optical data still remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose the use of Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) regression, a machine learning technique that learns automatically the statistical relationships among multisensor time series, to detect vegetated areas over which the synergy between SAR-optical imageries is profitable. For this purpose, we use the Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series over a study area in north west of the Iberian peninsula. Through a physical interpretation of MOGP trained models, we show its ability to provide estimations of LAI even over cloudy periods using the information shared with RVI, which guarantees the solution keeps always tied to real measurements. Results demonstrate the advantage of MOGP especially for long data gaps, where optical-based methods notoriously fail. The leave-one-image-out assessment technique applied to the whole vegetation cover shows MOGP predictions improve standard GP estimations over short-time gaps (R-2 of 74% vs 68%, RMSE of 0.4 vs 0.44 [m(2)m(-2)]) and especially over long-time gaps (R-2 of 33% vs 12%, RMSE of 0.5 vs 1.09 [m(2)m(-2)]). A second assessment is focused on crop-specific regions, clustering pixels fulfilling specific model conditions where the synergy is profitable. Results reveal the MOGP performance is crop type and crop stage dependent. For long time gaps, best R-2 are obtained over maize, ranging from 0.1 (tillering) to 0.36 (development) up to 0.81 (maturity); for moderate time gap, R-2 = 0.93 (maturity) is obtained. Crops such as wheat, oats, rye and barley, can profit from the LAI-RVI synergy, with R-2 varying between 0.4 and 0.6. For beet or potatoes, MOGP provides poorer results, but alternative descriptors to RVI should be tested for these specific crops in the future before discarding synergy real benefits. In conclusion, active-passive sensor fusion with MOGP represents a novel and promising approach to cope with crop monitoring over cloud-dominated areas.

AB Progress towards combatting land degradation as intended by Sustainable Development Goal 15.3.1 will be monitored using three sub-indicators, of which productivity of vegetation is one. This indicator is to be measured using trends in a remotely-sensed vegetation index. The use of vegetation indices is well-established and remotely-sensed data are readily available. However, their uses for monitoring production that is relevant to sustainable livelihoods have received little attention. This review identifies four areas in the currently-proposed monitoring methodology that are in need of further development. The first is the derivation of primary production from vegetation indices, which requires attention to physiological processes such as light-use efficiency and plant respiration. The second concerns the subsequent steps, in which ecological processes transform the net production into production of goods and services, such as crop products. The third is the need for explicit baselines or reference conditions that specify the productivity in the absence of anthropogenic degradation. The fourth, and most difficult, is to distinguish anthropogenic causes of degradation from potentially similar effects of natural environmental processes. Some of these issues are difficult to tackle with remote sensing alone, although several improvements are available, and others are in development. However, the current use of vegetation indices alone to remotely-sense degradation of ecosystem services does not provide an adequate SDG 15.3.1 productivity indicator.

ID VALIDATION
AB Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA was launched in January 2015. Currently, SMAP has an L-band radiometer and a defunct L-band radar with a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna. On July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar malfunctioned and became inoperable. Consequently, the production of high-resolution active-passive soil moisture product got hampered, and only similar to 2.5 months (April 15th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of data remain available. Therefore, during the SMAP post-radar phase, many ways were examined to restart the high-resolution soil moisture product generation of the SMAP mission. One of the feasible approaches was to substitute the SMAP radar with other available SAR data. Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B SAR data was found most suitable for combining with the SMAP radiometer data because of its nearly similar orbit configuration that allows overlapping of their swaths with a minimal time difference, a key feature/requirement for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. The Sentinel interferometric wide swath (IW) mode acquisition also provides the co-polarized and cross-polarized observations required for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. However, some differences do exist between the SMAP and Sentinel SAR data. They are mainly: 1) Sentinel has a C-band SAR whereas SMAP operates at L-band; 2) Sentinel has multiple incidence angles within its swath, and SMAP has one single incidence angle; and 3) Sentinel 1A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) swath width is similar to 250 km as compared to SMAP with 1000 km swath width. On any given day, the narrow swath width of the Sentinel observations significantly reduces the overlap spatial coverage between SMAP and Sentinel as compared to the original SMAP radar and radiometer swath coverage. Hence, the temporal resolution (revisit interval) suffers due to narrow overlapped swath width and degrades from 3 days to 12 days. One advantage of using very high-resolution resolution Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B data in the SMAP active-passive algorithm is the potential of obtaining the disaggregated brightness temperature and thus soil moisture at a much finer spatial resolution of 3 km and 1 km at global extent. The assessment of high-resolution product at 3 km and 1 km using the soil moisture calibration and validations sites shows reasonable accuracy of similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP-Sentinel1 active-passive high-resolution product is now available to the public (new version released in October 2018) through NSIDC (NASA DAAC). The duration of this product is from April 2015 to current date.

AB Winter wheat is a major staple crop and it is critical to monitor winter wheat production using efficient and automated means. This study proposed a novel approach to produce winter wheat maps using statistics as the training targets of supervised classification. Deep neural network architectures were built to link remotely sensed image series to the harvested areas of individual administrative units. After training, the resultant maps were generated using the activations on a middle layer of the deep model. The direct use of statistical data to some extent alleviates the shortage of ground samples in classification tasks and provides an opportunity to utilize a wealth of statistical records to improve land use mapping. The experiments were carried out in Kansas and Northern Texas during 2001-2017. For each study area the goal was to create winter maps that are consistent with USDA county-level statistics of harvested areas. The trained deep models automatically identified the seasonal pattern of winter wheat pixels without using pixel-level reference data. The winter wheat maps were compared with the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) for years when the CDL is available. In Kansas where the winter wheat extent of the CDL has high reported accuracy and agrees well with county statistics, the maps produced from the deep model was evaluated using the CDL as an independent test set. Northern Texas was selected as an example where the winter wheat area of the CDL is very different from official statistics, and the maps by the deep model enabled a map-to-map comparison with the CDL to highlight the areas of discrepancy. Visual representation of the deep model behaviors and recognized patterns show that deep learning is an automated and robust means to handle the variability of winter wheat seasonality without the need of manual feature engineering and intensive ground data collection. Showing the possibility of generating maps solely from regional statistics, the proposed deep learning approach has great potential to fill the historical gaps of conventional sample-based classification and extend applications to areas where only regional statistics are available. The flexible deep network architecture can be fused with various statistical datasets to fully employ existing sources of data and knowledge.

AB Approaches exploiting the complementary information on forest above-ground biomass (AGB) contained in multi-temporal and multi-frequency radar backscatter have hardly been explored in the tropics. Having available a multi-seasonal stack of air- and spaceborne X-, C-, L-, and P-band imagery for forest sites in Lope and Mondah, Gabon, we analyzed the sensitivity of backscatter at different frequencies to AGB under varying environmental imaging conditions, and the performance of an AGB retrieval when combining multi-temporal and multi-frequency backscatter observations. For the tropical forest sites in Gabon, which differ significantly with respect to forest composition and climatic conditions, we find that i) P-band allows for estimating AGB with the highest accuracy, ii) multi-temporal L-band backscatter may achieve accuracies close to what can be achieved with few P-band observations, iii) the use of multi-temporal observations is beneficial/crucial at all frequencies, in particular when the imaging conditions are persistently moist and the sensitivity of individual images to AGB reduced, and iv) combining P- and L-band backscatter allows for improving the AGB retrieval primarily when few P-band observations are complemented by a larger number of L-band observations. While the results of this study reemphasize that P-band is the most suitable frequency for mapping AGB in the tropics, they also advise consideration of the growing archives of spaceborne backscatter observations acquired at higher frequencies when mapping AGB in the tropics.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a leading approach for remote sensing of gross primary productivity (GPP). While SIF has an intrinsic, underlying relationship with canopy light capture and light use efficiency, these physiological relationships are obscured by the fact that satellites observe a small and variable fraction of total emitted canopy SIF. Upon emission, most SIF photons are reabsorbed or scattered within the canopy, preventing their observation remotely. The complexities of the radiative transfer process, which vary across time and space, limit our ability to reliably infer physiological processes from SIF observations. Here, we propose an approach for estimating the fraction of total emitted near-infrared SIF (760 nm) photons that escape the canopy by combining the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), two widely available remote sensing products. Our approach relies on the fact that NIRV is resilient against soil background contamination, allowing us to reliably calculate the bidirectional reflectance factor of vegetation, which in turn conveys information about the escape ratio of SIF photons. Our NIRV-based approach explains variations in the escape ratio with an R-2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 1.48% across a series of simulations where canopy structure, soil brightness, and sun-sensor-canopy geometry are varied. The approach is applicable to conditions of low leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover. We show that correcting for the escape ratio of SIF using NIRV provides robust estimates of total emitted SIF, providing for the possibility of studying physiological variations of fluorescence yield at the global scale.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an electromagnetic signal that can potentially indicate vegetation photosynthetic activity, can be retrieved from ground-based, airborne and satellite measurements. However, due to the scattering and re-absorption effects inside the leaves and canopy, SIF measured at the canopy level is only a small part of the total SIF emission at the photosystem level. Therefore, a downscaling mechanism of SIF from the canopy level to the photosystem level is important for better understanding the relationship between SIF and the vegetation gross primary production (GPP). In this study, firstly, we analyzed the canopy scattering effects using a simple parameterization model based on the spectral invariant theory. The probability for SIF photons to escape from the canopy was found to be related to the anisotropic spectral reflectance, canopy interception of the upward solar radiation, and leaf absorption. An empirical approach based on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm was applied to downscale SIF constrained by the red, red-edge and far-red anisotropic reflectance. The RF was trained using simulations conducted with the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. The performance of the SIF downscaling method was evaluated with SCOPE and Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulations, ground measurements and airborne data. Results show that estimated SIF at the photosystem level matches well with simulated reference data, and the relationship between SIF and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll is improved by SIF downscaling. This finding in combination with other evaluation criteria suggests the downscaling of canopy SIF as an efficient strategy to normalize species dependent effects of canopy structure and varying solar-view geometries. Based on our results for the SIF-APAR relationship, we expect that such normalization approaches can be helpful to improve estimates of photosynthesis using remote sensing measurements of SIF.

AB Detailed characterization of global forest dynamics requires accurate measurements of canopy cover beyond estimating the extent of forested area. Passive-optical remote sensing techniques, despite remarkable success in identifying global hotspots of forest cover loss, cannot fully satisfy observation requirements at the plot or canopy crown level. Critical issues including signal saturation and algorithm uncertainty impose limitations on capturing subtle canopy cover changes using standard products generated from satellite imagery, particularly over largely intact dense tropical forests. Spaceborne lidar remote sensing can fill this gap in contemporary Earth observation networks by providing direct measurements of 3-D canopy structure. Here we analyze global canopy cover distributions using observations from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) onboard of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1). We found ICESat-based cover estimates were sensitive to canopy cover dynamics even over dense forests with cover exceeding 80% and were able to better characterize biome-level gradients and canopy cover distributions than the existing products derived from conventional optical remote sensing. At the footprint level, ICESat-1 produced almost no bias when compared with airborne estimates, and had RMSE values on the order of similar to 20% cover. Improved cover products based on lidar should allow comprehensive analysis of subtle forest structure changes at landscape scales, and provide unique information for biophysical stratification of forests and changes in vertical canopy structure. This is particularly true given the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar recently installed on the International Space Station, which will acquire higher resolution lidar data at greater sampling densities than has been available to date.

TI A double instrumental variable method for geophysical product error
   estimation
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Error estimation; Instrumental variable; Triple collocation
ID SOIL-MOISTURE; PERFORMANCE
AB The global validation of remotely sensed and/or modeled geophysical products is often complicated by a lack of suitable ground observations for comparison. By cross-comparing three independent collocated observations, triple collocation (TC) can solve for geophysical product errors in error-prone systems. However, acquiring three independent products for a geophysical variable of interest can be challenging. Here, a double instrumental variable based algorithm (IVd) is proposed as an extension of the existing single instrumental variable (IVs) approach to estimate product error standard deviation (sigma) and product-truth correlation (R) using only two independent products - an easier requirement to meet in practice. An analytical examination of the IVd method suggests that it is less prone to bias and has reduced sampling errors relative to IVs. Results from an example application of the IVd method to precipitation product error estimation show that IVd-based a and R are good approximations of reference values obtained from TC at the global extent. In addition to their spatial consistency, IVd estimated error metrics also have only marginal (less than 5%) relative biases versus a TC baseline. Consistent with our earlier analytical analysis, these empirical results are shown to be superior to those obtained by IVs. However, several caveats for the IVd approach should be acknowledged. As with TC and IVs, IVd estimates are less robust when the signal-to-noise ratio of geophysical products is very low. Additionally, IVd may be significantly biased when geophysical products have strongly contrasting error auto-correlations.

AB Fractional cover of green vegetation (FCover) is a key variable when observing Arctic vegetation under a changing climate. Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models.
   First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data.
   The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research.
   Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales. Individual UAS sites can serve as focus areas, which provide information at the finest resolution (e.g. individual plants), whereas a sample of several UAS sites can be used to train satellite data and examine vegetation over larger extents.

AB In spite of the recent advances and the current perspectives of satellite radar altimetry to reach the coastline and monitor coastal sea level changes, this space-borne technology remains geocentric by essence. In contrast, the quantity that matters for coastal management and society is relative sea level. That is, the sea level relative to the land, as measured by conventional tide gauges. However, two important issues are associated with the use of tide gauges. First, supplemental information is required to separate vertical land motion from ocean climate signals in tide gauge records, and hence to understand the causes of future coastal sea level changes and their relative importance. This can be provided by space-borne geodetic techniques, for instance installing a permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna at the tide gauge. Second, vertical land motion can show local spatial patterns, which limits the spatial validity of the point-wise information at the GPS station. Using Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and high-precision GPS data, the above-mentioned limitations were addressed in the case study of Brest (France). Our findings show that, over the past decades, Brest and its surroundings are overall stable, in agreement with the geological setting, except for the embankment areas of the commercial and military harbours. The GPS-calibrated InSAR results were then further combined with geocentric satellite radar altimetry data to obtain relative sea level trends along the Brest coastline with an unprecedented high-spatial resolution of 200 m. Our approach is applicable beyond the case study of Brest, especially in coastal areas where tide gauge data are not available, provided satellite data are.

AB Change in lake water storage is an important factor influencing hydrological cycle, regional environment, and climate on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) because of the large number (> 1000 lakes) and huge areas ( > 46,500 km(2)) of lakes. Due to the lack of in situ lake level monitoring for most lakes, and long-term continuous satellite altimetry data for some large lakes, estimates of water storage changes for all lakes throughout the TP over a long time is challenging. We have estimated the lake water storage changes of 315 lakes (each lake is > 10 km(2)) during the period of 1976-2013 through an empirical equation based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data and Landsat images. These lakes are located within endorheic basins and occupied approximately 80% of the total lake surface areas of the TP in 2013 based on the results of this study and Zhang et al. (2014). The results showed that the lake water storage decreased by 23.69 Gt from 1976 to 1990 and increased by 140.8 Gt from 1990 to 2013. Increased water storage was mainly concentrated in the central TP (regions A) and northern TP (region B). The increase in total lake surface area during the period 2000-2013 in region B (1981.6 km(2)) was greater than that in region A (1869.1 km(2)), but the increase in the water storage in the former was half of that in the latter, indicating that lake surface area changes cannot represent the degree of lake water storage change due to differences in the topography and lake size. Although the total variation in the rate of the lake water storage change (7.19 Gt/y) was similar to the rate of increase in the mass (7 +/- 7 Gt/y) estimated from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for the whole region, the spatial distribution of these variations was largely different. During the period 2000-2013, a trend analysis revealed that precipitation was perhaps the primary reason for lake change throughout the TP, while a decreasing evaporation rate only contributed approximately 1.5%, 2.5% and 1.7% to the expansions of the lakes in regions A, C and D respectively. However, based on modern glacier mass balance observation data, we estimated that glacial meltwater may have contributed 22.2%, 39.8%, 50.6% and 100% to the increasing water storage during the period 2000-2013 by rough estimates in regions A, B, C and D, respectively, indicating that glacial meltwater perhaps was a primary contributor to lake expansion in region D, which was located in an extremely cold and dry climate with a broad distribution of glaciers.

TI L-band remote-sensing increases sampled levels of global soil
   moisture-air temperature coupling strength
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

   precipitation index; Heat extremes
ID VALIDATION
AB Due to their shallow penetration of the soil column, remote-sensing (RS) soil moisture retrievals are often considered ill-suited for measuring the strength of soil moisture-air temperature coupling. Consequently, soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates, C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at p = 0.05 [-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However, 2010-2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case. Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015-2018 soil moisture products from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled correlations than SPI over global hot spot regions (significant at p = 0.05 [-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify land atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling.

AB Native grassland in North America is considered one of the most imperiled and altered ecosystems. Unfortunately, an assessment of how much native grassland remains in North America is difficult because all nation-wide landcover mapping products do not reliably distinguish native grasslands from grasslands that have been deliberately planted with tame grasses and forbs (i.e., tame grasslands). We established a 218.5 km(2) study area in southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada to evaluate the use of high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for classification of native (i.e., fields with native-dominant species mixes or fields that were formerly native species dominated but have been invaded by exotic species) and tame grasslands (i.e., grasslands dominated by exotic grass and forb species), and compared these classifications to the best-available landcover mapping product that is currently available for this area. We used the presence of tractor furrows, identified from the LiDAR digital terrain hillshade product, in tame-dominated grasslands to distinguish them from native dominated grasslands that had an absence of tractor furrows. The LiDAR method achieved substantially better classification success (Cohen's Kappa = 0.57) at distinguishing native-dominated (N = 82) from tame-dominated grasslands (N = 45), than the currently available landcover product (Cohen's Kappa = 0.13) over our 218.5 km(2) study area. Misclassification by LiDAR of fields that had been planted with tame grasses and forbs, but were starting to be re-established by native plants appeared to be one weakness of the method in the study area. Our research highlights a novel and time-efficient method for classifying LiDAR imagery using easily available image analysis features in ArcGIS.

AB In the past, studies have successfully identified climatic controls on the temporal variability of the land surface phenology (LSP). Yet we lack a deeper understanding of the spatial variability observed in LSP within a land cover type and the factors that control it. Here we make use of a high resolution LiDAR based dataset to study the effect of subpixel forest stand characteristics on the spatial variability of LSP metrics based on MODIS NDVI. Multiple linear regression techniques (MLR) were applied on forest stand information and topography derived from LiDAR as well as land cover information (i.e. CORINE and proprietary habitat maps for the year 2012) to predict average LSP metrics of the mountainous Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Six different LSP metrics, i.e. start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), NDVI integrated over the growing season (NDVIsum), maximum NDVI value (NDVImax) and day of maximum NDVI (maxDOY) were modelled in this study. It was found that irrespective of the land cover, the mean SOS, LOS and NDVIsum were largely driven by elevation. However, inclusion of detailed forest stand information improved the models considerably. The EOS however was more complex to model, and the subpixel percentage of broadleaf forests and the slope of the terrain were found to be more strongly linked to EOS. The explained variance of the NDVImax improved from 0.45 to 0.71 when additionally considering land cover information, which further improved to 0.84 when including LiDAR based subpixelforest stand characteristics. Since completely homogenous pixels are rare in nature, our results suggest that incorporation of subpixel forest stand information along with land cover type leads to an improved performance of topography based LSP models. The novelty of this study lies in the use of topography, land cover and subpixel vegetation characteristics derived from LiDAR in a stepwise manner with increasing level of complexity, which demonstrates the importance of forest stand information on LSP at the pixel level.

AB The inversion of soil moisture from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) closure phases is intrinsically plagued by ambiguities that affect the moisture order. This work shows a characterization of the ambiguities and a way to solve for them with the help of interferometric coherence. This allows to properly constrain the inversion and to retrieve the moisture signal. A data set of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 L-band images is used as an example of successful inversion at the scene level, with sub-kilometer resolution. The results are validated with soil moisture products based on ASCAT and show a high degree of correlation. The raw moisture derived by the algorithm could be immediately used to correct SAR interferometric phases; however, for applications that need absolute moisture levels, a calibration step is likely necessary. Unexpectedly, a good performance was observed over forested areas, which suggests a sensitivity of closure phases to tree moisture; at the same time, over pastures and agricultural fields the closure phase signal was found relatively weak. Additional research is needed to evaluate the applicability of the same measurements principle to shorter wavelengths and exploitation of potential synergies with backscatter and polarimetric information.

AB The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have provided nearly two decades of global fire data. Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002-2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.

AB Geobotanical remote sensing (GbRS) in the strict sense is an indirect approach to obtain geological information in heavily vegetated areas for mineral prospecting and geological mapping. Using ultra- and hyperspectral technologies, the goals of this research comprise the definition and mapping of Neotropical tree species that are associated with geological facies (here called geo-environments) as well as their spectral discrimination at leaf and crown scales. This work also aims to investigate the possible relationship between leaf and crown spectral and chemical properties. The study was developed at the Mogi-Guacu Ecological Station, in the Cerrado domain, southeastern Brazil. Data from 70 sample units, such as sediment texture and species from inventories, were first analyzed through vectorial quantization using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Principal Component Analysis and Spearman's ranked correlation coefficients were used to define geo-environments and target-species, respectively. Biochemical and visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) point spectral data (350-2500 nm) were collected from the leaves of the target-species, during both rainy and dry seasons. Spectral data from target-species crowns were obtained from hyperspectral images (530-2.532 nm, ProSpecTIR-VS sensor) with 1 m spatial resolution, and acquired in the beginning of the dry season. These spectra were classified using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) with two endmembers (EMs). Based on the MESMA results with two EMs, the best dataset per target-species was chosen for pixel-based image unmixing with three EMs (target-species, other vegetation types and shade). From 121 species sampled in the field, two proved to be associated with floodplains (Alluvial Deposits sequence), two with hills and plateaus of the Aquidauna Formation (Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, Parana Basin), and two more with a specific facies of the Aquidauna Formation that has a distinctive presence of coarse and very coarse sand. Five target-species were well discriminated at the leaf scale, reaching 90.0% and 85.0% of global accuracies in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively. Accurate spectral discrimination appears to be linked to the considerable biochemical variability of their leaves in both seasons. Three species were discriminated at the crown scale, with 70.6% of global accuracy. When eight other landscape scale vegetation classes were included in the analyses, only Qualea grandiflora Mart. produced a satisfactory accuracy (61.1% and 100% of producer and user's accuracies, respectively). The spatial distribution of its fraction in the unmixed image, particularly, matches with the geological facies to which it was associated in the field. Ecological requirements for successfully mapping indicator species include broad and random distribution of the target-species' population, and singular physiological, phenological (and spectral) behavior at the imagery acquisition date. Our study shows that, even in tropical conditions, it is possible to use plant species mapping to support geological delineation, where rock exposures are typically rare.

AB Detailed mapping and regular monitoring of tropical rainforests is important for conservation and management of highly fragmented tropical rainforest habitats and biodiversity. Several studies have observed that it is highly challenging to map different vegetation types in tropical rainforests due to large environmental heterogeneity, high topographical variability and near constant cloud cover. In the present study, we assessed the capability of optical multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived NDVI and textures, and SAR Sentinel-1 bands and their textures to discriminate different vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using maximum likelihood and random forest classification. We also compared the results of our classification with previous such maps of the study area. Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of habitat fragmentation by using derived landscape metrics. Our classification had high accuracy ( > 75%), especially compared to previous classification efforts. Our results emphasise the significance of using vegetation indices and textures for vegetation type classification in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, the results suggest that rainforest habitats and other agro-ecosystems, suitable as habitats for numerous plant and animal species, are highly fragmented and require top conservation priority. High spectral and spatial resolution, continuity, affordability and access makes Sentinel-2 one of the best options for regular monitoring of tropical rainforests.

AB Vegetation phenology is widely acknowledged to be a sensitive indicator of the response of ecosystems to climate change, and phonological shifts have been shown to exert substantial impacts on ecosystem function, biodiversity, and carbon budgets at multiple scales. Therefore, long-term records of the phenology of the vegetated land surface are critical in exploring the biological response to environmental change at regional to global scales. Land surface phenology (LSP) from satellite observations has been extensively used to monitor the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the face of a changing climate. Here we introduce and describe the global land surface phonology (GLSP) product derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m. This new product will provide continuity for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GLSP product that has been produced on an operational basis since 2001. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm uses daily VIIRS Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data as the primary input to calculate the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) at each 500 m pixel. The temporal EVI2 trajectory is modeled using a hybrid piecewise logistic function to track the seasonal vegetation development, detect phenological transition dates, calculate the magnitude of vegetation greenness development, and characterize the confidence of phonology detections. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm has been implemented across the contiguous United States, and the resulting phenological metrics have been evaluated through comparisons with species-specific field phenological observations, Landsat phenology retrievals, and the MODIS phenology detections. The results demonstrate that the VIIRS GLSP metrics are of high quality and are in a good agreement with the other independent satellite and field observations. The results also indicate that the uncertainty in the VIIRS GLSP retrievals is primarily associated with missing high quality observations in VIIRS EVI2 time series.

AB Spatially and temporally accurate information on crop areas is a prerequisite for monitoring the multiannual dynamics of crop production. Satellite images have proven their high potential for mapping crop areas at large scales, even at the crop-species level, when a classifier is calibrated on the same image with reference data corresponding to the same period. For operational monitoring purposes, however, it is critical to develop generalized classification methodologies applicable to large scales and different years. Generalized classifiers were presented in this study as follows: a) simple cross-year calibration and application (M1); b) multiyear calibrations (M2); and c) map updating through change detection with multiyear calibrations (M3). These three methods were developed in a classical frame of object-based classifications for a time series of Landsat images with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Therein, we tested these methods for sugarcane classification in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as sugarcane is an economically important crop that has developed substantially in the past decades. Eight years of sugarcane reference maps were used to calibrate and validate the classifiers at four different sites. The cross-year application of M1 provided a low average accuracy Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.84, while it was, on average, 0.94 for the classical same-year calibration. When the classifier was trained on a multiyear dataset (M2), the accuracies achieved average values of 0.91 in independent years. The map updating method M3 showed promising results but was not able to reach the accuracy of visual interpretation methods for detecting annual sugarcane land use change. The multiyear classifier M2 was applied to four contrasting sites and provided reliable results for new sites and years for sugarcane classification. Calibration of the machine learning algorithm on a multiyear dataset of standardized and gap-filled satellite images and reference data proved to give an accurate and space-time generalized classifier, reducing the time, cost and resources for mapping sugarcane areas at large scales.

AB The Sentinel-2 optical satellites provide a global coverage of land surfaces with a 5-day revisit time at the Equator. We investigate the ability of these freely available optical images to detect precursory motions before rapid landslides. A 9-month time-series of displacement is derived from Sentinel-2 data over a major landslide in the French Alps, which exhibited a sudden reactivation in June 2016. This analysis reveals a 7-month period of low activity (<= 1 m), followed by a sudden acceleration of 3.2 +/- 1.2 m in 3 days, before the failure of a mass of about 2 to 3.6 10(6) m(3). The location of this precursory motion is consistent with that of the slow motions occurring since 2001 (about 1 m/year), as revealed by aerial photographs and LiDAR analysis. This change in activity over a very short period of time (days) emphasizes the value of the frequent revisit time of Sentinel-2, despite its medium resolution of 10 m. We finally simulate the ability of Sentinel-2 for detecting these precursory patterns before a rapid landslide occurs, based on typical Voight's laws for creeping materials, characterized by a power law exponent a. Based on this analysis and on global cloud cover maps, we compute the probability to detect pre-failure motions of landslides using the Sentinel-2 constellation. This probability is highly heterogeneous at the global scale, affected by the revisit time of the satellite and the cloud cover. However the main factors controlling this detection ability are the properties of the landslide itself (its size and the alpha parameter), with almost 100% of detection probability for alpha = 1.3 and 0% for alpha = 1.8. Despite all these limitations, probability to detect a motion before a landslide failure often reaches 50% for classical landslide parameters. These results open new perspectives for the early warning of large landslide motion from global and open source remote sensing data.

AB The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) provides global coverage 10 m to 60 m optical wavelength data in fixed geolocated tiles. Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantifies the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 x 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation > 0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in different orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution.

AB Salinity observing satellites have the potential to monitor river fresh-water plumes mesoscale spatio-temporal variations better than any other observing system. In the case of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission, this capacity was hampered due to the contamination of SMOS data processing by strong land sea emissivity contrasts. Kolodziejczyk et al. (2016) (hereafter K2016) developed a methodology to mitigate SMOS systematic errors in the vicinity of continents, that greatly improved the quality of the SMOS Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Here, we find that SSS variability, however, often remained underestimated, such as near major river mouths. We revise the K2016 methodology with: a) a less stringent filtering of measurements in regions with high SSS natural variability (inferred from SMOS measurements) and b) a correction for seasonally-varying latitudinal systematic errors. With this new mitigation, SMOS SSS becomes more consistent with the independent SMAP SSS close to land, for instance capturing consistent spatio-temporal variations of low salinity waters in the Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mexico. The standard deviation of the differences between SMOS and SMAP weekly SSS is < 0.3 pss in most of the open ocean. The standard deviation of the differences between 18 day SMOS SSS and 100-km averaged ship SSS is 0.20 pss (0.24 pss before correction) in the open ocean. Even if this standard deviation of the differences increases closer to land, the larger SSS variability yields a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio, with r(2) between SMOS and SMAP SSS larger than 0.8. The correction also reduces systematic biases associated with man-made Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI), although SMOS SSS remains more impacted by RFI than SMAP SSS. This newly-processed dataset will allow the analysis of SSS variability over a larger than 8 years period in regions previously heavily influenced by land-sea contamination, such as the Bay of Bengal or the Gulf of Mexico.

TI A new downscaling-integration framework for high-resolution monthly
   precipitation estimates: Combining rain gauge observations,
   satellite-derived precipitation data and geographical ancillary data

AB Deriving high quality precipitation estimates at high spatial resolution is of prime importance for many hydrological, meteorological, and environmental investigations. Rain gauge observations and satellite-derived precipitation data are two main sources of precipitation estimates. Gauge observations are accurate and reliable, but are heavily point-based and sparse in areas of rugged or complex terrains. Satellite-derived precipitation products can cover large areas, but they are generally characterized by inherent bias. To optimize the use of both datasets, we propose in this paper, a downscaling-integration framework to generate high quality monthly precipitation datasets at 1 km spatial resolution by merging rain gauge observations and TRMM 3B43 products. Firstly, an area-to-point kriging (ATPK) approach is used to downscale the original TRMM product to 1 km, so as to ensure a fair comparison with rain gauge data. Then, the downscaled TRMM precipitation datasets are integrated with the gauge observations using geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK). The geographical factors (i.e. longitude, latitude and elevation) are also used as auxiliary variables in the GWRK model. Applying this approach to an experiment conducted at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China from 2001 to 2014 shows that: (1) the downscaled monthly TRMM precipitation data by ATPK are more accurate than the original TRMM estimates; (2) the GWRK model employing the downscaled TRMM precipitation data and geographical factors provides better monthly precipitation estimates than the conventional ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation and the commonly used merging methods (i.e. geographical difference analysis, GDA and kriging with extemal drift, KED); (3) the GWRK method reduces the influence of the inaccuracy (bias) of satellite-derived precipitation data on the precipitation estimates compared to GDA. The approach presented in this study has provided an efficient alternative for solving the scale mismatch problem between point-based gauge data and low resolution satellite data, and producing improved precipitation data at high spatial resolution.

AB The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from structure-from-motion (SFM) multi-view stereo (MVS) 3D reconstruction is commonly computed for a single realization of model elevations. This approach may be adequate to estimate an overall measure of systematic error; however, it cannot provide a good estimation of measurement precision. Knowing measurement precision is crucial for measuring elevation surface changes observed by DEM comparisons. In this paper, we illustrate an approach to characterize spatial variation in the precision for SFM-MVS derived DEMs. We use a snow-covered surface of an active rock glacier located in the southern French Alps as the case study. A spatially varying precision estimate is calculated from repeated close range aerial surveys for a single acquisition period by calculating the standard deviation per grid cell between the DEMs created for each flight repetition. Regression analysis using a generalized additive model (GAM) is performed to model the estimated precision and provide insights regarding how sensor, survey design and field site conditions may spatially influence the measurement precision. Additionally, we define how DEM error can be described differently depending on the available validation data. In our study image height above ground level and distance to ground control points had the greatest explanatory power for spatial variation in DEM precision. Image overlap, mean reprojection error and saturation were also useful for explaining spatially varying measurement precision of the DEMs. Field site characteristics, such as slope angle and shading, had the least importance in our model of precision. From a practical point of view, regression-modeled relationships between precision and image and site characteristics can be utilized to design future surveys with similar sensing platforms and site conditions for improved DEM precision.

AB Understanding rapid global change requires land cover maps with broad spatial extent, but also fine spatial and temporal resolution. Developing such maps presents a unique challenge, as variability in relationships between spectral characteristics (i.e., predictors) and a response variable is likely to increase with the size of the region across which a model is built and applied. Although most mapping approaches apply the same predictor-response relationships globally across the entire modeling region, learned relationships from one local area may be invalid for another when predicting across broad extents. Here, we adapted a spatial ensemble approach borrowed from species distribution modeling to land cover mapping, and evaluated whether the approach could faithfully represent spatial variation in relationships between land cover and spectral data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) uses an ensemble of regression trees defined within spatially overlapping support sets, producing a broad-extent map that reflects variability at the spatial scale of each constituent support set. As test cases for reference maps, we used 30-m-resolution forest canopy and impervious surface cover layers from the 2001 U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. When testing strategies for support set size and sampling intensity, we found that predictor-response relationships were strongest when individual components of the spatial ensemble were small and when sampling intensity was high. Compared to aspatial bagged decision tree and random forest models, we found that the STEM approach successfully captured variation in our source maps, both globally and at scales smaller than the modeling region. Leveraging the spatial structure of a STEM, we also mapped per-pixel spatial variation in prediction confidence and the importance of different predictor variables. After testing appropriate spatial ensemble and sampling strategies, we extended the predictor-response relationships gleaned from the 2001 source maps into a yearly time series based on temporally-smoothed spectral data from the LandTrendr algorithm. The end products were yearly forest canopy and impervious surface cover time series representing 1990-2012. Formal evaluation showed that our temporally extended maps also closely resembled NLCD maps from 2011. The aim of this research was to cultivate the implicit relationships between spectral data and a given map, not improve them, but as the need for time series maps produced at both broad extents and fine resolutions increases, our results demonstrate that an ensemble of locally defined estimators is potentially more appropriate than conventional ensemble models for land cover mapping across broad extents.

AB Declining near-infrared (NIR) surface reflectance between early and late summer, here termed greendown, is a common, yet poorly understood phenomena in remote sensing time series of temperate deciduous forests. As revealed by phenology analysis of Landsat satellite data, there are strong spatial patterns in the rate of green down across temperate deciduous forest landscapes, and analyzing these patterns could help advance our understanding of surface reflectance drivers. Within an oak-hickory (Quercus spp. - Carya spp.) forest landscape in western Maryland, USA, we tested how spatial patterns in greendown related to potential drivers at the landscape-, tree crown- and leaf-levels. We found that 50% of the spatial variability in greendown was explained by landscape variables, with greendown particularly higher in locations with higher maximum greenness, more southerly aspects, or locations with greater abundance of white oak (Quercus alba). The importance of species composition as a driver of greendown was supported at the tree crown level, where, relative to three other tree species, white oak exhibited the most consistent trend toward more vertical leaf angles later in the season. At the leaf level, NIR reflectance decreased in productive sites where %N increased, and delta C-13 decreased, through the season. However, among all sites, there were no consistent seasonal trends in foliar NIR reflectance, and we found no correlation among leaf-level NIR reflectance and satellite-observed greendown. Collectively, these results suggest that the spatial variability of greendown in this oak-hickory forest is most strongly controlled by an interaction of topographic and species compositional drivers operating at the landscape and tree crown levels. We found spatial analysis of greendown to be a useful approach to explore landscape-, tree crown-, and leaf-level controls on surface reflectance, and thereby help translate land surface phenology data into predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.

AB Volcanic ash clouds can present an aviation hazard over distances of thousands of kilometres and, to help to mitigate this hazard, advanced numerical models are used to forecast ash dispersion in the atmosphere. However, forecast accuracy is usually limited by uncertainties in initial conditions such as the eruption rate and the vertical distribution of ash injected above the volcano. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the Telematics Earth Observation Mission (TOM) picosatellite formation, due for launch in 2020, to provide valuable information for constraining ash cloud dispersion models through simultaneous image acquisition from three satellites. TOM will carry commercial frame cameras. Using photogrammetric simulations, we show that such data should enable ash cloud heights to be determined with a precision (similar to 30-140 m depending on configuration) comparable to the vertical resolution of lidar observations (30-180 m depending on the cloud height). To support these estimates, we processed photographs taken from the International Space Station of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption, as a proxy for TOM imagery. Structure-from-motion photogrammetric software successfully reconstructed the 3-D form of the ascending ash cloud, as well as surrounding cloud layers. Direct estimates of the precision of the ash cloud height measurements, as well as comparisons between independently processed image sets, indicate that a vertical measurement precision of similar to 200 m was achieved. Image sets acquired at different times captured the plume dynamics and enabled a mean ascent velocity of 14 m s(-1) to be estimated for regions above 7 km. In contrast, the uppermost regions of the column (at a measured cloud top height of similar to 11 km) were not ascending significantly, enabling us to constrain a 1-D plume ascent model, from which estimates for the vent size (50 m) and eruption mass flux (2.6 x 10(6) kg s(-1)) could be made. Thus, we demonstrate that nanosatellite imagery has the potential for substantially reducing uncertainties in ash dispersion models by providing valuable information on eruptive conditions.

AB As two kinds of basic units of cities, land-cover objects and functional zones play different but totally important roles in urban mapping and studies. Recent several years have witnessed significant improvement in their classification methods, e.g. geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA). However, these methods focus mainly on bottom-up classifications from visual features to semantic categories but they ignore top-down feedbacks which are capable of optimizing classification results. To resolve the issue, this study presents an iterative method which integrates bottom-up and top-down processes for land-cover and functional-zone classifications. First, hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is employed to make bottom-up classification for land covers and functional zones. The HSC is essentially a hierarchical Bayesian model which links visual features, land covers, spatial object patterns, and functional zones together with a hierarchical structure. Then, a top down feedback method, inverse hierarchical semantic cognition (IHSC), is proposed to optimize the initial classification results. Finally, the two processes are carried out iteratively to generate more and more accurate results. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we conducted it in Beijing, China. Experimental results indicate that the method produces accurate classification results of land covers and functional zones, and improves their accuracies by 9.9% and 6.5% respectively. Accordingly, our method combines bottom-up classification and top-down feedback and can significantly improve land-cover and functional-zone mapping results, thus can be regarded as a novel paradigm of urban mapping.

TI Validation of Jason-3 tracking modes over French rivers

AB Satellite nadir radar altimeters have been widely used to measure river and lake surface water elevations. They can now retrieve the elevations of some rivers < 200 m wide. However, as these satellite missions are primarily designed to observe ocean surface topography, they are not always able to observe continental surfaces. For steep-sided rivers (i.e. in river valleys no more than a few km wide and surrounded by slopes over 50 m high), altimeters tend to observe the top of the surrounding topography rather than the river itself.
   The Jason-3 altimetry mission, launched in January 2016, has an alternative instrument operation mode, the so called Open-Loop (OL) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tracking mode. This mode is intended to help overcome this issue, by using an on-board DEM. However it was not used in 2016 as the operational mode because of difficulties in defining an accurate on-board global-scale DEM. Mainland France has been chosen to test the OL tracking mode, as water masks and DEMs of sufficient accuracy are available.
   Following the launch of Jason-3, Jason-2 (its predecessor) was maintained on the same nominal orbit as its follow-on, for more than 6 months. During this tandem period, data from the first 10 Jason-3 cycles (a Jason-2/-3 cycle corresponds to 10 days) were acquired in the traditional Closed-Loop (CL) tracking mode. Jason-3 data from the last 13 cycles were acquired in OL tracking mode. Jason-2 was always in CL tracking mode. Compared to nearby in situ gages and for river wider than 100 m, Jason-3 water elevation anomalies have a RMSE between 0.20 and 0.30 m for most reaches. Jason-3 performance over narrow rivers is similar to that of Jason-2. In CL tracking mode, Jason-3 altimeter tends to be locked over the surrounding topography more frequently than Jason-2 (due to the specific post-launch Jason-2 altimeter tuning). This study shows that Jason-2 observed 60% of river reaches studied (48 of 86 reaches), whereas Jason-3 in OL tracking mode was able to measure all river reaches for every cycle. This result clearly highlights the significant advantages of the OL tracking mode for observation of steep-sided rivers. However, further investigations are required to compute an accurate on-board global-scale DEM and to determine those locations where the use of OL tracking mode is or is not appropriate.

AB Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the similar to 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.

AB InSAR technology provides a powerful tool to detect potentially unstable slopes across wide areas and to monitor surface displacements of a single landslide. However, conventional time series InSAR methods such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) and small-baseline subset (SBAS) can rarely identify sufficient measurement points (MPs) in mountainous areas due to decorrelations caused by steep terrain and vegetation coverage. In this study, we developed a new InSAR approach, coherent scatterer InSAR (CSI), to map landslide surface displacements in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction by combining persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). The key ideas of CSI include the employment of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for the identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and the use of the phase linking algorithm to estimate optimal phase for each DS pixel. The joint exploitation of PS and DS targets dramatically increases the spatial density of MPs, which makes the phase unwrapping more reliable. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSI approach, we applied it to retrieve the historical displacements of the Jiaju landslide in Danba County of southwest China using 19 L-band ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2011) and nine C-band ENVISAT ASAR images (2007-2008). Multiple comparisons clearly illustrated the big advantages of CSI over PSI and SBAS in mapping landslide displacements with more details owing to much higher ( > 10 times) MP density. Furthermore, the superiority of L-band SAR data over C-band for landslide investigation in rural environments was confirmed. Quantitative validation of the CSI results for PALSAR data against in-situ GPS measurements suggested an accuracy of about 10.5 millimeters per year (mm/year) in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Afterwards, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the Jiaju landslide surface displacements were summarized, with a new upper boundary for the active northern part delineated. Particularly, the northern part of the landslide moved faster than the southern part, exhibiting a maximum LOS displacement rate of around 120 mm/year. Subsequently, the fluvial erosion by the Dajinchuan River was identified as the predominant impact factor for the instability of the Jiaju landslide. Finally, the major problems and challenges for the application of CSI method were discussed, and the conclusions were given.

AB Combining observations from multiple optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can provide temporally dense and regular information at medium resolution scale, independently of weather, season, and location. This has the potential to improve near real-time deforestation monitoring in dry tropical regions, where traditional optical only monitoring systems typically suffer from limited data availability due to persistent cloud cover. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 satellites promise unprecedented potential, because for the first time dense and regular SAR observations are free and openly available. We demonstrate multi-sensor near real-time deforestation detection in tropical dry forests, through the combination of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time series with ALSO-2 PALSAR-2 L-band SAR, and Landsat-7/ETM + and 8/OLI. We used spatial normalisation to reduce the dry forest seasonality in the optical and SAR time series, and combined them within a probabilistic approach to detect deforestation in near real-time. Our results for a dry tropical forest site in Bolivia, showed that, as a result of high observation availability of Sentinel-1, deforestation events were detected more timely with Sentinel-1 than compared to Landsat and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The spatial and temporal accuracies of the multi-sensor approach were higher than the single-sensor results. We improved the precision of the reference data derived from the multi-sensor satellite time series, which enabled a more robust estimation of the temporal accuracy. We quantified how the near real-time deforestation detection is associated with a trade-off between the confidence in detection and the temporal accuracy. We showed that the trade-off affects the choice on how to use the near-real time data for different applications such as fast alerting with high temporal accuracy but lower confidence versus accurate detection at lower temporal detail. When aiming for a high confidence in change area estimates for example, deforestation was detected with a user's accuracy of 88%, a producer's accuracy of 89% (low area bias), and a mean time lag of 31 days using all sensors. This is on average 7 days earlier than when using only Sentinel-1 observations, and six weeks earlier than when relying only on Landsat observations. We showed that confident near real-time deforestation alerts can be provided with a mean time lag of 22 days, but these are associated with a higher commission error. With more dense time series data expected from the Sentinel-1 and -2 sensors for the upcoming decade, spatial and temporal detection accuracy of multi-sensor deforestation monitoring in the tropics will improve further.

AB We present a new method for more accurate in-flight calibration and correction of imaging spectrometer spectral response functions. Non-Gaussian tails of spectral response functions can be difficult to characterize in the laboratory, and calibration can shift during deployment. Consequently, in-flight techniques are useful for validating and updating laboratory measurements. Our approach exploits predictable changes in the shape of the oxygen A band across varying surface elevation, with diverse scene content providing numerical leverage to characterize spectral response tails 3-4 orders of magnitude below the peak. We present a correction to recover the nominal response function, and show case studies based on NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). Corrected radiances are better conditioned for downstream analysis by sensitive atmospheric codes. We evaluate accuracy using multiple independent standards: simulation studies; consistency with laboratory measurements; elimination of a surface pressure retrieval bias; better alignment of retrieved reflectance with ground reference data; and statistics of over 250 flightlines from a campaign across the Indian Subcontinent showing consistent improvements in atmospheric correction.

AB The FLuorescence EXpiorer (FLEX) satellite mission, selected as ESA's 8th Earth Explorer, has been designed for the measurement of sun-induced fluorescence (F) spectra emitted by plants. This will be accomplished through a multi-sensor approach by placing it in a common orbit in tandem with the Sentinel-3 (S3) mission, which will have two optical sensors on board, OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) to complement FLEX. These S3 instruments will be used in combination with the imaging spectrometers on board FLEX to provide data useful for atmospheric correction of FLEX data. However, a fully synergetic approach, i.e. by exploiting the spectral and directional information from all tandem mission instruments together, is an attractive alternative which is explored in this paper. By employing all combined top of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data, one can (i) characterize the relevant optical properties of the atmosphere, (ii) retrieve biophysical canopy properties including the associated reflectance anisotropy, and (iii) retrieve a more accurate and consistent canopy F.
   Regarding retrieval methods, Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) and Spectral Fitting (SF) are well-known techniques applied to hyperspectral data. Both methods depend on a high spectral resolution and assume a Lambertian (isotropic) canopy reflectance. However, most vegetation canopies are non-Lambertian. This implies that, in particular when ignoring the anisotropic surface reflection, substantial retrieval errors can occur due to the interaction between atmospheric absorption bands and surface reflectance anisotropy. In this paper, a novel method based on spectral radiative transfer (RT) modeling is proposed, in which coupled RT models are used to simulate TOA radiance spectra. These are then matched with `measured' spectra in order to retrieve surface fluorescence, along with a suite of biophysical parameters, by model inversion through optimization. By applying coupled RT models of the soil-leaf-canopy and the surface-atmosphere systems, TOA radiance spectra can be simulated for all optical sensors of this tandem mission. In this way, complex effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and the spectral sampling by the various instruments, which are difficult to compensate for in the end products, are properly taken into account by their incorporation in the forward modeling. Next, by model inversion of TOA radiance data via optimization, the most accurate F retrievals can be achieved in a consistent manner, along with important canopy level biophysical parameters that may help interpret the F spectrum, such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI). The potential of this approach has been explored in a numerical experiment, and the results are presented in this paper. We find that, with the assumed well-characterized and plausible FLEX/S3 instrument performances, the simultaneous retrieval of biophysical canopy parameters and F spectra would be possible with a remarkable accuracy, provided the correct atmospheric characterization is available.

AB Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are two newly launched satellites for global monitoring. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors have very different spatial and temporal resolutions (Sentinel-2 MSI sensor 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, 10 days, albeit 5 days with 2 sensors, conditional upon clear skies; Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor 300 m, < 1.4 days with 2 sensors). For local monitoring (e.g., the growing cycle of plants) one either has the desired spatial or temporal resolution, but not both. In this paper, spatio-temporal fusion is considered to fuse Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-3 images to create nearly daily Sentinel-2 images. A challenging issue in spatio-temporal fusion is that there can be very few cloud-free fine spatial resolution images temporally close to the prediction time, or even available, strong temporal (i.e., seasonal) changes may exist. To this end, a three-step method consisting of regression model fitting (RM fitting), spatial filtering (SF) and residual compensation (RC) is proposed, which is abbreviated as Fit-FC. The Fit-FC method can be performed using only one Sentinel-3 Sentinel-2 pair and is advantageous for cases involving strong temporal changes (i.e., mathematically, the correlation between the two Sentinel-3 images is small). The effectiveness of the method was validated using two datasets. The created nearly daily Sentinel-2 time-series images have great potential for timely monitoring of highly dynamic environmental, agricultural or ecological phenomena.

AB During the past decades, overuse of land resources has increasingly contributed to environmental crises in China. To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990's still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 +/- 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 165 ha in 2014) and forth gain (190,645 28,352 ha during 2001-2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 54,939 ha during 2001-2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China.

AB The vertical heterogeneity of leaf biophysical and biochemical properties may have a large effect on the bidirectional reflectance and fluorescence of vegetation canopies. This has implications for the interpretation of remote sensing data. We developed a model for light interaction and energy balance in vegetation canopies in which leaf biophysical and biochemical properties vary in the vertical. The model mSCOPE is an extension of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which simulates spectral and bidirectional reflectance, fluorescence, and photosynthesis of vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies. The modelling of radiative transfer in mSCOPE is based on the classical SAIL theory. A solution to the radiative transfer equation for multi-layer canopies is given, which allows calculating top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance and the flux profile. The latter is used for the simulation of fluorescence emission and photosynthesis of every leaf through the leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect and a biochemical model. The radiative transfer of fluorescence in multi-layer canopies is solved numerically in mSCOPE to obtain TOC bidirectional fluorescence. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties on TOC reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis is demonstrated by different scenarios with customized vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf water content, and also with measured vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content in corn canopies. A preliminary validation of the reflectance calculating routine of mSCOPE is conducted by comparing measured and simulated TOC reflectance spectra of the corn canopies. We conclude that it is important to consider the vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties for the prediction of reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis. The model mSCOPE could serve as a tool to better understand vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies.

TI Correcting satellite-based precipitation products through SMOS soil
   moisture data assimilation in two land-surface models of different

AB Global rainfall information is useful for many applications. However, real-time versions of satellite-based rainfall products are known to contain errors. Recent studies have demonstrated how the information about rainfall intrinsically contained in soil moisture data can be utilised for improving rainfall estimates. That is, soil moisture dynamics are impacted for several days by the accumulated amount of rainfall following within a particular event. In this context, soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is used in this study to correct rainfall accumulation estimates provided by satellite-based real-time precipitation products such as CMORPH, TRMM-3B42RT or PERSIANN. An algorithm based on the SMOS measurements data assimilation is tested in two land-surface models of different complexity: a simple hydrological model (Antecedent Precipitation Index (API)) and a more sophisticated state-of-the-art land-surface model (SURFEX (Surface Extemalisee)). We show how the assimilation technique, based on a particle filter method, generally leads to a significant improvement in rainfall estimates, with slightly better results for the simpler (and less computationally demanding) API model. This methodology has been evaluated for six years at ten sites around the world with different land use and climatological features. The results also show the limitations of the methodology in regions highly affected by mountainous terrain, forest or intense radio-frequency interference (RFI), which can notably affect the quality of the retrievals. The satisfactory results shown here invite the future operational application of the methodology in near-real time on a global scale.

AB Global estimates of forest aboveground biomass and carbon storage have major discrepancies linked to limitations in tree-level biomass estimates. Robust allometric equations can improve biomass estimates; however, destructive sampling to measure single-tree biomass is expensive, challenging, and prone to measurement error. We present a method to efficiently and non-destructively estimate single-tree biomass from terrestrial LiDAR scan data and test the approach on 21 destructively-sampled lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees. The approach estimates branch and foliage volume using voxelization and estimates trunk volume using a method developed in this study called the Outer Hull Model (OHM). The OHM iteratively fits convex hulls, accurately handles noisy scan data, and fits the true shape of the trunk rather than forcing a cylindrical fit. Volume from the LiDAR scans is converted to biomass using density values from the literature and from field sampling to assess model sensitivity to density values. Whole-tree aboveground biomass estimates derived from the LiDAR scans were nearly unbiased and agreed strongly with destructive sampling data (R-2 = 0.98, RMSE = 20.4 kg). Estimation of the trunk component biomass (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 12.3 kg) was stronger than foliage and needle component estimates (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 21.4 kg). The approach presented in this study accurately and non-destructively estimated the aboveground biomass of needleleaf trees with minimal user input. The promising performance on coniferous trees advances efficient sampling of single-tree biomass.

AB Biodiversity is declining on a global scale and the limited resources available for conservation efforts and research need to be used efficiently. Fungi are a megadiverse taxonomic group where lack of knowledge impedes sufficient conservation focus. Inventories of fungi require a high level of expertise and are difficult and expensive due to seasonal variation and fluctuation in sporocarp formation. Lidar offers objective, fine-resolution and potentially cheap and broad scale data for representing vegetation structure and has proven useful for prediction of the diversity of plant and animal species. In this study, we used lidar-derived variables as explanatory variables in models of fungal species richness and controlling gradients of species composition, represented by three ordination axes derived from multidimensional scaling. The fungal data comprised a data set of 1527 species recorded in three inventories of 121 sites covering all major terrestrial habitat types across Denmark. We compared the performance of lidar-derived explanatory variables with two field inventory-based sets of variables: 1) lists of vascular plants and 2) recordings of soil, microclimate and vegetation structure. Lidar-derived variables performed best in predicting fungal richness and the first ordination axis, interpreted as a gradient from low and open herb-dominated communities over Closed swards and scrubs to closed-canopy forests (cross validated r(2) of 0.50 and 0.81, respectively). The number of red-listed species and the second ordination axis were poorly predicted by lidar, and the third ordination axis was equally well detected by the three explanatory sets of variables (cross validated r(2) of 0.38). From a fungal conservation perspective, it is promising that lidar-based variables hold information suitable for detecting major gradients in fungal richness and composition.

AB Three-dimensional structure of vegetation plays a key role in animal ecology and the arrival of LiDAR technologies has given ecologists the ability to understand species-habitat relationships in increasing detail. However, few studies have investigated the trait-environment relationships that underpin diverse animal relationships with vegetation structure. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and acoustic bat surveys to investigate relationships between forest structure and bat communities across a vegetation structural gradient at community, species and trait levels. We developed 20 measures of site scale vegetation structure and also quantified landscape scale vegetation cover and water availability. We predicted that overall bat activity would increase in open and decrease in cluttered vegetation, but this would vary with species, underpinned by ecomorphological traits. Overall bat activity was negatively associated with stem density, with total activity halving (from 380 to 190 calls night(-1)) as stem densities increased from 60 to 1350 stems ha(-1), while foraging activity declined from 8 to <1 feeding buzzes night(-1) over the same range. Bat activity varied among species and structures and foraging strategy explained more of this variability than call, body size or wing traits. As predicted, above canopy and edge-space foraging bats were negatively associated with local-scale clutter, while closed-space species were positively associated with cluttered stands. Stem density was the strongest predictor of bat-environment relationships, although there was evidence for differences in bat habitat use across different structural elements. Our study is the first to link detailed LiDAR-derived 3D forest structural metrics to multiple animal traits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Most time-sequenced ambient air pollution data in China is published through daily Air Quality Index (AQI). However, few studies have used the AQI data to calibrate satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles no greater than 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) concentrations, partly because the AQI-derived PM2.5 is not continuously obtained each day. Taking Beijing as an example, we developed a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model that can account for spatial and temporal variability in the relationship between the non-continuous AQI-derived PM2.5 and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). The GTWR model, which uses AOD values with a 3-km spatial resolution obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological fields, and land-use variables as predictors, was fitted seasonally from April 2013 to March 2015. After being cross-validated against ground observations, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of PM2.5 ranged from 0.36 to 0.75, with a mean value of 0.58. The GTWR model outperforms several conventional models, such as the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, temporally weighted regression (TWR) model, and linear mixed-effects (LME) model. Compared to a previous spatiotemporal model, the two-stage (LME + GWR) model, the GTWR model may be more feasible. When the number of daily records is >= 5, there is no obvious difference in prediction accuracy (cross-validated R-2 both valued at 0.68). However, when the number of daily records is <5, the GTWR model performs much better (cross-validated R-2 of 0.45 and 0.08). Our estimates indicate that the gridded annual mean PM2.5 values range from 62 to 110 mu g/m(3), denoting strong spatial variation. We find that when available, continuous daily PM2.5 observations can significantly improve model performance and therefore facilitate the estimation of surface PM2.5 concentrations at urban scales. The GTWR model may serve as a reference for studying regions where continuous air pollution data are limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge about inland surface water distribution and its short- to long-term variability is of high importance. Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3% with 7.8% omission and 0.5% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 933% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.

AB Soil water content is a vital resource that plays a central role in agricultural areas. In Argentina the soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill) is the most important crop, considering the economic yield and the sown area. Actually, remote sensing allows continuous monitoring of crops and to evaluate the impact of water stress in their development. The combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator that provides information about the condition of the vegetation and surface soil moisture content. In this study we evaluate relationships between indicators of crop water stress and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat, for sites with rainfed soybean in the agricultural central zone of Cordoba (Argentina).
   Field data were acquired continuously throughout the whole growing season. For each sample date and plot, data of percent green vegetation cover, soil moisture content and phenology were registered. The use of a simulation crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices: (1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity that is readily available.
   The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.
   When soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 = 0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and (1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have utilized ground plots, airborne lidar scanning or profiling data, and space lidar profiling data to estimate biomass across large regions, but these studies have failed to take into account the variance components associated with multiple models because the proper variance equations were not available. Previous large-domain studies estimated the variances of their biomass density estimates as the sum of the GLAS sampling variability plus the model variability associated with the models that predict airborne lidar estimates of biomass density (Y) as a function of satellite lidar measurements (X). This approach ignores the additional variability associated with the predictive models used to estimate ground biomass density as a function of airborne lidar measurements. This paper addresses that shortcoming. Analytic variance expressions are provided that include sampling variability and model variability in situations where multiple models are employed to generate estimates of biomass. As an example, the forest biomass of the continental US is estimated, by forest stratum within state, using a space lidar system (ICESat/GLAS). An airborne laser system (ALS) is used as an intermediary to tie the GLAS measurements of forest height to a small subset of US Forest Service (USFS) ground plots by flying the ALS over the ground plots and, independently, over individual GLAS footprints. Two sets of models are employed to relate satellite measurements to the ground plots. The first set of equations relates USFS ground plot estimates of total aboveground dry biomass density (Y-1) to spatially coincident ALS forest canopy measurements (X-1). The second set of models predicts those ALS canopy height measurements (X-1) used in the first set of models to GLAS waveform measurements (X2). The following important conclusions are noted. (1) The variability associated with estimation of the plot-ALS model coefficients is significant and should be included in the overall estimate of biomass density variance. In the continental US, the total variance of mean forest biomass density (98.06 t/ha) increases by a factor of 3.6x, i.e., from 1.91 to 6.94 t(2)/ha(2), when plot-ALS model variance is included in the calculation of total variance. (2) State-level results are more variable, but on average, the percent model variance at the state level, i.e., (model variance / total variance) * 100, increases from 16% to 59% when plot-ALS model variance is included. (3) The overall model variance is driven in large part by the number of plots overflown by the ALS and the number of GLAS pulses overflown by the ALS. Given a choice of improving precision by either increasing the number of plot-ALS observations or increasing ALS-GLAS observations, there is no obvious benefit to selecting one over the other. However, typically the number of ground plots overflown is the limiting factor. (4) If heteroskedasticity is evident in either the ground-air or air-satellite models, it can modeled using weighted regression techniques and incorporated into these model variance formulas in straightforward fashion. The results are unambiguous; in a hybrid three-phase sampling framework, both the ground-air and air-satellite model variance components are significant and should be taken into account.

AB Satellite remote sensing data can provide timely, accurate, and objective information on cultivated area by crop type and, in turn, facilitate accurate estimates of crop production. Here, we present a generic multi-resolution approach to sample-based crop type area estimation at the national level using soybean as an example crop type. Historical MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data were used to stratify growing regions into subsets of low, medium and high soybean cover. A stratified random sample of 20 km x 20 km sample blocks was selected and Landsat data for these sample blocics classified into soybean cover. The Landsat-derived soybean area was used to produce national estimates of soybean area. Current year MODIS-indicated soybean cover served as an auxiliary variable in a stratified regression estimator procedure. To evaluate the approach, we prototyped the method in the USA, where the 2013 USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) was used as a reference training data set for mapping soybean cover within each sample block. Three individual Landsat images were sufficient to accurately map soybean cover for all blocics, revealing that a rather sparse sample of phenological variation is needed to separate soybean from other cover types. In addition to stacks of images, we also evaluated standard radiometrically normalized Landsat inputs for mapping blocks individually (local-scale) and all at once (national-scale). All tested inputs resulted in area estimates comparable to the official USDA estimate of 30.86 Mha, with lower accuracy and higher standard error for national-scale mapping implementations. The stratified regression estimator incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soy reduced the standard error of the estimated soybean area by over 25% relative to the standard error of the stratified estimator. Finally, the method was ported to Argentina. A stratified random sample of blocks was characterized for soybean cultivated area using stacks of individual Landsat images for the 2013-2014 southern hemisphere growing season. A sub sample of these blocks was visited on the ground to assess the accuracy of the Landsat-derived soy classification. The stratified regression estimator procedure performed similarly to the US application as it resulted in a reduction in standard error of about 25% relative to the stratified estimator not incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soybean. Our final estimated soybean area was 28% lower than that reported by the USDA, corresponding to a 20% field-based omission error related to underdeveloped fields. Lessons learned from this study can be ported to other regions of comparable field size and management intensity to assess soybean cultivated area.

AB Leaf pigments provide valuable information about plant physiology. High resolution monitoring of their dynamics will give access to better understanding of processes occurring at different scales, and will be particularly important for ecologists, farmers, and decision makers to assess the influence of climate change on plant functions, and the adaptation of forest, crop, and other plant canopies. In this article, we present a new version of the widely-used PROSPECT model, hereafter named PROSPECT-D for dynamic, which adds anthocyanins to chlorophylls and carotenoids, the two plant pigments in the current version. We describe the evolution and improvements of PROSPECT-D compared to the previous versions, and perform a validation on various experimental datasets. Our results show that PROSPECT-D outperforms all the previous versions. Model prediction uncertainty is decreased and photosynthetic pigments are better retrieved. This is particularly the case for leaf carotenoids, the estimation of which is particularly challenging. PROSPECT-D is also able to simulate realistic leaf optical properties with minimal error in the visible domain, and similar performances to other versions in the near infrared and shortwave infrared domains.

AB Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) has been proven to serve as a proxy of photosynthesis activity and therefore, as an early indicator of physiological alterations for global monitoring of vegetation. However, the interpretation of SIF over different spatial resolutions is critical to bridge the existing gap between local and global scales. This study provides insight into the influence of scene components, and forest structure and composition on the quantification of the red and far-red fluorescence signal as an early indicator of forest decline. The experiments were conducted over an oak forest (Quercus ilex) affected by water stress and Phytophthora infection in the southwest of Spain. SIF retrievals through the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle with three spectral bands F (FLD3) was assessed using high resolution (60 cm) hyperspectral imagery extracting sunlit crown, full crown and aggregated pixels. Results showed the link between F (FLD3) extracted from sunlit crown pixels and the tree physiological condition in this context of disease infection, yielding significant relationships (r(2) = 0.57, p < 0.01) for midday xylem water potential NO, (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.001) for the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DEPS), and (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.001) for leaf-level measurements of steady-state fluorescence yield (F-s). In contrast, a poor relationship was obtained when using aggregated pixels at 30 m spatial resolution, where the relationship between the image-based F (FLD3) and F-s yielded a non-significant relationship (r(2) = 025, p > 0.05). These results demonstrate the need for methods to accurately retrieve crown SIF from aggregated pixels in heterogeneous forest canopies with large physiological variability among individual trees. This aspect is critical where structural canopy variations and the direct influence of background and shadows affect the SIF amplitude masking the natural variations caused by physiological condition. FluorFLIGHT, a modified version of the three dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model FLIGHT was developed for this work, enabling the simulation of canopy radiance and reflectance including fluorescence at different spatial resolutions, such as may be derived from proposed satellite missions such as FLEX, and accounting for canopy structure and varying percentage cover. The 3-D modelling approach proposed here significantly improved the relationship between F-s and F (FLD3) extracted from aggregated pixels (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001), performing better than when aggregation effects were not considered (r2 = 0.42, p < 0.01). The FluorFLIGHT model used in this study improved the retrieval of SIF from aggregated pixels as a function of fractional cover, Leaf Area Index and chlorophyll content yielding significant relationships between F-s ground-data measurements and fluorescence quantum yield estimated with FluorFLIGHT at p < 0.01 (r(2) = 0.79). The methodology presented here using FluorFLIGHT also demonstrated its capabilities for mapping SIF at the tree level for single tree assessment of forest physiological condition in the context of early disease detection.

AB The wide field of view (WFV) imaging system onboard the Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1) optical satellite has a 16-m resolution and four-day revisit cycle for large-scale Earth observation. The advantages of the high temporal-spatial resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular. However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

AB snow depth measurements are sparse, especially in remote areas. In this study, we assess the potential of ICESat laser altimetry for providing snow depths for its operational period 2003-2009 on the example of the Scandinavian Mountains in southern Norway. Snow cover during ICESat campaigns typically results in positive elevation differences (dh) between ICESat GLAH14 elevations and reference elevations from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Three DEMs are used: the Norwegian national DEM for the entire study area, and the SRTM DEM and a high-resolution airborne lidar DEM for a spatial subset on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau. To account for uncertainty in elevation data, ICESat samples are grouped into spatial subsets, elevation bands, and over time (e.g. all winter campaigns together). We find that ICESat has the potential to provide regional-scale snow depths for the years 2003-2009 for its winter (March) and late spring (June) campaigns. ICESat-derived snow depth time series for different elevation bands agree well with measured (RMSE 0.47 m) and modelled (RMSE 0.61 m) snow depths in the study area. Annual differences in snow amounts and the increase of snow depths with elevation and coastal proximity over the study area are correctly reproduced. Uncertainties in reference elevations exceed ICESat elevation uncertainty and good control over errors and biases in reference DEMs turn out essential. Spatially varying vertical offsets between ICESat and the reference DEMs make it necessary to bias-correct March/June snow depths with autumn dh per spatial unit or elevation band. Best results are achieved when samples are summarised per season over the entire observation period. After correction of local DEM biases, the spatial pattern of ICE Sat 2003-2009 March dh matches spatially distributed modelled snow depths in southern Norway with decimeter-scale accuracy. In the western part of Hardangervidda, ICESat-based March snow depths agree better with measurements (RMSE <= 0.15 m for all DEMs) than modelled snow depths do (RMSE 0.61 m). In eastern Hardangervidda, the coarse resolution SRTM DEM (RMSE 0.41 m) performs better than the 10 m Norwegian DEM (RMSE 0.64 m) which is based on a less consistent mosaic of elevation data. Using the high resolution lidar DEM, even single footprints show good agreement (R-2 0.59, RMSE 0.94 m) with measured snow depths from the same year. Snow depth estimates could be further improved by using full waveform ICESat data or elevation measurements from ICESat-2 once this satellite is operational. Good quality reference DEMs may still be acquired in the future even in areas where no such data exists today. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the relationships between stand-level photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and canopy structure/pigment pools, as well as light use efficiency (LUE) of photosynthetically active vegetation focusing on seasonal or ontogenetic time frames. PRI was originally designed as a means of assessing the xanthophyll cycle and LUE over short (e.g. diurnal) time frames, and few studies have explored the drivers of PRI over longer, seasonal time frames, particularly in crops having different photosynthetic pathways or canopy structures. Consequently, our purpose was to understand and quantify the drivers of PRI responses over seasonal time scales for two crops, maize (C-4) and soybean (C-3), contrasting in photosynthetic pathway, leaf structure and canopy architecture. In both crops, PRI was very closely related to green LAl (R-2 > 0.90) and stand chlorophyll (Chl) content (R-2 > 0.93). The slopes of the relationships in different phenological stages, vegetative and reproductive, were substantially different (3-fold smaller in the vegetative stage). The main cause of this disparity was the high PRI value of soil/residue background. While PRI was a sensitive indicator of the changes in stand green LAl and stand Chl content over the full growing season, it was not sensitive to LUE; LUE explained below 12% of PRI variation in maize and 19% in soybean. Unlike leaf-level PRI, stand-level PRI was not clearly related to the Car/Chl ratio, presumably because the large changes in canopy structure (affecting stand Chl and green LAI) had a dominant influence on PRI over this time frame. The strong relationship between PRI and stand Chl content as well as between PRI and Chl-related vegetation index over a growing cycle allowed us to subtract the stand Chl content effect from measured PRI to reveal the component of PRI most likely related to periods of stress. However, for accurate subtraction of the Chl effect from long-term PRI records, thoughtful study of uncertainties related to "natural" variation of PRI-stand Chl relationships, and stand Chl content estimation for different varieties of the same species and for different species is required. The findings of a strong link between stand-level PRI and stand green LAI and Chl content and the lack of a clear relationship between PRI and LUE over seasonal and ontogenetic time spans suggest the need for a more careful evaluation of the relationship between PRI and either LUE or photosynthetic activity. In particular, studies that contrast short-term (e.g. diurnal) vs. long-term (e.g. seasonal) pigment, PRI, and photosynthetic responses in contrasting vegetation types are needed to clarify the different mechanisms involved at different temporal and spatial scales. These findings have important implications for attempts to monitor photosynthetic phenology from remote sensing, many of which have relied on PRI as an indicator of photosynthetic activity.

AB Over the past four decades, amplified warming in the Arctic has led to numerous consequences. Of particular relevance, negative anomalies of snow and sea ice cover, glacier retreat, and the extended melt of Greenland combined with increasing temperature at double the rate of the rest of the planet have been observed in the Arctic. Several studies have suggested that another response to the current arctic warming could be an increase in rain-on-snow (ROS) events followed by subsequent freezing and the creation of ice layers. We use recently developed detection algorithms of ROS and ice events using passive microwave retrieval approaches to examine the spatial and temporal trends in rain-on-snow and ice layer creation for 18 islands across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) over the last two decades. Results show that both icing and ROS event occurrence tripled between the periods of 1979-1995 and 1996-2011, with very active years in winters 1993-1994,1998-1999 and 2002-2003. The areas with the most combined occurrences are the Boothia Peninsula and Axel Heiberg, Cornwallis, Banks and Victoria Islands. We then compare the rain-on-snow and icing events to Peary caribou estimates to test whether the algorithms can detect weather events associated with population declines. There has been an important reduction in population numbers of Peary caribou, the northernmost caribou population in Canada, over the last three generations. The major hypothesis for the decline is that severe weather events lead to more difficult winter grazing conditions. The comparison with the Peary caribou population estimates suggest that caribou numbers decrease with increased occurrence of ROS and icing events, where 3-4 ROS events and 12 icing events in one winter season are sufficient to have a negative impact on Peary caribou.

AB Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimations based on surface energy balance from remote sensing require information in the thermal infrared (TIR) domain, normally provided with an insufficient spatial resolution. In order to estimate ET in heterogeneous agricultural areas, we inspect in this paper the use of disaggregation techniques applied to two different sensors, such as MODIS (daily revisit cycle and 1 km spatial resolution in the TIR domain) and Spot 5 (5 days revisit cycle and 10 m spatial resolution in the VNIR bands but no TIR band). Spot 5 images were used as a proxy for upcoming Sentinel-2. The Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance (STSEB) model was used for the estimation of ET. Since no Sentinel-2 images were available yet, images from the Spot 5 Take 5 experiment were used for testing this approach. Results assessment was conducted at two different levels: field scale (using ground data), and scene scale (using Landsat 7-ETM+ images as a reference). Validation of both disaggregated land surface temperature (LST) and derived surface energy fluxes was performed. Mean absolute deviations of similar to 2 degrees C in disaggregated LST were observed at both field and scene scales. At field scale, relative errors of 22% and 19% were obtained for ET at instantaneous and daily scales, respectively. At scene scale, the four components of the surface energy balance equation were obtained with relative errors of 3, 14, 11 and 8% for net radiation, evapotranspiration, sensible heat flux and soil heat flux, respectively, compared to Landsat. The results obtained were compared to the use of the MODIS LST at its original resolution (1 km), which was used also to obtain the surface energy fluxes. As the surface heterogeneity increases the errors in both MODIS LSI and ET become more and more significant, compared to the use of the disaggregated images. Although reference images at 10 m spatial resolution were not available at this stage for a more robust comparison, this paper shows the potential of the use of disaggregated 1ST to estimate ET at 10 m spatial resolution, which is especially attractive in highly heterogeneous areas.

AB The satellite observed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, which describe the temporal and spatial variability of global terrestrial vegetation, are inevitably contaminated by clouds, aerosol, snow and ice cover. In general all these conditions yield negative deviations in the time series of NDVI. Many time series reconstruction models have been developed to eliminate effect of the negative deviations and most of them perform differently in different applications and regions. The Harmonic Analysis (HA), Double logistic (DL), Asymmetric Gaussian (AG), Whittaker smoother (WS) and Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) are five of the most widely used time series reconstruction models owing to their simplicity of implementation or the capability to extract phenological metrics from the time series. The performance of these models varies with the NDVI signal and the noise distribution, however, and until now there is no consensus on which method outperforms all others under all situations. Since the NDVI signal and the noise distribution are highly dependent on regional climate and land cover, the reconstruction performance is expected to be spatially variable. Thus this study compared the five reconstruction models at pixel scale to provide practical and biome- specific recommendations for future time series reconstruction applications. Specifically, the 14 years raw daily reflectance data and ancillary Quality Assessment (QA) information from the MODIS sensor were used to generate pixel reference series and noisy series. Then the five candidate models were applied to both reference series and noisy series and three reconstruction performance metrics i.e. Overall Reconstruction Error (ORE), Fitting Related Error (FRE), and Normalized Noise Related Error (NNRE), were calculated. Finally, the performance of the five candidate reconstruction models was evaluated by applying the three metrics. The preliminary results showed that when considering ORE only, the Asymmetric Gaussian model outperforms other models over most areas of high latitude boreal region, while the Savitzky-Golay model gives the best reconstruction performance in tropical and subtropical regions. The FRE and the NNRE helped to reveal the main error sources in the reconstruction in different regions. The comparison method developed and applied in this study led to suggest adaptive selection of the best reconstruction model for specific NDVI signals and noise distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Cloud cover and snow misclassifications are the two major limitations for the hydrological application of MODIS snow data. Ground-based meteorological data have the inherent potential to provide the means to reconstruct snow cover for regions in which MODIS snow maps are obstructed by clouds, and to reduce misclassified snow observations. In this study, a multistep method is developed to generate cloud-free MODIS daily snow cover products. The accuracy of the updated MODIS snow products is evaluated for a region in southwestern Germany in which winter cloud coverage and snow variability are typically high. First, we applied Aqua/Terra combination, temporal combination and spatial combination to reduce the cloud coverage and to retrieve the omitted snow. This procedure was not effective since cloud blockage occurs frequently during the snow season. A conditional probability interpolation was then employed to reclassify the remaining cloud cover on MODIS snow maps based on in situ snow depth observations. Finally, we implemented a set of meteorological filters to minimize the misclassified snow in MODIS snow products. The improved cloud-free MODIS daily snow maps showed an overall accuracy of about 92% during the snow season with significantly reduced snow overestimation errors and a slight increase in snow omission errors, compared to the overall accuracy of 87% and 94% for original MODIS Aqua and Terra data, respectively. This study suggests that the fusion of ground-based and satellite based snow observations is an effective approach for generating cloud-free remote sensing snow data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Landsat 8 mission provides new opportunities for quantifying the distribution of above-ground carbon at moderate spatial resolution across the globe, and in particular drylands. Furthermore, coupled with structural information from space-based and airborne laser altimetry, Landsat 8 provides powerful capabilities for large-area, long-term studies that quantify temporal and spatial changes in above-ground biomass and cover. With the planned launch of ICESat-2 in 2017 and thus the potential to couple Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 data, we have unprecedented opportunities to address key challenges in drylands, including quantifying fuel loads, habitat quality, biodiversity, carbon cycling, and desertification.
   In this study, we explore the strengths of Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) in estimating vegetation structure in a dryland ecosystem, and compare these results to Landsat 5's Thematic Mapper (TM). We also demonstrate the potential of OLI when coupled with light detection and ranging (lidar) in estimating vegetation cover and biomass in a dryland ecosystem. The OLI and TM predictions were similarly positive, indicating data from these sensors may be used in tandem for long-term time-series analysis. Results indicate shrub and herbaceous cover are well predicted with multi-temporal OLI data, and a combination of OLI and lidar derivatives improves most of these estimates and reduces uncertainty. For example, significant improvements were made for shrub cover (R-2 = 0.64 and 0.78 using OLI only and both OLI and lidar data, respectively). Importantly, a time series of OLI, with some improvement from lidar, provides strong estimates of herbaceous cover (68% of the variance is explained with OLI alone). In contrast, OLI data explain roughly 59% of the variance in total shrub biomass, however approximately 71% of the variance is explained when combined with lidar derivatives.
   To estimate the potential synergies of OLI and ICESat-2 we used simulated ICESat-2 photon data to predict vegetation structure. In a shrubland environment with a vegetation mean height of 1 m and mean vegetation cover of 33%, vegetation photons are able to explain nearly 50% of the variance in vegetation height. These results, and those from a comparison site, suggest that a lower detection threshold of ICESat-2 may be in the range of 30% canopy cover and roughly 1 m height in comparable dryland environments and these detection thresholds could be used to combine future ICESat-2 photon data with OLI spectral data for improved vegetation structure. Overall, the synergistic use of Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 may improve estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon storage in drylands that meet these minimum thresholds, increasing our ability to monitor drylands for fuel loading and the potential to sequester carbon.

AB Snow depth is an important factor in water resources management in Northeast China. Forest covers 40% of Northeast China, and the presence of forests influences the accuracy of snow depth retrievals from passive microwave remote sensing data. An optimal iteration method was used to retrieve the forest transmissivities at 18 and 36 GHz based on the snow and forest microwave radiative transfer models and the snow properties measured in field experiments. The transmissivities at 18 and 36 GHz are 0.895 and 0.656 in the horizontal polarization, and 0.821 and 0.615 in the vertical polarization, respectively. Furthermore, the forest transmissivity and snow properties were input into the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) to establish a dynamic look-up table (LUT). Snow depths were retrieved from satellite passive microwave remote sensing data based on the LUT method, and these retrievals were verified by snow depth observations at 103 meteorological stations. The results showed that the bias between the retrieved and measured snow depths is very small, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of approximately 6 cm in forest regions and 4 cm in non-forest regions. When compared with the existing snow products, the snow depth retrieved in this work presented the highest level of accuracy. The regional snow depth product in China is superior to the GlobSnow and NASA AMSR-E standard SWE products in non-forest regions, whereas the GlobSnow estimate is superior to the regional snow depth product in China and NASA AMSR-E standard SWE product estimates in forest regions. Therefore, we conclude that 1) the influence of forest on snow depth retrieval is important, and the appropriate forest parameters should be considered in the estimation of snow depth from passive microwave brightness temperature data; and 2) the snow depth retrieval algorithm based on the dynamic LUT method proved to be efficient in Northeast China.

AB Month-by-month ranking of 37 years (1979-2015) of satellite-derived sea-ice extents in the Arctic and Antarctic reveals interesting new details in the overall trends toward decreasing sea-ice coverage in the Arctic and increasing sea-ice coverage in the Antarctic. The Arctic decreases are so definitive that there has not been a monthly record high in Arctic sea-ice extents in any month since 1986, a time period during which there have been 75 monthly record lows. The Antarctic, with the opposite but weaker trend toward increased ice extents, experienced monthly record lows in 5 months of 1986, then 6 later monthly record lows scattered through the dataset, with the last two occurring in 2006, versus 45 record highs since 1986. However, in the last three years of the 1979-2015 dataset, the downward trends in Arctic sea-ice extents eased up, with no new record lows in any month of 2013 or 2014 and only one record low in 2015, while the upward trends in Antarctic ice extents notably strengthened, with new record high ice extents in 4 months (August-November) of 2013, in 6 months (April-September) of 2014, and in 3 months (January, April, and May) of 2015. Globally, there have been only 3 monthly record highs since 1986 (only one since 1988), whereas there have been 43 record lows, although the last record lows (in the 1979-2015 dataset) occurred in 2012.

AB Understanding how land surface seasonality emerges from individual tree crown phenology is a key challenge of tropical ecology. We used daily images over a full year from a tower-mounted RGB camera to quantify the leaf phenology of 267 individual tree crowns in an evergreen Central Amazon forest. The Green Chromatic Coordinate, an index of each crown's greenness, showed rapid large-amplitude positive and negative changes, each generally occurring once per year. Rapid increase was attributed to leaf flushing and occurred in 85% of all crowns. Rapid negative change occurred in 42% of individuals, caused mostly by massive pre-flush leaf abscission (31% of all crowns). Flushing was concentrated in the five driest months (55% of crowns) compared to the five wettest months (10%). Inter-crown variance of greenness was lowest in the wet season when fewer crowns were abruptly abscising or flushing leaves. With a one month lead, flushing frequency closely tracked seasonal light availability (R = 0.89) and was inversely correlated with rainfall (R = -0.88). We linked the post-flush age of each crown's leaf cohort to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of crowns at different phenostages on a nadir view QuickBird image. When aggregated to landscape-scale, this camera-based EVI closely followed (R = 0.95) the MODIS MAIAC EVI of the same site, fully corrected for sun-sensor geometry effects. Leaf phenology therefore drives the dry season green-up detected by MODIS in the Central Amazon. It is also consistent with evolutionary strategies to couple photosynthetic efficiency with light availability and to avoid predation and disease on vulnerable young leaves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop the first global 'Bare-Earth' Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for all landmasses between 60N and 54S. Our new 'Bare-Earth' SRTM DEM combines multiple remote sensing datasets, including point-ground elevations from NASA's laser altimeter ICESat, a database of percentage of tree cover from the MODIS satellite as a proxy for penetration depth of SRTM and a global vegetation height map in order to remove the vegetation artefacts present in the original SRTM DEM. We test multiple methods of removing vegetation artefacts and investigate the use of regionalization. Our final 'Bare-Earth' SRTM product shows global improvements greater than 10 m in the bias over the original SRTM DEM in vegetated areas compared with ground elevations determined from ICESat data with a significant reduction in the root mean square error from over 14 m to 6 m globally. Therefore, our DEM will be valuable for any global applications, such as large scale flood modelling requiring a 'Bare-Earth' DEM. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Oceanic shelf sea fronts have significant effects on local dynamics, ecology and climate. An assessment of the impact of climate change on frontal positions and frontal gradients requires reliable reference data and the possibility to monitor oceanic fronts. Therefore, the development of algorithms which automatically detect frontal positions from Earth Observation (EO) data is an important tool to analyse long EO time series, i.e. to process big data volumes. The development of GRADHIST was driven by the need to generate a climatology for North Sea fronts. GRADHIST is a new algorithm for the detection and mapping of oceanic fronts, which is based on a combination and refinement of the gradient algorithm of Canny (1986) and the histogram algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992). GRADHIST preserves the main principles of both algorithms and can be applied to various ocean parameters as well as to different sensors with very little effort. GRADHIST was validated and tested using both synthetic and real data and applied to sea surface temperature and ocean colour parameters retrieved from satellite data; i.e. data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer). Selected results and statistical analysis of a new North Sea climatology for oceanic fronts are presented and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) remote sensing satellite was launched by the European Space Agency in 2009. The L-band brightness temperature observed by SMOS has been used to produce estimates of both soil moisture and tau, the optical thickness of the land surface. Although tau should theoretically be proportional to the amount of vegetation present within a SMOS pixel, several initial investigations have not been able to confirm this expected behavior. However, when the noise in the SMOS tau product is removed, tau in the U.S. Corn Belt, a region of extensive row-crop agriculture, has a distinct shape that mirrors the growth and development of crops. We find that the peak value of SMOS tau occurs at approximately 1000 degrees C day (base 10 degrees C) growing degree days after the mean planting date of maize (corn). We can explain this finding in the following way: tau is directly proportional to the water column density of vegetation; maize contributes the most to growing season changes in tau in the Corn Belt; and maize reaches its maximum water column density at its third reproductive stage of development, at about 1000 degrees C day growing degree days. Consequently, SMOS tau could be used to monitor the phenology of crops in the Corn Belt at a spatial resolution similar to a U.S. county and a temporal frequency on the order of days. We also examined the magnitude of the change in SMOS tau over the growing season and hypothesized it would be related to the amount of accumulated solar radiation, but found this not to be the case. On the other hand, the change in magnitude was smallest for the year in which the most precipitation fell. These findings are rational since SMOS tau at the satellite scale is in fact a function of both vegetation and soil surface roughness, and soil surface roughness is reduced by precipitation. To fully explain changes in SMOS tau in the Corn Belt it appears that it will be necessary to use in situ and remotely-sensed observations along with agro-ecosystem models to account for land management decisions made by farmers that affect changes in soil surface roughness and all of the relevant biophysical processes that affect the growth and development of crops.

AB Several methods have been proposed in previous studies to map macroalgal blooms (MABs) in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS), yet some of the required spectral bands are not available on the new HJ-1 satellite sensors although they do provide optimal resolution and temporal coverage (30-m resolution with 2-day revisit frequency) for bloom mapping. In this study, an index of Virtual-Baseline Floating macroAlgae Height (VB-FAH) is proposed to use the green and red bands as the baseline to measure the height of the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Cross-sensor comparison with Landsat TM and ETM + data suggests that for several images evaluated here VB-FAH appears to be comparable to the previously proposed Floating Algae Index (FAI) even in the absence of a shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band. VB-FAH is applied to 30-m resolution TM and ETM + data for the YS during 1995-2006 and to HJ-1 data for the ECS during 2009-2014 to map MABs. Results show bloom history in the YS back to 1999 and early bloom occurrence in the ECS in winter and spring (e.g., February and March 2013). MABs are also found to extend to the ECS as far south as 26 degrees N near Fujian Province and Taiwan, and as far east as the Kuroshio Current. These new findings provide important information for exploring the origins, causes, and consequences of MABs in the YS and ECS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Progress in imaging spectroscopy technology and data processing can enable derivation of the complete sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission spectrum. This opens up opportunities to fully exploit the use of the SIF spectrum as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. Simulations performed with the coupled fluorescence-photosynthesis model SCOPE were used to determine how strongly canopy-leaving SIF can be related to net photosynthesis of the canopy (NPC) for various canopy configurations. Regression analysis between SIF retrievals and NPC values produced the following general findings: (1) individual SIF bands that were most sensitive to NPC were located around the first emission peak (SIFred) for heterogeneous canopy configurations (i.e., varying biochemistry, leaf, canopy variables); (2) using two SIF retrieval bands, e.g. O-2-B at 687 nm and O-2-A at 760 nm, or the red and NIR emission peaks at 685 nm and 740 nm, led to stronger correlations than using only one band; (3) using the O-2-B and the O-2-A SIF retrieval bands was at least as effective as using the two emission peaks; (4) superior correlations were achieved by using the four main SIF retrieval bands (H alpha, O-2-B, water vapor, O-2-A); and (5) further improvements may be obtained by exploiting the full SIF profile and by using an adaptive, nonlinear regression algorithm such as Gaussian processes regression (GPR). Relationships can be due to variation in photosynthetic capacity (V-cmo), but also from variation in leaf optical and canopy structural variables such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index. Overall, modeling results suggest that sampling the SIF profile in at least both O-2-B and O-2-A bands enables quantification photosynthetic activity of vegetation with high accuracy.

AB Lop Nur once was a huge lake located in northwestern China. Its environmental evolution is significant for understanding historical global climate change. At present, there is no surface water in Lop Nur Lake Basin, and on SAR images it looks like an "Ear". The objective of this article is to recognize different types of salt crust by surface roughness parameters and interpret their environmental meanings in Lop Nur. Surface roughness parameter estimation, by means of microwave remote sensing technology, is a topic which is intensively studied yet not solved satisfactorily. In this article, the potential of using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) acquisitions for the estimation of surface roughness parameter in Lop Nur Lake Basin is investigated. A new parameter Si is proposed to characterize surface roughness and to discriminate salt crust types. Through the analysis of scattering mechanisms, the physical meaning of the PolSAR parameter Single Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (SERD) is reinterpreted and it is used to retrieve parameterSt. A good linear correlation between the measured surface roughness parameter Si and SERD with an R-2 value of 0.72 was obtained. Furthermore, the distributions of different salt crusts in the certain lake area were analyzed. Based on hypotheses of the evolution of surface salt crust and the drying-up cycle of lakes, the fluctuation processes of an ancient lake in Lop Nur were discussed theoretically. These can help to have a better understanding of environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc

AB Real-time, nondestructive monitoring of crop nitrogen (N) status is important for precise N management in winter wheat production. Nadir viewing passive multispectral sensors have limited utility for measuring the N status of winter wheat in middle and bottom layers, and multi-angular remote sensors may instead improve detection of whole canopy physiological and biochemical parameters. Our objective was to improve the predictive accuracy and angular stability of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) measurement by constructing a novel Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI). We quantified the relationship between LNC and ground-based multi-angular hyperspectral reflectance in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) across different growth stages, plant types, N rates, planting density, ecological sites and years. The optimum vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from 17 traditional indices reported in the literature were tested for their stability in estimating LNC at 13 view zenith angles (VZAs) in the solar principal plane (SPP). Overall the back-scatter direction gave improved index performance, relative to the nadir and forward-scattering direction. Red-edge VIs (e.g., mND705, GND [750,550], NDRE, RI-1dB) were highly correlated with LNC. However, the relationships strongly depended on experimental conditions, and these VIs tended to saturate at the highest LNC (4.5%). To further overcome the influence of different experimental conditions and VZAs on VIs, we developed a novel index, Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI), based on red-edge, blue and green bands. Our new model showed the highest association with LNC (R-2 = 0.73-0.87) compared to traditional VIs. Investigating AIVI predictive accuracy in measuring LNC across view zenith angles (VZAs) revealed that performance was the highest at -20 degrees and was relatively homogenous between -10 degrees and -40 degrees. This provided a united, predictive model across this wide-angle range, which enhances the possibility of N monitoring by using portable monitors. Testing of the models with independent data gave R-2 of 0.84 at -20 degrees, and 0.83 across the range of -10 degrees to -40 degrees, respectively. These results suggest that the novel AIVI is more effective for monitoring LNC than previously reported VIs for predicting accuracy, monitoring model stability and view angle independency. More generally, our model indicates the importance of accounting for angular effects when analyzing VIs under different experimental conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, spatially distributed estimates of regional actual evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using a revised procedure of the so called "triangle method" to parameterize the Priestley-Taylor phi coefficient. In the procedure herein proposed, named Time-Domain Triangle Method (TDTM), the triangular feature space was parameterized considering pairs of T-s-VI values obtained by exploring, for each pixel, only their temporal dynamics. This new method was developed using time series products provided by MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI sensors. Moreover the proposed procedure does not depend on ancillary data, and it is only based on remotely sensed vegetation indices and day-night time land surface temperature differences.
   Two different test areas located in Sicily were selected for testing and validating the approach. Satellite ET rates were validated versus directly measured fluxes of mass (ET) obtained by eddy covariance (EC) towers during the observation period 2010-2012.
   The proposed approach predicts daily ET rates with an acceptable level of accuracy for practical purposes; therefore, the TDTM can be considered as a simple and effective tool to easily estimate, at regional scale, spatial and temporal changes of this key-variable related to water resource management, agriculture, ecology and climate change.

AB Peatlands are a major reservoir of global soil carbon, yet account for just 3% of global land cover. Human impacts like draining can hinder the ability of peatlands to sequester carbon and expose their soils to fire under dry conditions. Estimating soil carbon loss from peat fires can be challenging due to uncertainty about pre-fire surface elevations. This study uses multi-temporal LiDAR to obtain pre- and post-fire elevations and estimate soil carbon loss caused by the 2011 Lateral West fire in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, VA, USA. We also determine how LiDAR elevation error affects uncertainty in our carbon loss estimate by randomly perturbing the LiDAR point elevations and recalculating elevation change and carbon loss, iterating this process 1000 times. We calculated a total loss using LiDAR of 1.10 Tg C across the 25 km(2) burned area The fire burned an average of 47 cm deep, equivalent to 44 kg C/m(2), a value larger than the 1997 Indonesian peat fires (29 kg C/m(2)). Carbon loss via the First-Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) was estimated to be 0.06 Tg C. Propagating the LiDAR elevation error to the carbon loss estimates, we calculated a standard deviation of 0.00009 Tg C, equivalent to 0.008% of total carbon loss. We conclude that LiDAR elevation error is not a significant contributor to uncertainty in soil carbon loss under severe fire conditions with substantial peat consumption. However, uncertainties may be more substantial when soil elevation loss is of a similar or smaller magnitude than the reported LiDAR error. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Land surface albedo is an essential climate variable that is tightly linked to land cover, such that specific land cover classes (e.g., deciduous broadleaf forest, cropland) have characteristic albedos. Despite the normative of land-cover class specific albedos, there is considerable variability in albedo within a land cover class. The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product were combined to produce a long-term (14 years) integrated land cover-albedo database for the continental United States that can be used to examine the temporal behavior of albedo as a function of land cover. The integration identifies areas of homogeneous land cover at the nominal spatial resolution of the MODIS (MCD43A) albedo product (500 m x 500 m) from the NLCD product (30 m x 30 m), and provides an albedo data record per 500 m x 500 m pixel for 14 of the 16 NLCD land cover classes. Individual homogeneous land cover pixels have up to 605 albedo observations, and 75% of the pixels have at least 319 MODIS albedo observations (>= 50% of the maximum possible number of observations) for the study period (2000-2013). We demonstrated the utility of the database by conducting a multivariate analysis of variance of albedo for each NLCD land cover class, showing that locational (pixel-to-pixel) and inter-annual variability were significant factors in addition to expected seasonal (intra-annual) and geographic (latitudinal) effects.

AB Orbital imaging spectrometers, such as the proposed Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide global, multi-year Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) reflectance maps. Monitoring the Earth's surface at high spectral resolution will advance our understanding of changing ecosystems and land use. These applications depend on reliable correction of atmospheric scattering and absorption. The HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign is an airborne precursor mission comprised of multiple flights by the "classic" Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) over a wide geographic area. This article describes the atmospheric correction that we have implemented for the campaign. We first present the theoretical basis of our approach, which is grounded in the ATmospheric REMoval (ATREM) algorithm. We then describe new enhancements including retrieval of pressure altitude, which improves accuracy over widely varying topography, and joint retrieval of optical absorption for three phases of water (vapor, liquid, and ice), which improves accuracy over vegetated areas. Reflectance is validated using ground spectra acquired across a wide range of targets and elevations. Finally, we use the algorithm to map vapor, liquid, and ice phases of water over 6 months across a 14,000 km(2) region of California. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have shown that the floristic composition of northern peatlands provides important information regarding ecosystem processes and their responses to environmental change. Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AEA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82% and more than 96% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r(val)(2) = 0.74, 0.45 and 030 for the first three ordination axes and r(val)(2) = 0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PVC is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped. The resultant mapped floristic gradients enabled visualisation of homogeneous vegetation stands, heterogeneous mixtures of different key species and PFTs, and the presence of continuous and abrupt floristic transitions, without the need for unique spectral signatures or the collection of data characterising ancillary environmental variables.

TI SST Pattern Test in ACSPO clear-sky mask for VIIRS

ID EDGE-DETECTION; ALGORITHM
AB Discriminating clear-ocean from cloud in the thermal IR imagery is challenging, especially at night. Thresholds in automated cloud detection algorithms are often set conservatively leading to underestimation of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) domain. Yet an expert user can visually distinguish the cloud patterns from SST. In this study, available pattern recognition methodologies are discussed and an automated SST Pattern Test (SPT) is formulated. Analyses are performed with SSTs retrieved from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard S-NPP using the NOAA operational Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) system. Based on the analyses of global data, we have identified spatial features potentially useful for discriminating cloud from clear-ocean. The SPT attempts to mimic the visual perception by a human operator such as gradient information, spatial connectivity, and high/low frequency discrimination. It first identifies contiguous areas with similar features, and then makes a decision based on the statistics of the whole region, rather than on a per pixel basis. The initial objective of the SPT was to automatically identify clear sky regions misclassified by ACSPO clear sky mask as cloudy, and improve coverage in dynamic areas of the ocean and in the coastal zones. Future work will be directed towards extending the SPT to also minimize cloud leakages, and redesigning the current ACSPO clear-sky mask making full use of pattern recognition approach.

AB Accurate measurement of ice-flow velocity of floating glaciers is required to estimate ice mass balance from volume flux thinning/thickening, basal melting/freezing, and surface accumulation/ablation. We derived a tide-corrected ice velocity map and mass budget of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in East Antarctica by using 14 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) pairs obtained from January to November 2011. The vertical tidal deflection of CGT was estimated and removed from the DInSAR images by using a tide deflection ratio map generated by double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) method. We then generated averaged ice-flow velocity (v map) and its standard deviation (cry map). Ice-flow velocity increased from the upper part of the grounding line (similar to 020 m d(-1)) to the seaward edge of CGT (similar to 0.67 md(-1)) with sigma(v), less than similar to 0.04 m d(-1) in the main stream of CGT. The eastern part of CGT flows slower than the western part because it is grounded along the flow line and thus experiences severe basal drag. Flux mass balance (FMB), i.e., ice thickness change by volume flux divergence, of CGT was obtained by combining the v map and an ice thickness value of 340 +/- 18 m estimated by the ICESat GLAS data. We used mass conservation assumption in which total mass balance (TMB, -629 +/- 137 m a(-1) observed by ICESat GLAS data) is attributed to FMB, basal mass balance (BMB) and surface mass balance (SMB, 024 +/- 0.02 m a(-1)). Mass loss in the freely floating zone of CGT is mainly caused by basal melting (BMB = -144.5 +/- 39.9 Mt a(-1)) while thinning by volume flux (FMB = -67.2 +/- 8.9 Mt a(-1)) is relatively small. In the hinge zone of CGT, mass change is contributed to FMB of -147.3 +/- 25.2 Mt a(-1) and BMB of 15.3 +/- 39.8 Mt a(-1). However, basal freezing derived for the hinge zone may be erroneous as a result of the constant ice thickness assumption extrapolated from the freely floating zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The focus of the current study is to compare data fusion methods applied to sensors with medium- and high-spatial resolutions. Two documented methods are applied, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based method which proposes a Bayesian formulation to incorporate prior spectral information. Furthermore, the strengths of both algorithms are combined in a novel data fusion method: the Spatial and Temporal Reflectance Unmixing Model (STRUM). The potential of each method is demonstrated using simulation imagery and Landsat and MODIS imagery. The theoretical basis of the algorithms causes STARFM and STRUM to produce Landsat-like reflectances while preserving the spatial patterns found in Landsat images, and the unmixing-based method to produce MODIS-like reflectances. The ability of fused images to capture phenological variations is also assessed using temporal NDVI profiles. Temporal profiles of STARFM NDVI closely resembled Landsat NDVI profiles. However, the unmixing-based method and STRUM produced a more accurate reconstruction of the NDVI trajectory in experiments simulating situations where few input high-resolution images are available. STRUM had the best performance as it produced surface reflectances which had the highest correlations to reference Landsat images. The results of this study indicate that STRUM is more suitable for data fusion applications requiring Landsat-like surface reflectances, such as gap-filling and cloud masking, especially in situations where few high-resolution images are available. Unmixing-based data fusion is recommended in situations which downscale the spectral characteristics of the medium-resolution input imagery and the STARFM method is recommended for constructing temporal profiles in applications containing many input high-resolution images.

AB The European Space Agency's Data User Element (DUE) project GlobSnow was established to create a global database of Snow Extent and Snow Water Equivalent The Snow Extent (SE) product portfolio provided within ESA DUE GlobSnow (2008-2014) is introduced and described, with a special focus on the Daily Fractional Snow Cover (DFSC) of the SE version 2.0 and its successor 2.1 released in 2013-2014. The fractional snow retrieval uses the SCAmod method designed ecpecially to enable accurate snow mapping including forests. The basics of the methodology are presented, as well as the cloud screening method applied in SE production. Considerations for future validations together with discussion on some current issues and potential inaccuracies are presented. One focus of the investigation is on the representativeness of reference FSC generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data, with a particular interest in forested areas. Two methods for reference data generation are investigated. When comparing the GlobSnow Daily Fractional Snow Cover to these reference data, we try to identify how the comparison reflects the possible inaccuracies of the DFSC and to define the conditions where the reference data are not representative. It is obvious that the evaluation result strongly depends on the quality of the reference data, and that the two methods investigated cannot provide representative reference data for dense forests. For fully snow-covered dense conifer forest area in Finland, a Root Mean Squared Error of 20-30% was obtained from comparisons although DFSC indicated full snow cover correctly. These first evaluations would indicate a good performance of GlobSnow SE products in forests; however, this does not necessarily show up in validations due to the non-representativeness of the reference data. It is also concluded that GlobSnow SE products are sensitive to the representativeness of the applied SCAmod parameters and that FSC overestimations may occur in dense forests.

AB In an image from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) taken on 13 June 2011, a recurrent floating green algae bloom was detected around Qingdao. To detect the bloom an index based on multi-spectral band ratios using three wavelengths (555, 660, 745 nm) was utilized. One month later, the GOCI images detected widespread floating green algae patches (east west elongated) across the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YS, ECS). The presence of the patches was confirmed from various oceanic observation cruises. Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were conducted to understand the pathway of the floating green algae patches and interpret the physical forcing factors that affect the distribution and advection of the floating green algae. The numerical simulation results indicated that dominant southerly winds during June and July 2011 were related to offshore movement of the floating green algae, especially their eastward extension in the YS/ECS. An infrequent and unusual event occurred in June 2011: a typhoon MEARI, caused the green algae to detach from the coast and initiated movement to the east. After the typhoon event, sea surface temperature recovered rapidly enough to grow the floating green algae, and wind and local current controlled the movement of the massive floating algae patches (coastal accumulation or offshore advection in the YS/ECS). Analysis of the floating green algae pixels' movement during passage of Typhoon MAON in July 2011 revealed that the floating green algae patches were significantly controlled by both ocean currents and enhanced winds. These findings suggest that the floating green algae bloom off Qingdao and in the middle of the YS and ECS in the summer of 2011 occurred due to the combined effects of recent rapid expansion of seaweed aquaculture, strong winds, and the wind patterns in blooming regions. Our combined approach, using satellite data and numerical simulations, provides a robust estimate for tracing and monitoring changes in green algae blooms on a regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Douro is one of the longest rivers in the Iberian Peninsula and represents the most important freshwater input into the Atlantic Ocean in the northwestern Portuguese coast. In order to fill the gaps on the comprehension of the spatial variability of the Douro estuarine plume, an innovative methodology was applied to observe and characterize this plume and its spatial and temporal variability. Using images of normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) in combination with long-term concurrent wind, tidal and river discharge data (2003-2011), this work evaluates the effect of the main drivers (river discharge, wind and tide) on the plume features. Expected strong relationships between river discharge and turbid levels were detected. A circular pattern is well distinct off Douro estuary when the flow exceeds 500 m(3) s(-1). Under upwelling favorable winds and high river discharge regime, an offshore expansion is observed. During southerly winds, there is a plume confinement to the coast. Easterly winds produce a bulge formation with an offshore detachment from the coast while westerly winds tend to confine freshwater close to the shoreline and decrease the cross-shore advection. Under high river discharges, a remarkable tidal influence in the near-field regions is observed close to the coast and near the river mouth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a method for (i) obtaining particulate absorption coefficients from optical remote sensing reflectance signals and (ii) partitioning these coefficients into separate components for phytoplankton cells and mineral particles. This method makes the initial assumption that absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the region of interest is either constant, or so low that its variability can be neglected. It uses a slightly modified version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (Lee et al., 2009) to recover the non-water absorption (a) and particulate backscattering (bbp) coefficients, and then obtains an estimate of absorption by CDOM, and the bacicscattering to absorption ratios for minerals and phytoplankton, by fitting upper and lower boundaries to the resulting data cluster. These ratios are employed in linear un-mixing equations to resolve the contributions of phytoplanlcton and minerals to the particulate absorption coefficient. The performance of the method was evaluated using reflectance spectra generated by an optical model of the Irish Sea which incorporated realistic specific inherent optical properties and distributions of constituent concentrations. It was then used to recover absorption coefficients for phytoplankton and suspended minerals in the 488 nm waveband from MODIS remote sensing data for the central Irish Sea for the period May 2005-November 2012. The partitioned coefficients showed strong seasonality, with suspended mineral absorption peaking in winter and phytoplanlcton absorption becoming dominant in spring and summer. By employing locally determined specific inherent optical properties, it was possible to estimate the average annual cycles in the concentrations of the two constituents. These cycles proved to be consistent with previously published models of particle dynamics in the region in which mineral concentrations are elevated by winter mixing and increasing water column stability in spring is followed by a period of phytoplankton growth. We conclude that it is possible to resolve the separate contributions of phytoplankton and minerals to particulate absorption in waters where these constituents are the dominant determinants of optical variability, and that the partitioned absorption coefficients can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of biogenic and minerogenic particles in shelf sea ecosystems. 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The Erguna floodplain, located on the boundary of China, Russia, and Mongolia, is a globally important breeding and stop-over site for many migratory bird species. However, it has a fragile ecosystem and is facing severe impacts from climate change and human activities. Motivated by the high demand for spatial and temporal information about flooding dynamics and vegetation patterns, six fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images acquired with the same configuration were explored to reveal the characteristics of the floodplain. The evaluation of a set of polarimetric observables derived from the series of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data was used to investigate the characteristics of the typical land-cover types in the floodplain. The behaviors of the polarimetric features highlight the benefits of interpreting the scattering mechanism evolutions at different phenological and inundation stages. The vegetation and inundation patterns were mapped by a random forest (RF) classifier with the input of these polarimetric observations. The results show that a multi-temporal classification can better capture the spatial distribution of the vegetation pattern than single-temporal classifications, which often show a large variability due to the effect of phenology and flooding. A hydroperiod map, which was generated by the time-series classification results of open water, illustrates the flooding temporal dynamics and the hydrological regime. The two main environmental factors that induced the changes in the backscattering - phenology and flooding - were identified based on the aggregated classification results of different phenological intervals. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the phenology- and flooding-induced changes were documented by the changes in the trajectories of three patch metrics at the class level. The polarimetric features' importance scores derived from the RF classifier indicate that the intensity-related features are important for land-cover mapping. The HV intensity, in particular, achieves the highest importance score. In addition, the volume scattering component shows a better performance among the composite features, revealing the importance of the quad-polarimetric information for floodplain interpretation and monitoring.

AB Agricultural production capacity contributes to food security in Afghanistan and is largely dependent on irrigated farming, mostly utilizing surface water fed by snowmelt. Because of the high contribution of irrigated crops (>80%) to total agricultural production, knowing the spatial distribution and year-to-year variability in irrigated areas is imperative to monitoring food security for the country. We used 16-day composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to create 23-point time series for each year from 2000 through 2013. Seasonal peak values and time series were used in a threshold-dependent decision tree algorithm to map irrigated areas in Afghanistan for the last 14 years. In the absence of ground reference irrigated area information, we evaluated these maps with the irrigated areas classified from multiple snapshots of the landscape during the growing season from Landsat 5 optical and thermal sensor images. We were able to identify irrigated areas using Landsat imagery by selecting as irrigated those areas with Landsat-derived NDVI greater than 0.30-0.45, depending on the date of the Landsat image and surface temperature less than or equal to 310 Kelvin (36.9 degrees C). Due to the availability of Landsat images, we were able to compare with the MODIS-derived maps for four years: 2000, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The irrigated areas derived from Landsat agreed well r(2) = 0.91 with the irrigated areas derived from MODIS, providing confidence in the MODIS NDVI threshold approach. The maps portrayed a highly dynamic irrigated agriculture practice in Afghanistan, where the amount of irrigated area was largely determined by the availability of surface water, especially snowmelt, and varied by as much as 30% between water surplus and water deficit years. During the past 14 years, 2001, 2004, and 2008 showed the lowest levels of irrigated area (similar to 15 million hectares), attesting to the severe drought conditions in those years, whereas 2009, 2012 and 2013 registered the largest irrigated area (similar to 2.5 million hectares) due to record snowpack and snowmelt in the region. The model holds promise the ability to provide near-real-time (by the end of the growing seasons) estimates of irrigated area, which are beneficial for food security monitoring as well as subsequent decision making for the country. While the model is developed for Afghanistan, it can be adopted with appropriate adjustments in the derived threshold values to map irrigated areas elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data for generating Digital Terrain Models (DTM) at national level are often collected during leaf-off seasons. Leaf-off data are useful for classifying evergreen and deciduous trees since echoes at lower intensity are returned from deciduous trees when compared to evergreen trees. In addition to this, the proportion of echoes from the ground is higher for deciduous trees than for evergreen trees. In this study, we classified land cover, including evergreen and deciduous trees, using a Random Forest classifier based on LiDAR-metrics generated from leaf-off ALS data, and estimated tree cover and tree heights for the whole of Denmark. The results were compared with the CORINE Land Cover (CLC2006) data, percentage of tree cover from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) and a global tree height map based on ICESat data. Considering tree class alone, deciduous and evergreen trees could be classified with an overall accuracy of 94% using validation data generated using aerial imagery from a 60-km strip across Central Jutland. The lower values of ALS-based percentage tree cover were overestimated and the higher values underestimated by MODIS VCF data, with a root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of 18.26%. The tree heights estimated using ALS data were generally lower than the global estimates of tree height with an RMS deviation of 5.1 m. The ALS intensity values were useful for classifying evergreen and deciduous trees. These findings show that ALS datasets collected for generating national DTMs can be used for tree cover and tree height mapping, as well as for regional classification of trees if data over the whole area are collected within a few months in the leaf-off season.

AB The regional daily-integrated net primary production (NPP) model for the Chesapeake Bay, Chesapeake Bay Production Model (CBPM), has been improved for use with ocean color products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua. A polynomial regression formula for the photosynthetic parameter (i.e., optimal carbon fixation rate, P-opt(B)) as a function of sea surface temperature (SST) was derived for the Chesapeake Bay. Results show that the CBPM-derived NPP using the new model for P-opt(B) are improved for the Chesapeake Bay. Comparisons of MODIS-Aqua-derived and in situ-measured NPP show that the satellite-derived data correspond reasonably well to in situ measurements, although MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP values may be slightly overestimated for the upper Bay, primarily due to uncertainties in the bio-optical algorithm for satellite ocean color products for that region. We also generated MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP maps using the improved CBPM for the period of 2002 to 2011 to characterize NPP in the Chesapeake Bay. Spatial distributions of MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP products show that higher NPP values are generally found in the southern upper Bay and northern middle Bay (regions around 38.3 degrees N-39.0 degrees N), including the Potomac River, while relatively low NPP values were found in the northern upper Bay, the eastern area of middle Bay, and lower Bay. The temporal pattern of MODIS-Aqua-derived NPP showed lowest values in winter (December to February) over the entire Bay, while high NPP values were in late spring to summer (May to August), depending on location. Furthermore, there is a strong interannual variability in NPP for the Chesapeake Bay, and an apparent increasing trend from 2003 to 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB As cloud cover exacerbates the application of optical satellite data for forest monitoring in tropical wet and dry regions during the rainy season, data acquisition is mainly restricted to the dry season. When analyzing wide areas, large numbers of single scenes obtained at different times of the dry season are often handled. Such imagery is characterized by changes of spectral reflectance due to vegetation phenology, varying atmospheric effects and solar geometries. In order to allow batch processing with automatic classification techniques, inter-scene comparability is required and data have to be radiometrically normalized. Cambodia is characterized by a mixture of evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest types, the latter two experiencing at least partial leaf shedding over the course of the dry season. Using spatial medium resolution SPOT 4 data and a manually delineated base map a season adjustment model was developed. The model is adapting the land cover specific spectral signatures of a slave scene (acquired in the middle of the dry season with its seasonal forests defoliated) to an adjacent master scene (from the beginning of the dry season, showing the same forest types with leafs). The relative position of every pixel reflectance was determined in relation to the mean reflectance and its standard deviation for each land cover type and sensor band of the unadjusted slave scene. For seasonality adjustment these pixel reflectance values were transformed (rescaled) to the corresponding position in spectral space defined by the band mean reflectance and standard deviation derived from the corresponding land cover class of the master scene. While the variability of spectral profiles of the pixels in the slave scene is rescaled, the mean reflectance value of the land cover class in the slave scene is conformed to the mean reflectance of the corresponding land cover class in the master scene. The Transformed Divergence (TD) separability index was used to indicate the performance of the adjustment process by characterizing the spectral distance for each land cover type comparing a reference dataset to the uncorrected and to the seasonality corrected scene respectively. While the TD values of all forest types showed a sharp decline, highlighting the good performance of the model, the TD values of the agriculture/urban class remained high, indicating limited normalization of this heterogeneous land cover type. In order to further demonstrate the performance of the model, an object-based land cover classification was applied to the unadjusted as well as to the corresponding adjusted scene. A comparison of the results showed a highly significant improvement of overall accuracy from 32.2% to 75.8% when applying seasonality adjustment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched in October 2011 aboard the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. The VIIRS instrument carries two separate sets of multi-spectral channels providing full global coverage at both 375 m and 750 m nominal resolutions every 12 h or less depending on the latitude. In this study, we introduce a new VIIRS active fire detection algorithm, which is driven primarily by the 375 m middle and thermal infrared imagery data. The algorithm builds on the well-established MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product using a contextual approach to detect both day and nighttime biomass burning and other thermal anomalies. Here we present the fire algorithm's design and implementation, including important information describing the input data characteristics and potential artifacts associated with pixel saturation and the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, both found to affect the middle infrared channel data. Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors (<1.2%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375 m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750 m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3 x and 25 x factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375 m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days.

AB The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is recognized as an essential climate variable (ECVs), playing a critical role in the estimation of the global energy and carbon balance. With multiple space-borne remote sensing FAPAR global products available from several sources the need for continual comparison and validation has become imperative. In this study, the performance of three global FAPAR algorithms (JRC-TIP, ESA/JRC MGVI and Boston University FAPAR) was evaluated over Europe for the year 2011. Results show an overall agreement among FAPAR products on sites having high and low FAPAR values, except for the north-eastern region of Europe characterized by boreal forest and the transition region with tundra biomes, where the Boston product exceeds values in other products by up to 0.5. Differences in FAPAR estimates over forest biomes suggest that assumptions on structure and optical properties of land surfaces in the different radiative transfer models play an important role in remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Uncertainty assessments were carried out using both quality indicators as proposed by the individual product teams as well as independent theoretical uncertainty estimates obtained with the triple collocation error model. The former revealed consistent spatial patterns but large differences in magnitudes (up to 0.1) with systematically lower uncertainties for the Boston product The latter instead suggests similar uncertainty ranges among the three products. Finally, a comparison with ground estimates for the 2009-2011 period over four European flux tower sites showed consistent, plausible seasonal variations of remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Findings suggest that differences in absolute values and inconsistency in uncertainty representation among FAPAR products are still considerable. Standardization frameworks quantifying the impact of different radiative transfer formulations on the estimation of biophysical variables, independent uncertainty estimation methods and well-defined ground measurement protocols need to be put in place before FAPAR products can be reliably fed into existing biogeochemical process models.

AB Reindeer and caribou are keystone species in the circumpolar region, and rely on lichens as their main winter forage to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. Lichen mats, however, can be heavily overgrazed at high deer densities, triggering area abandonment or population declines. Although the species' management and conservation require precise information on the quality of winter grazing areas, no reliable and cost-efficient methods are available to date to measure lichen volume across wide and remote areas. We developed a new Lichen Volume Estimator, LVE, using remote sensing and field measurements. We used a Landsat TM land cover mask to separate lichen heath communities from other vegetation types and, therein, we predicted lichen volume from a two dimensional Gaussian regression model using two indexes: the Normalized Difference Lichen Index, NDLI (Band 5 - Band 4/ Band 5 + Band 4), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index, NDMI (Band 4 - Band 5 / Band 4 + Band 5). The model was parameterized using 202 ground measurements equally distributed across a gradient ranging from 0 to 80 lichen dm(3)/m(2) (R-2 = 0.74 between predicted and observed ground measurements), and was validated with a ten-fold cross validation procedure (R-2 = 0.67), which also showed a high parameter stability. The LW can be a valuable tool to predict the quality of winter pastures for reindeer and caribou and, thus, help to improve the species' management and conservation. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Bio-optical data for spring and summer phytoplankton blooms at 176 stations along the Patagonia Shelf break and adjacent areas were collected from October 2006 to January 2009 during six cruises. Data included chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla), coefficients of particulate absorption, a(p)(lambda), phytoplankton absorption, a(ph)(lambda), beam attenuation, c(p)(660), diffuse attenuation, K-d(lambda), and hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda). Surface Chla varied within a wide range from 0.10 to 18.87 mg m(-3) (mean of 2.82 +/- 3.35), reflecting differences in both, the timing of the blooms and the geographical sampling area. Considerable dispersion was verified for a(p)(lambda), c(p)(660), and K-bio(440) (K-d(440) minus diffuse attenuation for pure water) as a function of Chla. A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) applied to the R-rs(lambda) spectra (N = 116) resulted in three classes ordered by spectral features that varied according to Chla. Class 1 (N = 22), Class 2 (N = 52), and Class 3 (N = 42) were grouped according to the R-rs(lambda) associated with Chla average of 0.86 (+/- 0.51), 2.42 (+/- 1.62), and 8.40 mg m(-3) (+/- 3.96), respectively. The estimation of Chla and a(ph)(lambda) by empirical and semi-analytical algorithms was evaluated using satellite data. Errors in the Chla estimates from the empirical algorithm OC4v6 using in situ R-rs(lambda) showed significant statistical relationships with Chla, a(ph)(440) / Chla, and b(p)(660) / Chla (where b(p)(660) = c(p)(660) - a(p)(660)). Although reasonable agreements were found between the measured and satellite-estimated values, the dependence of the OC4v6 errors on the Chla-specific phytoplankton absorption and particulate scattering coefficients reinforces the need to regionally refine both empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to improve satellite estimates of the bio-optical variables for the Patagonia region.

AB Information on vegetation phenology and land cover for the area of the Mekong Basin are derived for the year 2010, based on optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). On account of almost persistent cloud cover in the rainy season, the application of optical remote sensing data presents a challenging exercise and demands special data processing and classification methods. An Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series is produced based on data from both platforms AQUA and TERRA, with dropouts and noise being effectively-reduced by applying an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter. Thereby, different parameterisation is applied dependent on the number of harvest cycles, which are defined by an initial harmonic analysis, based on an EVI time series of 5 years. Information on land cover is derived by a multistep unsupervised classification approach optimised for regions with frequent cloud cover, based on multispectral monthly and seasonal composites, amplitude and phase information from a 11-year EVI time series (2001-2011), and phenological metrics from 2010. Moreover, the environmental heterogenic conditions in the region are addressed by a regionally tuned clustering approach based on physiographic subregions and the use of auxiliary geodata. The results obtained demonstrate that the adapted approach performs satisfactory in terms of accuracy under given conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The high temporal resolution and large coverage of coarse- to moderate-resolution satellite imagery, such as NOAA/AVHRR and EOS-TERRA/MODIS, are very advantageous for flood monitoring, but their coarse spatial resolution hinders their wider application. Overcoming this limitation is an interesting scientific challenge with substantial application potential.
   When both the total water area and topography are known, it is possible to locate regional water distribution in small regions, e.g., less than 1 km(2). The water fraction derived from TERRA/MODIS not only provides the water area in 500-m pixels, but it also contains geo-location information in each pixel, providing a potential way to derive high-resolution water maps with the use of SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) data. In this study we introduce an integration method to downscale MODIS 500-m water fraction maps to 30-m water maps with SKIM 30-m DEM data. The method uses an iteration cycle to compare water fraction by increasing water surface level based on the minimal elevation (searched from the 30-m SRTM cells within a 500-m pixel) to water fraction retrieved with dynamic nearest neighboring searching (DNNS) method from TERRA/MODIS multi-channel data, and iterations are terminated when the two fractions are equal to each other. The final water surface level is viewed as the maximal water surface level and smoothed by a uniformity process to reduce the impact from TERRA/MODIS water fraction retrieval errors. Then, cells in SRTM 30-m DEM with elevation between the minimal and maximal water surface levels are assigned as water to generate 30-m water maps.
   The presented method was applied to the Mississippi River flood of May 2011 and showed promising results. A validation analysis was performed using simultaneous Landsat TM 30-m data, Worldview-2 2-m data and river gauge observations and showed high consistency between integrated MODIS 30-m water maps and high resolution real-time satellite water maps, and the matched rate with TM is above 93%. The calculated maximal water surface levels used for integration are also close to the water levels observed at river gauges along Mississippi River. The validation result indicates the feasibility of this method to derive high-resolution water maps from coarse- or moderate-resolution satellite data, which can significantly improve the capability of these satellite data in flood analysis for decision-makers and downstream users.

AB Remote sensing detection of suspended particulate composition is of importance for understanding variability of water optical properties, especially in complex-material loading turbid inland waters. To achieve this goal, this study carried out multiple in situ bio-optical investigations during the period of 2008 similar or equal to 2010, covering Lake Taihu, Chaohu, Dianchi, and Three Gorges reservoir in China. Using the collected in situ observed datasets, a semi-analytical approach was developed based on theoretical derivation of the water radiative transfer theory. This algorithmshowed relatively high calibration accuracy, and was further evaluated bymeans of an independent validation dataset, producing low predictive errors (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE = 29.5%, and root mean square error, RMSE = 0.23, 10(-3)). Then, the developed algorithmwas applied into a new hyperspectral satellite data, namely the HJ1A/HSI image, mapping spatio-temporal distribution of suspended particulate composition for Lake Taihu waters. The findings in the present study indicate that the proposed approach has a great potential in detecting particulate composition of water bodies. This study provides us improved understanding of particulate composition characteristics and corresponding spatio-temporal distribution for complex turbid inland waters.

AB Total suspended particulate matter (TSM) in coastal waters is often characterized by high concentration and significant diurnal dynamics. Insufficient spatial and temporal resolution limits both cruise sampling and polar-orbiting satellite remote sensing in the mapping of TSM diurnal dynamics in coastal regions. However, the in-orbit operation of the world's first geostationary satellite ocean color sensor, GOCI, provides hourly observations of the covered area. In this study, we proposed a practical atmospheric correction algorithm for GOCI data in turbid waters. The validation results showed that the GOCI-retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances matched the in situ values well in both quantity and spectral shapes. We also developed a regional empirical TSM algorithm for GOCI data that is applicable in extremely turbid waters. Based on these atmospheric correction and regional TSM algorithms, we generated hourly TSM maps from GOCI Level-1B data. The diurnal variations derived by GOCI were a good match to the buoy data. The hourly GOCI observations revealed that various regions and tidal phases had different diurnal variation magnitudes, with a maximum of up to 5000 mg/l in central Hangzhou Bay. Strong wind events, such as typhoons, can significantly increase TSM in the bay; however, both the GOCI observations and buoy measurements indicated that this increase was episodic, had a short duration, and returned to normal within a day after the passage of a typhoon. Our results suggest that GOCI can successfully map the diurnal dynamics of TSM in turbid coastal waters. Moreover, the significant diurnal dynamics revealed in the hourly GOCI observations implied that caution should be taken in mapping TSM in coastal waters using cruise sampling and conventional polar-orbiting satellite data, as the temporal resolution is insufficient for catching diurnal variations.

AB SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) data have now been available for over two years and, as part of the validation process, comparing this new dataset to already existing global datasets of soil moisture is possible. In this study, SMOS soil moisture product was evaluated globally by using the triple collocation method. This statistical method is based on the comparison of three datasets and produces global error maps by statistically inter-comparing their variations. Only the variable part of the errors are considered here, the bias errors are not treated by triple collocation. This method was applied to the following datasets: SMOS Level 2 product, two soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer)-LPRM (Land Parameter Retrieval Model) and NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center), ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting). The resulting errors are not absolute since they depend on the choice of the datasets. However this study showed that the spatial structure of the SMOS was independent of the combination and pointed out the same areas where SMOS performed well and where it did not. This global SMOS error map was then linked to other global parameters such as soil texture, RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) occurrence probabilities and land cover in order to identify their influences in the SMOS error. Globally the presence of forest in the field of view of the radiometer seemed to have the greatest influence on SMOS error (56.8%) whereas RFI represented 1.7% according to the analysis of variance from a multiple linear regression model. These percentages were not identical for all the continents and some discrepancies in the proportion of the influence were highlighted: soil texture was the main influence over Europe whereas RFI had the largest influence over Asia.

AB This study provides insight into the assessment of the spatio-temporal trends of chlorophyll fluorescence, narrow-band physiological indices, and structural indices acquired with a hyperspectral imager flown over a flux tower in a canopy characterized by small seasonal structural changes and a heterogeneous architecture. A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30 cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900 nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r(2) = 0.17; p > 0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r(2) in the range 0.75-0.84; p < 0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9% while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAI(p)) remained almost constant during the experiment (3% variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p > 0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17% at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAI(p) showed little variation during that time (CV = 1.8%). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9%. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Wishart classification, utilizing polarimetric parameters alpha (alpha) and entropy (H), was performed on airborne L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar to identify dominant scattering mechanisms within each pixel. The scattering classes were then attributed to structural forms of either excurrent (large, central stem with minimal branching) or decurrent (diffuse branching) trees. To test the classification for a variety of forest structures, three contrasting study areas were chosen; a wooded savanna at the Injune Landscape Collaborative Project in Queensland, Australia, a managed transitional boreal-hardwood forest at the Howland Research Forest in Howland, Maine, and a transitional hardwood-pine forest at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts. Two questions are answered in this study: can the polarimetric parameters alpha and H characterize structurally similar areas within forests? And can they consistently differentiate these areas across multiple study areas? It is shown that the classification explained nearly 80% of the forest composition at the Injune Collaborative Research Site, 47% at the Howland Research Forest and 40% at the Harvard Forest. Classification accuracy decreases with high levels of H, which is a limiting factor at Howland and Harvard forests where canopy heterogeneity, density and moisture content are higher. When high-H Wishart classes (H>0.9) are omitted from analysis, accuracy improves to 83% and 86% for the Injune Collaborative Research Site and Harvard Forest respectively. The success of the Wishart classification at low-H indicates that there is a potential for using polarimetric information to characterize forest composition in particular landscapes; namely those that do not exhibit a high, homogeneous H response.

AB Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mg m(-3)) in optically complex waters using remote sensing is difficult because traditional empirical (e.g., OCx blue/green band ratios) or semi-analytical algorithms (e.g., GSM or QAA) rely on blue-green wavelengths where water constituents other than phytoplankton often dominate the optical properties and satellite-derived reflectance in these wavelengths often contains substantial uncertainties. Some recent attempts have been made to derive Chla based on red and near-infrared wavelengths to avoid such problems. Using in situ data collected from 9 cruises between 1998 and 2010 in Tampa Bay, a large estuary (similar to 1000 km(2)) located in Florida (U.S.A.), we first tested three Chla algorithms, where each algorithm derived Chla as a function of independent variable x = Rrs(lambda(2))/Rrs(lambda(1)), x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)] * Rrs(lambda(3)), and x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[Rrs(lambda(4))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)], respectively. Here Rrs(lambda) is the remote sensing reflectance, lambda is the wavelength from 660 to 760 nm, and the positions of the these wavelengths were determined using an objective method while the functional forms of Chla=f(x) were determined through regression between Chla and x. A synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) using 4 green-red MERIS wavelengths was also tested. Using field measured Rrs(lambda) data, all these algorithms showed the potentials to retrieve Chla between similar to 2 and similar to 80 mg m(-3), with 2-band algorithms showing the best performance. However, when satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) data were used, none of the four algorithms was applicable to MODIS in this estuary, and only a 2-band algorithm in the form of Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) was applicable to MERIS, with other algorithms significantly degraded. The coefficients of the 2-band algorithm for MERIS were determined through regression between in situ Chla and MERIS-derived Rrs(709)/Rrs(665), with the final form of Chla = 10.55x(1.51). The algorithm yielded mean relative errors of 35.3% for Chla between 1.0 and 30.0 mg m(-3) when an in situ dataset from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) was used to tune the algorithm coefficients, which was further validated using another independent dataset. Spatial Chla patterns derived from MERIS for both low and high concentrations also showed reasonable agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, 3-band and 4-band algorithms yielded significant patchiness in spatial patterns that differed from in situ measurements. Tests in Chesapeake Bay (located on the east coast of the U.S.A.) showed reasonable spatial patterns of Chla using the Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) approach, with a mean relative error of 34.7% for Chla ranging between 1.6 and 21.5 mg m(-3), suggesting that the approach may be generally applicable to other turbid estuaries once algorithm coefficients are adjusted using local data.

AB In this study, a simple model was developed to estimate crop gross prirnary productivity (GPP) using a product of chlorophyll-related vegetation index, retrieved from MODIS 250 m data, and potential photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Potential PAR is incident photosynthetically active radiation under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. This model was proposed for GPP estimation based entirely on satellite data, and it was tested in maize and soybean, which are contrasting crop types different in leaf structures and canopy architectures, under different crop managements and climatic conditions. The model using MODIS 250 m data, which brings high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, was capable of estimating GPP accurately in both irrigated and rainfed croplands in three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites during growing seasons 2001 through 2008. Among the MODIS-250 m retrieved indices tested, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) were the most accurate for GPP estimation with coefficients of variation below 20% in maize and 25% in soybean. It was shown that the developed model was able to accurately detect GPP variation in crops where total chlorophyll content is closely tied to seasonal dynamic of GPP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Systematic error in long-term satellite data records resulting from inter-sensor differences or other persistent influences such as satellite orbital drift can greatly affect the use of these data to monitor land surface dynamics and trends. In this research an identification and correction procedure for systematic error is developed and used to evaluate the NOAA AVHRR long-term satellite data record produced by the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS). The record is composed of observations acquired by seven AVHRR sensors during the period 1985-2011. It includes two types of AVHRR sensor: AVHHR-2 flown onboard NOAA-9, -11, and -14, and AVHRR-3 onboard NOAA-16, -17, -18 and -19. Systematic error between sensors was identified through evaluation of synchronized nadir overpass (SNO) observations. The first order systematic error correction was derived from SNO comparison and then further optimized using a reference calibration target. Examination showed considerable difference between AVHRR-2 and AVHRR-3 measurements, which are largely attributed to differences in sensor design characteristics, uncertainty in sensor radiometric calibration, and imperfections in data processing. The results also show overall higher consistency between data from missions with AVHRR-3 than with AVHRR-2 sensors. The developed approach for correction of systematic error in time series was validated based on statistical analysis of eight independent pseudo-invariant targets not used for the initial correction development. Trends in these targets largely caused by the difference between AVHRR-2 and -3 sensors are shown to be removed or reduced after the correction was applied.

AB Monitoring the conservation status of natural habitats is an essential aspect of effective conservation management. Not only data on habitat occurrence are needed, but also detailed information on the structural and functional characteristics of the habitat patches is crucial for an adequate conservation status assessment. Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images performs well in discriminating dominant land cover and vegetation classes, but the accuracy drops significantly for the classification of more subtle differences in conservation status that are related to structural characteristics. This study proposes a method to facilitate ecological conservation status assessment based on decision tree modeling of subpixel fraction estimates steered by ecological expert knowledge. In particular, it contributes to the spatially explicit assessment of an important structural aspect of dry heathland vegetation, namely the heather age structure, using Airborne Hyperspectral line-Scanner radiometer (AHS-160) data of the Kalmthoutse Heide in northern Belgium. We implemented a subpixel unmixing approach to identify the percentage of heather, sand and shadow in each heather pixel, and subsequently applied a decision tree classification to allocate each pixel to a certain age class. As such, our method provides a tool that contributes to the information required for an appropriate management and successful conservation of natural heathlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study explores the potential of waveform lidar in mapping the vertical and spatial distributions of leaf area index (LAI) over the tropical rain forest of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Vertical profiles of LAI were derived at 0.3 m height intervals from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data using the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. Cumulative LAI profiles obtained from LVIS were validated with data from 55 ground to canopy vertical transects using a modular field tower to destructively sample all vegetation. Our results showed moderate agreement between lidar and field derived LAI (r(2) = 0.42, RMSE = 1.91, bias = -0.32), which further improved when differences between lidar and tower footprint scales (r(2) = 0.50, RMSE = 1.79, bias = 0.27) and distance of field tower from lidar footprint center (r(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 1.36, bias = 0.0) were accounted for. Next, we mapped the spatial distribution of total LAI across the landscape and analyzed LAI variations over different land cover types. Mean values of total LAI were 1.74, 5.20, 5.41 and 5.62 over open pasture, secondary forests, regeneration forests after selective-logging and old-growth forests respectively. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivities of our LAI retrieval model to variations in canopy/ground reflectance ratio and to waveform noise such as induced by topographic slopes. We found for both, that the effects were not significant for moderate LAI values (about 4). However model derivations of LAI might be inaccurate in areas of high-slope and high LAI (about 8) if ground return energies are low. This research suggests that large footprint waveform lidar can provide accurate vertical LAI profile estimates that do not saturate even at the high LAI levels in tropical rain forests and may be a useful tool for understanding the light transmittance within these canopies.

AB Wildland and wilderness refer to areas of land which have been subject to little or no modification by human activity. These areas are important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology.. To test its practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009. Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological assessment and monitoring.

AB This study presents and compares new methods to describe the 3D canopy structure with Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) waveform data as well as ALS point data. The ALS waveform data were analyzed in three different ways; by summing the intensity of the waveforms in height intervals (a); by first normalizing the waveforms with an algorithm based on Beer-Lambert law to compensate for the shielding effect of higher vegetation layers on reflection from lower layers and then summing the intensity (b); and by deriving points from the waveforms (c). As a comparison, conventional, discrete return ALS point data from the laser scanning system were also analyzed (d). The study area was located in hemi-boreal, spruce dominated forest in the southwest of Sweden (Lat. 58 degrees N, Long. 13 degrees E). The vegetation volume profile was defined as the volume of all tree crowns and shrubs in 1 dm height intervals in a field plot and the total vegetation volume as the sum of the vegetation volume profile in the field plot. The total vegetation volume was estimated for 68 field plots with 12 m radius from the proportion between the amount of ALS reflections from the vegetation and the total amount of ALS reflections based on Beer-Lambert law. ALS profiles were derived from the distribution of the ALS data above the ground in 1 din height intervals. The ALS profiles were rescaled using the estimated total vegetation volume to derive the amount of vegetation at different heights above the ground. The root mean square error (RMSE) for cross validated regression estimates of the total vegetation volume was 31.9% for ALS waveform data (a), 27.6% for normalized waveform data (b), 29.1% for point data derived from the ALS waveforms (c), and 36.5% for ALS point data from the laser scanning system (d). The correspondence between the estimated vegetation volume profiles was also best for the normalized waveform data and the point data derived from the ALS waveforms and worst for ALS point data from the laser scanning system as demonstrated by the Reynolds error index. The results suggest that ALS waveform data describe the volumetric aspects of vertical vegetation structure somewhat more accurately than ALS point data from the laser scanning system and that compensation for the shielding effect of higher vegetation layers is useful. The new methods for estimation of vegetation volume profiles from ALS data could be used in the future to derive 3D models of the vegetation structure in large areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Plant species discrimination using remote sensing is generally limited by the similarity of their reflectance spectra in the visible, NIR and SWIR domains. Laboratory measured emissivity spectra in the mid infrared (MIR; 2.5 mu m-6 mu m) and the thermal infrared (TIR; 8 mu m-14 mu m) domain of different plant species, however, reveal significant differences. It is anticipated that with the advances in airborne and space borne hyperspectral thermal sensors, differentiation between plant species may improve. The laboratory emissivity spectra of thirteen common broad leaved species, comprising 3024 spectral bands in the MIR and TIR, were analyzed. For each wavelength the differences between the species were tested for significance using the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post-hoc Tukey HSD test. The emissivity spectra of the analyzed species were found to be statistically different at various wavebands. Subsequently, six spectral bands were selected (based on the histogram of separable pairs of species for each waveband) to quantify the separability between each species pair based on the Jefferies Matusita GM) distance. Out of 78 combinations, 76 pairs had a significantly different JM distance. This means that careful selection of hyperspectral bands in the MIR and TIR (2.5 mu m-14 mu m) results in reliable species discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In situ data are widely used to provide a ground truth for the calibration and validation of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) retrievals. They are also used to monitor long-term changes in the climate. For these applications, and others, it is necessary to understand the uncertainties in the data. Near-coincident SST observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and in situ platforms were used to understand the characteristics of errors in the measurements. The mean random error on the AATSR retrievals was found to be 0.14 K. The in situ errors were modelled as a constant offset plus a random error. For ships, the standard deviation of the constant offset was estimated to be 0.71 K and the mean random error was 0.74 K. For drifting buoys, the standard deviation of the constant offset was estimated to be 0.29 K and the mean random error was 0.26 K. These results suggest that there is a need to revisit current assessments of the adequacy of in situ observing systems. The trend in global-average SST between 1991 and 2007 calculated from in situ data was compared to its counterpart calculated from the ATSR instruments. The in situ record warms more slowly than the ATSR record, probably due to a decrease in the fraction of relatively warm-biassed ship observations contributing to the global-average SST over the period and a corresponding increase in the fraction of relatively unbiassed drifting buoy observations.

AB Spatiotemporal variations of wetland water in the Prairie Pothole Region are controlled by many factors: two of them are temperature and precipitation that form the basis of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Taking the 196 km(2) Cottonwood Lake area in North Dakota as our pilot study site, we integrated PDSI. Landsat images, and aerial photography records to simulate monthly water surface. First, we developed a new Wetland Water Area Index (WWAI) from PDSI to predict water surface area. Second, we developed a water allocation model to simulate the spatial distribution of water bodies at a resolution of 30 m. Third, we used an additional procedure to model the small wetlands (less than 0.8 ha) that could not be detected by Landsat. Our results showed that i) WWAI was highly correlated with water area with an R-2 of 0.90, resulting in a simple regression prediction of monthly water area to capture the intra- and inter-annual water change from 1910 to 2009; ii) the spatial distribution of water bodies modeled from our approach agreed well with the water locations visually identified from the aerial photography records: and iii) the R-2 between our modeled water bodies (including both large and small wetlands) and those from aerial photography records could be up to 0.83 with a mean average error of 0.64 km(2) within the study area where the modeled wetland water areas ranged from about 2 to 14 km(2). These results indicate that our approach holds great potential to simulate major changes in wetland water surface for ecosystem service; however, our products could capture neither the short-term water change caused by intensive rainstorm events nor the wetland change caused by human activities.

AB This study presents an alternative assessment of the MODIS LAI product for a 58,000 ha evergreen needleleaf forest located in the western Rocky Mountain range in northern Idaho by using lidar data to model (R-2= 0.86, RMSE = 0.76) and map LAI at higher resolution across a large number of MODIS pixels in their entirety. Moderate resolution (30 m) lidar-based LAI estimates were aggregated to the resolution of the 1-km MODIS LAI product and compared to temporally-coincident MODIS retrievals. Differences in the MODIS and lidar-derived values of LAI were grouped and analyzed by several different factors, including MODIS retrieval algorithm, sun/sensor geometry, and sub-pixel heterogeneity in both vegetation and terrain characteristics. Of particular interest is the disparity in the results when MODIS LAI was analyzed according to algorithm retrieval class. We observed relatively good agreement between lidar-derived and MODIS LAI values for pixels retrieved with the main RT algorithm without saturation for LAI LAI Moreover, for the entire range of LAI values, considerable overestimation of LAI (relative to lidar-derived LA!) occurred when either the main RT with saturation or back-up algorithm retrievals were used to populate the composite product regardless of sub-pixel vegetation structural complexity or sun/sensor geometry. These results are significant because algorithm retrievals based on the main radiative transfer algorithm with or without saturation are characterized as suitable for validation and subsequent ecosystem modeling, yet the magnitude of difference appears to be specific to retrieval quality class and vegetation structural characteristics.

AB Human and natural forces are rapidly modifying the global distribution and structure of terrestrial ecosystems on which all of life depends, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting our climate now and for the foreseeable future, causing steep reductions in species diversity, and endangering Earth's sustainability.
   To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064 nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:
   (1) Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.
   (2) The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1 km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1 ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1 km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30 m along-transect measurements globally at 25 m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization.
   We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein.

AB General models are required for better understanding the dynamics of wetland inundations and their water regimes. Extraction by imagery snapshots and use of a crisp data model do not value the inherent uncertainties in space and time. This study addresses parameterization of a mixed Gaussian random set model in a multi-temporal analysis. The model is applied to monitor annual variation of wetland inundation extents from a series of Landsat TM images in 2004 and HJ images in 2009 on the Poyang Lake national nature reserve (PLNNR) in China. We use related indices to represent spatial uncertainties of inundated areas and to delineate the transition zone between wetland vegetation and open water. The PLNNR water regime is investigated by accumulating a series of random sets during one year and determining the water covering days (WCD) at the pixel level. Random sets provide detailed spatial configurations of the WCD which has a strong negative correlation with the underwater DEM. Comparing 2004 and 2009, the study shows that almost half of the PLNNR area experienced drought. We conclude that the mixed Gaussian random set model with three components presented in this study serves as a general method to parameterize the random set model for large datasets. Moreover, it is well suited to capture detailed information on spatial temporal dynamic of wetland inundation and contributes to our understanding of wetlands water regimes from multi-temporal images.

AB Chlorophyll fluorescence is related to photosynthesis and can serve as a remote sensing proxy for estimating photosynthetic energy conversion and carbon uptake. Recent advances in sensor technology allow remote measurements of the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence signal (Fs) at leaf and canopy scale. The commonly used Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle exploits spectrally narrow atmospheric oxygen absorption bands and relates Fs to the difference of the absorption feature depth of a fluorescensing and a non-fluorescensing surface. However, due to the nature of these narrow bands. Fs retrieval results depend not only on vegetation species type or environmental conditions, but also on instrument technology and processing algorithms. Thus, an evaluation of all influencing factors and their separate quantification is required to further improve Fs retrieval and to allow a reproducible interpretation of Fs signals.
   Here we present a modeling study that isolates and quantifies the impacts of sensor characteristics, such as spectral sampling interval (SSI), spectral resolution (SR), signal to noise ratio (SNR), and spectral shift (SS) on the accuracy of Fs measurements in the oxygen A band centered at 760 nm (O-2-A). Modeled high resolution radiance spectra associated with known Fs were spectrally resampled, taking into consideration the various sensor properties. Fs was retrieved using the three most common FLD retrieval methods, namely the original FLD method (sFLD), the modified FLD (3FLD) and the improved FLD (iFLD). The analysis investigates parameter ranges, which are representative for field and airborne instruments currently used in Fs research (e.g., ASD FieldSpec, OceanOptics HR, AirFLEX, AISA, APEX, CASI, and MERIS).
   Our results show that the most important parameter affecting the retrieval accuracy is SNR, SR accounts for <= 40% of the error, the SSI for <= 12%, and SS for <= 7% of the error. A trade-off study revealed that high SR can partly compensate for low SNR. There is a strong interrelation between all parameters and the impact of specific parameters can compensate or amplify the influence of others. Hence, the combination of all parameters must be considered by the evaluation of sensors and their potential for Fs retrieval. In general, the standard FLD method strongly overestimates Fs, while 3FLD and iFLD provide a more accurate estimation of Fs. We conclude that technical sensor specifications and the retrieval methods cause a significant variability in retrieved Fs signals. Results are intended to be one relevant component of the total uncertainty budget of Fs retrieval and have to be considered in the interpretation of retrieved Fs signals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Four models for deriving percent surface water estimates were developed for use with MODIS16-day Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrected composite images. The models allow intra-annual surface water estimates to be produced with 1 km spatial resolution and an 8-day temporal resolution when applied to image composites from sensors on both the Aqua and Terra platforms. The surface water models are conceptually simple, relying on widely used indices (NDVI, NDWI, and tasseled cap), but computationally intensive. The models differ in the time and effort required to produce or acquire the inputs necessary for model training. The models were applied and tested in Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, an area with varied surface water types including ponds, fens, and the Yukon River and its tributaries. Resulting accuracies peaked with an R(2) of approximately 0.625, and model accuracies were higher for pixels with higher percentages of water. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR (TM)) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region.
   Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2 million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS "short-period" data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with "long-period" tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years).
   The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements.
   IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geomorphological conditions.
   Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:
   a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;
   a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.

AB Satellite remote sensing of ocean colour is the only method currently available for synoptically measuring wide-area properties of ocean ecosystems, such as phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass. Recently, a variety of bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use satellite data to identify and differentiate between either phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs). In this study, several of these techniques were evaluated against in situ observations to determine their ability to detect dominant phytoplankton size classes (micro-, nano- and picoplankton). The techniques are applied to a 10-year ocean-colour data series from the SeaWiFS satellite sensor and compared with in situ data (6504 samples) from a variety of locations in the global ocean. Results show that spectral-response, ecological and abundance-based approaches can all perform with similar accuracy. Detection of microplankton and picoplankton were generally better than detection of nanoplankton. Abundance-based approaches were shown to provide better spatial retrieval of PSCs. Individual model performance varied according to PSC, input satellite data sources and in situ validation data types. Uncertainty in the comparison procedure and data sources was considered. Improved availability of in situ observations would aid ongoing research in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Heat waves are expected to become more frequent and severe as climate changes, with unknown consequences for biodiversity. We sought to identify ecologically-relevant broad-scale indicators of heat waves based on MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data and assess their associations with avian community structure. Specifically, we asked which data source, time periods, and heat wave indices best predicted changes in avian abundance and species richness. Using mixed effects models, we analyzed associations between these indices and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey in the central United States between 2000 and 2007 in four ecoregions and five migratory and nesting species groups. We then quantified avian responses to scenarios of severe, but commonly-occurring early, late, and summer-long heat waves. Indices based on MODIS LST data, rather than interpolated air temperatures, were more predictive of avian community structure. Avian communities were more related to 8-day LST exceedances (positive anomalies only); and were generally more sensitive to summer-long heat waves. Across the region, abundance, and to a lesser extent, species richness, declined following heat waves. Among the ecoregions, relationships were most consistently negative in the southern and montane ecoregions, but were positive in a more humid northern ecoregion. Among migratory groups, permanent resident species were the most sensitive, declining in abundance following a summer-long heat wave by 19% and 13% in the montane and southern ecoregions, respectively. Ground-nesting species, which declined in the south by 12% following a late summer heat wave, were more sensitive than avifauna overall. These results demonstrate the value of MODIS LST data for measuring ecologically-relevant heat waves across large regions. Ecologically, these findings highlight the importance of extreme events for avian biodiversity and the considerable variation in response to environmental change associated with different functional groups and geographic regions. The magnitude of the relationships between avian abundance and heat waves reported here raises concerns about the impacts of more frequent and severe heat waves in a warming climate.

AB We have tested three methods for estimating 2003-2008 elevation changes of Svalbard glaciers from multi-temporal ICESat laser altimetry: (a) linear interpolation of crossover points between ascending and descending tracks, (b) projection of near repeat-tracks onto common locations using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and (c) least-squares fitting of rigid planes to segments of repeat-track data assuming a constant elevation change rate. The two repeat-track methods yield similar results and compare well to the more accurate, but sparsely sampled, crossover points. Most glacier regions in Svalbard have experienced low-elevation thinning combined with high-elevation balance or thickening during 2003-2008. The geodetic mass balance (excluding calving front retreat or advance) of Svalbard's 34,600 km(2) glaciers is estimated to be -4.3 +/- 1.4 Gt y(-1), corresponding to an area-averaged water equivalent (we.) balance of -0.12 +/- 0.04 m w.e. y(-1). The largest ice losses have occurred in the west and south, while northeastern Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap have gained mass. Winter and summer elevation changes derived from the same methods indicate that the spatial gradient in mass balance is mainly due to a larger summer season thinning in the west and the south than in the northeast. Our findings are consistent with in-situ mass balance measurements from the same period, confirming that repeat-track satellite altimetry can be a valuable tool for monitoring short term elevation changes of Arctic glaciers.

AB Land surface model parameter estimation can be performed using soil moisture information provided by synthetic aperture radar imagery. The presence of speckle necessitates aggregating backscatter measurements over large (>100 m x 100 m) land areas in order to derive reliable soil moisture information from imagery, and a model calibrated to such aggregated information can only provide estimates of soil moisture at spatial resolutions required for reliable speckle accounting. A method utilizing the likelihood formulation of a probabilistic speckle model as the calibration objective function is proposed which will allow for calibrating land surface models directly to radar backscatter intensity measurements in a way which simultaneously accounts for model parameter- and speckle-induced uncertainty. The method is demonstrated using the NOAH land surface model and Advanced Integral Equation Method (AIEM) backscatter model calibrated to SAR imagery of an area in the Southwestern United States, and validated against in situ soil moisture measurements. At spatial resolutions finer than 100 m x 100 m NOAH and AIEM calibrated using the proposed radar intensity likelihood parameter estimation algorithm predict surface level soil moisture to within 4% volumetric water content 95% of the time, which is an improvement over a 95% prediction confidence of 10% volumetric water content by the same models calibrated directly to soil moisture information derived from synthetic aperture radar imagery at the same scales. Results suggest that much of this improvement is due to increased ability to simultaneously estimate NOAH parameters and AIEM surface roughness parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a validation study performed by comparing the Climate-SAF Surface Albedo Product (SAL) to ground truth observations over Greenland and the ice-covered Arctic Ocean. We compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based albedo retrievals to data from the Greenland Climate Network (GCN) weather stations and the floating ice station Tara for polar summer 2007. The AVHRR dataset consists of 2755 overpasses. The overpasses are matched to in situ observations spatially and temporally. The SAL algorithm presented here derives the surface broadband albedo from AVHRR channels 1 and 2 using an atmospheric correction, temporal sampling of an empirical Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), and a narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithm. The satellite product contains algorithms for snow, sea ice, vegetation, bare soil, and water albedo. At the Summit and DYE-2 stations on the Greenland ice sheet, instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.073. The heterogeneous surface conditions at satellite pixel scale over the stations near the Greenland west coast increase RMSE to >0.12. Over Tara, the instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.069. The BRDF sampling approach reduces RMSE over the ice sheet to 0.053, and to 0.045 over Tara. Taking into account various sources of uncertainty for both satellite retrievals and in situ observations, we conclude that SAL agrees with in situ observations within their limits of accuracy and spatial representativeness.

AB Geospatial datasets of forest characteristics are modeled representations of real populations on the ground. The continuous spatial character of such datasets provides an incredible source of information at the landscape level for ecosystem research, policy analysis, and planning applications, all of which are critical for addressing current challenges related to climate change, urbanization pressures, and data requirements for monitoring carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these applications is dependent upon the accuracy of the geospatial input datasets. A comprehensive set of robust measures is necessary to provide sufficient information to effectively assess the accuracy of these modeled geospatial datasets being produced. Yet challenges in the availability of reference data, in the appropriateness of assessment methods to dataset use, and in the completeness of assessment methods available have continued to hamper the timely and consistent application of map assessments. In this study we present a suite of assessments that can be used to characterize the accuracy of geospatial datasets of modeled continuous variables an increasingly common format for modeling such attributes as proportion or probability of forestland as well as more traditionally continuous attributes such as leaf area index and forest biomass. It is a comparative accuracy assessment, in which each modeled dataset is compared to a set of reference data, recognizing both the potential for error in reference data, and probable differences in spatial support between the datasets. When used together, this proposed suite of assessments provides essential information on the type, magnitude, frequency and location of errors in each dataset. The assessments presented depend upon reference data with large sample sizes. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database is introduced as an available reference dataset of sufficient sampling intensity to take full advantage of these assessments and facilitate their prompt application after modeled datasets are developed. We illustrate the application of this suite of assessments with two modeled datasets of forest biomass, in Minnesota and New York. The information provided by this suite of assessments substantially improves a user's ability to apply modeled geospatial datasets effectively and to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of multiple datasets depicting the same forest characteristic.

AB Vegetation fires are a key global terrestrial disturbance factor and a major source of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols. Therefore, many earth-system science and operational monitoring applications require access to repetitive, frequent and well-characterized information on fire emissions source strengths. Geostationary imagers offer important temporal advantages when studying rapidly changing phenomena such as vegetation fires Here we present a new algorithm for detecting and characterising active fires burning within the imager footprints of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), including consideration of cloud-cover and calculation of fire radiative power (FRP), a metric shown to be strongly related to fuel consumption and smoke emission rates The approach is based on a set of algorithms now delivering near real time (NRT) operational FRP products from the Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) imager (available from http://landsaf meteo pt/), and the GOES processing chain presented here is designed to deliver a compatible fire product to complete geostationary coverage of the Western hemisphere. Results from the two GOES imagers are intercompared, and are independently verified against the well regarded MODIS cloud mask and active fire products We find that the detection of cloud and active fires from GOES matches that of MODIS very well for fire pixels having FRP > 30 MW, when the GOES omission error falls to less than 10% The FRP of fire clusters detected near simultaneously by both GOES and MODIS have a bias of only 22 MW, and a similar bias is found when comparing near-simultaneous GOES East and GOES West FRP observations However, many fire pixels having FRP < 30 MW remain undetected by GOES, probably unavoidably since It has a much coarser spatial resolution than MODIS. Adjustment using data from the less frequent but more accurate views obtained from high spatial resolution polar orbiting imagers could be used to bias correct regional FRP totals. Temporal integration of the GOES FRP record indicates that during the summer months, biomass burning combusts thousands of millions of tonnes of fuel daily across the Americas. Comparison of these results to those of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv2) indicate strong linear relationships (r(2) > 0.9), suggesting that the timely FRP data available from a GOES real-time data feed is likely to be a suitable fire emissions source strength term for inclusion in schemes aiming to forecast the concentrations of atmospheric constituents affected by biomass burning.

AB Spatial distribution models are increasingly used in ecological studies, but are limited by the poor accuracy of remote sensing (RS) for mapping microhabitat (<0.1 ha) features. Mapping accuracy can be improved by combining advanced RS image-processing techniques with microhabitat data expressed as a structural complexity index (SCI). To test this idea, we used principal components analysis (PCA) and an additive SCI method developed for forest ecology (calculated by re-scaling and summing representative structural variables) to summarize 13 microhabitat-scale (0.04 ha) vegetation structure attributes describing the rare mountain bongo antelope's (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci) habitat in Kenya's Aberdare mountains. Microhabitat data were collected in 127 plots: 37 related to bongo habitat use, 90 from 1 km-spaced grid points representing overall habitat availability and bongo non-presence. We then assessed each SCI's effectiveness for discerning microhabitat variability and bongo habitat selection, using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests for differences in mean SCI scores among plots divided into 4 vegetation classes, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics from logistic regressions. We also examined the accuracy of predicted SCI scores resulting from regression models based on variables derived from a) ASTER imagery processed with spectral mixture and texture analysis, b) an SRTM DEM and c) rainfall data, using the 90 grid plots for model training and the bongo plots as an independent test dataset. Of the five SCIs derived, two performed best: the PCA-derived Canopy Structure Index (CSI) and an additive index summarizing 8 structural variables (AI(8)). CSI and AI(8) showed significant differences between 5 of 6 vegetation class pairs, strong abilities to distinguish bongo-selected from available habitat (AUCs=0.71 (CSI); 0.70 (AI(8))), and predicted scores 60-110% more accurate than reported by other studies using RS to quantify individual microhabitat structural attributes (CSI model R(2)=0.51, RMSE=0.19 (training) and 0.21 (test); AI(8) model R(2)=0.46, RMSE=0.17 (training) and 0.19 (test)). Repeating the Wilcoxon tests and logistic regressions with RS-predicted SCI values showed that AI(8) most effectively preserved the patterns found with the observed SCIs. These results demonstrate that SCIs effectively characterize microhabitat structure and selection, and boost microhabitat mapping accuracy when combined with enhanced RS image-processing techniques. This approach can improve distribution models and broaden their applicability, makes RS more relevant to applied ecology, and shows that processing field data to be more compatible with RS can improve RS-based habitat mapping accuracy.

AB Tallgrass prairie in North America has been largely converted to croplands and cool season grasslands. In Missouri, only 0.5% of the tallgrass prairie remains in a form of isolated prairie islands. This study sought to delineate prairie-native warm season grass (WSG) from cool season grass (CSG) using five ASTER images acquired on 03/11/2008, 05/12/2007, 07/12/2007, 08/16/2007 and 10/19/2007. Temporal trajectories of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were extracted to examine temporal variation of WSG and CSG grasslands in a growth cycle. It was found that the spring-summer period revealed maximal spectral differences between these two grass types. CSG reached peak NDVI in May while WSG tended to have peak NDMI in July. NDVI was more useful than NDMI in summer-fall. The NDVI trends in this period varied with both phenology and grassland treatments such as haying and grazing, which provided additional information in WSG/CSG delineation. A hierarchical decision tree was developed to delineate WSG and CSG grasslands in a 3-tier process. The WSG lands including those publically conserved prairies were identified in the lower Osage Plain in southwest Missouri. The accuracies were about 80% and could be improved with more frequent satellite observations. The trajectory-based decision tree in this study provides a robust approach of long-term WSG/CSG mapping. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The estimation of near surface air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of applications such as agriculture, climate related diseases and climate change studies. Air temperature is commonly obtained from synoptic measurements in weather stations. In Africa, the spatial distribution of weather stations is often limited and the dissemination of temperature data is variable, therefore limiting their use for real-time applications. Compensation for this paucity of information may be obtained by using satellite-based methods. However, the derivation of near surface air temperature (Ta), from the land surface temperature (Ts) derived from satellite is far from straight forward. Some studies have tried to derive maximum Ta from satellites through regression analysis but the accuracy obtained is quite variable according to the study. The main objective of this study was to explore the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Ts products over different ecosystems in Africa. First, comparisons between night MODIS Ts data with minimum Ta showed that MODIS nighttime products provide a good estimation of minimum Ta over different ecosystems (with (Delta Ts - Ta) centered at 0 degrees C, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.73 degrees C and a standard deviation = 2.4 degrees C). Secondly, comparisons between day MODIS Ts data with maximum Ta showed that (Delta Ts - Ta) strongly varies according to the seasonality, the ecosystems, the solar radiation, and cloud-cover. Two factors proposed in the literature to retrieve maximum Ta from Ts, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA), were analyzed. No strong relationship between (Delta Ts - Ta) and (i) NDVI and (ii) SZA was observed, therefore requiring further research on robust methods to retrieve maximum Ta. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB The accurate mapping of small, often fragmented and linear vegetation patches is of key importance for natural resource management because of their ecological significance. However, due to their small size and the quantised nature of remote sensing imagery they may be under-represented in the landscape when mapped using earth observation. This paper investigates the effect of patch area and patch elongation on the accurate mapping of these vegetation patches. Using synthetic images to simulate sub-pixel patch location, we investigated classification accuracy and extraction probability resulting from differences in the geometric properties of the raster grid and the feature alone. We simulated the effect of grid position, detectability, feature size and shape on classification. This represents the highest achievable accuracy using the remote sensing raster grid, where other factors influencing classification such as classification algorithm, radiometric calibration and sensor characteristics are excluded. We found that mapping error was highest when the scale of the feature and the raster grid coincided. We showed that the spatial resolution of the grid should be many times finer in order to extract these features accurately. For square patches with a mean classification accuracy of 75%, the grid pixel area was 11 times smaller than patch size. When patches were small and/or elongated, the probability of extraction was reduced, mapping accuracies decreased and variability in accuracy due to the effects of grid position increased. For example, a square shaped patch needed an area of at least 11 pixels to achieve a mean accuracy of 75%, whilst a linear patch with a width to length ratio of 4 needed an area of 12.3 pixels. This paper quantifies the limitations of remote sensing for the accurate detection of small and linear features and provides guidelines on the appropriate spatial resolution required to map these features. Using our results, map users can estimate the probability of a map classifying small and linear features independently of the error matrix. Furthermore, we provide a more precise estimate of the size of the smallest discernable feature taking into account the random position of the remote sensing grid with respect to the feature as well as its shape. An understanding of this phenomenon is critical for making good land management decisions based on a thorough understanding of the limitations of remote sensing data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Physically-based retrieval of vegetation canopy properties from remote sensing data presumes a knowledge of the spectral albedo of the basic scattering unit, i.e. leaf. In this paper, we present a novel method to directly retrieve the spectral dependence of leaf single-scattering albedo of a closed broadleaf forest canopy from multiangular hyperspectral satellite imagery. The new algorithm is based on separating the reflected signal into a linear (first-order) and non-linear (diffuse) reflectance component. A limitation of the proposed algorithm is that the leaf single-scattering albedo omega(lambda) is retrieved with an accuracy of a structural parameter (called a) which, in turn, depends on canopy bidirectional gap probability. ratio of leaf reflectance to transmittance, and distribution of leaf normals. The structural parameter (a(0)) was found to depend on tree-level structural parameters, such as tree height and volume of a single crown, but not the amount of leaf area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   METHODOLOGY
AB This paper assesses remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture over Australia, derived from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument. Soil moisture fields generated by the AMSR-E soil moisture retrieval algorithm developed at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) in collaboration with NASA have been used in this study, following a preliminary investigation of several other retrieval algorithms. The VUA-NASA AMSR-E near-surface soil moisture product has been compared to in-situ soil moisture data from 12 locations in the Murrumbidgee and Goulburn Monitoring Networks, both in southeast Australia. Temporally, the AMSR-E soil moisture has a strong association to ground-based soil moisture data, with typical correlations of greater than 0.8 and typical RMSD less than 0.03 vol/vol (for a normalized and filtered AMSR-E timeseries). Continental-scale spatial patterns in the VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture have also been visually examined by comparison to spatial rainfall data. The AMSR-E soil moisture has a strong correspondence to precipitation data across Australia: in the short term, maps of the daily soil moisture anomaly show a clear response to precipitation events, and in the longer term, maps of the annual average soil moisture show the expected strong correspondence to annual average precipitation.

AB Surface mining and reclamation is the dominant driver of land cover land use change (LCLUC) in the Central Appalachian Mountain region of the Eastern U.S. Accurate quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how this LCLUC affects ecosystem services such as aesthetics, biodiversity, and mitigation of flooding. We used Landsat imagery from 1976, 1987, 1999 and 2006 to map the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for eight large watersheds in the Central Appalachian region of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. We employed standard image processing techniques in conjunction with a temporal decision tree and GIS maps of mine permits and wetlands to map active and reclaimed mines and track changes through time. For the entire study area, active surface mine extent was highest in 1976, prior to implementation of the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, with 1.76% of the study area in active mines, declining to 0.44% in 2006. The most extensively mined watershed, Georges Creek in Maryland, was 5.45% active mines in 1976, declining to 1.83% in 2006. For the entire study area, the area of reclaimed mines increased from 1.35% to 4.99% from 1976 to 2006, and from 4.71% to 15.42% in Georges Creek. Land cover conversion to mines and then reclaimed mines after 1976 was almost exclusively from forest. Accuracy levels for mined and reclaimed cover was above 85% for all time periods, and was generally above 80% for mapping active and reclaimed mines separately, especially for the later time periods in which good accuracy assessment data were available. Among other implications, the mapped patterns of LCLUC are likely to significantly affect watershed hydrology, as mined and reclaimed areas have lower infiltration capacity and thus more rapid runoff than unmined forest watersheds, leading to greater potential for extreme flooding during heavy rainfall events.

AB The loss of coral reef habitats has been witnessed at a global scale including in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes ('coral', 'sand', 'bare hardbottom' and 'covered hardbottom') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

AB Yardangs, an exclusive landform due to intensive wind erosion, cover a large area in the hyper-arid Lut desert of Iran. This paper presents a new approach using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as unsupervised algorithm of artificial neural networks for analysis and characterization of yardangs.
   Nowadays, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with 3 arc sec data (approximately 90 m resolution) and nearly world wide coverage provides uniform good quality data.
   The SRTM 3 arc sec data were re-projected to a 90 m UTM grid. Bivariate quadratic surfaces with moving window size of 5 x 5 were fitted to this DEM. The first derivative, slope steepness and the second derivatives minimum, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvatures were calculated as geomorphometric parameters used as input to the SOMs. 42 SOMs with different learning parameter settings, e.g. initial and final radius, number of iterations, and the effect of random initial weights on average quantization error were investigated. A SOM with a low average quantization error (0.1040) was used for further analysis. Feature space analysis, morphometric signatures, three-dimensional inspection, auxiliary data like Landsat ETM+ and high resolution satellite imagery from QuickBird facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of geomorphometric features. Results are provided in a geographic information system as thematic maps of landform entities based on form and slope, e.g. yardangs (ridge), corridors (valley) or planar areas.
   The results showed that all yardangs and corridors were clearly recognized and classified by this method when their width was larger than the DEM resolution but became unrecognizable if their width is much smaller than the grid resolution. The identified yardangs and corridors are aligned NNW-SSE parallel to the prevailing direction of the strong local 120 days wind and cover about 31% and 42% of the study area respectively. The results demonstrate that SOM is a very efficient tool for analyzing aeolian landforms in hyper-arid environments that provides very useful information for terrain feature analysis in remote regions.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides high resolution horizontal and vertical spatial point cloud data, and is increasingly being used in a number of applications and disciplines, which have concentrated on the exploit and manipulation of the data using mainly its three dimensional nature. LiDAR information potential is made even greater though, with its consideration of intensity. Elevation and intensity airborne LiDAR data are used in this study in order to classify forest and ground types quickly and efficiently without the need for manipulating multispectral image files, using a supervised object-orientated approach. LiDAR has the advantage of being able to create elevation surfaces that are in 3D, while also having information on LiDAR intensity values, thus it is a spatial and spectral segmentation tool. This classification method also uses point distribution frequency criteria to differentiate between land cover types. Classifications were performed using two methods, one that included the influence of the ground in heavily vegetated areas, and the other which eliminated the ground points before classification. The classification of three meanders of the Garonne and Allier rivers in France has demonstrated overall classification accuracies of 95% and 94% for the methods including and excluding the ground influence respectively. Five types of riparian forest were classified with accuracies between 66 and 98%. These forest types included planted and natural forest stands of different ages. Classifications of short vegetation and bare earth also produced high accuracies averaging above 90%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We applied the Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) technique to study the city of Rome (Italy) aiming to detect and measure the surface movements of buildings and urban structures. The available SAR dataset has been delivered by ESA CAT1 3258 and ranges the period 1992-2005. In particular ERS1-ERS2 data processed covers 1995-2000, while Envisat ASAR 2002-2005. The Point Target velocity map shows a general stability except for some very local areas affected by subsidence rate larger than 10 mm/year. The analysis of the time series, compared to a detailed geological and geotechnical investigation of the lithostratigraphy of the alluvial sediments of the Tiber River, and combined with a temporal reconstruction of the expansion of the city over the alluvial valleys, allowed us to depict the main factors controlling the observed subsidence. These are: the in situ effective stress conditions, the related compressibility and viscous characteristics of the loaded soils, the thickness of the compressible stratum, the time since loading instant, and the entity of loading. Furthermore the observed subsidence is time-dependent, even at a long time-scale, with respect to the age of the buildings being most of the buildings constructed since the '50s still affected by slow subsidence. We mainly focused on the Grottaperfetta stream valley that is characterized by an anomalous high and time-lasting subsidence. Original data on the lithostratigraphic setting of this alluvial valley indicate that the high subsidence rate measured up to 2005 is caused by a still active primary consolidation process.

AB An integrated data assimilation system is implemented over the Red-Arkansas river basin to estimate the regional scale terrestrial water cycle driven by multiple satellite remote sensing data. These satellite products include the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Also, a number of previously developed assimilation techniques, including the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the particle filter (PF), the water balance constrainer, and the copula error model, and as well as physically based models, including the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), the Land Surface Microwave Emission Model (LSMEM), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), are tested in the water budget estimation experiments. This remote sensing based water budget estimation study is evaluated using ground observations driven model simulations. It is found that the land surface model driven by the bias-corrected TRMM rainfall produces reasonable water cycle states and fluxes, and the estimates are moderately improved by assimilating TMI 10.67 GHz microwave brightness temperature measurements that provides information on the surface soil moisture state, while it remains challenging to improve the results by assimilating evapotranspiration estimated from satellite-based measurements.

AB The U.S. Landsat satellite series provide the longest dedicated land remote sensing data record with a balance between requirements for localized high spatial resolution studies and global monitoring. As with any other optical wavelength satellite sensor, cloud contamination greatly compromises image usability for land surface studies. Additionally, selective scene acquisition due to payload, ground station and mission cost constraints further reduces Landsat image availability. Since the 1999 launch of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) a Longterm Acquisition Plan (LTAP) has been used to anticipate user requests with the goal of annually refreshing a global daytime archive of cloud-free ETM+ data. This research evaluates the availability of cloud-free Landsat ETM+ data over the conterminous U.S. and globally using 3 years of ETM+ cloud fraction metadata archived by the U.S. Landsat project. Landsat application requirements including obtaining at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, and two different seasons, or at least a pair of cloud-free observations occurring no more than 16, 32, 48, 64, and 80 days apart within a year and season are considered. Probabilistic analyses indicate that over the conterminous U.S., land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, two different seasons, or at least two cloud-free observations occurring within any period of the year, are on average largely unaffected by cloud cover, except for certain Winter applications and cloudy scenes near the U. S. Canada border and the Great Lakes. Cloud becomes a constraint when at least two cloud-free observations are required from the same season over the conterminous U.S., especially when the separation between observations is restricted to short time intervals. Global applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a season, in two different seasons, and applications requiring at least two cloud-free observations in a year, are all severely affected by cloud and data availability constraints; and globally it is generally not practical to consider land applications that require at least two cloud-free observations in any season. Globally, only land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation per year are largely unaffected by cloud cover and the reduced global ETM+ data availability. These results are specific only to the U.S. Landsat ETM+ archive; they suggest the need for an increased global Landsat acquisition rate for the current and future Landsat missions and/or the development of new approaches to mitigating cloud contamination in the U.S. global Landsat ETM+ archive.

AB The paper examines alternative non-parametric estimation methods or smoothing methods in the context of the Finnish multi-source forest inventory. It uses satellite images in addition to field data to produce forest variable predictions for regions ranging from the single pixel level up to the national level. With the help of the bias-variance decomposition, the influence of the smoothing parameters on prediction accuracy is considered when the smoother's pixel-level predictions are averaged in order to produce predictions for larger areas. A novel variation of cross-validation, called region-wise cross-validation, is proposed for selecting the smoothing parameters. Experimental results are presented using local linear ridge regression (LLRR), which is a variant of the better known local linear regression method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

AB This paper examines how reflectance spectrometry used in the laboratory to estimate clay and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) Soil contents can be applied to field and airborne measurements for Soil Property mapping. A continuum removal (CR) technique quantifying specific absorption features of clay (2206 nm) and CaCO3 (2341 nm) was applied to laboratory, field and airborne HYMAP reflectance measurements collected in 2003 (33 sites) and 2005 (19 sites) over bare soil sites of a few meters within the La Peyne Valley area, southern France. Nine intermediate stages from the laboratory up to HYMAP sensor measurements were considered for separately evaluating the possible degradation of estimation performances when going across scales and sensors, e.g. radiometric calibration, spectral resolution, spatial variability, illumination conditions, and surface status including roughness, soil moisture and presence and nature of pebbles. Significant relationships were observed between clay and CaCO3 contents and CR values computed respectively at 2206 nm and 2341 nm from reflectance measurements at the laboratory level with an ASD spectrophotometer up to the HYMAP spectro-imaging sensor. Performances of clay and CaCO3 estimations decreased from the laboratory to airborne scales. The main factors inducing uncertainties in the estimates were radiometric and wavelength calibration uncertainties of the HYMAP sensor as well as possible residual atmospheric effects.

AB Several published foliage mass and crown radius regression models were tested on the preparation of the input for the reflectance model of Kuusk and Nilson [Kuusk, A. and Nilson, T. (2000), A directional multispectral forest reflectance model. Remote Sensing of Environment, 72 (2):244-252.] for 246 forest growth sample plots in Estonia. In each test, foliage mass and crown radius for trees in the sample plots were predicted with a particular pair of allometric regression models. The forest reflectance model was then run using the estimated foliage mass and crown radius values. Reflectance factors were simulated and compared with the reflectance values obtained from three atmospherically corrected Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) scenes. The statistics of linear regression between the simulated and measured reflectance factors were used to assess the performance of foliage and crown radius models. The hypothesis was that the best allometric regression models should provide the best fit in reflectance. The strongest correlation between the simulated and measured reflectance factors was found in the short-wave infrared band (ETM+5) for all the images. The highest R-2 =0.71 was observed in Picea abies dominated stands. No excellent combination of foliage mass and crown radius functions was found, but the ranking based on determination coefficients showed that some linear crown radius models are not applicable to our data. Processing of raster images, reflectance measurement for small sample plots, usage of tree-species-specific fixed parameters (specific leaf area, etc.), and the ignored influence of phenology introduced additional variation into the relationships between simulated and measured reflectance factors. Further studies are needed, but these preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed method could serve as an effective way of testing the performance of foliage mass and canopy cover regressions.

AB A low frequency (80-120 MHz) VHF RaDAR, BioSAR, specifically designed for forest biomass estimation and a profiling LiDAR, PALS, were flown over loblolly pine plantations in the southeastern United States. LiDAR-only, RaDAR-only, and joint LiDAR-RaDAR linear models were developed to determine if returns from two sensors could be used to estimate pine biomass more accurately and precisely than returns from either sensor alone. The best five-variable RaDAR model explained 81.8% (R (2)) of the stem green biomass variability, with a regression RMSE of 57.5 t/ha. The best one-variable LiDAR model explained 93.3% of the biomass variation (RMSE=33.9 t/ha). Combining the RaDAR normalized volumetric returns with the profiling LiDAR ranging measurements did little to improve the best LiDAR-only model. The best LiDAR-RaDAR model explained 93.8% of the biomass variation (RSME=32.7 t/ha). Cross-validation and training/test validation procedures demonstrated (1) that all models are unbiased and (2) the increased precision of the LiDAR-only and LiDAR-RaDAR models. The results of this investigation and a companion study indicate that there is little to be gained combining VHF-RaDAR volumetric returns and profiling LiDAR ranging measurements in pine forests; a LiDAR ranging system is sufficient for accurate, precise biomass estimation. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The concept of recollision probability originates from the theory of canopy spectral invariants (p-theory') but is a simplification that involves several heuristic assumptions. Nonetheless, the concept has been shown to be a useful tool for incorporating the effects of 3D structure on canopy absorptive and reflective properties in forest reflectance models. A method is presented by which an average value of the canopy recollision probability ((p) over cap) can be calculated from canopy gap fraction data, which are provided for example by the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer or can be extracted from fisheye photographs. The new method was used to calculate the average recollision probabilities ((p) over cap values) of uniform leaf and shoot canopies, showing good agreement with results from Monte Carlo simulations. Strengths of the method presented here are the explicitly formulated relationship between recollision probability and canopy structure, and its direct applicability in canopy RT studies.

AB High-resolution (675 kHz) side-scan sonar surveys were collected six and thirty months after a major coral bleaching event in the Seychelles. The surveyed areas contain four different reef morphologies, the distribution of which depends on water depth and distance from the shoreline. These four reef types also have different coral densities and colony morphologies (branching or mixed massive/branching). Textural analysis, based on first order statistics, unsupervised cluster analysis and Mann-Whitney U-tests, showed a correlation between recorded backscatter response and reef type that is attributed to the link between community composition and rugosity on a millimetre to tens of metre scale. Branching coral colonies are found to be relatively good scatterers of acoustic energy, and result in a broad intermediate to high intensity response. Massive coral colonies and reefs with a hard carbonate pavement are found to be principally reflectors of the acoustic energy, resulting in a narrow low intensity response. Comparison of the two surveys separated in time by two years, showed seabed texture to change most significantly over the reef areas that contained the highest coral abundances and mortality rates. In particular, the disintegration of dense branching colonies that suffered almost 100% mortality during the bleaching event resulted in a characteristic loss of intermediate to high backscatter intensity. The work demonstrates the contribution that side-scan sonar could make in the assessment of loss of rugosity following a bleaching episode, which has important implications to both the recovery of the reef itself and the abundance and distribution of associated reef organisms.

AB Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is one of the most important fuel properties and a critical parameter for wildland fire danger rating estimation and fire behavior analysis. Direct ground measurement of live fuel moisture content has disadvantages of high cost and limited spatial distribution extent. This paper presents an algorithm to retrieve live fuel moisture content from multiple bands of MODIS measurements. We analyzed the physical relationship between surface reflectance and live fuel moisture content using simulated MODIS measurements of diverse leaf samples, derived approximate inversion models, and proposed a semi-physical approach for live fuel moisture retrieval employing multiple MODIS bands. Using simulated MODIS measurements, the correlation coefficients between the true LFMC and estimated LFMC with our inversion models are 0.7738, 0.8397, 0.9560 and 0.9576 respectively. For validation, we tested our inversion method with woody live fuel moisture measurements at fire weather stations in Georgia. The correlation coefficients between measured LFMC and estimated LFNIC with our inversion models are 0.5727, 0.6522, 0.755 1, and 0.7737 respectively. Both model simulation and station measurements demonstrated advantages of our approach in accuracy. Our study suggests the potential for near real-time applications of live fuel moisture.

AB The southeastern United States, including the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, had a high occurrence of fire activity as detected by the I km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TERRA Active Fire Product (MOD 14). The analysis of the satellite data from 2001 to 2004 showed that agricultural burning in the southeastern United States accounted for an average of 16% of annual fire activity. The southeastern region contributed an average of 33% of all agricultural burning detected in the contiguous United States. Crop residues that burned in the southeast included rice, winter wheat, sugarcane, soybean and cotton. Much of the agricultural burning occurred in June and from October to January and was related to the harvest of winter wheat and rice in the spring and the harvest of sugarcane, soybean and cotton in the fall and winter. The results showed that cropland burning was spatially dependent on crop type and temporally dependent on management practices (planting harvesting). Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana contributed more than 75% of all agricultural burning in the southeast. A 250 in MODIS land cover map cover for 2004 was developed for these three states using a decision tree classification and validation from a field campaign in the fall of 2004. Compared to the standard MODIS I kin Land Cover Dataset (MOD 12) product ([Friedl, M. A., McIver, D. K., Hodges, J. C. F., Zhang, X. Y., Muchoney, D., Strahler, A. H., Woodcock, C.

Remote Sensing of the Environment, 83, 2 37-302.]), the 250 in classified images contained on average 50% more cropland area and improved the estimation of cropland area based on validation from ground control sites of croplands. Results from the decision tree classification for each state revealed that in 2004 agricultural burning contributed 73%, 54%, and 33% of total fires for Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana, respectively.

AB Coincident MISR and MODIS cloud-top heights retrieved above two vertically pointing radar sites (ARM-SGP and UK-CFARR) are compared for 54 scenes between March 2000 and October 2003. The difference between MODIS and MISR cloud-top heights is assessed in situations where multiple cloud layers are present in a vertical column (i.e., cloud overlap or multilayered cloud). MISR stereo cloud-top heights are known to be sensitive to low-level clouds of high contrast (between two camera views) even if high clouds with a wide range of optical thicknesses are also present in the scene. MODIS retrieved cloud-top heights do not experience this problem as long as the highest cloud layer has a visible optical thickness greater than approximately 1. Consequently, the difference in cloud-top heights between MODIS and MISR is often large and positive in cloud overlap conditions. In cloud overlap conditions, small differences between MODIS and MISR cloud-top heights can be found where both instruments detect the highest cloud layer or, on the contrary, where they both fail to detect the highest cloud but instead detect some lower level cloud. The comparison with radar cloud-top heights on a 2 1 -scene subset confirmed that large differences are associated with cloud overlap, but also showed that small differences can be found in similar situations if the highest layer is of large contrast (both instruments detect the highest cloud layer) or of extremely small optical thickness (both instruments fail to detect the highest cloud layer). With the use of a cloud-typing technique applied to MODIS data that can also identify areas containing cloud overlap, small differences were found to occur for 60-70% of all overlap pixels examined here, highlighting the weakness of using the MODIS-MISR cloud-top height differences as a sole indicator for automated cloud overlap detection. While the accuracy of the MODIS cloud-top pressure/height algorithm decreases as the cirrus optical thickness becomes less than 1, the MISR approach may still be able to infer an accurate cloud-top height depending on the cloud contrast between two view angles. However, synergy between the difference in MODIS-MISR cloud-top height analysis and the MODIS cloudtyping method could improve overlap detection for thin cirrus over low cloud situations and provide additional information on the cloud-top height of two distinct layers.

AB It is known that natural gas in the soil affects vegetation health, which may be detected through analysis of reflectance spectra. Since natural gas is invisible, changes in the vegetation could potentially indicate gas leakage. Although it is known that gas in soil affects plant reflectance, the relationship between natural gas and the development and reflectance properties of plants has not been studied. The objective of this study was to test whether natural gas and its two main components, methane and ethane, affect vegetation reflectance in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions. An experiment was carried out in which maize (Zea mays) plants were grown in pots that were flushed with 10 1 of gas per day for 39 4 days. Leaf reflectance was measured once a week with a spectrophotometer. The reflectance was analysed using continuum removal of the blue (400-550 nm), red (550-750 nm) and two water absorption features (1370-1570 nm and 1870-2170 nm), after which the band depths and normalized band depths were analyzed for each treatment. The band depth analysis showed that ethane caused an initial increase of 10% in reflectance between 560 and 590 nm, followed by a decrease during the course of the experiment. Normalized band depth analysis showed that ethane caused a reflectance shift of I to 5 nm towards longer wavelengths compared to the control reflectance in the visible region. All gases caused an increase in reflectance in the water absorption bands. The physiological reflectance index, PRI, which has previously linked water stress to photosynthetic activity, suggested that the hydrocarbon gases (particularly ethane) decreased the photosynthetic activity of the plants. The combination of reduced band depths in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions and the increased PRI suggests that ethane gas in the soil hampered a normal water uptake by maize plants in an early stage of their growth. Although further research is necessary to upscale the results from the laboratory to the field, the increased reflectance in the 560-590 nm region caused by ethane together with the increased PRI are promising indicators for gas leakage.

AB With the expectation of major shifts in climate, ecologists have focused attention on developing predictive relationships between current climatic conditions and species diversity. Climatic relationships appear best defined at regional rather than local levels. In reference to tree diversity, process-based models that express gross primary production (GPP) as an integrated function of climate seem most appropriate. Since 2000, NASA's MODIS satellite has provided composite data at 16-day intervals to produce estimates of GPP that compare well with direct measurements. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which is independent of climatic drivers, also appears a good surrogate to estimate seasonal patterns in GPP. In this paper we identified 65 out of 84 delineated ecoregions distributed across the contiguous U.S.A., within which sufficient (>= 200) Federal Inventory and Analysis survey plots were available to predict the total number of tree species, which varied from 17 to 164. Four different formulations of EVI were compared: The annual maximum, the annual integrated, the growing season defined mid-point and growing season averaged values. The growing season mid-point EVI defined the beginning and end of the active growing season. In all formulations of EVI, a polynomial function accounted for about 60% of the observed variation in tree diversity, with additional precision increasing to 80% when highly fragmented ecoregions with < 50% forest cover were excluded. Maps comparing predicted with measured tree richness values show similar patterns except in the Pacific Northwest region where a major extinction of tree genera is known to have occurred during the late Pliocene. The extent that these relationships remain stable under a changing climate can be evaluated by determining if the MODIS climate-driven estimate of GPP continues to match well with EVI patterns and systematic resurveys of forest vegetation indicate that tree species are able to adjust rapidly to climatic variation.

AB Forest regeneration assessment considers the abundance and condition of crop trees as well as the level of competing vegetation. Most remote sensing research has been conducted on conifer crop tree detection and assessment using imagery acquired in deciduous leaf-off conditions. Some research on competition assessment has been conducted using leaf-on imagery, but it is too costly and time consuming to require both leaf-off and leaf-on image acquisition and analysis for complete regeneration assessment. This paper evaluates the potential of automated methods for assessment of woody stem competition using very high-resolution (2 cm) leaf-off imagery. The intent is to couple the competition-evaluation methods with previously developed leaf-off conifer assessment methods. The automated method combined texture analysis, classification, and line detection. Results show that competition measures extracted from the processed imagery agreed well with estimates derived from both manual competition interpretation and field measurements. Manual estimates slightly outperformed automated extraction when compared against field measurements, but the best approach may be to combine them to optimize processing time and achieve the highest possible precision, particularly in areas where competition abundance is estimated to be close to a given silvicultural decision threshold.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most widely used vegetation index for retrieval of vegetation canopy biophysical properties. Several studies have investigated the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, but without any consensus on the two issues. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the spatial scale dependencies of NDVI and to analyze the relationship between NDVI and fractional vegetation cover at different resolutions based on linear spectral mixing models. Our results show strong spatial scale dependencies of NDVI over heterogeneous surfaces, indicating that NDVI values at different resolutions may not be comparable. The nonlinearity of NDVI over partially vegetated surfaces becomes prominent with darker soil backgrounds and with presence of shadow. Thus, the NDVI may not be suitable to infer vegetation fraction because of its nonlinearity and scale effects. We found that the scaled difference vegetation index (SDVI), a scale-invariant index based on linear spectral mixing of red and near-infrared reflectances, is a more suitable and robust approach for retrieval of vegetation fraction with remote sensing data, particularly over heterogeneous surfaces. The proposed method was validated with experimental field data, but further validation at the satellite level would be needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the use of multi-frequency, polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for quantifying the above ground biomass (AGB) of open forests and woodlands, NASA JPL AIRSAR (POLSAR) data were acquired over a 37 x 60 kin area west of Injune, central Queensland, Australia. From field measurements recorded within 32 50 x 50 in plots, AGB was estimated by applying species-specific allometric equations to stand measurements. AGB was then scaled-up to the larger area using relationships established with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired over 150 (10 columns, 15 rows) 500 x 150 in cells (or Primary Sampling Units, PSUs) spaced 4 x 4 kin apart in the north- and east-west directions. Large-scale (1 :4000) stereo aerial photographs were also acquired for each PSU to assess species composition. Based on the LiDAR extrapolations, the median AGB for the PSU grid was 82 Mg ha(-1) (maximum 164 Mg ha(-1)), with the higher levels associated with forests containing a high proportion of Angophora and Callitris species. Empirical relationships between AGB and SAR backscatter confirmed that C-, L- and P-band saturated at different levels and revealed a greater strength in the relationship at higher incidence angles and a larger dynamic range and consistency of relationships at HV polarizations. A higher level of saturation (above similar to 50 Mg ha(-1)) was observed at C-band HV compared to that reported for closed forests which was attributable to a link between foliage projected cover (FPC) and AGB. The study concludes that L-band HV backscatter data acquired at incidence angles approaching or exceeding 45 degrees are best suited for estimating the AGB up to the saturation level of similar to 80-85 Mg ha(-1). For regional mapping of biomass below the level of saturation, the use of the Japanese Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phase Arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR) is advocated.

AB This paper presents a statistical method for deriving optimal spatial sampling schemes. it focuses on ground verification of minerals derived from hyperspectral data. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) and spectral feature fitting (SFF) classification techniques were applied to obtain rule mineral images. Each pixel in these rule images represents the similarity between the corresponding pixel in the hyperspectral image to a reference spectrum. The rule images provide weights that are utilized in objective functions of the sampling schemes which are optimized through a process of simulated annealing. A HyMAP 126-channel airborne hyperspectral data acquired in 2003 over the Rodalquilar area in Spain serves as an application to target those pixels with the highest likelihood of occurrence of a specific mineral and as a collection the location of these sampling points selected represent the distribution of that particular mineral. In this area, alunite being a predominant mineral in the alteration zones was chosen as the target mineral. Three weight functions are defined to intensively sample areas where a high probability and abundance of alunite occurs. Weight function I uses binary weights derived from the SAM classification image, leading to an even distribution of sampling points over the region of interest. Weight function 11 uses scaled weights derived from the SAM rule image. Sample points are arranged more intensely in areas of abundance of alunite. Weight function III combines information from several different rule image classifications. Sampling points are distributed more intensely in regions of high probable alunite as classified by both SAM and SFF, thus representing the purest of pixels. This method leads to an efficient distribution of sample points, on the basis of a user-defined objective. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the unique features of the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) subsystem of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is the near-infrared back-looking view, which is obtained 55 s later than the corresponding nadir view. Although the stereoscopic capability derived from a combination of these two views was originally designed for use in land applications, serendipitous observation has shown that it also represents a promising source of data over water bodies. In fact, when coupled with surface temperature measurements derived from the sensor's thermal-infrared (TIR) component, stereo viewing forms a powerful observational capability that can be exploited in the monitoring of lake and marine environments. One important aspect introduced by the stereo system is the capability to measure the short-term displacements associated with surface currents and waves by comparing the nadir and back-looking views. In initial results presented here, surface motion was deduced from the displacement of a ship wake appearing in the Sun glitter regime of an ASTER image of the Izu Shoto islands, which lie to the southwest of Tokyo Bay, Japan. Within the natural limitations imposed by spatial and temporal resolutions, this measurement was found to be consistent with simultaneous surface current values derived from a nearby shore-based High-frequency (HF) radar system. The success of this basic comparison introduces the possibility that stereo imaging from space, if well tuned to follow the motion of surface slicks and other surface features within the Sun glitter regime, could provide a future means of observing surface current on a global scale.
   Data from the VNIR stereo system also highlights the influence of observational geometry. In the case of a surface with Sun glitter, this often manifests as a brightness reversal between the nadir and back-looking views in which relatively bright (dark) features at nadir appear dark (bright) in the back-looking view. Such a region of brightness reversal (ROBR) can be indicative of a locally rough or smooth surface texture as may be found, for example, in the vicinity of internal waves (rough) or ship wakes (smooth). Simple analysis based on a "Back to Nadir" ratio of relative radiances shows that the signal strengths measured by ASTER within a ROBR can yield a crude estimate of the mean square surface slope, which is an important parameter in theories of sea surface roughness imaging by devices such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
   Several other potential applications of VNIR stereo data in coastal zone and lake monitoring are considered here, including the study of internal waves (in the Strait of Gibraltar), derivation of wind velocity at cloud height, swell-wave propagation, suspended sediment transport, marine traffic monitoring and ship wake patterns. As the reflectivity of water in the near infrared reverses from low to high in the presence of Sun glitter, most of the applications discussed here involve glitter and hence some discussion of the influence of sensor view geometry is presented. The general conclusion of the paper is that future missions such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), which aim to deploy high spatial resolution stereo viewing systems primarily for land applications, should also return data of considerable value in oceanography and limnology, particularly if their observational geometry can be adjusted to permit the imaging of Sun glitter from water surfaces.

AB The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard NASA's Terra satellite measures multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) emission from the Earth's surface to space. Based on analysis of TIR spectral properties of typical rocks on the Earth, several mineralogic indices including the Quartz Index (QI), Carbonate Index (CI) and Mafic Index (MI) for detecting mineralogic or chemical composition of quartzose, carbonate and silicate rocks with ASTER-TIR data are proposed. These indices are applied to the ASTER-TIR data scenes for selected study areas in China and Australia. The results show that ASTER-TIR can discriminate quartz and carbonate rocks as well as mafic-ultramafic rocks, even with atmospherically uncorrected radiance-at-sensor data. Lithologic interpretations agree well with published geologic data and field observations. The mineralogic indices applied to ASTER-TIR provide one unified approach for lithologic mapping in and and semi-arid regions of the Earth. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The complex feedback relationship between climate variability and vegetation dynamics is a subject of intense investigation for its implications in furthering our understanding of the global biogeochemical cycle. We address an important question in this context: "How does topography influence the vegetation's response to natural climate fluctuations?" We explore this issue through the analysis of interannual vegetation variability over a very large area (continental United States) using long-term (13-year period of 1989-2001), monthly averaged, biweekly maximum value composite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. These data are obtained from satellite remote sensing at 1-km resolution. Through the novel implementation of data mining techniques, we show that the Nor-them Pacific climate oscillation and the ENSO phenomena influence the year-to-year vegetation variability over an extensive geographical domain. Further, the vegetation response to these fluctuations depends on a variety of topographic attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, and proximity to moisture convergence zones, although the first two are the predominant controls. Therefore, the dynamic response of terrestrial vegetation to climate fluctuations, which shows tremendous spatial heterogeneity, is closely linked to the variability induced by the topography. These findings suggest that the representation of vegetation dynamics in existing climate models, which do not incorporate such dependencies, may be inadequate. Therefore, climate models that are regularly employed to guide policy decisions need to better incorporate these dependencies for the assessment of terrestrial carbon sequestration under evolving climate scenarios.

TI Detection method of the Kuroshio front using the satellite-derived

AB Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) has been providing high-resolution information of the oceanic front. However, in summer, increasing surface heating effects make SSTs uniform and the SST front disappears. The purpose of the present study is to examine applicability of satellite-derived surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) for detection of the Kuroshio front in the ocean south of Japan during the summer season.
   The Kuroshio surface front is formed between the Kuroshio water (KW) and the coastal water (CW) in the study area. Investigating accumulated in situ observations of SST and Chl-a, it is shown that the difference of Chl-a between KW and CW is increased in summer though that of SST becomes small. Using 76 pairs of cloud-free satellite-derived SST and Chl-a images with 0.01 degrees spatial resolution, their seasonal variations are investigated through two-dimensional (2-D) histograms of Chl-a and SST. In summer, SST ranges from 25 to 30 degrees C and Chl-a ranges 0.03 to 0.4 mg/m(3). Two peaks in the summer 2-D histogram correspond to wider KW and CW areas with rather uniform Chl-a and SST distributions. The peak values are extracted from the 2-D histograms and used to determine a threshold value dividing the KW and CW surface Chl-a during summer. It is found that the Chl-a concentration of 0.17 mg/m(3) divides the extracted peaks into two groups, i.e., CW and KW except for a few peaks.
   The proposed Kuroshio-front detection method using the Chl-a images and the threshold value is examined using the satellite images and in situ data. The threshold contour superimposed in the summer Chl-a image distinctly separates the two representative waters in the ocean south of Japan. The front positions determined by the satellite-derived Chl-a, in situ SST, and in situ surface salinity transects along observation lines crossing the Kuroshio front agree with each other. Applying a traditional Kuroshio front index of temperature at 200 m depth, the capability of new Chl-a threshold in dividing two waters around the near-front area is quantitatively examined. Producing 74 match-ups of the satellite-derived Chl-a and 200-m temperature in the frontal zone, the dividing capability is evaluated quantitatively using the traditional Kuroshio-axis index. The detection capability of the proposed method is 82%, which can be considered high enough for practical applications. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LANDSAT; STRATEGY; IMAGERY; RATES
AB Area of gross change in land cover can be derived from a complete coverage land cover change map of a region of interest or estimated from a statistical sample of the region. Sampling may produce significant cost savings and more timely results because change is determined over a smaller total area than required by complete coverage mapping. Mean square error (MSE) defined in the context of a survey sampling measurement model is used to compare gross change estimators obtained from the two approaches. Measurement error bias attributable to error in classifying land cover change may occur with either the sampling or complete coverage mapping approach. An additional contribution to MSE attributable to sampling variability exists for the sampling-based estimator, but not the complete coverage estimator. If this sampling variability is small, the classification error bias of the sampling approach need not be reduced very far relative to the classification error bias of complete coverage to achieve similar MSE. Data from several published change accuracy error matrices are used to provide MSE comparisons for specific applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an evaluation of the operational MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) product over two temperate deciduous forests and focus on the seasonal variation. Two EUROFLUX beech (Fagus sylvatica) sites, Hesse, France and Soro, Denmark, were selected for this evaluation. The local LAI seasonal courses from the years 2001 to 2003 were retrieved based on a local radiative transfer model using above and below canopy radiation measurements. The MODIS LAI time series for the same years was created by downscaling the downloaded MODIS LAI data and filtering with the associated quality flags. Validation of MODIS LAI in the temporal scale included the traditional absolute value check and more importantly, the pattern check. Although MODIS LAI has generally lower absolute values than the local model, it is able to resemble the general patterns of the LAI seasonal trajectory of typical temperate deciduous forests. However, some obvious discrepancies are also noted in the two LAI time series. The MODIS LAI time series tends to rise early, to have a relatively short period of leaf constant period, and to have a much longer LAI decreasing period in the leaf senescent period as compared with the local LAI seasonal courses. The onset dates detected through MODIS LAI are significantly earlier than the local LAI determinations, which lead to the longer growing season length. It remains unclear if this apparent anticipation of canopy greening is a caused by understorey or herbal layer greening, that is known to occur earlier in European Beech forests or by other factors. The results indicate that MODIS LAI retrieval in these complex multi-layer deciduous forests is not unequivocal even with advanced sensors and algorithms, and care should be taken before using MODIS LAI retrieval for regional scale modeling applications.

AB Knowledge about land cover and its change is an important input for the monitoring and modeling of ecological and environmental processes from the regional to the global scale. Considerable efforts have been made to develop global continuous fields for different land cover types at large spatial scales based on NOAA-AVHRR and TERRA-MODIS data and a range of techniques have been applied to depict the sub-pixel fraction of land cover types from these data. In this study, a new methodology is described for deriving and optimizing continuous fields of tree cover for complex topography at the regional scale of the European Alps using generalized linear models (GLM). MODIS data (MOD09) at a spatial resolution of 500 m were used to calibrate the models against regional training data of fractional tree cover. For evaluating the method we test the GLM model output to a regression tree model (using the same data structure). Further we test the resulting GLM-based tree cover continuous fields against two different, independent test data sets; one of which is spatially separated and the other is from within the calibration area. Finally, we compare the GLM model output with two available global data sets at spatial resolutions of I km and 3 km: (1) TERRA-MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product (MOD44), and (2) the NOAA-AVHRR vegetation continuous fields. Our GLM-based method results in high accuracy. (MAE=9. 1%) and low bias (- 1.2%) across the combined evaluation and calibration area, and with small differences only between the calibration and the spatially separated evaluation area (1.3%). Compared to the regression tree model the results from the GLM model for all analyses are significantly better. Thus we conclude that generalized linear models are appropriate for deriving continuous fields of fractional tree cover for complex topography at the regional scale. GLMs can handle nonlinear relationships present in the training data set well, and the method is robust with respect to sample size and the number of months used for calibration. Regional calibrations of vegetation continuous fields may offer significantly improved predictions compared to globally calibrated models. Such regionally calibrated and optimized models may serve as valuable tools for regional monitoring of land cover pattern and its temporal change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information on the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice fields is needed for trace gas emission estimates, management of water resources, and food security. Paddy rice fields are characterized by an initial period of flooding and transplanting, during which period open canopy (a mixture of surface water and rice crops) exists. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the NASA EOS Terra satellite has visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands; and therefore, a number of vegetation indices can be calculated, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) that is sensitive to leaf water and soil moisture. In this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping algorithm that uses time series of three vegetation indices (LSWI, EVI, and NDVI) derived from MODIS images to identify that initial period of flooding and transplanting in paddy rice fields, based on the sensitivity of LSWI to the increased surface moisture during the period of flooding and rice transplanting. We ran the algorithm to map paddy rice fields in 13 provinces of southern China, using the 8-day composite MODIS Surface Reflectance products (500-m spatial resolution) in 2002. The resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map was evaluated, using the National Land Cover Dataset (1: 100,000 scale) derived from analysis of Landsat ETM+ images in 1999/2000. There were reasonable agreements in area estimates of paddy rice fields between the MODIS-derived map and the Landsat-based dataset at the provincial and county levels. The results of this study indicated that the MODIS-based paddy rice mapping algorithm could potentially be applied at large spatial scales to monitor paddy rice agriculture on a timely and frequent basis.

AB Given the importance of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for the structure and function of lake ecosystems, a method to estimate the amount of CDOM in lake waters over large geographic areas would be highly desirable. Advanced Land Imager (ALI) images were acquired in southern Finland (in 2002) and southern Sweden (in 2003) together with in situ measurements of bio-optical properties of 34 lakes (39 measuring stations). Based on this dataset, a band-ratio type algorithm was developed using ALI band 2 and band 3 for estimating CDOM content (absorption of filtrated water at 420 nm) in lakes. Correlation between in situ measured CDOM and the remote sensing estimate of CDOM was high, r(2)=0.73. The CDOM retrieval algorithm obtained on the basis of two images and in situ data was validated on a third ALI image (eastern Finland, 2002) that was available in the ALI image archive. In situ water-colour monitoring data from 22 lakes (27 measuring stations) in the third image were available in a database of the Finnish Environment Administration. The water-colour data were converted to CDOM absorption values, which were then compared to the results from a third ALI image. The correlation between remotely estimated and in situ CDOM values in the algorithm validation image was high, r(2)-0.83. These results support the conclusion that CDOM content in lakes over a wide range of concentrations (a(CDOM)(420) between 0.68 and 11.13 m(-1)) can be mapped using Advanced Land Imager data.

AB This paper describes a method for integrating leaf area index (LAI) derived from remote sensing data with an ecosystem model for accurate estimation of net primary productivity (NPP). The ecosystem model used in this study was Sim-CYCLE, with which LAI retrieved from the data acquired by MODIS sensor (MODIS-LAI) was integrated. Global annual NPP was estimated as 59.6 Gt C year(-1) by MOD-Sim-CYCLE (Sim-CYCLE after integration of MODIS-LAI), whereas it was 62.7 Gt C year(-1) in case of Sim-CYCLE for the year 2001. Both models predicted highest NPP around the equator with another smaller peak occurring around 60degreesN. These two regions represented the tropical and boreal forests biomes, respectively. The NPP estimated by MOD-Sim-CYCLE exceeded the NPP estimated by Sim-CYCLE in these two regions. Other than the tropical and boreal forests biomes, NPP values estimated by the MOD-Sim-CYCLE were typically lower than Sim-CYCLE across the latitudes. Validations of results in Australia and USA showed that MOD-Sim-CYCLE estimated NPP more accurately than Sim-CYCLE. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining satellite-observation with an ecosystem process model to achieve improved accuracy in estimates and monitoring global net primary productivity.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) models are often used with remotely sensed data products to estimate net primary production (NPP) from local to global scales. However, data on the variability of the LUE coefficient, epsilon, on the landscape are minimal and sometimes conflicting. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify and compare the variability of LUE among five forest cover types: aspen, northern hardwoods, red pine, forested wetland, and upland conifer; and (2) quantify the variability of epsilon between two years, 1999 and 2000, and relate differences to environmental conditions. The study site was in a northern temperate forest in Wisconsin, USA. Northern hardwood forests, primarily consisting of sugar maple, had the highest epsilon each year followed by aspen, red pine, forested wetlands, and upland conifer. NPP was estimated using radial growth measurements and published allometric equations. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) was estimated optically using a Li-Cor Plant Canopy Analyzer. Growing season - of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.42 in 1999 to 0.47 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Annual E of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.33 in 1999 to 0.36 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Growing season and annual g differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) among forest cover types for each year. Future research should consider variations in LUE among mixtures of many land cover types, especially forested wetlands. Results from this study show that LUE models should consider species-specific efficiency factors rather than biome-specific factors. Remote sensing-based land cover classifications should also reflect species differences for this area if the classification map is used in estimating NPP with an LUE model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Urban mapping using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery presents numerous challenges. These include spectral mixing of diverse land cover components within pixels, spectral confusion with other land cover features such as fallow agricultural fields and the fact that urban classes of interest are of the land use and not the land cover category. A new methodology to address these issues is proposed. This approach involves, as a first step, the generation of two independent but rudimentary land cover products, one spectral-based at the pixel level and the other segment-based. These classifications are then merged through a rule-based approach to generate a final product with enhanced land use classes and accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of derived products of Ottawa, Calgary and cities in southwestern Ontario is presented based on conventional ground reference data as well as inter-classification consistency analyses. Producer accuracies of 78% and 73% have been achieved for urban 'residential' and 'commercial/industrial' classes, respectively. The capability of Landsat TM to detect low density residential areas is assessed based on dwelling and population data derived from aerial photography and the 2001 Canadian census. For low population densities (i.e. below 3000 persons/km(2)), density is observed to be monotonically related to the fraction of pixels labeled 'residential'. At higher densities, the fraction of pixels labeled 'residential' remains constant due to Landsat's inability to distinguish between high-rise apartment dwellings and commercial/industrial structures.

AB An investigation of the estimation of leaf biochemistry in open tree crop canopies using high-spatial hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is presented. Hyperspectral optical indices related to leaf chlorophyll content were used to test different radiative transfer modelling assumptions in open canopies where crown, soil and shadow components were separately targeted using 1 m spatial resolution ROSIS hyperspectral imagery. Methods for scaling-up of hyperspectral single-ratio indices such as R-750/R-710 and combined indices such as MCARI, TCARI and OSAVI were studied to investigate the effects of scene components on indices calculated from pure crown pixels and from aggregated soil, shadow and crown reflectance. Methods were tested on 1-m resolution hyperspectral ROSIS datasets acquired over two olive groves in southern Spain during the HySens 2002 campaign conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Leaf-level biochemical estimation using 1-m ROSIS data when targeting pure olive tree crowns employed PROSPECT-SAILH radiative transfer simulation. At lower spatial resolution, therefore with significant effects of soil and shadow scene components on the aggregated pixels, a canopy model to account for such scene components had to be used for a more appropriate estimation approach for leaf biochemical concentration. The linked models PROSPECT-SAILH-FLIM improved the estimates of chlorophyll concentration from these open tree canopies, demonstrating that crown-derived relationships between hyperspectral indices and biochemical constituents cannot be readily applied to hyperspectral imagery of lower spatial resolutions due to large soil and shadow effects. Predictive equations built on a MCARI/OSAVI scaled-up index through radiative transfer simulation minimized soil background variations in these open canopies, demonstrating superior performance compared to other single-ratio indices previously shown as good indicators of chlorophyll concentration in closed canopies. The MCARI/OSAVI index was demonstrated to be less affected than TCARI/OSAVI by soil background variations when calculated from the pure crown component even at the typically low LAI orchard and grove canopies.

AB The Multiple-Forward-Mode approach to running the 5-Scale geometric-optical reflectance model (MFM-5-Scale) provides an inversion modeling capability for powerful but non-invertible models, and yields both landcover classification and forest biophysical-structural information that is important in global change projects such as BOREAS. Unlike regular forward mode, MFM-5-Scale does not require exact physical stand descriptors, but instead requires only input ranges and model increments that are easily obtained, with results determined by matching satellite image data with modeled reflectance values as stored in a look-up table. In this work, MFM-5-Scale was applied to a mosaic of seven multi-year (1991-1998) Landsat TM scenes covering the BOREAS region in western Canada, with results validated against field data and also compared with the Enhancement Classification Method (ECM), a highly accurate yet subjective and labour intensive approach which involves considerable user judgement and expertise. The goal was to approach ECM accuracy using MFM-5-Scale, but without the subjectivity of ECM. Classifications of 13 forest classes including deciduous and species-specific coniferous classes subdivided into low, medium and high crown densities as well as a mixed forest class were evaluated against 136 field checked validation sites. Overall classification accuracies were 91% for ECM and 85% for MFM-5-Scale. Additional assessments of agreement between the MFM-5-Scale and ECM products were also performed over larger sample areas. MFM-5-Scale classification of a full set of 25 forest and non-forest classes adhering to Global Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC) specifications was in 80% agreement with the ECM product (n = 11,442). This is viewed as a significant result given the ambitious and detailed nature of the classes considered (21 forest classes comprising 12 species and density specific conifer and deciduous classes, four mixed forest classes and five burnt forest classes, as well as four non-forest classes). The two products were also in 94% agreement for 6 forest density classes (it = 3730). MFM-5-Scale biophysical analysis of 63 BOREAS plots showed LAI was estimated within +/- 0.53 LAI compared with ground-based TRAC LAI validation data (biophysical information is not provided by ECM). These results represent significant progress towards defining an operational landcover and biophysical estimation approach given the objective, semi-automated nature of MFM-5-Scale physical scene modeling compared to subjective, user-driven methods such as ECM.

AB Remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a climatic water budget model, and the STATSGO database were used within a GIS environment to determine the influences of hydrologic soil properties on soil moisture and thermal emission in western-central Kansas for a dry year, 2000. Two important variables, water-holding capacity (WHC) and hydrologic soil group (HSG), were controlled in our water budget experiment to evaluate their impacts on soil moisture content (SMC) changes throughout the period. Results showed that HSG affected drought detection and occurrence very little, but WHC variations explained most local variations of soil moisture content. As a strong indicator of relative soil moisture deficit, the Standardized Thermal Index (STI) patterns were also influenced by WHC. Generally, the earlier the soil moisture content drops below 40%, the earlier the STI reaches a threshold value of 0.2 or higher. Vegetation responses to thermal detection lagged behind the STI by up to 8 weeks, which was computed by comparing the STI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) deviation from a 10-year mean. The spatial pattern of lag-times was not apparent, but lag-times were correlated with a WHC component. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Kuusk-Nilson forest reflectance model was used to study the effect of crown shape on the reflectance of Scots pine and Norway spruce stands. In the first part of the study, we examined spruce and pine stands with an age range of 20 - 100 years and compared their simulated hemispherical-directional reflectance factors (HDRFs) at nadir in red (661 nm), NIR (838 nm) and MIR (1677 nm) when crowns were modeled as ellipsoids or cones. In all the cases, when a stand was modeled with conical crowns, it had a smaller reflectance factor than the same stand with ellipsoidal crowns.
   To analyze the sensitivity of HDRF on crown shape, in the second part of the study we simulated the angular distributions of HDRF of two pine stands with different leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure values at 661 nm assuming four different crown shapes (cone, cylinder, ellipsoid, and cylinder bottom, cone top) and separated the components forming the HDRE Considerable difference in the HDRF between the four crown shapes was observed: The larger the crown volume, the higher the canopy reflectance at similar LAI and canopy closure. A comparison of the two stands revealed that in denser stands (with a higher canopy closure) single scattering from tree crowns was responsible for the difference in HDRF between the different crown shapes, whereas in stands with a smaller canopy closure the single scattering from ground dominated the HDRE Finally, the role of crown shape for the retrieval of LAI by inversion from remotely sensed data is discussed.

AB A multi-year study was carried out to evaluate ERS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for monitoring surface hydrologic conditions in wetlands of southern Florida. Surface conditions (water level, aboveground biomass, soil moisture) were measured in 13 study sites (representing three major wetland types) over a 25-month period. ERS SAR imagery was collected over these sites on 22 different occasions and correlated with the surface observations. The results show wide variation in ERS backscatter in individual sites when they were flooded and non-flooded. The range (minimum vs. maximum) in SAR backscatter for the sites when they were flooded was between 2.3 and 8.9 dB, and between 5.0 and 9.0 dB when they were not flooded. Variations in backscatter in the non-flooded sites were consistent with theoretical scattering models for the most part. Backscatter was positively correlated to field measurements of soil moisture. The Michigan MIcrowave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model predicts that backscatter should decrease sharply when a site becomes inundated, but the data show that this drop is only 1-2 dB. This decrease was observed in both non-wooded and wooded sites. The drop in backscatter as water depth increases predicted by MIMICS was observed in the non-wooded wetland sites, and a similar decrease was observed in wooded wetlands as well. Finally, the sensitivity of backscatter and attenuation to variations in aboveground biomass predicted by MIMICS was not observed in the data.
   The results show that the inter- and intra-annual variations in ERS SAR image intensity in the study region are the result of changes in soil moisture and degree of inundation in the sites. The correlation between changes in SAR backscatter and water depth indicates the potential for using spaceborne SAR systems, such as the ERS for monitoring variations in flooding in south Florida wetlands.

We obtained high spectral resolution reflectances, during the 2000 wet and dry seasons, over the major Cerrado types at Brasilia National Park (BNP) using the light aircraft-based Modland Quick Airborne Looks (MQUALS) package, consisting of a spectroradiometer and digital camera. Site-intensive biophysical and canopy structural measurements were made simultaneously at each of the Cerrado types including Cerrado grassland, shrub Cerrado, wooded Cerrado, Cerrado woodland, and gallery forest. We analyzed the spectral reflectance signatures, their first derivative analogs, and convolved spectral vegetation indices (VI) over all the Cerrado physiognomies. The high spectral resolution data were convolved to the MODIS, AVHRR, and ETM+ bandpasses and converted to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to simulate their respective sensors. Dry and wet season comparisons of the measured biophysical attributes were made with the reflectance and VI data for the different Cerrado physiognomies. We found that three major domains of Cerrado could be distinguished with the dry and wet season spectral signatures and vegetation indices. The EVI showed a higher sensitivity to seasonality than the NDVI; however, both indices displayed seasonal variations that were approximately one-half that found with the measured landscape green cover dynamics. Inter-sensor comparisons of seasonal dynamics, based on spectral bandpass properties, revealed the ETM+-simulated VIs had the best seasonal discrimination capability, followed by MODIS and AVHRR. Differences between sensor bandpass-derived VI values, however, varied with Cerrado type and between dry and wet seasons, indicating the need for inter-sensor VI translation equations for effective multi-sensor applications.

AB Experience with the first 2 years of high quality data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) through quality control and validation has suggested several improvements to the original MODIS active fire detection algorithm described by Kaufman, Justice et al. [Journal of Geophysical Research 103 (1998) 32215]. In this paper, we present an improved replacement detection algorithm that offers increased sensitivity to smaller, cooler fires as well as a significantly lower false alarm rate. Performance of both the original and improved algorithm is established using a theoretical simulation and high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) scenes. In general, the new algorithm can detect fires roughly half the minimum size that could be detected with the original algorithm while having an overall false alarm rate 10-100 times smaller.

AB Leaf and canopy fluorescence properties of field corn (Zea mays L.) grown under varying levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization were characterized to provide an improved N sensing capability which may assist growers in site-specific N management decisions. In vivo fluorescence emissions can occur in the wavelength region from 300 to 800 nm and are dependent on the wavelength of illumination. These light emissions have been grouped into five primary bands with maxima most frequently received from corn at 320 mn (UV), 450 nm (blue), 530 mn (green), 685 nm (red), and 740 nm (far-red). Two active fluorescence sensing systems have been custom developed; a leaf level Fluorescence Imaging System (FIS), and a canopy level Laser Induced Fluorescence Imaging System (LIFIS). FIS sequentially acquires high-resolution images of fluorescence emission bands under darkened laboratory conditions, while LIFIS simultaneously acquires four band images of plant canopies greater than or equal to1 m(2) under ambient sunlit conditions. Fluorescence emissions induced by these systems along with additional biophysical measures of crop condition; namely, chlorophyll content, N/C ratio, leaf area index (LAI), and grain yield, exhibited similar curvilinear responses to levels of supplied N. A number of significant linear correlations were found among band emissions and several band ratios versus measures of crop condition. Significant differences were obtained for several fluorescence band ratios with respect to the level of supplied N. Leaf adaxial versus abaxial surface emissions exhibited opposing trends with respect to the level of supplied N. Evidence supports that this confounding effect could be removed in part by the green/blue and green/red ratio images. The FIS and LIFIS active fluorescence sensor systems yielded results which support the underlying hypothesis that leaf and canopy fluorescence emissions are associated with other biophysical attributes of crop growth and this information could potentially assist in the site-specific management of variable-rate N fertilization programs.

AB About 20% of the final energy consumed in Europe is used in buildings. The active and passive use of solar energy is an approach to reduce the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions originated by buildings. Consideration of solar energy technologies in urban planning demands accurate information of the available solar resources. This can be achieved by the use of remote sensing data from geostationary satellites which show a very high spatial and a sufficient temporal resolution compared to ground station data. This paper gives a brief introduction to the HELIOSAT method applied to derive surface solar irradiance from satellite images and shows examples of applications: The use of daylight in buildings, the generation of correlated time series of solar irradiance and temperature as input data for simulations of solar energy systems and a short-term forecast of solar irradiance which can be used in intelligent building control techniques. Finally an outlook is given on potential improvements expected from the next generation of European meteorological satellites Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The presence of snow strongly impacts the exchange of moisture and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. In the interior of the northern hemisphere continents, snowmelt on frozen soils can cause or exacerbate major floods. Microwave remote sensing from satellite platforms has the potential to monitor the freeze-thaw status of soil and overlying snow packs over large areas. We evaluate the backscatter response of the NSCAT scatterometer to changing snow surface conditions, especially freeze and thaw status, using a macroscale hydrology model and the NSCAT backscatter data for the upper Mississippi River basin of the north central U.S. and the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) region in central Canada. We compared the snowmelt conditions simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model driven with surface meteorological observations with NSCAT measurements for 1996-1997 snow season. A mid-winter thaw event (in February) and late season melt (April-May) are evaluated for both regions. Comparison of backscatter images with daily and hourly-modeled snow surface wetness and temperature showed that the model agreed with the backscatter for snow surface wetness on some days but not on others. Factors such as NSCAT overpass times, vegetation on the ground and their freeze-thaw state, and liquid moisture content appear to contribute to these discrepancies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Decision tree classifiers have received much recent attention, particularly with regards to land cover classifications at continental to global scales. Despite their many benefits and general flexibility, the use of decision trees with high spatial resolution data has not yet been fully explored. In support of the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Mapping Program (VMP), we have examined the feasibility of using a commercially available decision tree classifier with multitemporal satellite data from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus (ETM+) instrument to map 11 land cover types at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near Milford, PA. Ensemble techniques such as boosting and consensus filtering of the training data were used to improve both the quality of the input training data as well as the final products.
   Using land cover classes as specified by the National Vegetation Classification Standard at the Formation level, the final land cover map has an overall accuracy of 82% (kappa = 0. 80) when tested against a validation data set acquired on the ground (n = 195). This same accuracy is 99.5% when considering only forest vs. nonforest classes. Usage of ETM+ scenes acquired at multiple dates improves the accuracy over the use of a single date, particularly for the different forest types. These results demonstrate the potential applicability and usability of such an approach to the entire National Park system, and to high spatial resolution land cover and forest mapping applications in general.

AB Automated techniques for satellite imagery navigation and co-location are especially required for environmental monitoring activities intensively using satellite data. In this work are presented the results obtained after 2 years of operational use of the Subpixel Automatic Navigation of AVHRR (SANA) scheme. An automatic method for accuracy assessment of satellite navigation techniques, which permits a preliminary evaluation of their performances, dealing with a large collection of test images is also proposed. The navigation accuracy assessment, performed by using a selection of small islands as reference points, is discussed.
   Results achieved over more than 400 Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) scenes confirm that the SANA scheme is a very accurate one (computed mean navigation error is generally about one AVHRR pixel). Furthermore, because of its high processing speed, it can be considered a suitable tool for intensive satellite data processing in multitemporal analyses, especially required for environmental studies as well as for operational monitoring purposes.

ID MACROTIDAL FLAT; SEA; CHENIER; STORMS; COAST
AB Waterline extraction is potentially one of the most effective satellite remote sensing tools for studying changes in tidal flat environment and coastlines. However, its application to the study of tidal flats has not been investigated in detail. The waterline in a tidal flat in Gomso Bay, Korea is characterized and evaluated using 27 sets of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and Earth Observing System-Terra (EOS-Terra) Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) data. Ground truth data including grain size, soil moisture content, ground levelling, and waterline tracking have been obtained. The choice of spectral bands in terms of tidal conditions turned out to play a key role in locating the waterline. While the waterlines extracted from near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) data are commonly reliable on the flood tide, the discrepancies between different bands become large on the ebb tide. The bands TIR, NIR, and SWIR are, in that order, decreasingly effective in extracting the waterline while ebb tides are in progress. The effect of turbid water on NIR can be reduced by a ratioing of NIR and the visible band. The location of the waterline is also an important factor to consider; the discrepancy is largest on the middle tidal flat. Selection of the proper band for waterline extraction under various conditions is suggested. However, no single band can accommodate all aspects of the tidal flat environment. A schematic model associated with the spectral reflectance of the tidal flat is proposed in which the remnant water scattered on the surface after exposure is emphasized as an additional factor.

AB Savanna ecosystems are water limited and responsive to rainfall on short time scales, characteristics that can be exploited to estimate fractional cover of trees, grass, and bare soil over large-scale areas from synthesis of remote sensing and rainfall measurements. A method is presented to estimate fractional cover based upon the differing ways in which grasses and trees respond to rainfall, and implementation of this method is demonstrated along the Kalahari Transect (KT), an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Seasonally averaged normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the sensitivity of the NDVI to interannual variations in wet season rainfall are used as state-space variables in a linear unmixing model. End members for this analysis were determined on the basis of best fit to the observed data. The realized end members were consistent with the qualitative characteristics of trees (high NDVI, low sensitivity of NDVI to interannual variations in rainfall), bare soil (low NDVI, low sensitivity), and the transient grass/bare soil area (moderate NDVI, high sensitivity). Observed sensitivity of NDVI to rainfall was measured as the relationship between wet season NDVI and normalized rainfall over a 16-year period (1983-1998). The unmixing model yields a north-to-south decrease in tree fractional cover that corresponds to the decrease in mean wet season precipitation from 1600 to 300 mm along the KT (R-2 =. 87). The fractional tree cover results compare favorably with available ground-based observations. The potential extent of grass cover is limited by the dominance of trees on the northern end of the transect, peaks at the location with approximately 450 mm of mean wet season rainfall, and is limited by rainfall in the and southern portion of the transect. With mean NDVI for grass inferred from the data, yearly estimates of tree, grass, and bare soil fractional cover can be derived. These annual estimates, which are difficult to obtain from traditional unmixing procedures, are important parameters in fuel load and land-atmosphere exchange models. No calibration or training sets were required for this analysis, and this method has the additional capability to predict fractional-cover components for future rainfall scenarios.

AB Although the interaction between linear polarized microwaves and agricultural targets has been studied extensively, far less is understood about the added information provided from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs), Using 1994 Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) data, this Study examines the sensitivity of linear polarizations and polarimetric parameters to conditions present on agricultural fields during the period of preplanting and postharvest, The polarimetric parameters investigated include circular polarized backscatter, pedestal height, and co-polarized phase differences (PPD). The co-polarization signature plots are also discussed. Results indicate that the dominant scattering mechanism from these fields varies depending on the type and amount of residue cover, and whether the crop had been harvested. Radar parameters most sensitive to Volume and Multiple scattering perform best at characterizing these surface conditions. These parameters are the pedestal height. as well as the linear cross-polarization (HV) and the circular co-polarization (RR). The co-polarization signature plots and the standard deviation associated with the PPD are also useful in categorizing these cover types. However, the field average PPD provides little information on residue and soil characteristics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SUPPORT
AB New sensors and new technologies for remotely sensed data acquisition have proven useful for mapping urban environments. In this paper, a new dataset from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spaceborne sensor, as used with support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithms for classification processing. A case study of Beer-Sheva, Israel demonstrates that ASTER data are suitable for urban studies. The classification results also show that the approach based on SVM has high performance in convergence, speed. and accuracy of training and classifying. Field validation shows that the classification is reliable for urban studies, with high classification precision and little confusion (88.6% average overall accuracy and 9.6% average omission error for 15-m resolution image classification vs. 89.9% average overall accuracy and 11.2% average omission error for 30-m resolution image classification). For the 30-m multispectral data, there are only five classes vs. six for the 15-m visible spectrum data. Despite the additional classes retrieved from the visible data, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) data provides the accuracy in differentiating some of the confused classes.

AB A new method for a composite evaluation of atmospheric resistance, surface resistance, and evapotranspiration rate (lambdaE) is applied to Landsat-5 TM. The method uses three equations to solve for three variables: the atmospheric resistance between the surface and the air (r(ae)); the surface resistance (r(s)); and the vapour pressure at the surface (e(s)). The novelty of this approach is the estimation of e(s), which is assessed using the decoupling coefficient (Omega) by Jarvis and McNaughton [Adv. Ecol. Res. 15 (1986) 1]. The input parameters are: surface temperature (T-s), net radiation (R-n), soil heat flux (G), air temperature (T-a), and air humidity (e(a)). A time series (100 days) of field data collected for a wheat crop is used to illustrate the method, which is validated using latent heat fluxes recorded by the eddy covariance technique. The control of r(s) on lambdaE is expressed through the Surface Control Coefficient (SCC = 1-Omega), which is compared to soil moisture data. The application of the technique in a remote sensing monitoring context is demonstrated for a Danish agricultural landscape containing crops at different stages of development. For the satellite-based estimation of lambdaE and SCC, the variables T-s, R-n, and G are calculated on the basis of Landsat-5 TM, which leaves solar irradiance (for computing R-n), T-a, and e(a) as the only field data required. The method is directly applicable without any calibration when the soil surface is moist or when the vegetation cover is dense. Only for a dry bare soil surface, where the effective source area of water vapour is below the surface, is the modification of a surface humidity parameter (h(s,max)) required.

AB Land soil moisture conditions play a critical role in evaluating terrestrial environmental conditions related to ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. Extensive efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex variable are still underway. Among the various methods, several investigators have explored a combination of surface temperatures and spectral vegetation index (SVI) measurements, the TVX method, as a means to account for the variable influence of vegetation cover in soil moisture assessment. Although considerable empirical evidence has been presented exploring the potential of TVX methods to assess regional moisture conditions, less attention has been given to assessing the underlying biophysics of the observed TVX patterns. In this study, the Simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model is exploited to examine the factors that lead to the observed TVX relation. For a range of typical, midlatitude, growing season conditions, the SSiB model produces the expected TVX relationship, surface temperature decreases with increasing SVI values. The most critical factors that cause the TVX relation to vary include near-surface soil moisture (2 cm), incident radiation (IR), and, to a lesser degree, wind speed. Whereas many empirical studies have suggested that the slope of the TVX relation may provide an important diagnostic of soil moisture conditions, in this analysis, the impact of plant stomatal function is shown to confuse this interpretation of the TVX slope. However, other aspects of the TVX metrics, specifically bare soil temperature and canopy temperature. do provide diagnostic near-surface soil moisture information. Growing season variations in TVX metrics were examined for the conditions recorded at the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-Mobilhy) study site. The results from this analysis indicate that soil and canopy temperatures vary as a function of soil moisture conditions and, to a lesser degree, as a result of varying solar insolation and wind speed. The results also show that the TVX metrics are able to provide daily soil moisture variation up to 2 cm of soil depth and seasonal trend up to 10 cm. Using the satellite-derived surface temperatures and a SSiB-derived retrieval equation, the retrieved soil moistures at the HAPEX-Mobilhy site generally closely approximate the conditions recorded on the ground.

AB Moisture availability is estimated in the 1.1 million km(2) Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeast Australia. Remotely sensed data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are combined with meteorological data to estimate the Normalised Difference Temperature Index (NDTI). The NDTI provides a measure of the moisture availability, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration. Sur-face temperature minus air temperature, percent vegetation cover and net radiation explained 85% of variation in the modelled NDTI. Using these three covariates across the network of meteorological stations allows NDTI images, which maps changes in Moisture availability across the MDB, to be calculated. This method uses a calculate then interpolate (CI) approach that uses the per-pixel variation present in the AVHRR data as the backbone for the spatial interpolation. Using the spatially dense AVHRR-based covariates in a Cl approach avoids errors that occur between measurement points when interpolating variables for regional hydrologic modelling, most significantly the spatial pattern of rainfall. The NDTI provides a link into regional water balance modelling which does not require daily rainfall to be spatially interpolated. Assessing spatial and temporal interactions between the NDTI and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides useful information about regional hydroecological processes, including agricultural management, within the context of Australia's highly variable climate and sparse network of meteorological stations.

AB The estimation of ground radiance and emissivity from Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data is strongly dependent on the atmospheric correction applied to these data. Since such corrections are a function of the atmospheric path between the sensor and ground, correction techniques that do not consider the topographic variations within a scene can introduce appreciable error in the estimation of the atmosphere effects. In this paper. we describe the development and application of a variable-elevation atmospheric correction procedure. Our objective was to incorporate changes in target altitude into a general atmosphere correction strategy. This procedure was tested on a TIMS data set acquired over Mt. Etna, Italy in July 1986. The methodology adopted in this study is based on the use of the LOWTRAN radiative transfer code and a digital elevation model (DEM) registered to the image data. The image data are divided into a series of layers, based on elevation. and a separate atmosphere correction is applied to each layer. Maps of emissivity estimates derived with the variable-elevation approach were compared with geologic maps of the Etna flow fields. Prior to the variable-elevation correction, the emissivity spectra of long lava flows appeared to vary with elevation. Following the variable-elevation correction, many of these spectral artifacts were removed from the emissivity maps. In addition. the variable-elevation correction increased our ability to discriminate individual lava flows. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; FOREST; SIMULATION; CYCLE
AB A growing number of studies have shown that reflectance changes at 531 nm, associated with the xanthophyll cycle and the related thylakoid energisation are widespread among plant species. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), derived from narrow band reflectance at 531 and 570 nm has been related with some success to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). Such a relationship would enable the estimation of stand photosynthesis from remotely sensed data. However, canopy PRI is an integral of the component leaf response weighted by the strength of the signal from each leaf to the sensor. This analysis investigates the extent to which canopy structure, view, and illumination angles are likely to influence the measured canopy PRI. A one-dimensional ray tracing radiative transfer model was used to estimate light distribution within a canopy and the dynamic response of individual foliar elements, based oil a published relationship between PRI and LUE and a simple photosynthetic light response function. The model estimated the LUE of the canopy, based oil both incident and absorbed light, and reflectance of the canopy at the desired wavelengths and hence the canopy PR1. A range or solar zenith, leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distributions (LAD), and soil types were used to determine the likely influence on measured canopy PRI. The results show a positive correlation between PRI and LUE variation at canopy scale. However, the index shows a greater variation of view angle than most vegetation indices. The index is strongly influenced by varying soil background for LAI < 3. At large viewing angles (> 30 degrees) the index is also sensitive to LAD. Correction for Rayleigh scattering is necessary to relate the index to ground measured PRI. Results Show that the PRI value is most sensitive to changes in LAI. Utilisation of the relationship to predict or improve estimates of canopy LUE based oil either absorbed or incident light will require an independent estimate of LAI change between dates/locations of in situ measurements and of remote sensing observations.

ID INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION; SPECTRORADIOMETER
AB A vicarious reflectance-based calibration experiment for the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) airborne simulator, AirMISR, is described as one precursor experiment of this type planned for postlaunch application to MISR itself The experiment produces a set of multiangle near-top-of-atmosphere radiances that are compared with the multiangle AirMISR radiances, established using a laboratory calibration. The field and aircraft data were collected as part of an engineering test flight at Moffett Field, CA, on November 5, 1997. A concrete tarmac was used as the field target. Atmospheric optical depth data were collected adjacent to the target throughout the actual overflight period using a single Reagan solar radiometer. For logistical reasons, the surface hemispherical directional reflectance factor (HDRF) was determined 7 days later using the Portable Apparatus for Rapid Acquisition of Bidirectional Observation of the Land and Atmosphere III (PARABOLA III), along with the areally averaged spectral HDRF at normal incidence, obtained with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec moderate resolution field spectrometer. AirMISR overflew the target under clear sky conditions though the aerosol turbidity was high (similar to 0.3 at 550 nm). Good to fair agreement has been obtained at all angles and wavelengths between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances calculated for the measured atmospheric and surface conditions and the radiances incident at AirMISR as determined from the laboratory calibration. Some systematic disagreements are present. The largest disagreements (similar to 15% in the blue) are found at the highest view angles and the smallest at nadir viewing (<5%). Possible explanations for the differences in radiances at large view angles are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote-sensing scenes can provide information highly useful for real-time modelling of the atmospheric deposition in the case of an accidental nuclear release. Accurate prediction of spatial patterns in the deposition is vital to establish countermeasures to avoid unnecessary exposure of the public. This is demonstrated by a hypothesised case for a nuclear power plant in Lithuania. From classification analysis a number of land cover classes are mapped in an LRS-IC LISS III scene. The roughness of each land cover class is assigned and used as input to a real-time dispersion model. Calculation results with input of a high-resolution roughness map provide the most realistic deposition pattern. A scare analysis of degrading the land cover map into lower resolutions is performed. The atmospheric deposition model results based on lower resolution roughness maps are compared and evaluated by the so-called Dose Isopleth Correlation Area (DICA) method. The recommendation is that a l-km resolution is adequate for real-time deposition modelling. Furthermore, the land cover mapping should be performed with care. Temporal variations in roughness at a seasonal time scale should be considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using 180 degrees field-of-view (full-sky) imaging polarimetry, we measured the spatiotemporal change of the polarization pattern of the entire celestial hemisphere during the total solar eclipse of ii August 1999 in Kecel, Hungary. We compared these patterns with the normal celestial polarization patterns measured at the same times on the subsequent day of the eclipse. As a second control sky, the celestial polarization pattern measured on 26 August 1999 in Tunisia was chosen with the same solar zenith distance as that at the Hungarian eclipse. We computed the corresponding theoretical celestial polarization patterns on the basis of the single-scattering Rayleigh model. The spectral characteristics of the polarization pattern in the sky during totality were also measured in the red (650 nm), green (550 nm), and blue (450 nm) ranges of the spectrum. A qualitative explanation was given for the origin of the angle of polarization (E-vector) pattern and the neutral point of skylight polarization near the zenith observed Juring totality. The I elation of our results to earlier observations on skylight polarization during total eclipses was analyzed. The agreements with previous eclipse observations were discussed. The reasons for some disagreements with previous eclipse observations were explained in connection with the spectral dependence of skylight polarization and the fine structure of the celestial E-vector pattern during totality.

AB The first and second harmonics of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) concisely summarize the amplitude and phase of annual and biannual signals embedded in time-series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We applied and evaluated the DFT using monthly composited NDVI data over a 7-year period for a 150 x 150-km study area in southern California. The study area contains strong gradients in environmental conditions and basic vegetation formations. Analysis of the DFT harmonics for six point-locations provided a basis for linking the DFT results to basic vegetation types according their characteristic phenologies. The mean NDVI, or 0th-order harmonic, indicated overall productivity, allowing the differentiation of unproductive, moderately productive, and highly productive sites. The amplitude of the first harmonic indicated the variability of productivity over the year as expressed in a single annual pulse of net primary production. This summarized the relative dominance of evergreen vs. deciduous or annual habit. The phase of the first harmonic summarized the timing of green-up relative to the timing of winter and spring rains. This differentiated rapidly responding annual grasslands, slowly responding evergreen life-forms, and irrigated agriculture. The second harmonic indicated the strength and timing of any biannual signal. This provided information on secondary vegetation types, such as subcanopy grasses beneath evergreen woodlands or mixtures of annual grasslands and irrigated agriculture. The point-based analysis provided the foundation for a regional analysis of the entire study area. The mean NDVI and first- and second-order amplitude and phase, in conjunction with 148 field-sampled polygons, were used to produce an unsupervised classification of basic vegetation formations for the study area. These results were evaluated by comparison with other land cover products, and through assessment using field-sampled test regions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI BRDF correction of vegetation in AVHRR imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; DIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE
AB In this article we present a method for correcting AVHRR visible and near-infrared imagery for varying satellite and solar zenith angles. This method is based on the WAK BRDF model for closed canopies. The parameters required to perform BRDF correction can be derived from consecutive pass AVHRR imagery pairs. This imagery provides two views of the land surface close together in time but with large differences in phase angle. It is reasonable to assume that both the surface and the atmosphere will change little between orbits, and that after BRDF correction reflectances of given targets should be the same in both orbits. Before BRDF parameters can be fitted, atmospheric correction must be performed. To improve this process, average monthly atmospheric profiles and aerosol optical depths are used as radiative transfer model inputs in conjunction with a digital elevation model. Using atmospheric corrected reflectance data from 12 NOAA-14 AVHRR image pairs, BRDF parameters were extracted for predominant vegetation groups in New Zealand: indigenous forest; exotic forest; scrub; pasture; and tussock grassland. For each of these vegetation groups significant non-Lambertian reflectance behavior was observed, and BRDF correction using the derived equal reflectance line gives a measure of the accuracy of the method. After correction, the RMS reflectance errors were approximately 0.01 in the visible and 0.02 in the near-infrared. A vegetation map specifying the proportions of the vegetation groups at any given location can be used to perform regular BRDF correction. Reflectance standardization to a fixed view and sun angle can then be performed using the pre-derived BRDF parameters and proportional BRDF correction. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The non-Lambertian nature of the terrestrial surface is a major source of unexplained variability in wide-swath satellite sensor data acquired in the solar reflective wavelengths, hindering quantitative analysis in the spectral, temporal, and locational domains. The interactions of light with the surface are governed by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and modeling this is one of the most promising methods for describing and explaining this variability. Here the Roujean linear semiempirical kernel-driven (LiSK) model was tested against two independent bidirectional reflectance factor datasets that were acquired close to ground level over seminatural semiarid grasslands in Xilingol, Inner Mongolia (People's Republic of China) and in Arizona (United States). The objectives were to determine how well the model is able to describe and explain observed bidirectional reflectance factor distributions in the red and near-infrared wavelengths, to explore its utility in correcting such data for angular variations, and the likely impact of such corrections on cover-type discrimination. The sensitivity of the model to reductions in the number and angular distribution of the bidirectional reflectance observations with which it is inverted was also evaluated. The results show that the model is able to describe the observed multiangular BRFs with good accuracy and with low sensitivity to the number of angular inputs, with observations in the forward-scattering direction shown to be important in constraining inversions. The behavior of retrieved parameters indicates that one or more of the simplifying assumptions made in the model derivation is likely to be too severe for explaining BRDF in the near-infrared region; non-negligible anisotropic multiple scattering and the assumption of an optically thick medium mean that a physical interpretation of parameters is unlikely to be valid. However, the model is shown to provide an effective means of correcting for BRDF effects, allowing greater precision and consistency than hitherto possible in the retrieval of surface spectral reflectance over simiarid grasslands and concrete improvements in cover-type discrimination.

ID IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE
AB Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to high resolution laboratory reflectance spectra of soil samples reflecting the range of soil development levels in a test site in the southern Apennines (Fortore beneventano) in Italy. Principal component analysis was used to identify the dominant characteristics of soil spectra and cluster analysis to group samples into homogeneous classes. The analysis was applied stepwise (1) to a minimum number of reflectance values, representative of the general shape and curvature of soil spectra, and (2) to the normalized amplitude (depth) of characteristic absorption bands. In the first step analysis, it was found that the brightness and the visible near-infrared (VIS-NIR) slope of the spectra are important spectral characteristics to discriminate soil development, also in relation to the underlying lithology. The principal intercorrelation between the brightness, the VIS-NIR spectral slope, and various soil properties, such as calcium carbonate content, organic matter, and texture, could be also explained. In the second step, it was demonstrated that different types of soil include in the homogeneous groups, resulting from the first step multivariate analysis, could be further separated, mainly as function of the iron oxide features and the two main water and hydroxyl absorption bands at 1400 nm and 1900 nm. These results suggest that our method is suitable for the evaluation and interpretation of remote sensing data for discriminating different soil development and degradation levels of large parts of the Apennines, which are similar to the test area. The brightness and the VIS-NIR slope components derived int he first step multivariate analysis may be retrievable from common multispectral systems such as Landsat-TM. The application of the second step multivariate analysis, however, would require the use of hyperspectral systems capable of retrieving the absorption features. In both cases rigorous atmospheric correction including the removal of the effects of relief illumination is a prerequisite. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has three visible bands centered at 485 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm which can be used for ocean applications. This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.

AB This article proposes a nara approach for estimation of the transpiration rate in sparse canopies. The method relies on a combination of techniques; some of which having a successful background of solid experimental and theoretical justification, while others having only recently been introduced as promising tools for the extraction of environmental information from satellite data. The transpiration rate (lambda E-v) is calculated by applying an energy balance approach to the vegetation component of the land surface: lambda E-v=R-n(v)-H-v, where R-n(v) is the net radiation absorbed by the vegetation, and H-v is the sensible heat flux between the leaves and the air within the canopy. R-n(v) is calculated through the use of remote sensing and standard meteorological data by combining a conventional method for estimation of the land surface net radiation with a ground-calibrated function of NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index). H-v is assessed as a linear function of the temperature difference between vegetation (T-v) and the mean canopy air stream (To) Because the surface temperature (T-s) recorded by satellite contains combined information of both soil and vegetation, T-v is evaluated on the basis of the linear NDVI-T-s relationship for individual surface types. T-0 is assessed utilizing recent evidence that (T-s-T-0) is linearly related to the difference in surface temperature and air temperature above the canopy (Ts-T-u), with the slope coefficient depending only on canopy structure. The method is tested using remote sensing data ranging from ground-based, airborne, and satellite recordings. The modeled transpiration rates compared well to measurements of sapflow data and latent heat fluxes recorded for a wide range of surface types (agricultural crops, natural vegetation, forest vegetation).

AB Estimation of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis from remote sensing data frequently use soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models (SVAT models). These models compute energy and mass transfer using descriptions of turbulent, radiative, and water exchanges, as well as a description of stomatal control in relation with water vapor transfers and photosynthesis. Remote sensing data mall provide information that is useful for driving SVAT models (e.g., surface temperature, surface soil moisture, canopy structure, solar radiation absorption, or albedo). Forcing or recalibration methods may be employed to combine remote sensing data and SWAT models. In this article a review of SVAT models and remote sensing estimation of energy and mass fluxes is presented. Examples are given based on our work on two different SVAT models. Eventually, some of the difficulties in the combined use of multispectral remote sensing data and SVAT models are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

TI A revised measurement methodology for conifer needles spectral optical
   properties: Evaluating the influence of gaps between elements
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID REFLECTANCE; SPRUCE; CANOPY
AB Gaps are unavoidable when compositing small or narrow plant parts (e.g., conifer needles, twigs, narrow leaves, and leaflets) on sample holders in preparation for measuring spectral optical properties. The Daughtry et al. (1989) (A new technique to measure the spectral properties of conifer needles. Remote Sens. Environ. 27:81-91.) method of measuring conifer needle optical properties utilizes a relatively large gap fraction (approximately 0.3-0.6) and needles painted black on one surface of the sample from which the gap fraction of the sample is indirectly determined. Following this protocol typically results in distortions in optical properties, including underestimates in transmittance (sometimes negative values), and only one surface of the sample can be measured. The objectives of this article are to: 1) evaluate the influence of gaps between sample elements (conifer needles, twigs, narrow leaves and leaflets) on optical properties calculated with the published equations from Daughtry et al. (1989) and 2) revise the original Daughtry et al. method for optical property measurements by using an image-analysis to directly measure the gap fraction and use both surfaces of the sample. We achieve these objectives by reviewing the theory and investigating the effects of gaps by measurements of an inert photographic film material, fir needles, and mesquite leaflets. Tests to estimate the transmittance of film samples (film) and foliage (fir needles, mesquite leaflets) indicate that a relatively small gap fraction (less than 0.20) reduces the occurrence of computed negative transmittance values, reduces the variation in computed values, and yields values expected for the "true" or "nongap" transmittance. Employing the image analysis along with reduced gap fractions decreased the variance of measurements and permitted measurements of both surfaces per sample, thus reducing the time required by making half as many samples as originally required by Daughtry et al.

AB The Japanese Geostationary Meterological Satellite 5 (GMS-5) carries the Visible and infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR), which has two thermal infrared channels within the "so-called" atmospheric window. These channels are similar to the split-window channels of the AVHRR-2 and are potentially useful for determining surface temperatures. The purpose of the present work is to determine the accuracy of land surface temperatures derived from the GMS-5 VISSR. For a period of 10 clear days during March 1997 hourly digital data from the GMS-5 VISSR are analyzed over two ground-truth sites in Australia. The satellite and ground-truth data are used to test the efficacy of a variety of published land surface temperature (LST) algorithms. NOAA AVHRR-2 data are also used to compare and contrast the accuracies of the LST estimates from these instruments. The results show that LST can be determined from the GMS-5 VISSR to root-mean-squared accuracy of 2-3 degrees C with little bias. Two land surface temperature algorithms are validated and presented for use with the GMS-5 VISSR split-window radiances. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Several global datasets on fire distribution are being generated from remotely sensed data to support research on the ecological impacts of biomass burning. This article examines the strengths and weaknesses of a number of approaches to the monitoring of biomass burning at a regional scale and suggests how to best combine the information content on fire distribution provided by different earth observation satellites. Remotely sensed data acquired over Central Africa from a variety of sensors (air-borne video camera, SPOT XS, Landsat Thematic Mapper, NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, and ERS-1 Along Track Scanning Radiometer) were used to provide quantitative measurements of the spectral separability, and temporal and spatial sampling associated with the detection of burnt areas and active fires. Three main strategies to the monitoring of biomass burning were analyzed: detection of burnt areas at fine spatial resolution, detection of burnt areas at coarse spatial resolution and high temporal frequency, and detection of active fires at a coarse spatial resolution and high temporal frequency. In each case, we assess the detectability of the selected biomass burning indicator, the statistical representativity in time and space of the sample detected and whether the sample observations are an unbiased estimator of the total biomass burning events in the region. We conclude that while active fire detection remains important in defining the seasonality, timing, and interannual variations in biomass burning, the most reliable strategy for estimating biomass burning at a regional scale is a multisensor approach in which regional burnt area estimates from coarse spatial resolution data are calibrated on the basis of a sample of fine spatial resolution estimates of burnt areas, using a double sampling with regression estimator approach.

AB To recover the ocean water-leaving radiance and derive biophysical parameters from observations of space-borne ocean color sensors, the required uncertainty in the measured top-of-atmosphere radiance is at present impossible to achieve prior to launch. A methodology and strategy for achieving the required uncertainty in the post-launch era is presented here. The method consists of combining direct measurements of the water-leaving radiance, white-cap radiance, and aerosol optical thickness made simultaneously with satellite overpasses, with radiative transfer theory to reduce the calibration uncertainty of the visible bands with respect to the near-infrared (NIR). This procedure is possible over the open ocean, where, in the absence of aerosol transported from land over long distances by the wind, the atmosphere can be very clear with most of the aerosol generated by local processes such as breaking waves, for example, the aerosol optical thickness in the visible similar to 0.05-0.10. In this case, the radiative transfer process is considerably simplified and molecular scattering is the dominant atmospheric component in the visible. It is shown that such a procedure alone is sufficient to reduce the calibration uncertainty to required levels. Further reduction is possible by reducing the uncertainty in the NIR calibration by measuring sky radiance from island locations (or a ship), and using these to predict the at-sensor radiance. For the most part, this NIR calibration is limited by the uncertainty in the calibration of the radiometer used to measure the sky radiance. Finally, the sensory calibration is maintained by monitoring the actual water-leaving radiance continuously at a single location, where the atmosphere is sufficiently clear that atmospheric correction introduces only a small error, and directly comparing the true and the sensor-derived water-leaving radiances.

ID MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES; AVIRIS DATA; ENHANCEMENT
AB image fusion is used to merge images of different spatial and spectral resolutions to create a high spatial resolution multispectral combination. High spectral resolution allows identification of materials in the scene, while high spatial resolution locates those materials. Spectral mixing is an algorithm that estimates the percentage of each material (called endmembers) within each low resolution multi/hyperspectral pixel. In this article we extend the spectral mixing (unmixing) approach to use one or more higher resolution sharpening images, locating the endmembers to higher spatial accuracy. The approach starts with conventional unmixing to generate fraction images. Constrained optimization techniques spatially locate the endmembers to high resolution. Synthetic image generation (SIG) tools are used to generate test images. SIG controls all the image parameters, making it easier to analyze algorithm performance. The results show spectral mixing material maps can be successfully sharpened, increasing the effective resolution of the hyperspectral images. Accurate fusion algorithms integrate spectral and spatial information into a single image, presenting the most information to an analyst. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB This article describes a multispectral digital video imaging system that produces imagery similar to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Bands 5, 4, 3. The system is comprised of two charge coupled device (CCD) analog video cameras, one tube analog; video camera, and a computer equipped with an image digitizing board. The two CCD came ms are sensitive to visible/near-infrared wavelengths and are equipped with visible red (0.625-0.635 mu m) and NIR (0.845-0.857 mu m) narrowband filters, respectively. The third camera is sensitive to visible/NIR/middle-infrared wavelengths (MIR) (0.40-2.20 mu m) and was equipped with an MIR (1.631-1.676 mu m) narrowband filter. The computer is a Bi-Link Pentium 90 MHz system that has an RGB image grabbing board with 640x480 pixel resolution. The MIR, NIR, and red image signals from the cameras are subjected to RGB inputs of the computer digitizing board, thus giving a false color composite digital image similar in color rendition to TM 5, 4, 3 satellite imagery. The computer hard disk can store 1000 false color composite images. Image results showed this system to have potential for a variety of remote sensing applications including detection of plant species and distinguishing among vegetation cover types.

AB Airborne laser altimetry is a remote sensing technique that can provide high resolution data on the roughness of the landscape both for estimating water balance components and for distinguishing between landscapes. Models of the scale-dependent roughness are needed to find scales most appropriate for these purposes. Our objectives were to apply fractal scaling to high-resolution profiling laser altimetry data and to determine fractal parameters for differentiating land cover. Data were collected at the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico over grass-dominated and shrub-dominated sites along four transects at each site. Scale-dependent root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and data power spectrums were computed from 100,000 data points (similar to 2 km) from each transect. A linearity measure and piecewise linear approximation were applied to find intervals of the fractal scaling. The RMS roughness data had two intervals of self-affine fractal scaling on grass transects and four such intervals on shrub transects. Reduction in the number of data points did not lead to a decrease in roughness but caused a smoothing dependency of fractal dimension on scale. Ten- and hundred-meter scales were appropriate for distinguishing between grass and shrub transects on the basis of fractal dimensions. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

ID SOIL; REFLECTANCE
AB Crop residues, the portion of the crop left in the field after harvest, can be an important management factor in controlling soil erosion. Current methods for quantifying crop residue cover use tedious manual sampling methods or visual comparisons with photographs. There is a need for new methods to quantify residue cover that are rapid, accurate, and objective. Scenes with known amounts of crop residue were illuminated in the lab with long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation and fluorescence images were measured and recorded with a video camera equipped with a mico-channel-plate image intensifier and fitted with a 453-488 nm bandpass filter. Six agricultural soils were used as backgrounds for the weathered soybean residue. Residue cover was determined from the proportion of the pixels in the image with fluorescence values greater than a threshold. Soil pixels gave the lowest fluorescence or brightness responses in the images and the residues the highest, so that brightness values of the scene spanned nearly the full range of the 8-bit video data. The images were classified in brightness categories that related to within 2% (absolute units) of measured residue cover regardless of the soil type or moisture condition (dry vs. wet). Therefore, fluorescence images can be used to provide percent residue cover in the lab, but portable equipment and procedures for use in the field still need to be developed.

AB An examination of AVHRR images obtained from the current triplet of nearly simultaneous NOAA polar orbiting satellites (namely, NOAA-9, -10, -12) revealed significant variances in the infrared radiation of opaque clouds observed from a satellite at different angles. To account for the effect of cloud temperature changes with depth, causing the essential part of these angular differences, the current cloud radiative model was revised following the principles of radiative transfer. Based on this model a dual-path method exploiting these differences to derive the cloud-top temperature and either the optical depth (of semitransparent clouds) or the ratio of opaque lapse rate to volume absorption coefficient (of opaque clouds) was proposed The derived cloud-top temperature and optical depth of semitransparent cirrus clouds were verified by the analysis of cloud shadows and albedos using visible technique. Comparison of the results obtained to the coincident retrieval by the split-window method demonstrates the advantages of the dual-path method. Also discussed are promising combinations of the proposed method with multichannel infrared and microwave methods. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

TI Cloud-top height determination using ATSR data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID TRACK SCANNING RADIOMETER; STEREOSCOPY
AB A method for computing cloud-top heights using multi-angle satellite data has been developed. By exploiting the dual-angle capability of the ERS-1 Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), cloud-top heights can be determined to a nominal accuracy of +/- 1 km. The method uses a spatial correlation function to determine the ''best-fit'' between the nadir and forward images of any channel. The resulting horizontal shifts are then converted to cloud-top heights using a simple, but accurate, approximation to the ATSR view geometry. The technique is presented, and some examples of cloud top height determination are given. The possibility of determining cloud top winds using this technique is explored.

AB The DART (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer) model simulates radiative transfer in heterogeneous 3-D scenes that may comprise different landscape features; i.e., leaves, grass, trunks, water, soil. The scene is divided into a rectangular cell matrix, i.e., building block for simulating lar er scenes. Cells are parallelipipedic. Their optical properties are represented by individual scattering phase functions that are directly input into the model or are computed with optical and structural characteristics of elements within the cell. Radiation scattering and propagation are simulated with the exact kernel and discrete ordinate approaches; any set of discrete direction can be selected. In addition to topography and hot spot, leaf specular and first-order polarization mechanisms are modeled. Two major iterative steps are distinguished: 1) Cell illumination with direct sun radiation: Within cell multiple scattering is accurately simulated. 2) Interception and scattering of previously scattered radiation: Atmospheric radiation, possibly anisotropic, is input at this stage. Multiple scattering is stored as spherical harmonics expansions, for reducing computer memory constraints. The model iterates on step 2, for all cells, and stops with the energetic equilibrium. Two simple accelerating techniques can be used: 1) Gauss Seidel method, i.e., simulation of scattering with radiation already scattered at the iteration stage, and (2) decrease of the spherical harmonics expansion order with the iteration order. Moreover, convergence towards the energetic equilibrium is accelerated with an exponential fitting technique. This model predicts the bidirectional reflectance distribution function. of 3-D canopies. Radiation components associated with leaf volume and surface mechanisms are distinguished. It gives also the radiation regime within canopies, for further determination of 3-D photosynthesis rates and primary production. Accurate modeling of multiple scattering within cells, combined with the fact that cells can have different x,y,z dimensions, is well adapted to remote sensing based studies, i.e., scenes with large dimensions. The model was successfully tested with homogeneous covers. Preliminary comparisons of simulated reflectance images with remotely acquired spectral images of a 3-D heterogeneous forest cover stressed the usefulness of the DART model for conducting studies with remotely acquired information.

ID VEGETATION INDEXES; NOAA AVHRR; RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; SOIL; UPDATE
AB Vegetation studies using NOAA-AVHRR data hove tended to focus on the use of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This unitless index is computed using near-infrared and red reflectances, and thus has both an accuracy and precision. This article reports on a formal statistical framework for assessing the precision. of the NDVI derived from NOAA-AVHRR observations. The framework is based on the ''best possible'' precision concept, which assumes that signal quantization is the only source of observational error. While the radiance resolution of a spectral observation is essentially fixed by the instrument characteristics, the reflectance resolution is the radiance resolution divided by the cosine of the solar zenith angle. Using typical solar zenith angles for AVHRR image acquisitions over Australia, +/- 0.01 NDVI units is typically with ''best possible'' precision attainable in the NDVI, although this degrades significantly over dark targets, and at large solar zenith angles. Transforming the computed NDVI into a single byte for disk storage results in little or no boss of precision. The framework developed in this article can be adapted to estimate the ''best possible'' precision of other vegetation indices derived using data from other remote sensing satellites.

TI EXTENSION OF OFF-NADIR VIEW ANGLES FOR DIRECTIONAL SENSOR SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID REFLECTANCE FACTOR DISTRIBUTIONS; RADIOMETER
AB A knowledge-based system called VEG mns expanded to infer nadir or any off-nadir reflectance(s) of a vegetation target given any combination of other directional reflectance(s) of the target. VEG determines the best techniques to use in an array of techniques, applies the techniques to the target data, and provides a rigorous estimate of the accuracy of the inference(s). The knowledge-based system, VEG, facilitates the use of diverse knowledge bases to be incorporated into the inference techniques. In this study, VEG used additional information to make more accurate view-angle extension techniques than the traditional techniques that only use spectral data from the unknown target. VEG used spectral data and a normalized difference technique to infer the percentage of ground cover of the unknown target. This estimate of percentage of ground cover of the unknown target along with information on the sun angle were then used to search a historical data base for targets that match the unknown target in these characteristics. This data captured the general shape of the reflectance distribution of the unknown target. This historical information was used to estimate the coefficients of the techniques for the conditions at hand and to test the accuracy of the techniques. The tests used in this study were difficult ones. For example, techniques were tested that make long angular extensions using one, two, or four input view angles to predict an unknown nadir value. Furthermore, a wide variety of unknown targets were tested. The errors (+/- proportional rms) obtained were on the order of 0.15. In addition techniques were tested that use seven or nine multiple view angles to predict the entire hemispherical reflectance distribution of an unknown target. The accuracy of these tests was relatively good considering the relatively dynamic and noisy nature of directional reflectance distributions. The accuracy of the techniques in this study depends on the smoothness of the historical reflectance distributions and the amount of historical data available that closely matches the unknown target.

AB The effects of vegetation density on the surface temperatures in the urban and suburban areas of Tokyo Metropolis on clear winter days are examined, based on daytime and nighttime images obtained from the Landsat TM, In the urban areas, the effect of vegetation on the surface temperature is relatively small in the daytime. In the less vegetated places of the suburbs, higher surface temperatures are observed in the daytime. In the more vegetated places of the urban areas, lower surface temperatures are observed in the nighttime. The degree of vegetation effect on surface temperature depends on the difference between the percentage of buildings area and that of forests area. In the areas where the buildings area is dominant compared with the forests area, the increase in vegetation, induced by the afforestation or green planting, has a little influence on the daytime surface temperature and lowers the nighttime surface temperature, so that the diurnal range tends to increase. In the areas where the forests area is dominant compared with the buildings area, the increase in vegetation, induced by the afforestation or the green planting, lowers the daytime surface temperature and has a little influence on the nighttime surface temperature, so that the diurnal range tends to decrease.

AB One of the primary interests of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) program is to study the role of vegetation in biospheric processes. Currently, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is utilized to study and monitor' vegetation activity on an operational basis at global scales. Recently developed variants to the NDVI equation, based on improved knowledge of atmosphere, canopy background, and sensor-view geometry, are being considered for use with the EOS Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. A set of criteria is established to evaluate their performance with respect to the vegetation signal and atmospheric and soil sources of noise. These include the vegetation signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), % relative error, and vegetation equivalent noise (VEN), which form the basis for the evaluation and comparison of vegetation indices (VIs) across a wide range in vegetation covers. The NDVI variant equations outperformed the NDVI by minimizing atmospheric and/or soil background sources of contamination as well as increasing vegetation signal sensitivity. Preliminary estimates, based on the data sets tested here, indicate an overall level of uncertainty of +/- 0.4 LAI (similar to 15% cover) with the use of the soil adjusted and atmospherically resistant vegetation index (SARVI), compared with +/- 0.8 LAI (30% cover) for the NDVI. Eventually, the final evaluation and validation of VIs for MODIS will include a field campaign strategy, simulation studies, and a worldwide establishment of test sites that collectively cover a diverse range of biomes. Lastly, the retrieval of canopy biophysical information from these VIs are discussed.

   FROM TERRESTRIAL DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Part I of this article reviewed an approach to modeling in scientific geographic information systems (GIS) by digitally synthesizing environmental parameters or phenomena as functions of other data. This interactive approach to global environmental modeling complements the approach of dynamic process models while enabling the scientist to rigorously assess the character of data used as boundary conditions in other models on widely available personal computers and workstations. Part II presents a case history using existing GISs to recreate the AVHRR-based vegetation index using data derived from in situ study on the Earth's surface. The example explores the relationship between the global vegetation index and ecosystems, soils, and precipitation, and defects in our present ability to describe these features. The degree of success of the model shows that GIS and the global change data base can be effective modeling tools, especially when functions are added to enhance the modeling capabilities of GIS. One function, INDEX, developed for this case history, is a simple utility that models a single data set as a function of another data set. A second function THEMCOIN, takes two input categorical data sets, such as vegetation and soils maps, and computes the mean and standard deviation of a third input data set Of numerical values, such as elevation, precipitation, or vegetation index computed from AVHRR data. THEMCOIN outputs a table of these empirical relationships. It also optionally models the numerical data set based on correlations with the categorical data sets. Both of these functions facilitate environmental modeling in GIS. The models begin to approximate vegetation index as a function of ecosystem, precipitation, and soils. Statistical output from the models extends our understanding of relationships between environmental parameters.

AB The bidirectional reflectance distribution characteristics of a spruce-hemlock forest were studied during field campaigns conducted in August-September of two different years using the three-channel PARABOLA radiometer system and a SE590 spectrometer mounted for sampling above a forest canopy. Canopy bidirectional reflectance data were acquired under clear, cloudless sky conditions over a large range of solar zenith angles. Pyranometer measurements of the total hemispherical upwelling and downwelling solar radiation above and below the forest canopy were simultaneously acquired. In addition, the PARABOLA instrument was deployed at different heights within the canopy, under overcast sky conditions, to measure the directional downward spectral radiation transmitted. The highly absorbing forest canopy, with a total plant area index of 3.9, reflected only approximately 2.5% of the red (0.662 mum) hemispherical irradiance. Reflectances for wavebands in the photosynthetically active radiation (0.4-0.7 mum), the near-infrared (NIR, 0.826 mum), and the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1.658 mum) were approximately 3%, 26%, and 15%, respectively. The bidirectional spectral reflectance factors in the solar principal plane were highly anisotropic, while those in the plane perpendicular to the solar principal plane were much closer to Lambertian. The forwardscatter was not much greater than the nadir reflectance, differing from the usual dense vegetative cover cases previously examined, especially for the NIR waveband. The hot spot maximum reflectance, occurring at the retrosolar view angle, was pronounced in all three wavebands. This prominent hot spot effect has not been observed for the NIR in other vegetation canopy types (e.g., grasslands, agricultural crops, and semiarid and desert scrub). View angle effects were more prominent than solar zenith angle effects, except at large solar zenith angles. Hemispherical spectral reflectance factors and albedo increased with increases in solar zenith angle. Substantial variation was observed in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for different view and solar zenith angles with a nominal value of 0.75.

AB Relationships between leaf area index (LAI) and midday soil heat flux/net radiation ratio (G/R(n)) and two more commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) were used to analytically derive formulas describing the relationship between G/R(n) and VI. Use of VI for estimating G/R(n) may be useful in operational remote sensing models that evaluate the spatial variation in the surface energy balance over large areas. While previous experimental data have shown that linear equations can. adequately describe the relationship between G/R(n) and VI, this analytical treatment indicated that nonlinear relationships are more appropriate. Data over bare soil and soybeans under a range of canopy cover conditions from a humid climate and data collected over bare soil, alfalfa, and cotton fields in. an arid climate were used to evaluate model formulations derived for LAI and G/R(n), LAI and VI, and VI and G/R(n). In general, equations describing LAI- R, and LAI-VI relationships agreed with the data and supported the analytical result of a nonlinear relationship between VI and G/R(n). With the simple ratio (NIR/Red) as the VI, the nonlinear relationship with G/R(n) was confirmed qualitatively.

AB The sensitivity of near-infrared / red ratio vegetation indices to soil reflectance and plant color result in ambiguous interpretation of plant condition and productivity. Measurements of the reflectance of crop canopies were made at high spectral resolution to investigate candidate vegetation indices, in the near- and middle-infrared (800-2500 nm), for their ability to unambiguously estimate foliage cover independently of the extraneous effects of variations in canopy color and soil background brightness. Reflectances were measured with an IRIS spectroradiometer over plots of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) sown on different dates and at different densities to produce a wide range in canopy cover. Vegetation color was varied by infecting selected plots with sugar beet yellows virus. Soil brightness was varied by placing trays of peat between the plant rows. Selected narrow-band near- and middle-infrared reflectances were tested for their relationship with canopy cover and their sensitivity to variations in canopy color and soil brightness. The relationship between canopy cover and traditional near-infrared / red ratio indices was found to be sensitive to both canopy color and soil brightness. Most infrared indices were insensitive to the effects of canopy color, but those showing the highest correlations with cover tended to be significantly influenced by soil brightness. The most promising NIR reflectances were those beyond the range (760-900 nm) of near-infrared reflectance detected by current space-borne systems, such as Landsat TM and SPOT HRV.

TI ESTIMATING CHANGES IN VEGETATION COVER OVER TIME IN ARID RANGELANDS
   USING LANDSAT MSS DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRAL AUSTRALIA; SOIL COLOR; IMAGE DATA; REFLECTANCE; INFORMATION;
   CATTLE; MODELS
AB Changes in vegetation cover over time in arid rangelands can be used to monitor land condition and to identify processes of land degradation. This article describes how a cover index can be derived from Landsat MSS data and how the index can be standardized to remove atmospheric effects and differences in sensor calibration between space-craft. Tests carried out on 1-m-diameter radiometer targets show that the best separation between soil, rock, or stone and vegetated surfaces occurs in the Band 4-Band 5 data space. This separation includes both dry and green vegetation whereas in the commonly used Band 5-Band 7 data space the separation is much less clear if the vegetation is not green. We have therefore developed a vegetation cover index in the Band 4-Band 5 data space. This index, known as PD54, has a similar form to the perpendicular vegetation index of Richardson and Weigand (1977). It is calculated by identifying a soil line or, more correctly, an upper soil band limit, and then determining the perpendicular distance of each pixel from that line. The perpendicular distance is scaled using distances calculated for points or pixels which have 100% cover. In the normal mix of rangeland vegetation at the pixel scale, these reference pixels occupy a very limited area of the Band 4-Band 5 data space and can be treated as a point or as a line of limited length and with a slope similar to that of the soil line. PD54 performs better than several other indices when tested at the Landsat MSS pixel scale using aircraft-mounted radiometer data. It is also less subject to systematic errors when shifting from one vegetation type to another. The principal difficulty in using PD54 as a cover index arises because there is no single soil line. Instead, the position of that line varies with both Munsell soil hue and chroma. Attempts to standardize PD54 for Landsats 1, 2, 4, and 5 showed that the commonly used approach of converting data to exoatmospheric reflectance based on published radiometer gains and offsets does not work. Furthermore, the dark pixel subtraction method of haze correction does not remove all atmospheric effects. It is, however, possible to remove the effects of differences between the different Landsat MSSs and inadequate haze correction by identifying the extremes of the Band 4-Band 5 data space on a particular scene and using them to scale PD54. Once this is done, PD54 gives substantially better estimates of cover from MSS data than Band 5 values which have supposedly been radiometrically standardised.

AB During the intermonsoon period in May, pigment concentrations in the Arabian Sea are uniformly low, winds are light, and the atmosphere is relatively clear. During May 1986, a hydrographic survey of the central Arabian Sea was conducted, and stations were coordinated with Nimbus-7/Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) overpasses. Because the calibration of the CZCS degraded severely during its lifetime (October 1978 to June 1986), pigment concentrations from 35 samples at four sites in the Arabian Sea are used to refine the calibration of the CZCS using a ''vicarious'' calibration technique. This calibration provides a final estimate of the sensor's sensitivity loss for sensor Gain 2. The results show that the sensitivity losses during May 1986 were roughly 35%, 16%, and 9% at 433 nm, 520 nm, and 550 nm, respectively. Additional comparisons were made with the calibration used in the NASA CZCS global processing for May 1986. Assuming the same calibration correction at 670 nm as was used in the global processing, the global processing calibrations for 520 nm and 550 nm were found to be correct, but the calibration correction at 443 nm was found to overestimate the total radiance. Profiles of pigment concentration, temperature, salinity, and light attenuation are also used to describe the bio-optical characteristics of the Arabian Sea during the intermonsoon period as they pertain to the calibration.

ID CANOPY CHEMISTRY; FOREST CANOPY; SPECTROMETRY
AB In an effort to further develop the methods needed to remotely sense the biochemical content of plant canopies, we report the results of an experiment to relate the concentrations of chlorophyll, protein, starch, sugar, amaranthin, and water in fresh whole leaves to their reflectance at wavelengths throughout the visible and near infrared.  This is an analysis of laboratory data from a previously reported experiment (Curran et al., 1991) in which 163 freshly excised leaves of the plant Amaranthus tricolor were measured for reflectance and biochemical content.  Stepwise regression was used to generate an equation for the estimation of chemical concentration from derivative reflectance in selected wavelengths.  The reduction of instrument noise through Fourier filtering and a sample control procedure to minimize spectral overlap had little effect on the correlation between derivative reflectance in selected wavelengths and chemical concentration but did enable absorption features attributable to sugar and protein to be detected.  However, the minimization of spectral overlap did increase the number of wavelengths attributable to known absorption features that were selected by stepwise procedures.  Using only derivative reflectance in wavelengths that were attributable to absorption by the chemical of interest, the coefficients of determination (R2) between estimated and measured concentrations of chlorophyll, amaranthin, starch, and water were 0.82 or above, with root-mean square errors that were 12.5% of the median or less.

TI SUNGLINT AND ITS OBSERVATION IN AVHRR DATA

ID M SPECTRAL BAND; SEA
AB This paper describes a number of aspects of sunglint in AVHRR data.  The theory of Cox and Munk is used for the extraction of near-surface wind speeds from 5 AVHRR scenes of the western Mediterranean from 1982.  The results are compared with meteorological observations.  The strong correlation between calm areas observed from Band-1 data and areas of skin-layer heating in Band-4 data is described; the magnitude of the temperature difference associated with the skin effect was found to be about 1.8 degK.  It is illustrated with data from another 4 scenes that calculations of sea surface temperature from Band-4 or Band-5 data for an area of sunglint are subject to an error of up to 2 degK if the reflected solar radiation is neglected.

ID GREEN PLANTS; SCATTERING
AB In the Netherlands an operational field instrument for the measurement of laser induced fluorescence of vegetation (LEAF) is developed.  In addition, plant physiological and remote sensing research is done to support this new remote sensing instrument.  This paper presents a general introduction on the subject of laser-induced fluorescence, including the relation between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis, spectral characteristics, and previous research.  Also the LEAF system is briefly described.  Subsequently, the development of a leaf fluorescence model (KMF) and a canopy fluorescence model (FLSAIL) are reported.  With these simulation models a sensitivity study is carried out.  Fluorescence of 685 nm appears to be most suitable to obtain information on photosynthesis and stress, but is also influenced by canopy structure.  Separation of these two effects is studied.

TI SATELLITE REMOTE-SENSING OF SURFACE-ENERGY AND MASS BALANCE - RESULTS
   FROM FIFE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In FIFE a diverse, interdisciplinary group of scientists are cooperating to understand how the earth's land-surface vegetation and atmospheric boundary layer interact to affect weather and climate.  The focus of this research is the interception of solar and long-wave radiation by a vegetated surface, and the subsequent thermodynamic and biological control of sensible and latent heat release.  In addition, the science teams are investigating the use of satellite remote sensing to monitor the components of the surface energy balance at point, regional and global scales.  Field experiments were conducted in the summer of 1987 and again in the summer of 1989.  Analyses of the 1987 data are reasonably mature, whereas the 1989 data analyses are in the early stages.  In this paper we summarize the results of the analyses to date.  The analyses have shown that the hypotheses linking energy balance components to surface biology and remote sensing are reasonable at a point level, and that satellite remote sensing can potentially provide useful estimates of the surface energy budget.  GOES data have been used to estimate solar insolation at the earth's surface to an accuracy of about 21.6 W m-2 and about 8.2 W m-2 for photosynthetically active radiation.  The ratio of near-infrared to red reflectance has also shown to be linearly related to measured CO2 flux.  Radiometric temperatures estimated from remote sensing are highly correlated to the canopy aerodynamic temperatures; however, the remote sensing estimation of H to useful accuracies (+/- 100 W m-2) appears to be a more difficult problem than the accurate estimation of LE.  The investigation of atmospheric scattering and absorption effects on satellite remote sensing of surface radiance shows that the magnitude of atmospheric opacity variations within the FIFE site and with season can have a large effect on satellite measured values of surface radiances.  However, comparisons of atmospherically corrected TM radiances with surface measured radiances agreed to within about 2% in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths and to 6% in the mid-infrared.  Looking at the frequency of cloud-free (< 10%) acquisitions actually achieved during FIFE shows that for land-surface climatology, multiple polar orbiters may be required to achieve the minimum desired acquisition frequency:  once each 5 days.

AB Remote sensing based assessments of tree cover and extent provide insight into global and local land use planning. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the distribution of tree cover in drylands and in areas with non-forest land use. Here, we present a 10-m map of tree extent for 4.35 billion hectares in the tropics (-23.44 degrees to 23.44 degrees latitude) based on multitemporal composites of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analyzed with convolutional neural networks, from which we derive spatially aggregated tree cover data at a 70-m (0.49 ha) resolution. We identify 2719 million hectares of tropical land with & GE;10% tree cover, including 680 million hectares in tropical drylands. We find that 52% of tropical cropland and 46% of tropical urban areas had & GE;10% tree cover in 2020. Compared to previous datasets, we demonstrate improved ability to map tree extent in areas with high canopy cover heterogeneity and with open canopy cover, especially in drylands, urban areas, and on cropland. As such, this data is expected to enable improved monitoring of tree cover distributions at local scales.

Despite all the key findings in hydrology, the utility of GRACE-derived Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) and its time derivative Terrestrial Water Storage Flux (TWSF) have mainly been limited to large catchments due to their coarse spatial resolution. Here, we propose a method to downscale TWSF by incorporating available finer-resolution data. We determine the downscaled TWSF and its uncertainty within a proposed Bayesian framework by incorporating the fine-scale data of TWSF and Soil Moisture Change (SMC) from different available sources. For the Bayesian ingredients, we rely on GRACE data to obtain the prior and rely on copula models to obtain nonparametric likelihood functions based on the statistical relationship between GRACE TWSF with fine-scale TWSF data and SMC. We apply our method to the Amazon Basin and assess the performances of our products from various fine-scale input datasets of TWSFs and SMCs. Given the lack of ground truth for TWSF, we validate our results against space-based Surface Water Storage Change (SWSC) in the Amazon river system and also against the Vertical Crustal Displacements Rate (VCDR) observed by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Overall, the results show that the proposed method is able to estimate a downscaled TWSF, which is informed by GRACE and fine-scale data. Validation shows that our downscaled products are better anticorrelated with VCDR (-0.81) than fine-scale TWSF (-0.73) and show a mean relative RMSE of 26% with SWSC versus 70% for fine-scale TWSF. The proposed methodology can be extended to other coarse scale datasets, which are crucial for hydrological application at regional and local scales.

AB The potential of time series of Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for monitoring crops and their phenological stages has long been recognized. However, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is one of the crops whose interaction with microwave signal is still not fully understood. Here, we aim to analyze and interpret time series of S1 data for sunflower phenology monitoring. The SAR backscattering coefficients in VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) polarizations as well as their ratio (VH/VV) in both ascending and descending orbits were retrieved for three sites located in three different agro-ecological regions in Ukraine. We observed that sunflower backscattering response differs for the ascending and descending orbits for the VV polarization and VH/VV polarization ratio due to the directional behavior of the flower head. Our analysis did not find major change in VH polarization for the two orbits. We also compared the S1-based sunflower phenology with that of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2 (S2). Our analysis revealed a considerable correlation r2 > 0.4 between S1 and NDVI for VH and VV polarizations in both ascending and descending orbits; however, we observed lower correlation (r2 < 0.20) for the VH/VV polarization ratio in descending orbit (VH/VVdes). Based on the characteristics of sunflower phenology, we identified two sunflower phenological stages: beginning of flowering (BoF) and end of flowering (EoF). The difference between S1-based dates using VH/VVdes and reference dates was 4.1 and 4.4 days for the BoF and EoF stages, respectively; the use of VH/VVdes+asc yielded weaker results: 7.4 and 6.1 days. These results suggest that the VH/VVdes is a preferable parameter for identifying sunflower phenological stages such as BoF and EoF.

AB Detailed information on spatial patterns of tree species diversity (TSD) is essential for biodiversity assessment, forest disturbance monitoring, and the management and conservation of forest resources. TSD mapping ap-proaches based on the Spectral Variability Hypothesis (SVH) could provide a reliable alternative to image classification methods. However, such methods have not been tested in large-scale TSD mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. In this study, we developed a new workflow for large-scale TSD mapping in an approximately 4000 km2 temperate montane forest using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery-based heterogeneity metrics and topographic data. Through a systematic comparison of model performance in 24 prediction scenarios with different combinations of input variables, and a correlation analysis between six image heterogeneity metrics and two in-situ TSD indicators (species richness S and Shannon-Wiener diversity H '), we assessed the effects of vegetation phenology, image heterogeneity metrics, and sensor type on the accuracy of TSD pre-dictions. Our results show that (1) the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery produced higher ac-curacy of TSD predictions compared to the Sentinel-2 data alone, and that the further inclusion of topographic data yielded the highest accuracy (S: R2 = 0.562, RMSE = 1.502; H ': R2 = 0.628, RMSE = 0.231); (2) both Multi -Temporal and Spectral-Temporal-Metric data capture phenology-related information of tree species and signif-icantly improved the accuracy of TSD predictions; (3) texture metrics outperformed other image heterogeneity metrics (i.e., Coefficient of Variation, Rao's Q, Convex Hull Volume, Spectral Angle Mapper, and the Convex Hull Area), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived image heterogeneity metrics were most effective in predicting TSD; and (4) the spatial distribution of TSD showed a clear decrease trend along the altitudinal gradient (r = -0.61 for S and -0.45 for H ') and varied significantly among forest types. Our results suggest a good potential of the SVH-based approaches combined with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data for large-scale TSD mapping in temperate montane forests. The TSD maps generated in our study will be valuable for forest biodiversity assessments and for developing management and conservation measures.

AB Spatiotemporal patterns of earth surface deformation are influenced by a combination of the geologic, topo-graphic, seismic, anthropogenic, meteorological and climatic conditions specific to any landscape of interest. These have been mostly modelled through machine learning tools. However, these influences are yet to be explored and exploited to train interpretable data-driven models and then make predictions on the deformation one may expect in space or time. This work explored this aspect by proposing the first multivariate model dedicated to InSAR-derived deformation data. The results we obtain are promising for we suitably retrieved the signal of environmental predictors, from which we then estimated the mean line of sight velocities for a number of hillslopes affected by seismic shaking. The importance of such models resides in its potential for opening an entirely new research line for slope instability modelling.

AB We use radiances collected from space by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) when looking down at ocean surfaces during the day to remotely determine the probability distribution of wave slopes. This is achieved by using about 300 channels between 3.6 and 4.0 mu m and a physically-based approach which properly takes the contribution of the reflected solar radiation into account. Based on about 150 millions observations, the same number of wave-slope probabilities are retrieved for wind speeds (at 10 m) up to 15 m/s. We revisit and discuss the methodology proposed by Cox and Munk (CM) to derive their celebrated wave-slope probability distribution function (pdf) from photographs of the sun glitter. We propose an original and robust approach for accurate retrievals of the 7 parameters appearing in the Gram-Charlier representation of the pdf. Our results for the mean square slopes (MSSs) are fully compatible with those of CM, and with the more recent results by Breon and Henriot, but our lower uncertainties enable to point out departures from the linear wind-speed dependencies and a slight overestimation of the upwind MSS described by the linear fit of CM at moderate wind speed. Our skewness and kurtosis coefficients show clear influences of the wind speed, with a steady decrease of the former and the alongwind kurtosis coefficient being maximal at moderate wind speeds, features that CM could not point out due to the limitations of their measurements. We revisit the renormalization procedure employed by CM to obtain the complete variances from truncated pdfs and show that it imposes stringent conditions on the kurtosis coefficients that allow to determine them accurately, with wind-dependent values specific to the local sea state. We also provide measurements of the shifted position of the most probable slope as well as a demonstration of a qualitative change of regime in the updown wind asymmetry of the wave-slope probability when the wind speed increases.

AB Polarimetric Global Navigation Satellite System - Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has proven to be sensitive to different land parameters, such as vegetation or soil moisture. In this manuscript, the correlation of the Stokes parameters of the GNSS reflections collected by the Soil Moisture Active Passive - Reflectometry (SMAP-R) with SMAP soil moisture (SM), SMAP vegetation optical depth (VOD), and the Global Forest Canopy Height (CH) are analyzed. SMAP-R is the first hybrid compact polarimetric reflectometer in space, and it provides a valuable dataset useful to design future GNSS-R mission that target polarimetric retrievals. The SMAP-R total-intensity reflectivity is presented, estimated from the bistatic radar cross section assuming coherent reflection. The calibrated intensity and the normalized Stokes parameters of the received wave are compared for a 1-year period to the SMAP VOD, the SMAP SM, the Global Forest CH, and the standard deviation of the digital elevation model. To provide a first assessment of the performance of full-Polarimetric GNSS-R to estimate SM and VOD, a linear regression approach is implemented using the four Stokes parameters and the child Stokes parameters. The two approaches show a correlation coefficient of R = 0.73 and R = 0.55 to estimate SM and VOD, respectively, enabling the estimation of both variables using polarimetric GNSS-R data without the need for ancillary data. Finally, the differences between the polarimetric signature at different incidence angles and polarizations are discussed.

AB Satellite-based data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP) are being increasingly used for the estimation of vegetation gross primary product (GPP) at the global scale. Although SIF contains more physiological information than NIRvP, NIRvP can have higher data quality and spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, the two variables can be considered complementary for GPP monitoring. Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP.

AB Mini-EUSO (Multiwavelength Imaging New Instrument for the Extreme Universe Space Observatory) is a telescope observing the Earth from the International Space Station since 2019. The instrument employs a Fresnel-lens optical system and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with single photon counting sensitivity. Mini-EUSO also contains two ancillary cameras to complement measurements in the near infrared and visible ranges. The scientific objectives of the mission range from the search for Extensive Air Showers (EAS) generated by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) with energies above 10(21) eV, the search for nuclearites and Strange Quark Matter (SQM), up to the study of atmospheric phenomena such as Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), meteors and meteoroids. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the near UV range (predominantly between 290-430 nm) with a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km (full field of view equal to 44 degrees) and a maximum temporal resolution of 2.5 mu s, observing our planet through a nadir-facing UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module. The detector saves triggered transient phenomena with a sampling rate of 2.5 mu s and 320 mu s, as well as continuous acquisition at 40.96 ms scale. In this paper we discuss the detector response and the flat-fielding and calibration procedures. Using the 40.96 ms data, we present similar or equal to 6.3 km resolution night-time Earth maps in the UV band, and report on various emissions of anthropogenic and natural origin. We measure ionospheric airglow emissions of dark moonless nights over the sea and ground, studying the effect of clouds, moonlight, and artificial (towns, boats) lights. In addition to paving the way forward for the study of long-term variations of light of natural and artificial origin, we also estimate the observation live-time of future UHECR detectors.

AB South America has been an epicenter of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) for over five decades due to rapid agricultural expansion along forest frontiers, the establishment of plantations in savannas, and desertifi-cation in drylands. Most attention has focused on LCLUC in tropical forests, and so information regarding the magnitude, geography, and rate of LCLUC across sub-tropical and temperate ecosystems in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay (APU) is incomplete. To address this, we used Landsat to map changes in the fractional cover of bare ground, woody cover, and herbaceous vegetation at annual time steps from 1999 to 2019 over APU. Using field observations and Landsat imagery, we created a spectral library representative of these three cover types. We trained a machine learning model to map annual fractional cover at 30 m spatial resolution, and used a Bayesian change point algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal trajectories of LCLUC. Our results reveal that 11.6% of the study domain experienced changes in land cover composition over APU between 1999 and 2019. The most substantial changes were herbaceous cover gain (87,507 symbolscript 2730 km2), woody cover loss (101,528 symbolscript 2843 km2), and bare ground gain (31,354 symbolscript 934 km2). Herbaceous cover in Paraguay increased by 51%, mostly because of deforestation for cattle ranching in the Dry Chaco and commodity crop agriculture in the Atlantic Forest. Uruguay showed a 62% increase in woody cover arising from the emergence and growth of pine and eucalyptus plantations. Argentina, the largest and most heterogeneous of the three countries, experienced a 38% increase in bare ground in the Patagonian Steppe due to climate and anthropogenic drivers, including reduced precipitation. Quantification of these abrupt and gradual LCLUC processes can be used to improve models of the carbon and energy budgets in southern South America, especially in arid and semi-arid ecoregions because they are increasingly understood to be important drivers of the interannual variability of the global carbon cycle.

AB The vast Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) south of the Himalaya are subject to dense fog every year during winter months (December-January), severely disrupting rail, air and public transport of millions of people living in northern India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Air pollution combined with high moisture availability in the shallow boundary layer, are important factors affecting the persistence and widespread nature of fog over the IGP. Despite the environmental significance and impacts on the public at-large, an in depth understanding of the long-term spatial-temporal distribution of the south Asian fog, is presently not available in the literature. We utilize infrared remote sensing techniques to develop a high-resolution (asymptotic to 1 km x 1 km) fog/low-stratus detection climatology over the past two decades (2002-2020), using Aqua/MODIS satellite observations. A dynamic brightness temperature difference threshold (involving 3.96 mu m and 11.03 mu m bands) for nighttime fog/low-stratus detection is constructed based on systematic radiative transfer simulations involving cloud effective radius, cloud top height, liquid water path and satellite viewing geometry. Our satellite-based fog/low-stratus detection is consistent with theoretical simulations of fog characterization and is also found to be well-correlated with near-surface visibility observations of dense fog (r = 0.89, p-value << 0.01). We also provide satellite -derived nighttime estimates of fog/low-cloud effective radius that are comparable to the operational daytime MODIS cloud data product and limited in situ observations. In terms of fog/low-stratus frequency, the IGP is relatively uniformly covered by widespread fog/low-stratus occurrences with the largest frequency found in the low-lying Terai region, bordering India and Nepal, which is also consistently observed in our daytime fog/low-stratus detection results over the last two decades. Additionally, the interannual variations in fog/low-stratus occurrences track closely with that of relative humidity in the IGP, which is associated with shallow boundary layer conditions during winter-time favoring the formation and persistence of fog. Overall, these long-term satellite-derived results present new high-resolution data and insights into the dense and often intense winter fog occurrences which routinely engulf the entire stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plains and cause significant degradation to ground visibility in one of the world's most densely populated regions.

AB Despite the small size and ubiquitous presence, fine-mode aerosols play a vital role in climate change and human health, especially in highly populated regions. Hitherto, some studies have been carried out to retrieve fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties from multi-wavelength lidar measurements. However, there has been a dearth of lidar-based methods with quality retrieval and high time efficiency to adequately quantify the impacts of fine-mode aerosols on Earth's energy budget. The reasons for the gap involve the limitations in current approaches and the nature of the under-determined problem with insufficient information of three backscattering coefficients (beta) and two extinction coefficients (alpha), typically known as the 3 beta + 2 alpha configuration. Furthermore, the latest lidars, especially for spaceborne and airborne applications, are inherently difficult to perform routine diurnal 3 beta + 2 alpha observations with high resolution and require high processing speed for massive data. To overcome these conundrums, we developed a novel unsupervised machine learning method-multivariate Full-permutAtion based Stochastic foresT method (dubbed the FAST method)-to improve the retrieval of fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties. To the best of knowledge, this work is the first time that machine learning algorithms are employed in attempts to retrieve the aerosol microphysical properties with stand-alone multi-wavelength lidar data. The major merits of the FAST method include 1) high accuracy of fine-mode aerosol products with the typical 3 beta + 2 alpha configuration, 2) acceptable performances for fewer input optical channels, and 3) high processing speed for large volume data. Comprehensive simulations have been conducted to investigate the error characteristic of the FAST method under different conditions. We also applied the FAST method to the airborne lidar data acquired during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. The retrievals of the FAST method provide high resolution time-height distributions of fine-mode aerosol microphysical properties at 20-s temporal resolution and 45-m vertical resolution. In situ measurements are compared with multi-wavelength lidar retrievals showing good agreements. We achieved 0.010, 0.014 and 0.016 in terms of mean absolute difference for retrieved 532-nm single-scattering albedo with 3 beta + 2 alpha, 3 beta + 1 alpha, and 2 beta + 1 alpha configurations, respectively. The proposed method is expected to represent an important step toward improving microphysical retrievals from multi-wavelength lidar data, especially for airborne and spaceborne lidar missions.

AB This paper discusses the differences, due to different measuring mechanisms, of satellite-derived and ground measured surface solar irradiance (SSI) direct and diffuse components, and the impacts of the differences when validating satellite-derived data using ground measurements, using SSI products derived from the Advanced Himawari Imager. The issue of satellite-ground mismatch, though previously recognized, has not been given sufficient attention in the relevant scientific literature due to: (i) satellite SSI have mostly focused on relatively longer-term data, such as hourly, daily and longer; and/or (ii) most studies assessed only global (or total) irradiance. Also, studies addressing this satellite-ground mismatch issue often require a dense ground network to characterize the spatial representativeness of ground measurements, which likely limited performing such studies. With shorter-term satellite SSI data, such as 10-min or less, and the direct and diffuse components becoming increasingly available, further investigation of this satellite-ground mismatch issue is warranted. Our analysis, using direct and diffuse component SSI observations from satellite and sparse ground sites showed that a large part of apparent validation errors may have been due to the satellite-ground mismatch, often exceeding 50% in the case of 10-min direct normal irradiance. Greater appreciation and understanding of this issue should lead to more objective assessment of the real quality of satellite SSI products. Our study also showed that several factors, such as spatial averaging, temporal averaging, solar zenith angle and view zenith angle, all have often substantial impacts on the validation outcomes, over 100 W/m(2) in some cases, highlighting the necessity for the ground-and satellite-based solar radiation communities to co-develop protocols for satellite SSI data validation.

AB Algal blooms around the world are increasing in frequency and severity, often with the possibility of adverse effects on human and ecosystem health. The health and economic impacts associated with harmful algal blooms, or HABs, provide compelling rationale for developing new methods for monitoring these events via remote sensing. Although concentrations of chlorophyll -a and key pigments like phycocyanin are routinely estimated from satellite images and used to infer algal or cyanobacterial cell counts, current methods are unable to provide information on the taxonomic composition of a bloom. This study introduced a new approach capable of differentiating among genera based on their reflectance characteristics: Spectral Mixture Analysis for Surveil-lance of HABs, or SMASH. The foundation of SMASH is a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm that takes a library of cyanobacteria endmembers and a hyperspectral image as input and estimates the fractional abundance of each genus, plus water, on a per-pixel basis. Importantly, we assume that the water column consists of only pure water and cyanobacteria, implying that our linear spectral unmixing models do not account for other optically active constituents such as suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We used reflectance spectra for 12 genera measured under a microscope to populate an algal spectral library and applied the SMASH workflow to satellite images from four waterbodies across the United States. Normalized spectral separability scores indicated that the 12 genera were distinct from one another and the MESMA algorithm reproduced known input fractions for simulated mixtures that included all pairwise combinations of genera and water. We used Upper Klamath Lake as an example to illustrate data products generated via SMASH: maps of the normalized difference chlorophyll index and cyanobacterial index, a MESMA-based classification of algal genera, fraction images for each endmember, and a root mean square error (RMSE) image that summarizes uncertainty. For Upper Klamath Lake, these outputs highlighted a complex algal bloom featuring several genera, primarily Aphanizomenon, and intricate spatial patterns associated with gyres. The maximum RMSE constraint imposed on the MESMA algorithm provided a means of avoiding false positive detection of genera not present in a waterbody but must not be set so low as to leave much of an image un-classified in cases where genera included in the library are present. Comparison of endmember fractions with relative biovolumes calculated from field samples indicated that taxonomic information from SMASH was consistent with field observations. For example, the algorithm successfully identified Microcystis in Owasco Lake but avoided misclassifying Asterionella, a genus not yet included in our library, in Detroit Lake. This proof -of-concept investigation demonstrates the potential of SMASH to enhance our understanding of algal blooms, particularly with respect to their spatial and temporal dynamics.

AB Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of "big " and "open " data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.

AB In this paper, it is demonstrated that while satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals often have minimum biases, reanalysis data can capture more temporal variability of SM, especially for non-cropland areas - when validated against in situ measurements. Accordingly, this paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) that utilizes the merits of a suite of existing satellite and reanalysis products to produce a new SM product with minimum (maximum) bias (correlation) - using NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data and ERA5 reanalysis. The benchmark of the network is a bias-adjusted SM with maximum correlation with in situ data over each land cover type. The mean of the benchmark data is adjusted to the product that exhibits a minimum bias over each land-cover type. Consistent with the laws of L-band microwave propagation in soil and canopy, the input variables of DNN include polarized SMAP brightness temperatures, incidence angle, vegetation scattering albedo, surface roughness parameter, surface water fraction, effective soil temperatures, bulk density, clay fraction, and vegetation optical depth from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) climatology. The DNN is trained and validated using two years (04/2015-03/2017) of global data and deployed for assessment of its performance from 04/2017 to 03/2021. The testing results against in situ measurements demonstrate that the DNN outputs typically exhibit improved error quality metrics over most land-cover types and climate regimes and can properly capture SM temporal dynamics, beyond each SMAP product across regional to continental scales.

AB Clouds play a significant role in the climate system, which affects the radiation balance and modulates the global hydrological cycle. However, the existing cloud property products have poor spatiotemporal continuity with only daytime cloud property retrieval results, which makes it challenging for us to carry out researches related to clouds at night. In this study, the effect of parallax error between the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Himawari-8 data is corrected based on parallax correction algorithm by referring to cloud parameters extracted from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) cloud property product. Due to the different sensitivity of different channels to clouds, this study treats the CALIOP data with cloud optical depth greater than 0.2 as clouds, otherwise as clear sky. Cloud property retrieval model based on the XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed for the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite. The ML model can achieve unified cloud mask, cloud top temperature (CTT), and cloud top height (CTH) retrieval for both daytime and nighttime with high spatial (0.02) and temporal (10 min) resolutions using the AHI thermal data. The retrieval results are extensively evaluated over study regions (80E ~ 135E, 18N ~ 55N) by comparisons with cloud property products of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) AHI, MODIS, and CALIOP data. The ML algorithm has higher cloud detection accuracy with cloudy sky (clear sky) hit rate (CHR) and false alarm rate (FAR) of 90.79% (88.35%) and 5.74% (4.67%) compared with the JAXA AHI (CHR = 92.81% (60.64%) and FAR = 19.66% (3.61%)) and MODIS (CHR = 88.50% (72.32%) and FAR = 13.10% (6.06%)) cloud products, and the ML algorithm also performs well for thin clouds over bright surfaces. The CTH and CTT retrieved by the ML algorithm (RMSE = 1.83 km and 12.29 K) are in good agreement with the CALIOP cloud property product, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of CTH and CTT is reduced by 33.70% (18.67%) and 35.28% (16.45%) on average, respectively, compared with the JAXA AHI (MODIS) cloud product with RMSE of 2.76 km (2.25 km) and 18.99 K (14.71 K). In addition, the ML algorithm can obtain higher cloud property retrieval accuracy at night compared with the results during the day.

AB Maritime glaciers in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) featuring the largest maritime glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been experiencing dramatic mass loss and interannual variability over the past two decades, increasing risks of glacier avalanches and glacial lake outbursts. However, spatially explicit and high temporal-resolution glacier mass loss over the entire SETP has not been well quantified. We developed an approach to integrate satellite altimetry (ICESat, CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2) with DEM differencing and satellite gravity to resolve high spatiotemporally resolved glacier surface elevation change and mass balance across the SETP for the past two decades. We generated DEMs from ASTER L1A stereo-images to estimate the multi-year elevation change, which was used to correct for the altimetry-based counterpart. Subsequently, we processed three different satellite altimetry data and total water storage (TWS) products specifically. Finally, we obtained time series of glacier elevation change and mass balance through the integration of satellite altimetry-, satellite gravity-, and DEM-derived elevation changes during 2000-2020. Results show rapid and heterogeneous glacier depletion with a mean mass loss rate of-0.66 +/- 0.02 m water equivalent (w.e.)/yr during 2003-2020 and an accelerating trend over the past two decades. The strongest downwasting was observed in the Hengduan Mountains (-1.29 +/- 0.32 m w.e./yr). Contiguous glaciers distributed mostly in Bomi County have a slower rate of elevation changes but play a dominant role in the regional mass balance. Glacier terminus types have a significant impact on glacier melting. The mass loss rate of lake-terminating glaciers is 45% higher than that of land terminating glaciers, suggesting increasing risks of glacial lake outbursts caused by rapid glacier melting across the SETP. These spatially explicit and high-temporal-resolution features of glacier mass loss will be extremely valuable for calibrating and validating glaciological and hydrological models. Our approach also shows a promising application of CryoSat-2 to mountain glaciology and its potential of estimating glacier mass balances over similar regions globally.

AB In 2021, coastal communities in the Sea of Marmara were impacted by large sea snot events. Based on data collected by several satellite sensors, we analyze and present the spectral reflectance characteristics of sea snots in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Sea snots often form elongated image slicks in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) or false-colour RGB (FRGB) images. Most reflectance spectra of sea snots show largely featureless spectral shapes, with continuous reflectance increases from the blue to the red, which then become flat toward the near infrared wavelengths. Some reflectance spectra show a local trough around 670 nm, indicating presence of chlorophyll a pigment, and thereby live algae. A 20-year time series of satellite data also reveals large-scale sea snot events in the Sea of Marmara before 2021. These results suggest that it might be possible to develop algorithms to search and map sea snots at a global scale, as sea snot events also occur in other regions. The results also indicate that remote differentiation of sea snots and marine debris using multi-band sensors may be difficult because of the spectral similarity between them.

AB Sinkhole activity in Florida is a major hazard for people and property. Its increasing frequency is often related to an accelerated use of ground-water and land resources in the region. In this work, we use a combined approach of radar interferometry and spatial clustering analysis over three selected sites in West-Central Florida to identify localized deformation that may be caused by sinkhole activity. The region of West-Central Florida is a densely active sinkhole region, where sinkholes tend to be small and land cover is mixed resulting in variable interferometric coherence that complicates Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surveys. In this work, we present a combined methodology implementing InSAR and a Density-Based Spatial Clustering Analysis (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect unknown sinkhole activity and to alert to possible precursors of sinkhole collapse. The data used for the study consist of acquisitions from three TerraSAR-X frames covering time spans of similar to 1.7 and 2.5 years with spatial resolutions ranging from 25 cm up to 1 m. We applied the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) and confirmed the observed deformation signals by also processing the data using the SAR PROcessing tool (SARPROZ). Results show several areas of localized subsidence, from which the cluster with highest rates for each site was selected for detailed inspection. Locations of selected clusters were found in buildings with sizes ranging from 300 m(2) to nearly 2000 m(2), with subsidence trends ranging from -3 to -6 mm/yr. Results were compared with in-situ observations such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys, visual structural inspection and public county archive documents to help as ground truthing; subsiding locations were found to be related to sinkhole presence or development.

AB Soil moisture controls the land surface water and energy budget and plays a crucial role in land surface processes. Based on certain mathematical rules, data assimilation can merge satellite observations and land surface models, and produce spatiotemporally continuous profile soil moisture. The two mainstream assimilation algorithms (variational-based and sequential-based) both need model error and observation error estimates, which greatly impact the assimilation results. Moreover, the performance of land data assimilation relies heavily on the specification of model parameters. However, it is always challenging to specify these errors and model parameters. In this study, a dual-cycle assimilation algorithm was proposed for addressing the above issue. In the inner cycle, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is run with parameters of both model and observation operators and their errors, which are provided by the outer cycle. Both the analyzed state variable and the innovation are reserved at each analysis moment. In the outer cycle, the innovation time series kept by the inner cycle are fed into a likelihood function to adjust the values of parameters of both the model and observation operators and their errors through an optimization algorithm. A series of assimilation experiments were first performed based on the Lorenz-63 model. The results illustrate that the performance of the dual-cycle algorithm substantially surpasses those of both the classical parameter calibration and the standard EnKF. Subsequently, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures were assimilated into the simple biosphere model scheme version 2 (SiB2) with a radiative transfer model as the observation operator in two experimental areas, namely Naqu on the Tibetan Plateau and a Coordinate Enhanced Observing (CEOP) reference site in Mongolia. The results indicate that the dual-cycle assimilation algorithm can simultaneously estimate model parameters, observation operator parameters, model error, and observation error, thus improving surface soil moisture estimation in comparison with other assimilation algorithms. Since the dualcycle assimilation algorithm can estimate the observation errors, it provides the potential for assimilating multi-source remote sensing data to generate physically consistent land surface state and flux estimates.

AB Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create fullwaveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000 rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed from vegetation has been considered as a promising proxy of gross primary productivity (GPP) in several studies, and recent work has shown advantages of using the total emitted SIF (SIFtotal) to capture the variation of GPP. The non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the canopy level was often observed in many previous studies, but the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP has not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, based on a theoretical analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP at the leaf level and how it propagates to the canopy level with the consideration of sunlit and shaded leaf fractions in the canopy, we asserted that non-linear relationships between SIFtotal and GPP at the canopy level are general and physically sound. We derived SIFtotal from two different approaches using TROPOMI SIF data. One is based on the canopy escape ratio of SIF signals observed by satellite sensors (SIFobs), and the other is an angular normalization method. At the site level, we established linear and non-linear (exponential, hyperbolic, and polynomial) regressions between TROPOMI SIF and GPP data from 25 flux tower sites covering the eight biomes. The results indicate that non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP exists among eight major biomes, and expo-nential regression is the best regression method to capture the non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the site level. We developed a simple variable, SIFnon-linear, to capture the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP. R-2 values of the linear correlations between SIFnon-linear and GPP are equal or close to those of exponential corre-lations between SIFtotal and GPP. SIFnon-linear captures the non-linearity well, even though different biomes have different degrees of non-linearity. On the global scale, TROPOMI SIF was compared with GPP simulations of the BEPS model and the SMAP GPP product, showing that SIFnon-linear is a better proxy of GPP than SIFobs and SIFtotal. We find that the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP generally exists among eight major biomes regardless of the spatial or temporal scales. The non-linearity is driven by the seasonal variation of the absorbed photosyn-thetically active radiation (APAR). The degree of the non-linearity varies among different biomes, and it is controlled by three factors: the light saturation point of GPP, the variation of APAR during the growing season, and the ratio between the sunlit and shaded portion of the canopy. Temporal aggregation of SIFtotal reduces the non-linearity. Our results indicate that the simple variable SIFnon-linear can replace SIFobs or SIFtotal to improve global SIF-GPP related studies in the future.

AB The decline of the number of newly discovered mineral deposits and increase in demand for different minerals in recent years has led exploration geologists to look for more efficient and innovative methods for processing different data types at each stage of mineral exploration. As a primary step, various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and robust data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of some popular and recently established machine learning methods for processing different types of remote sensing data and investigates their applications for detecting various ore deposit types. We demonstrate the high capability of combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping different geological features that are critical for providing potential maps. Moreover, we find there is scope for advanced methods such as deep learning to process the new generation of remote sensing data that provide high spatial and spectral resolution for creating improved mineral prospectivity maps.

AB Pronounced climate warming has resulted in a significant reduction of snow cover extent, as well as poleward and upslope shifts of shrubs in Arctic and alpine ecosystems. However, it is difficult to establish links between changes in snow cover and shrub distribution changes due to a lack of in situ and long-term snow records in relation to abundance shifts of shrubs at their leading (i.e., cold) and trailing (i.e., warm) edges. We used remote sensing to extract long-term changes in both snow cover and shrub distributions in response to climate change in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China. First, we analyzed spatio-temporal changes in snow cover during the snowmelt period (April 1st to June 15th) over the past 54 years (1965-2019). Then, we analyzed distribution changes of the dominant evergreen alpine shrub, Rhododendron aureum, using 31 years (1988-2019) of Landsat NDVI archives. We applied a novel approach by analyzing NDVI data from autumn only, when R. aureum is green yet most of the surrounding plants are already brown. Finally, we tested the relationship between snowmelt date and the distribution of R. aureum. We found that the fraction cover of R. aureum experienced greater loss than gain in the last 30 years. R. aureum expanded at the leading edge, establishing in snow-rich habitats, yet retracted further at the trailing edge due to loss of snow habitats. We identified the preferred snowmelt regime (habitats with snowmelt date of 20 April or later) of this shrub species and found that further advances in snowmelt dates would lead to the upward range shift of R. aureum in a warming climate. Our results indicate that spring snow cover change affected distribution changes of R. aureum. Our study highlights that long-term changes in snow cover due to climate change have already had marked impacts on plant species distributions in alpine ecosystems.

AB Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1 x 106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very highresolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at largescale for 2001-2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158 ha, 2001-2019: 66,699 ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatiotemporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.

AB Retrieval of the phycocyanin concentration (PC), a characteristic pigment of, and proxy for, cyanobacteria biomass, from hyperspectral satellite remote sensing measurements is challenging due to uncertainties in the remote sensing reflectance (increment Rrs) resulting from atmospheric correction and instrument radiometric noise. Although several individual algorithms have been proven to capture local variations in cyanobacteria biomass in specific regions, their performance has not been assessed on hyperspectral images from satellite sensors. Our work leverages a machine-learning model, Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), trained on a large (N = 939) dataset of collocated in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla), PCs, and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) measurements to estimate PC from all relevant spectral bands. The performance of the developed model is demonstrated via PC maps produced from select images of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and Italian Space Agency's PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) using a matchup dataset. As input to the MDN, we incorporate a combination of widely used band ratios (BRs) and line heights (LHs) taken from existing multispectral algorithms, that have been proven for both Chla and PC esti-mation, as well as novel BRs and LHs to increase the overall cyanobacteria biomass estimation accuracy and reduce the sensitivity to increment Rrs. When trained on a random half of the dataset, the MDN achieves uncertainties of 44.3%, which is less than half of the uncertainties of all viable optimized multispectral PC algorithms. The MDN is notably better than multispectral algorithms at preventing overestimation on low (<10 mg m(-3)) PC. Visibly, HICO and PRISMA PC maps show the wider dynamic range that can be represented by the MDN. The available in situ and satellite-derived Rrs matchups and measured in situ PC demonstrate the robustness of the MDN for estimating low (<10 mg m(-3)) PC and the reduced impact of increment Rrs on medium-to-high in situ PC (>10 mg m(-3)). According to our extensive assessments, the developed model is anticipated to enable practical PC products from PRISMA and HICO, therefore the model is promising for planned hyperspectral missions, such as the Plankton Aerosol and Cloud Ecosystem (PACE). This advancement will enhance the complementary roles of hyperspectral radiometry from satellite and low-altitude platforms for quantifying and monitoring cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms at both large and local spatial scales.

AB The applications of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data are inevitably hampered by cloud-induced gaps and noise. Although numerous reconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed the issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy regions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial, temporal and periodical correlations. In this paper, an adaptive SpatioTemporal Tensor Completion method (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional spatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a highly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the spatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in order to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank tensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then implemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was tested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces large gaps and noise in the data. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the ST Tensor method is more effective than the five previous methods in addressing the different missing data problems, especially the temporally continuous gaps and spatio-temporally continuous gaps. It is also shown that the ST-Tensor method performs better than the other methods in tracking NDVI seasonal trajectories, and is therefore a superior option for generating high-quality long-term NDVI time series for cloud-prone regions.

AB Wave mode of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is designed for the global ocean wave observations. Despite the fact that the significant wave height inferred from SAR measurements has been validated against model output and in-situ data, SAR' s primary and unique capability for operational 2-dimensional spectral description of sea state remains to be fully evaluated. In this study, we extended the previous assessment approaches by introducing a new SAR image spectral parameter, the Mean rAnge Cross-Spectrum (MACS) that focuses on the isolated wave scales along the radar line-of-sight direction. MACS is an efficient variable in that it characterizes the local wave spectra properties without need of the non-linear wave inversion procedure. The assessment is based on the multiple-year data acquired by Envisat/ASAR wave mode, along with the collocated WaveWatch III (WW3) hindcast and the in-situ buoy-observed wave spectra, for which the SAR forward transformation is systematically performed to obtain the simulated image spectra. Inter-comparison between SAR-measured and WW3-simulated MACS demonstrates that the consistency is wavelength (or wavenumber) dependent. Three typical wavelengths, around 62 m for windsea, 168 m for intermediate waves and 342 m for swell, are selected to present the MACS comparison in detail. Comparable magnitude of SAR-measured and the simulated MACS is observed for the intermediate waves and swell, while larger simulation values are predicted for the windsea waves. Spatial distribution of MACS agrees well between these two data sets for all wavelengths with high correlation coefficients (>0.8) in most of the global ocean. One exception is in the extratropics where the quantitative difference is particularly notable. In the contrary, when comparing SAR-measured and buoys-simulated MACS, the agreement increases towards the shorter (<100 m) wavelengths. We also found that the large-scale atmospheric/oceanic features persistent on SAR images lead to the overestimate of SAR MACS at long wavelengths, which is expected to bias the wave inversion. The wave spectra retrieval performance shall advance as long as such impact is properly resolved.

AB Although the C-H chains of petroleum derivatives display unique absorption features in the short-wave infrared (SWIR), it is a challenge to identify plastics on terrestrial surfaces. The diverse reflectance spectra caused by chemically varying polymer types and their different kinds of brightness and transparencies, which are, moreover, influenced further by the respective surface backgrounds. This paper investigates the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and equipped with eight distinct and relatively narrow SWIR bands suitable for global monitoring of different types of plastic materials. To meet the objective, hyperspectral measurements and simulations were conducted in the laboratory and by aircraft campaigns, based on the JPL-ECOSTRESS, USGS, and inhouse hyperspectral libraries, all of which are convolved to the spectral response functions of the WV-3 system. Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA). The second and third clusters are diagnostic for aromatic hydrocarbons, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), respectively separated from polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyurethane (PU). The robustness of the classifier is examined on the basis of simulated spectra derived from our HySimCaR model, which has been developed inhouse. The model simulates radiation transfer by using virtual 3D scenarios and ray tracing, hence, enables the analysis of the influence of various factors, such as material brightness, transparency, and fractional coverage as well as different background materials. We validated our results by laboratory and simulated datasets and by tests using airborne data recorded at four distinct sites with different surface characteristics. The results of the classifier were further compared to results produced by another signature-based method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a commonly used technique, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Finally, we applied and successfully tested the classifier on WV-3 imagery of sites known for a high abundance of plastics in Almeria (Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Accra, (Ghana, West Africa). Both airborne and WV-3 data were atmospherically corrected and transferred to "at-surface reflectances". The results prove the combination of WV-3 data and the newly designed classifier to be an efficient and reliable approach to globally monitor and identify three clusters of plastic materials at various fractions on different backgrounds.

AB Identifying meaningful measures of ecological change over large areas is dependent on the quantification of robust relationships between ecological metrics and remote sensing products. Over the past several decades, ground observations of wildfire and prescribed fire severity have been acquired across hundreds of wildland fires in the United States, primarily utilizing the Composite Burn Index (CBI) plot protocol. These observations have been coupled to spaceborne passive spectral reflectance indices (e.g. Landsat-derived variations of the Normalized Burn Ratio [NBR]) to produce regression models describing their relationship. Here we develop regression models by vegetation type for multiple vegetation classification systems representing a range of spatial scales, and a decision tree framework for evaluating these regression models. Our overall goals were to determine which scale of ecological classifications provided the best estimate of burn severity from Landsat data and how to choose the best regression model. We aggregated a total of 6280 CBI plots for 234 wildland fires that burned between 1994 and 2017 and produced Landsat-derived NBR and differenced NBR (dNBR) values for each plot. We then calculated best fit linear or higher order regression equations between CBI and NBR/dNBR for each landcover classification system from smallest to largest scale: LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BPS), National Vegetation Classification macrogroup (NVC) landcover classifications, Omernick III, II, and I ecoregions, LANDFIRE Fire Regime Groups (FRG), and the entire conterminous United States (CONUS) dataset. The CONUS regression model goodness of fit was moderate (R2 = 0.55, P < 0.001) for dNBR and poor (R2 = 0.30, P < 0.001) for NBR. Within landcover classifications, CBI was better fit by dNBR than NBR. Finer scale regional regression models including BPS (dNBR R2 = 0.56 and 0.00-0.83 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.43 and 0.00-0.82 R2 range) and NVC (dNBR R2 = 0.55 and 0.15-0.78 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.41 and 0.00-0.79 R2 range) were on average the same or better than the CONUS models for dNBR and NBR, with the strongest fit models exhibiting R2 >= 0.70, whereas larger scale regional models R2 ranged from 0.28 to 0.5. However, variation in accuracy among landcover types indicate that dNBR and NBR regression models could be used to effectively estimate CBI for future fires in certain regions, while for other regions models may require additional field observations or alternative spectral transformations. Our decision tree schema can be used to help users determine which scale is likely to produce the most accurate results using our models. The CBI regression models developed here, paired with the decision tree, provide users with a simple method to estimate burn severity in units of CBI for any fire within CONUS with moderate to high levels of confidence and provide a template for further development of models with new data going forward.

AB Holm oak decline is a complex phenomenon mainly influenced by the presence of Phytophthora cinnamomi and water stress. Plant functional traits (PTs) are altered during the decline process - initially affecting the physiological condition of the plants with non-visual symptoms and subsequently the leaf pigment content and canopy structure - being its quantification critical for the development of scalable detection methods for effective management. This study examines the relationship between spectral-based PTs and oak decline incidence and severity. We evaluate the use of high-resolution hyperspectral and thermal imagery (< 1 m) together with a 3-D radiative transfer model (RTM) to assess a supervised classification model of holm oak decline. Field surveys comprising more than 1100 trees with varying disease incidence and severity were used to train and validate the model and predictions. Declining trees showed decreases of model-based PTs such as water, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin contents, as well as fluorescence and leaf area index, and increases in crown temperature and dry matter content, compared to healthy trees. Our classification model built using different PT indicators showed up to 82% accuracy for decline detection and successfully identified 34% of declining trees that were not detected by visual inspection and confirmed in a re-evaluation 2 years later. Among all variables analysed, canopy temperature was identified as the most important variable in the model, followed by chlorophyll fluorescence. This methodological approach identified spectral plant traits suitable for the detection of pre symptomatic trees and mapping of oak forest disease outbreaks up to 2 years in advance of identification via field surveys. Early detection can guide management activities such as tree culling and clearance to prevent the spread of dieback processes. Our study demonstrates the utility of 3-D RTM models to untangle the PT alterations produced by oak decline due to its heterogeneity. In particular, we show the combined use of RTM and machine learning classifiers to be an effective method for early detection of oak decline potentially applicable to many other forest diseases worldwide.

AB Increased focus on restoring forest structural variation and spatial pattern in dry conifer forests has led to greater emphasis on forest monitoring strategies that can be summarized across scales. To inform restoration objectives with data sources that can characterize individual trees, groups of trees, and the entire stand, different remote sensing strategies such as aerial and terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been explored. Unfortunately, high equipment and operational costs of aerial systems, along with limited spatial extent of terrestrial scanners, have restricted widespread adoption of these technologies for repeated forest monitoring. This study investigates applications of unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery for Structure from Motion derived modeling of individual tree and stand-level metrics. Specifically, we evaluate how flight parameters impact UAS extracted height and imputed DBH accuracies against field stem-mapped values. In total, 30 UAS image datasets collected from combinations of three altitudes, two flight patterns, and five camera orientations were assessed. Tree heights were extracted using a variable window function that searched UAS-derived canopy height models, while DBH was sampled from point cloud slices at 1.32-1.42 m using a least squares circle fitting algorithm. The sample trees were then filtered against National Forest Inventory data from the study region to ensure reasonable matching of extracted heights and diameters. The matched values were used to create a height to diameter relationship for predicting missing DBH values. Extracted and imputed tree values were compared against stem mapped values to determine tree commission and omission rates, the accuracy and precision of extracted tree height, DBH, as well as overstory and understory stand density. Finding that, 1) tree extraction accuracy and correctness was maximized (F-score = 0.77) for nadir crosshatch UAS flight designs; 2) extracted tree height R-2 with stem-mapped values was high (R-2 >= 0.98) for all UAS flight parameters, but the quality (mean error = 0.79 cm) and quantity (similar to 10% of all trees) of extracted DBH values was maximized for lower altitude, nadir crosshatch acquisitions; 3) the distribution of predicted DBH values most closely matched field observed values for off-nadir crosshatch flight designs; 4) using either off-nadir or crosshatch flight designs at lower altitudes maximized correlation (r > 0.70) and accuracy (basal area within 2 m(2) ha(-1)) of stand density estimates. This study demonstrates a novel UAS-based inventory strategy for estimating individual tree structural attributes (i.e., location, height, and DBH) in dry conifer forests, without the need for in situ field observations.

AB Timely and reliable acquisition of built-up areas (BAs) information in large regions is of great significance for the assessment of the influence of human activities in local, regional and even global environments and promotes the sustainable development of cities. In this study, a deep learning based framework is presented to automatically extract BAs from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data in China. In the framework, a U-Net structure based deep learning with convolutional neural network is implemented for semantic segmentation to extract BAs. To overcome the problem of network degradation when the neural network layers become deeper, residual blocks were introduced via identity shortcut connections to add to U-Net. About 30,000 samples containing different distribution types of BAs and corresponding labeled binary images, which are from 27 scenes of GF-3 SAR images covering different regions (for example plain, hilly and mountainous regions) in China, were obtained for model training. With the trained model, more than 1700 scenes of 10-m resolution GF-3 Fine Stripmap II (FSII) mode singlepolarized images covering the whole country of China were processed to obtain the BA map of China. On the one hand, quality evaluation based on the confusion matrix was performed to determine the accuracy of the results with the ground truth data, which were manually interpreted by experts. The experimental results show that among 34 provinces or regions, the overall accuracy ranges from 76.05% to 93.45%, and the F1-score ranges from 0.69 and 0.89. On the other hand, the results were also compared with other semantic segmentation methods, such as FCN, PSPNet and U-Net, and other global urban area products, such as the Global Urban Footprint (GUF), Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Vegetation phenology obtained from time series of remote sensing data is relevant for a range of ecological applications. The freely available Sentinel-2 imagery at a 10 m spatial resolution with a similar to 5-day repeat cycle provides an opportunity to map vegetation phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. To facilitate the production of a Europe-wide Copernicus Land Monitoring Sentinel-2 based phenology dataset, we design and evaluate a framework based on a comprehensive set of ground observations, including eddy covariance gross primary production (GPP), PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (GCC), and phenology phases from the Pan-European Phenological database (PEP725). We test three vegetation indices (VI) - the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and the plant phenology index (PPI) - regarding their capability to track the seasonal trajectories of GPP and GCC and their performance in reflecting spatial variabilities of the corresponding GPP and GCC phenometrics, i.e., start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). We find that for GPP phenology, PPI performs the best, in particular for evergreen coniferous forest areas where the seasonal variations in leaf area are small and snow is prevalent during wintertime. Results are inconclusive for GCC phenology, for which no index is consistently better than the others. When comparing to PEP725 phenology phases, PPI and EVI2 perform better than NDVI regarding the spatial correlation and consistency (i.e., lower standard deviation). We also link VI phenometrics at various amplitude thresholds to the PEP725 phenophases and find that PPI SOS at 25% and PPI EOS at 15% provide the best matches with the ground-observed phenological stages. Finally, we demonstrate that applying bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction to Sentinel-2 reflectance is a step that can be excluded for phenology mapping in Europe.

AB Many satellite missions rely on modeling approaches to acquire global or regional evapotranspiration (ET) products. However, a current challenge in ET modeling lies in dealing with sub-pixel heterogeneity, as models often assume homogeneous conditions at the pixel level. This is particularly an issue for heterogeneous landscapes, such as tree-grass ecosystems (TGE). In these areas, while appearing homogeneous at larger spatial scales pertaining to a single land cover type, the separation of the spectral signals of the main landscape features (e.g. trees and grasses) may not be achieved at the conventional satellite sensor resolution (e.g. 10-1000 m). This leads to important heterogeneity within the pixel grid that may not be accounted for in traditional modeling frameworks. This study examined the effect of pixel heterogeneity on ET simulations over a complex TGE in central Spain. High resolution hyperspectral imagery from five airborne campaigns forced the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model at 1.5-1000 m spatial resolutions. Along with this, the sharpened (20 m) and original (1000 m) Sentinels for Evapotranspiration (Sen-ET) products were evaluated over the study site for 2017. Results indicated that TSEB accurately simulated ET (RMSD: -60 W/m2) when the pixel scale was able to robustly discriminate between grass and tree pixels (<5 m). However, model uncertainty drastically increased at spatial resolution greater than 10 m (RMSD: -115 W/m2). Model performance remains relatively constant between 30 and 1000 m spatial resolutions, with within pixel heterogeneity being similar at all these scales. For mixed pixels (>= 30 m), forcing an effective landscape roughness into TSEB (RMSD: -80 W/m2) or applying a seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S; RMSD: -65 W/m2) improved the modeling performance. The Sen-ET products behaved similarly at both scales with RMSD of ET roughly 80 W/m2. The non-linear relationship between input parameters and flux output, along with the poor representation of aerodynamic surface roughness, were the main drivers for the increased uncertainties at coarser scales. These results suggest that care should be taken when using global ET products over TGE and similarly heterogeneous landscapes. The modeling procedure should inherently account for the presence of vastly different vegetation roughness elements within the pixel, to achieve reliable estimates of turbulent fluxes over a TGE.

AB Two retrieval algorithms developed as a part of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) project are used to assess the effects of withholding observations from selected frequency channels on the retrieved subskin Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from AQUA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and to evaluate a Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) like channel configuration.
   The first algorithm is a statistical regression-based retrieval algorithm, while the second is a physically based optimal estimation (OE) algorithm. A database with matching satellite and drifting buoy observations is used to test the performance of each channel configuration using both retrieval algorithms to identify the most optimal channel selection for accurate SST retrievals. The evaluation against in situ observations allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the two retrieval algorithms, and demonstrates the importance of using in situ observations to evaluate existing theoretical retrieval uncertainty studies. Overall, the performance increases as expected when more channels are included in the retrieval. In particular, more channels allow a better performance for the range of different observing conditions (e.g. cold waters). The two retrieval algorithms agree that for a three-channel configuration, the 6, 10, 18 GHz (V and H polarization) is better than the 6, 10, 23 GHz configuration (V and H polarization). This is demonstrated for different geographical regions and throughout all seasons. Of the different combinations tested here, it is evident that withholding observations from the 23 and 36 GHz channels from the retrieval has the least impact on the SST performance. Overall, this analysis shows that the CIMR like channel configuration performs very well when compared to an AMSR-E like constellation using both retrieval algorithms.

AB Spectroscopy can be used to investigate ecosystem functioning and phylogenetic relationships, since it can provide information about the optical properties of a plant - a critical functional trait with regard to light usage. The link between phylogenetic relationships and foliar reflectance spectra of Neotropical species has rarely been considered and no previous studies have explored this in relation to forest regeneration following natural gap formation. We investigated phylogenetic signatures, i.e. evolutionary conservation, of foliar spectra in gap-regenerating woody species in conserved Neotropical forests. We collected foliar spectra of 53 regenerating woody species in the forest gaps at two sites of Atlantic Seasonal Semi-deciduous forest, and quantified the phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths using Blomberg's K, Pagel's lambda (lambda) and LIPA (Local indicator of phylogenetic association) statistics. Analysis of foliar reflectance spectra showed that the largest portion of phylogenetic signature from both K and lambda occurred within the first part of the shortwave infrared region (SWIR-1: 1551-1849 nm), followed by the near infrared (NIR: 701-1349 nm), and the lowest portion within the visible region (VIS: 400-700 nm). Most of the significant phylogenetic signal found for wavelengths of all spectral regions suggested convergent conservation, i.e. homoplasy. The largest portion of positive LIPA (i.e. phylogenetic similarity) was found for wavelengths within the second part of the SWIR (SWIR-2: 2051-2450 nm), while most of the negative LIPA (i.e. phylogenetic distinctiveness) occurred within the VIS. We conclude that there is a tendency towards evolutionary convergence in the phylogenetic signature of foliar spectra in certain parts of the spectrum. The extent of phylogenetic signal found in the SWIR allows us to conclude that this region carries the most potential for future investigations of phylogenetic influence on spectral community dynamics within Neotmpical forests.

AB Water clarity is a comprehensive indicator of the water environment status. Studies have shown that in recent years the clarity of inland and ocean water has decreased in many parts of the world owing to the influence of climate change and human activities. However, changes in inland water clarity exclusively resulting from climate change are largely ignored because most inland water is being utilized by human beings for applications such as waterworks or aquaculture. Therefore, understanding the trends and reasons of inland water clarity under natural conditions is important to recognize the inland water environment shifts under the global changes. Because of the harsh environment, the lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are less disturbed by human activities and are ideal objects for studying water clarity variations attributed to climatic changes. Here, we describe water clarity changes as measured using the Secchi Depth (SD) in 152 big lakes with an area greater than 50 km(2) based on in-situ investigations and the retrieval results from a high accuracy retrieval model (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). Most of the lakes had an SD of 3-10 m, although there was marked spatial variation and a significant positive correlation with lake area (P < 0.01). The mean SD of all 152 lakes significantly increased at a rate of 0.033 m/year (95% CI, 0.021-0.045; P < 0.01) between 2000 and 2019. Variations in lake SD were linked with temporal changes in precipitation, and related to spatial changes of water optical components including suspended matter (0.13 < R-2 < 0.40, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), fDOM (R-2 = 0.24, P < 0.01) and chlorophyll-a concentration (R-2 = 0.12, P < 0.01). The reconstructed lake water clarity in our study will improve the understanding of inland water clarity changes and provide basic data to study the heat exchanges between lake water and atmosphere.

AB The frequent acquisitions of fine spatial resolution imagery (10 m) offered by recent multispectral satellite missions, including Sentinel-2, can resolve single agricultural fields and thus provide crop-specific phenology metrics, a crucial information for crop monitoring. However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the "Copernicus module" of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level.

AB A land data assimilation system is developed to merge satellite soil moisture retrievals into the Joint U.K. Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (LSM) using the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). The system assimilates microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) after bias correction based on cumulative distribution function fitting. The soil moisture assimilation estimates are evaluated with ground-based soil moisture measurements over the continental U.S. for five consecutive warm seasons (May-September of 2015-2019). The result shows that both SMAP and ASCAT retrievals improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimates. Especially, the SMAP single-sensor assimilation experiment shows the best performance with the increase of temporal anomaly correlation by Delta R similar to 0.05 for surface soil moisture and Delta R similar to 0.03 for root-zone soil moisture compared with the LSM simulation without satellite data assimilation. SMAP assimilation is more skillful than ASCAT assimilation primarily because of the greater skill of the assimilated SMAP retrievals compared to the ASCAT retrievals. The skill improvement also depends significantly on the region; the higher skill improvement in the western U.S. compared to the eastern U.S. is explained by the Kalman gain in the two experiments. Additionally, the regional skill differences in the single-sensor assimilation experiments are attributed to the number of assimilated observations. Finally, the soil moisture assimilation estimates provide more realistic land surface information than model-only simulations for the 2015 and the 2016 western U.S. droughts, suggesting the advantage of using satellite soil moisture retrievals in the current drought monitoring system.

AB In forest landscapes affected by fire, the estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from remote sensing data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) enables to evaluate the ecological impact of such disturbance across plant communities at different spatio-temporal scales. Even though, when landscapes are highly heterogeneous, the fine-scale ground spatial variation might not be properly captured if FVC products are provided at moderate or coarse spatial scales, as typical of most of operational Earth observing satellite missions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of a RTM inversion approach for estimating FVC from satellite reflectance data at high spatial resolution as compared to the standard use of coarser imagery. The study was conducted both at landscape and plant community levels within the perimeter of a megafire that occurred in western Mediter-ranean Basin. We developed a hybrid retrieval scheme based on PROSAIL-D RTM simulations to create a training dataset of top-of-canopy spectral reflectance and the corresponding FVC for the dominant plant communities. The machine learning algorithm Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) was learned on the training dataset to model the relationship between canopy reflectance and FVC. The GPR model was then applied to retrieve FVC from WorldView-3 (spatial resolution of 2 m) and Sentinel-2 (spatial resolution of 20 m) surface reflectance bands. A set of 75 plots of 2x2m and 45 plots of 20x20m was distributed under a stratified schema across the focal plant communities within the fire perimeter to validate FVC satellite derived retrieval. At landscape scale, the accuracy of the FVC retrieval was substantially higher from WorldView-3 (R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 7.92%) than from Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 11.89%). At community level, FVC retrieval was more accurate for oak forests than for heathlands and broomlands. The retrieval from WorldView-3 minimized the over- and under-estimation effects at low and high field sampled vegetation cover, respectively. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of high spatial resolution satellite reflectance data to capture FVC ground spatial variability in heterogeneous burned areas using a hybrid RTM retrieval method.

AB Significant advances toward the remote sensing of photosynthetic activity have been achieved in the last decades, including sensor design and radiative transfer model (RTM) development. Nevertheless, finding methods to accurately quantify carbon assimilation across species and spatial scales remains a challenge. Most methods are either empirical and not transferable across scales or can only be applied if highly complex input data are available. Under stress, the photosynthetic rate is limited by the maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), which is determined by the leaf biochemistry and the environmental conditions. V-cmax has been connected to plant photoprotective mechanisms, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll fluorescence emission. Recent RTM developments such as the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model allow the simulation of the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and V-cmax effects on the canopy spectrum. This development provides an approach to retrieve V-cmax through RTM model inversion and track assimilation rate. In this study we explore SIF, narrow-band indices and RTM inversion to track changes in photosynthetic efficiency as a function of vegetation stress. We use hyperspectral imagery acquired over an almond orchard under different management strategies which affected the assimilation rates measured in the field. V-cmax used as an indicator of assimilation was retrieved through SCOPE model inversion from pure-tree crown hyperspectral data. The relationships between field-measured assimilation rates and V-cmax retrieved from model inversion were higher (r(2) = 0.7-0.8) than when SIF was used alone (r(2) = 0.5-0.6) or when traditional vegetation indices were used (r(2) = 0.3-0.5). The method was proved successful when applied to two independent datasets acquired at two different dates throughout the season, ensuring its robustness and transferability. When applied to both dates simultaneously, the results showed a unique significant trend between the assimilation measured in the field and V-cmax derived using SCOPE (r(2) = 0.56, p < 0.001). This work demonstrates that tracking assimilation in almond trees is feasible using hyperspectral imagery linked to radiative transfer-photosynthesis models.

TI Investigating ESA Sentinel-2 products' systematic cloud cover
   overestimation in very high altitude areas
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE Sentinel-2 cloud mask; Cloud cover overestimation; Big EO data image
   selection; Geographical bias
AB Cloud detection in optical remote sensing imagery is crucial because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in analyses. Almost all optical remote sensing data access portals rely to some degree on a cloud cover filter. Here we show that cirrus as well as opaque cloud cover in Sentinel-2 Level-1C (L1C) and Level-2A (L2A) imagery is systematically and significantly overestimated in very high altitude areas (e.g. Himalayas, Andes). We argue that this systematic bias is created by applying simple thresholds to single bands instead of using a multi band spectral signature in the cloud detection process. This results in a lot of "hidden" data for very high altitude areas when each image's estimated cloud cover is used as an automated selection criterion for analysis (e.g. global analyses, cloud-free mosaic production). We show geographic locations exemplifying this overestimation, and compare the L1C and L2A cloud masks produced by ESA to cloud masks generated by an expert system that uses comprehensive spectral signatures, showing that reliable cloud estimations are possible in very high altitudes. Based on this comparison, we argue for changes to L1C and L2A cloud detection algorithms in order to improve initial querying and selection of big EO data, where reliable yet automated quality indicators are necessary to handle an overwhelming data volume and velocity. Our contribution raises awareness of potential bias when pre-selecting images based on reported cloud cover in very high altitude areas for researchers and users of Sentinel-2 imagery in the environmental domain.

AB The Central Valley in California is characterized by a semi-arid climate prone to droughts, a variable surface water supply, and immense agricultural areas dependent on groundwater irrigation. The groundwater is stored in a complex aquifer system composed of alternating layers of coarse sediments and fine-grained sediments acting as confining materials. Groundwater fluctuations are coupled with both the elastic and inelastic land surface deformation historically observed in the Central Valley. Surface deformation poses a hazard to the California Aqueduct, which supports Central Valley agriculture and large urban populations in Southern California. The risk of reduced aqueduct efficacy and expensive repairs compels water resource managers to carefully monitor land deformation in the Valley.
   A persistent drought in the region began in 2012, intensified in 2014, and was abruptly alleviated by a wet period from Dec-2016 to Feb-2018. NASA's UAVSAR L-band synthetic aperture radar acquired 31 high resolution radar images between May-2013 and Nov-2018. The interferometric phase difference between acquisitions is used to develop a time series of vertical displacement and identify and track a rapidly forming subsidence feature adjacent to the California Aqueduct. The surface area of the feature that subsided 10 cm or more by the end of the time series reaches 4452 ha and a 10.5+ km segment of the aqueduct. This study also incorporates ex-tensometer measurements, precise leveling surveys, Sentinel-1A displacement, concurrent water elevation data, well construction reports, nearby extensometer measurements, aquifer material characterization, and environmental conditions. Spatiotemporal data availability limits the appropriateness of calculations and models able to be performed for different sites along the aqueduct. We aim to offer insight into heterogeneous subsurface properties and mechanics, estimate the permanent loss of aquifer storage volume, and identify additional data that would aid water management.

AB The recent increase in population growth and urbanisation demands for real-time riverine water management to fulfil the daily-scale domestic and ecological water needs, necessitating for high-frequent streamflow estimation at any river section. Although there are several conventional methods available in the literature, using these methods to obtain streamflow information at finer spatiotemporal resolutions is not feasible. Moreover, streamflow estimation using single or multi-satellite remote sensing approaches is still in the experimental stage. As advancement in the existing approaches, this study advocates two novel models, namely CMOD and CFUS, which use the Frank copula-based single MODIS satellite data and copula-based multi-satellite MODIS-Landsat fusion data, respectively. These developed models fit a box-centre matrix to the pixel ratios of water (within the river at the gauging station) and land (in the riparian zone) in the near-infrared spectrum. Two other approaches using the stand-alone MODIS data (MOD model) and enhanced spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS-Landsat datasets (FUS model) are also developed to inter-compare with the CMOD and CFUS models for reproducing the daily time series of streamflow at three gauging stations on the Brahmani River in eastern India. The calibration and validation results reveal that the 30 m resolution CFUS model is the best approach for daily-scale streamflow estimation with sufficient accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC) of 0.92 followed by the CMOD (NSC = 0.80), FUS (NSC = 0.78), and MOD (NSC = 0.66) models. Hence, the CFUS model can be used as a potential tool for the next-generation hydrometry in semi-gauged river basins for riverine water resources assessment and inter-state water-sharing conflict resolution.

AB Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.

AB Lakes and permafrost on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are both important indicators of climate change. Previous literatures have shown the usefulness of optical remote sensing in lake expansion monitoring and the effectiveness of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) in retrieving permafrost deformation on QTP. However, none of them incorporated both optical remote sensing and InSAR to investigate an event that may exhibit causal links between lake outburst and permafrost degradation. This study integrated both the Google Earth Engine (GEE) analysis on optical images and the small baseline subset (SBAS) processing on SAR datasets to evaluate the potential impact of a lake outburst event on permafrost degradation. The outburst of Zonag Lake (headwater lake) that occurred on 14 September 2011 was focused, and its consequential influence on the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake (tailwater lake) was investigated. The GEE processing on Landsat and HJ-1 imageries allowed an efficient monitoring of the Salt Lake expansion over past 20 years. In addition, the SBAS-InSAR analysis on temporal Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets further discovered the accelerated permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake after 2014. The results provide an evidence that on QTP the outburst of a headwater lake may significantly accelerate the permafrost degradation surrounding the tailwater lake. Such degradation may be attributed to the thermal alteration of the permafrost thawing-freezing cycle and the melting ground ice, along with the subsequent changes on hydrological connectivity and soil permeability. With the continuous trend of the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake, potential risks may be further exposed to the regional environment and infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway, thus deserving a particular attention in the near future. The novelties of this study are: 1) technically, the preliminary attempt to integrate the GEE and InSAR techniques for a joint analysis of lake expansion and permafrost degradation, and 2) scientifically, the finding that lake outburst may accelerate permafrost degradation on QTP.

AB In open forest canopies, such as in boreal forests, forest floor can contribute significantly to the observed top of canopy reflectance. In order to retrieve the biophysical properties of the tree layer, correcting for forest floor is essential. Traditionally, the algorithms for retrieval of forest floor reflectance depend on tree layer information such as leaf area index, canopy cover, and site fertility. To overcome these circular dependencies, we propose an algorithm that can be applied only using airborne remote sensing data. We acquired airborne hyperspectral imagery over the Hyytiala forest research station (61 degrees 50 ' N, 24 degrees 17 ' E) in central Finland on July 3rd in 2015 using a hyperspectral pushbroom line scanner. The image data had a spectral resolution of 4.6 nm, and the spatial resolution was 0.6 m. We developed a linear spectral unmixing algorithm, which is based on the definition of the reflectance factor, taking into account the variation of incident irradiance inside the canopy. The weights of the mixture can be computed from tree canopy gap fractions, a tree species insensitive leaf albedo, and average tree stand reflectance. Canopy gap fractions were retrieved with empirical methods available in scientific literature. The forest floor reflectance in the near-infrared increased with site fertility in agreement with the forest floor field measurements. Moreover, we found that in near infrared, the reflectance of moderately rich and moist upland forests was significantly different from all other fertility classes. Finally, we tested the reflectance decomposition on the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) known to be heavily affected by understory reflectance and canopy structure, and the forest PRI to be decoupled from the PRI of the overand understory.

AB The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3-30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km(2) Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start and end-of-season for the series using a 50% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of similar to 8 days for SOS50 and similar to 15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.

AB This article proposes a simple and intuitive classification system by which to define full spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) data with a quantitative output that enables a more manageable handling of spectral information for aquatic science applications. The weighted harmonic mean of the R-rs(lambda) wavelengths outputs an Apparent Visible Wavelength (in units of nanometers), representing a one-dimensional geophysical metric of color that is inherently correlated to spectral shape. This dimensionality reduction of spectral information combined with the output along a continuum of wavelength values offers a robust and user-friendly means to describe and analyze spectral R-rs(lambda) in terms of spatial and temporal trends and variability. The uncertainty in the algorithm's estimation of spectral shape is demonstrated on a global scale, in addition to the utility of the algorithm to discern spectral-spatial-temporal trends in the ocean, on a per-pixel basis for the entire 22 year continuous ocean color (SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua) time-series. This technique can be applied to datasets of varying multi- and hyper-spectral resolutions, providing continuity between heritage and future satellite sensors, and further enabling an effective means of elucidating similarities or differences in complex spectral signatures within the constraints of two dimensions. This straightforward means of conceptualizing multi-dimensional variability can help maximize the potential of the spectral information embedded in remote sensing data.

AB In tropical forests, leaf phenology-particularly the pronounced dry-season green-up-strongly regulates biogeochemical cycles of carbon and water fluxes. However, uncertainties remain in the understanding of tropical forest leaf phenology at different spatial scales. Phenocams accurately characterize leaf phenology at the crown and ecosystem scales but are limited to a few sites and time spans of a few years. Time-series satellite observations might fill this gap, but the commonly used satellites (e.g. MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) have resolutions too coarse to characterize single crowns. To resolve this observational challenge, we used the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m resolution and near daily nadir-view coverage. We first developed a rigorous method to cross-calibrate PlanetScope surface reflectance using daily BRDF-adjusted MODIS as the reference. We then used linear spectral unmixing of calibrated PlanetScope to obtain dry-season change in the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the PlanetScope pixel level. We used the Central Amazon Tapajos National Forest k67 site, as all necessary data (from field to phenocam and satellite observations) was available. For this proof of concept, we chose a set of 22 dates of PlanetScope measurements in 2018 and 16 in 2019, all from the six drier months of the year to provide the highest possible cloud-free temporal resolution. Our results show that MODIS-calibrated dry-season PlanetScope data (1) accurately assessed seasonal changes in ecosystem-scale and crown-scale spectral reflectance; (2) detected an increase in ecosystem-scale GV fraction (and a decrease in NPV fraction) from June to November of both years, consistent with local phenocam observations with R-2 around 0.8; and (3) monitored large seasonal trend variability in crown-scale NPV fraction. Our results highlight the potential of integrating multi-scale satellite observations to extend fine-scale leaf phenology monitoring beyond the spatial limits of phenocams.

AB Accurate representations of canopy cover are essential for directing natural resource management efforts targeted at issues such as carbon storage, habitat modeling, fire spread, water resources, and ecosystem services. A two-phase classification approach utilizing an iterative classification of high-resolution aerial imagery to develop training data for a regional-scale classification of percentage woody canopy cover (PWCC) using Sentinel-2 imagery is presented in this study, and is tested for a large portion of South Texas (9,200,000 ha). The modeled PWCC for the study area belonged to the respective classes as follows, PWCC0 = 26%, PWCC90 = 14%, PWCC10 = 12%, PWCC80 = 8%, PWCC20 = 7%, PWCC30 = 7%, PWCC70 = 6%, PWCC50 = 5%, PWCC40 = 5%, and PWCC60 = 5%. Statistics indicated that the overall weighted accuracy for the mapped PWCC classes (A(ow)) was 0.82 and that the overall weighted kappa ((k) over cap (w)) was 0.49. To demonstrate the usefulness of the PWCC mapping approach to produce reasonable canopy cover estimates, the relative accuracies of modeled PWCC and other similar canopy cover products (LANDFIRE, NLCD) for the study area were summarized. MAE and RSS values were calculated based on five sample areas of directly measured LiDAR canopy cover estimates. The PWCC mapping approach presented here exhibited significantly MAE values for 5 out of 5 sample areas, and lower RSS values for 4 of 5 sample areas. By class MAE and RSS values were lower for all percentage cover classes. Overall, comparisons of the mapping result with high-resolution aerial imagery and the quantitative assessments indicated that the approach presented here was effective for developing highly detailed canopy cover estimates that can be used for planning and modeling at multiple scales (e.g. regional or local). Additionally, this approach can be employed by individual researchers and is less time and resource consumptive when compared to other large scale approaches. To date, only a limited number of existing studies have focused on approaches that can be used to map tree canopy cover for large areas.

AB The seasonal snow-cover is one of the most rapidly varying natural surface features on Earth. It strongly modulates the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon balance. Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit: the operational land imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua. We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes: thresholding of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), regression on the NDSI, and spectral unmixing. We conduct the evaluation at a high-Arctic site in Svalbard, Norway, by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high-resolution snow-cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system. For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals, the regression-based retrievals outperformed the unmixing-based retrievals for all metrics but the bias. For the higher resolution sensors (OLI and MSI), retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board. We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI.

AB A novel methodology is proposed to robustly map oil seed rape (OSR) flowering phenology from time series generated from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors. The time series are averaged at parcel level, initially for a set of 229 reference parcels for which multiple phenological observations on OSR flowering have been collected from April 21 to May 19, 2018. The set of OSR parcels is extended to a regional sample of 32,355 OSR parcels derived from a regional S2 classification. The study area comprises the northern Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (N) and the southern Bavaria (S) regions in Germany. A method was developed to automatically compute peak flowering at parcel level from the S2 time signature of the Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) and from the local minimum in S1 VV polarized backscattering coefficients. Peak flowering was determined at a temporal accuracy of 1 to 4 days. A systematic flowering delay of 1 day was observed in the S1 detection compared to S2. Peak flowering differed by 12 days between the N and S. Considerable local variation was observed in the N-S parcel-level flowering gradient. Additional in-situ phenology observations at 70 Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) stations confirm the spatial and temporal consistency between S1 and S2 signatures and flowering phenology across both regions. Conditions during flowering strongly determine OSR yield, therefore, the capacity to continuously characterize spatially the timing of key flowering dates across large areas is key. To illustrate this, expected flowering dates were simulated assuming a single OSR variety with a 425 growing degree days (GDD) requirement to reach flowering. This GDD requirement was calculated based on parcel-level peak flowering dates and temperatures accumulated from 25-km gridded meteorological data. The correlation between simulated and S2 observed peak flowering dates still equaled 0.84 and 0.54 for the N and S respectively. These Sentinel-based parcel-level flowering parameters can be combined with weather data to support in-season predictions of OSR yield, area, and production. Our approach identified the unique temporal signatures of S1 and S2 associated with OSR flowering and can now be applied to monitor OSR phenology for parcels across the globe.

AB The increased availability of spaceborne radar data projected over the next decade provides a great opportunity for operational soil moisture mapping with high spatial ( < 50 m) and temporal ( < 3 days) resolution, by combining the data from multiple SAR missions. Accordingly, a multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval framework has been proposed, being applicable for SAR missions operating at the commonly used remote sensing frequencies of L-, C- and X-band. A combination of numerical, physical and semi-empirical scattering models was selected to build a series of forward modeling look up tables (LUTs) covering the typical radar configurations and nature surface conditions. An unsupervised change detection method was integrated to identify areas with abrupt roughness and vegetation changes, so that time-series data collected from different SARs can be combined with the assumption of time-invariant roughness and vegetation. The multi-frequency backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) with negligible scattering from soil surface (equivalent to calibration uncertainty) was then removed before soil moisture retrieval. Finally, soil moisture retrieval was carried out independently for each landcover type using an optimization method and forward LUTs. Evaluation based on the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment-5 dataset consisting of L-band airborne data, C-band RADARSAT-2 data and X-band COSMO-SkyMed data showed an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.058 cm(3)/cm(3) at the paddock scale (similar to 0.1 - 0.5 km). The comparison with single and dual frequency retrieval suggests that multi-frequency retrieval is not necessary to have the highest accuracy. However, it is still valuable to joint use multi-frequency data consider the limited deterioration in accuracy and the significantly enhanced temporal resolution.

AB Phytoplankton size structure impacts ocean food-web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, and is thus an important ecological indicator that can be utilised to quantitatively evaluate the state of marine ecosystems. Potential alterations to size structure are predicted to occur in tropical regions under future scenarios of climate change. Therefore, there is an increasing requirement for the synoptic monitoring of phytoplankton size structure in marine systems. The Red Sea remains a comparatively unexplored tropical marine ecosystem, particularly with regards to its large-scale biological dynamics. Using an in situ pigment dataset acquired in the Red Sea, we parameterise a two-component, abundance-based phytoplankton size model and apply it to remotely-sensed observations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, to infer Chl-a in two size classes of phytoplankton, small cells < 2 mu m in size (picophytoplankton) and large cells > 2 mu m in size. Satellite-derived estimates of phytoplankton size structure are in good agreement with corresponding in situ measurements and also capture the spatial variability related to regional mesoscale dynamics. Our analysis reveals that, for the estimation of Chl-a in the two size classes, the model performs comparably or in some cases better, to validations in other oceanic regions. Our model parameterisation will be useful for future studies on the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton size classes in the Red Sea, which may ultimately be relevant for understanding trophic linkages between phytoplankton size structure and fisheries, and the development of marine management strategies.

AB The 2017 fire season was one of the largest on record for British Columbia (BC), Canada, in terms of total area burned (estimated 1.2 million ha), affecting the safety and air quality of numerous communities. Moreover, fires of this number and extent alter the wood supply for harvesting, the nature of habitat for wildlife, and can affect regional and national carbon budgets. As a result, it is important to map these fires accurately and to monitor within-year fire progression in order to quantify the resulting forest-disturbance impacts fully. The Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm was used to merge burned-area classifications of individual fires from a range of remote sensing sources such as Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS (MCD64A1) burned-area dataset. Together, these provisional classifications imaged each pixel within a known fire perimeter an average of 33.8 times between April 1 and December 1. The resulting 35-week time-series stack had updated weekly burned areas for each of the 89 fires in BC in 2017. Province-wide fire progression was variable throughout the period analyzed, characterized by a steady burn phase of 41,437 ha (5% of total area burned) over a two-week period in early July, an accelerated burn phase of 149,422 ha (17%) from mid-July to early August, another steady burn phase of 218,079 ha (24%) for one month until early September, and a second accelerated burn phase of 301,931 ha (34%) over two weeks in late September with subsequent steady growth of 180,119 ha (20%) over 1.5 months until containment in late October. Herein, we demonstrate how such temporally dense fire classification stacks can be used to analyze fire progression over the course of a fire season (both retrospectively and in near-real time) providing useful metrics to characterize and compare fire events. End-of-season burned-area estimates correspond with estimates derived from the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) product that is generated retrospectively from fire best-available mapping approaches. This rapid interpretation of information enables the analysis of suppression success and potential drivers of fires spread while facilitating analyses of carbon budget consequences as well as impacts to communities and timber supply.

AB The livestock activity accounts for a large part of the transformations in land cover in the world, with pasture areas being the main land use in Brazil and the main livelihood of the largest commercial herd in the world. In this sense, a better understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of pasture areas is of fundamental importance for a better occupation and territorial governance. Moreover, because they provide different ecosystem services, pastures play a key role in mitigating climate change and in meeting GHG emission reduction targets. Within this context, and based on Landsat image processing via machine learning methods in a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), this work has mapped, annually and in an unprecedented way, the totality of the Brazilian pastures, from 1985 to 2017. With an overall accuracy of about 90%, the 33 maps produced indicated the pasture area varying from similar to 118 Mha +/- 3.41% (1985) to similar to 178 Mha +/- 2.53% (2017), with this expansion occurring mostly in the northern region of the country and to a lesser extent in the midwest. Temporarily, most of this expansion occurred in the first half of the period evaluated (i.e. between 1985 and 2002), with an increase in Brazilian pasture areas of similar to 57 mha in just 17 years. After 2002, this area remained relatively stable, varying between similar to 175 mha +/- 2.48% and similar to 178 mha +/- 2.53% by 2017. In 33 years, about 87% of the mapped areas experienced zero, one, two, or three land-cover / land-use transitions; overall, of the similar to 178 mha 2.53% of existing pastures in 2017, similar to 52 mha are at least 33 years old, similar to 66 mha were formed after 1985, and similar to 33 mha may have undergone some reform action in the period under consideration. The dynamics revealed in this study reinforce the thesis of pasture utilization as a land reserve, and demonstrate the importance of these areas in the economic, social, and environmental aspects of Brazil.

AB The Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission has been successfully launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on December 5th, 2018. While the sampling pattern of GEDI (8 transects with about 600 m across-track spacing) is sufficient to provide accurate biomass maps at the mission's required gridded resolution of 1 km, it is of significant interest to fuse GEDI data with ancillary, wall-to-wall remote sensing data from other sensors to provide increased accuracy, potentially higher resolution, and to fill gaps caused by track spacing, clumping in the ISS orbital tracks, as well as from clouds. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining simulated GEDI lidar observations with acquisitions from DLR's TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission to improve forest biomass estimation at a moderate resolution of 1 km, and to produce biomass maps at a much finer resolution of one hectare. We statistically characterize uncertainties before and after fusing simulated GEDI observations with TDX data across three different biomes: a temperate mixed deciduous forest, a temperate and mountainous coniferous forest, and a tropical forest. We implement the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model to derive canopy heights from TDX, using GEDI observations to parameterize key variables in the model. Our uncertainty framework is based on application of what are known as hybrid and hierarchical model-based inference, which allows for the parametric estimation of the variance of biomass estimation using both sampled and modeled data. We found improved accuracies after applying our fusion methods, with uncertainties at 1 km resolution ranging from 11%-20% across the different study sites of the mean biomass from the use of GEDI data alone, compared to 7%-12% achieved after the fusion. At one hectare resolution, comparison of the fusion derived biomass with field plots showed uncertainties associated with mean biomass predictions between 11%-27% across sites. Our results suggest that the use of ancillary data that are sensitive to biomass, such as heights from TDX, with observations of ecosystem structure from GEDI, has the potential to both improve accuracies and/or provide finer spatial resolution, than what is achievable through either mission by itself. We further demonstrate that the GEDI data themselves may be used to parameterize models that invert height from TDX, leading to more accurate height maps for use in biomass estimation. Lastly, our results illustrate the benefits of using parametric estimation theory to quantify uncertainties from both sampling and modeling errors that arise in the fusion of multi-modal remote sensing data at various spatial scales.

AB With the advances in complexity and resolution in ecological modeling, there is an increasing demand for more detailed characterization of vegetation canopy architecture. Clumping, a characteristic of foliage distribution, is one of the important aspects of canopy structure and significantly influences light penetration through the canopy. Airborne full-waveform LiDAR data contains large amounts of structural information, and presents a powerful avenue for providing detailed foliage distribution information over large areas. In this study, we present a method for describing physical canopy clumping structure for individual trees that can resolve fine scale variations in foliage clumping. We first utilize K-means clustering algorithm to extract structure found within full-waveform LiDAR data. Then we use representative traits for each data cluster to classify them into their natural groups. Based on these traits, we draw conclusions about physical representations of each group and identify groups as containing clumps in vegetation ranging from spares to dense. We formulate a clumping index multiplier based on cluster traits that inform relative degrees of vegetation clumping at the sub-canopy scale. We use the clumping index multiplier to introduce heterogeneity to a modeled plot level clumping index and generate a vertical clumping index profile for a forested plot. This study demonstrates that large amounts of canopy structural information can be extracted from waveform LiDAR data. The fine resolution canopy clumping structure found by the method described in this work can be used as valuable input for ecological models.

AB Peatlands are key reservoirs of belowground carbon (C) and their monitoring is important to assess the rapid changes in the C cycle caused by climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts. Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts. Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks. First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information. Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with the random forests derived maps.
   This SEM approach resulted in higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with improvements of r(2) from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from 31.33% to 20.24% and bias from -0.73 to 0.05. Our case study showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and (2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in empirical modeling approaches.

AB The satellites of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) continuously broadcast L-band signals at about a 20-cm wavelength. Some signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data received by off-shelf geodetic antennas contain the multipath information of the sea, and they have been demonstrated for use in retrieving sea levels; however, compared with conventional tide gauges, this GNSS multipath reflectometry (GNSS-MR) technique is limited in terms of both precision and sampling rate. The simplest measure to increase the sampling rate of retrievals is to use SNR data from more satellite tracks at more satellite constellations. This study estimated the sea level of station BAST belonging to the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) using SNR data of four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou) of the GNSS. It was found that the S5X/S2X, S2P/S2C, S5X, and S7I SNR types had optimal precisions for the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, respectively. In addition, we developed a multi-GNSS combination algorithm to formulate a 10-min sea level time series based on a state transition equation set and a robust regression solution strategy. The combined sea level retrieval time series had an approximately 40%-75% accuracy improvement compared to individual signal sea level retrievals; with a constant sampling interval in the 10 min window, the combined method presented here is beneficial for both the precision and sampling rate. This approach is novel and advanced in two key ways, in that we use data from four constellations simultaneously and through the regression strategy, which is applied to synthesize all data into a time series at regular 10-min intervals. This technique could be applied to other sites and is therefore beneficial for the GNSS-MR community.

AB Tropical cyclones are natural events that transform into natural disasters as they approach and reach land. In 2017 alone, tropical cyclones caused an estimated $215 billion in damage. While MODIS data are regularly used in the analysis of hurricanes and typhoons, damage studies typically focus on just a few events without providing a comprehensive overview and comparison across events. The MODIS record is now sufficiently long to enable standardization in time, allowing us to extend previously developed disturbance methodology and to remove dependency on land cover datasets. We apply this new approach to detect the impact of both droughts and hurricanes on the four largest Caribbean islands since 2001. We find that the percentage of disturbed land on the four islands varies from approximately 0-50% between 2001 and 2017, with the highest percentages coinciding with major droughts in Cuba, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. We demonstrate that (1) Hurricane Maria resulted in significant disturbance across 50% of Puerto Rico (4549 km(2)), and (2) gradual recovery started about 2.5 months after the hurricane hit. While our approach focuses on the identification of damage arising from hurricanes, it is also capable of identifying the damage from droughts.

AB Vegetation phenological events, especially peak foliage coloration, are among the ecological phenomena that are most sensitive to climate change. Compared to spring seasonally recurring events, fall phenology remains much less understood. Remotely sensed monitoring of fall phenology provides a wealth of opportunities to understand the underlying processes and mechanisms. However, the gradual change of foliage color in the fall season makes it challenging to remotely estimate critical phenological transition dates. Particularly, the transition date for foliage peak coloration cannot be adequately captured via conventional curve fitting-based phenological models. Also the lack of consensus among the conventional models makes it desirable to explore new remotely sensed representations of the fall phenological process. In this study, we developed an innovative complex network based phenological model, namely "pheno-network", to estimate the fall foliage transition date for peak coloration. The pheno-network model characterizes the phenological process through analyzing the collective changes of spectral signatures along the temporal trajectory. A network measure, moving average bridging coefficient, is newly designed to estimate the phenological transition date. With Harvard Forest and Hubbard Brook Forest as reference sites, the results demonstrated that the transition date estimated through the devised pheno-network model corresponds well with the peak coloration period of the reference sites. The unique structure of the pheno-network formulated via spectral similarities differentiates the various roles of vegetation spectral signatures at different phenological stages. This study is the first attempt at introducing network science to time series remote sensing in modeling the complex phenological processes of vegetation. The innovative network-based phenological representation shows great potential in improving remotely sensed phenological monitoring and shedding light on the subsequent modeling of vegetation phenological responses to climate change.

AB Reliable detection of clouds is a critical pre-processing step in optical satellite based remote sensing. Currently, most methods are based on classifying invidual pixels from their spectral signatures, therefore they do not incorporate the spatial patterns. This often leads to misclassifications of highly reflective surfaces, such as human made structures or snow/ice. Multi-temporal methods can be used to alleviate this problem, but these methods introduce new problems, such as the need of a cloud-free image of the scene. In this paper, we introduce the Remote Sensing Network (RS-Net), a deep learning model for detection of clouds in optical satellite imagery, based on the U-net architecture. The model is trained and evaluated using the Landsat 8 Biome and SPARCS datasets, and it shows state-of-the-art performance, especially over biomes with hardly distinguishable scenery, such as clouds over snowy and icy regions. In particular, the performance of the model that uses only the RGB bands is significantly improved, showing promising results for cloud detection with smaller satellites with limited multi-spectral capabilities. Furthermore, we show how training the RS-Net models on data from an existing cloud masking method, which are treated as noisy data, leads to increased performance compared to the original method. This is validated by using the Fmask algorithm to annotate the Landsat 8 datasets, and then use these annotations as training data for regularized RS-Net models, which then show improved performance compared to the Fmask algorithm. Finally, the classification time of a full Landsat 8 product is 18.0 +/- 2.4 s for the largest RS-Net model, thereby making it suitable for production environments.

AB The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provided monthly global estimates of the vertically integrated terrestrial water storage with about 300-400-km horizontal resolution between 2002 and 2017. Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1-3 days at a nominal 43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model can improve the estimation of 0-5 cm "surface" soil moisture, 0-100 cm "root-zone" soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S. for 6 years (July 2010 June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE analysis.

AB Drought-induced tree mortality events are expected to increase in frequency under climate change. However, monitoring and modeling of tree mortality is limited by the high spatial variability in vegetation response to climatic drought stress and lack of physiologically meaningful stress variables that can be monitored at large scales. In this study, we test the hypothesis that relative water content (RWC) estimated by passive microwave remote sensing through vegetation optical depth can be used as an empirical indicator of tree mortality that both integrates variations in plant drought stress and is accessible across large areas. The hypothesis was tested in a recent severe drought in California, USA. The RWC showed a stronger threshold relationship with mortality than climatic water deficit (CWD) - a commonly used mortality indicator - although both relationships were noisy due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data (0.25 degrees or approximately 25 km). In addition, the threshold for RWC was more uniform than that for CWD when compared between Northern and Southern regions of California. A random forests regression (machine learning) with 32 variables describing topography, climate, and vegetation characteristics predicted forest mortality extent i.e. fractional area of mortality (FAM) with satisfactory accuracy-coefficient of determination R-tmt(2) = 0.66, root mean square error = 0.023. Importantly, RWC was more than twice as important as any other variable in the model in estimating mortality, confirming its strong link to mortality rates. Moreover, RWC showed a moderate ability to aid in forecasting mortality, with a relative importance of RWC measured one year in advance of mortality similar to that of other relevant explanatory variables measured in the mortality year. The results of this study present a promising new approach to estimate drought stress of forests linked to mortality risk.

AB Global urbanization drastically reshapes the land atmosphere interactions, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystems in the integrated earth system. Urban trees are used extensively for providing desirable ecosystem services, especially to mitigate elevated thermal stress in cities. Urban trees differ markedly from their natural counterparts in the physiology due to their close interactions with anthropogenic stressors. Here we present the cooling capacity of urban trees in response to thermal extremes in cities of the contiguous United States. The cooling capacity is quantified as the surface cooling rate, which is expressed as the negative ratio of land surface temperature (LST) changes to fractional tree cover (FTC) changes, i.e., -Delta LST/Delta FTC. Results show that the surface cooling rate is dominated by plant transpiration up to 1.336 degrees C per percentage of FTC in heat waves; its temperature dependence remarkably resembles the thermodynamic liquid-water-vapor equilibrium. Urban trees also exert pseudo cooling effect in cold waves in contrast to the anthropogenic heat emission. The average surface cooling rate in cold waves is 0.022 degrees C per percentage of FTC, which is much smaller than that in heat waves (0.202 degrees C per percentage of FTC). The enhanced cooling capacity of urban trees will enable their provision of better ecosystem services to the urban environment for projected future increase of extreme heat.

AB Late spring frost plays a major role in the structure and function of forest ecosystems with potential consequences on species distribution at both local and regional scales. Paradoxically, in a warmer world the incidence and impact of frost is increasing because of earlier leaf unfolding and flowering as a response to warmer temperatures. In this regard, European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), a native tree species widely distributed in European forests, is considered particularly sensitive to changes in spring temperature regimes associated with climate change and thus especially subject to the risk of frost damage. Although several studies concerning F. sylvatica frost damage have been conducted in northern and central Europe, no extensive studies are available for the southern part of its range, i.e. central and southern Italy as well as Greece.
   In this paper the effect of a late spring frost occurring at the end of April 2016 is extensively documented with high spatial detail all along the Apennine Chain through satellite image data. Three different remote-sensing greenness indexes, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the greenness index (GI) derived from Landsat-8 satellite images acquired from May to July in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, were used to gauge the spatial response of common beech forests to this late frost event with relation to latitude, altitude and slope exposure. Frost damage was evaluated as a difference (Delta) of NDVI, GI and EVI between the mean of years 2014 and 2015 (i.e. MRY, mean of reference years), and 2016 (i.e. FEY, frost reference year). The three satellite remote-sensing indexes were efficient at detecting leaf damage with detailed spatial resolution and proved consistent with one another.
   The greatest damage occurred in the middle altitudinal range between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. with a decreasing trend toward both lower and higher elevations due to warmer temperatures below, and delayed phenology above. Exposure also influenced frost injury, with south-facing slopes of the mountain more damaged than the north. This difference was due to earlier spring leaf phenology of southern beech trees in response to a greater heat sum in the warm weeks preceding. Less damage in the northern Apennines is consistent with the spatial extent of minimum freezing temperatures. To sum up, frost damage is strongly related to site-specific conditions, i.e. on the one hand to minimum temperatures, and on the other to the phonological stage of the trees involving both altitude and exposure. Hence focusing on detailed sub-regional studies can be helpful for predicting future consequences of climate change on forests.

AB Tropical montane forests, particularly Andean rainforest, are important ecosystems for regional carbon and water cycles as well as for biological diversity and speciation. Owing to their remoteness, however, ecological key-processes are less understood as in the tropical lowlands. Remote sensing allows modeling of variables related to spatial patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g., biomass) and ecosystem functioning (e.g., functional leaf traits). However, at a landscape scale most studies conducted so far are based on airborne remote sensing data which is often available only locally and for one time-point. In contrast, multispectral satellites at moderate spectral and spatial resolutions are able to provide spatially continuous and repeated observations. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of Landsat-8 imagery in modeling tropical montane forest biomass, its productivity and selected canopy traits. Topographical, spectral and textural metrics were derived as predictors. To train and validate the models, in-situ data was sampled in 54 permanent plots in forests of southern Ecuador distributed within three study sites at 1000 m, 2000 m and 3000 m a.s.l. We used partial least squares regressions to model and map all response variables. Along the whole elevation gradient biomass and productivity models explained 31%, 43%, 69% and 63% of variance in aboveground biomass, annual wood production, fine litter production and aboveground net primary production, respectively. Regression models of canopy traits measured as community weighted means explained 62%, 78%, 65% and 65% of variance in leaf toughness, specific leaf area, foliar N concentration, and foliar P concentration, respectively. Models at single study sites hardly explained variation in aboveground biomass and the annual wood production indicating that these measures are mainly determined by the change of forest types along with elevation. In contrast, the models of fine litter production and canopy traits explained between 8%-85% in variation depending on the study site. We found spectral metrics, in particular a vegetation index using the red and the green band to provide complementary information to topographical metrics. The model performances for estimating leaf toughness, biochemical canopy traits and related fine litter production all improved when adding spectral information. Our findings therefore revealed that differences in fine litter production and canopy traits in our study area are driven by local changes in vegetation edaphically induced by topography. We conclude that Landsat-derived metrics are useful in modeling fine litter production and biochemical canopy traits, in a topographically and ecologically complex tropical montane forest.

AB River ice breakup and resulting flood risk is a nearly annual concern for communities along the five major rivers draining to the James and Hudson Bay Coasts in Ontario (Moose, Albany, Attawapiskat, Winisk and Severn Rivers). Ice breakup within this region has historically been monitored using flight reconnaissance supplemented by assessment of hydrometric data. More recently, remote sensed imagery have been used to monitor near real-time ice breakup and flood risk. However, the near real-time remotely sensed breakup information was found to have limited utility in the absence of a broader spatial and temporal understanding of breakup progression. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a method for generating a dataset of breakup dates. A secondary objective was to calculate statistics from this dataset that can be used to provide context to operational near real-time imagery analysis and improve understanding of ice processes in the study area. An automated method for detecting river ice breakup dates from 2000 to 2017 using MODIS imagery was developed. This method uses a threshold-based technique that aims to maximize river coverage and minimize effects of cloud obstruction. Image processing was completed in the high-performance Google Earth Engine application which enabled iterative classification and model calibration. The breakup date dataset was used to calculate statistics on breakup timing, duration, annual variability and breakup order. An assessment of patterns within these data is discussed, relationships between breakup timing, duration and highwater years is explored and the operational utility of these statistics is described. The classification compared well with Water Survey of Canada derived breakup dates with mean bias ranging from -2.0 days to 6.7 days and mean absolute error of 3.4 days to 6.9 days across the rivers. Latitude and distance upstream were found to be primary controls on breakup timing with drainage network configuration and reach morphology also having an influence. No relationships between highwater years and calculated breakup statistics were found. It is recommended that future studies use the dataset developed in this study in combination with hydrometric and remotely sensed data to improve prediction of highwater and understanding of breakup processes within these rivers.

AB The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new generic algorithm applied to collection 6 (C6) MODIS measurements to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over land at high spatial resolution (1 km). This study is the first evaluation of the MAIAC AOD from MODIS Aqua (A) and Terra (T) satellites between 2006 and 2016 over South Asia. The retrieval accuracy of MAIAC was assessed by comparing it to ground-truth AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD, as well as to AOD retrieved by the two operational MODIS algorithms: Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB). MAIAC AOD showed higher spatial coverage and retrieval frequency than either the DT or the DB AOD retrievals. The high spatial resolution of the MAIAC retrievals enhances the capability to distinguish aerosol sources and to determine fine aerosol features, such as wildfire smoke plumes and haze over complex geographical regions, and provides more retrievals in conditions that are cloudy or when the surface is partially covered by snow. In comparison to AERONET AOD, MAIAC AOD shows a better accuracy than both DT and DB AOD. A higher number of MAIAC-AERONET AOD matchups demonstrate the capability of MAIAC to retrieve AOD over varied surfaces, different aerosol types and loadings. Our results demonstrate high retrieval accuracy in term of the Expected Error (EE) (A/T, EE: 72.22%, 73.50%), and low root mean square error (A/T, RMSE: 0.148, 0.164), root mean bias (RMB) (A/T, RMB: 0.978, 1.049) and mean absolute error (MAE) (A/T, MAE: 0.098, 0.096). Moreover, MAIAC has a lower bias as a function of the viewing geometry and the aerosol type among the three retrieval algorithms. MAIAC performed well over bright and vegetated land surfaces, showing the highest retrieval accuracy over dense vegetation and particularly well in retrieving smoke AOD, yet it underestimated dust AOD. In conclusion, MAIAC's ability to provide AOD at high spatial resolution appears promising over South Asia, thus having advantage over contemporary aerosol retrieval algorithms for epidemiological and climatological studies.
   Capsule: In comparison with MODIS DT and DB AOD, and AERONET AOD, MAIAC shows improved accuracy and lower bias over South Asia, as well as with greater spatial coverage.

AB Rivers link land and ocean ecosystems, the two largest active carbon reservoirs in the world, and transport tremendous amounts of particulate organic carbon (POC) into marginal seas annually. Due to high spatiotemporal variations, estimations of riverine POC flux into the sea can be relatively inexact when based on field measurement only. In this study, remote sensing algorithms of riverine POC flux through the Xuliujing hydrological station in the Changjiang River Estuary (CRE) were developed using satellite data with hourly resolution from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI). Based on data collected during four seasonal cruises in the CRE from 2014 to 2016, POC concentration showed a significant linear relationship to total suspended matter (TSM) (N = 426, R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01). Thus, surface POC concentration was calculated by satellite-derived TSM. From the in-situ data, the vertical POC concentration profile at Xuliujing showed an exponentially increasing curve (p < 0.01), but a linear decrease (p < 0.01) for the water flow profile from the surface to the bottom. Combining the GOCI-derived surface POC concentration and vertical profiles of POC and water flow, we estimated monthly riverine POC fluxes to the CRE. Results showed that monthly POC flux at Xuliujing (0.071 +/- 0.022 Tg C) was 22.64% higher, on average, than the commonly used value at the non-tidal Datong hydrological station. Moreover, under human activity pressures, the influences of POC input from the Changjiang River on POC concentration at Xuliujing have weakened in recent years. Monthly and diurnal POC variations in the CRE were mainly impacted by wind speed and tidal processes, respectively. Thus, satellite monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution has great significance for accurately estimating riverine POC flux to estuary.

TI Chlorophyll content estimation in an open-canopy conifer forest with

AB With the advent of Sentinel-2, it is now possible to generate large-scale chlorophyll content maps with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, suitable for monitoring ecological processes such as vegetative stress and/or decline. However methodological gaps exist for adapting this technology to heterogeneous natural vegetation and for transferring it among vegetation species or plan functional types. In this study, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2A imagery for estimating needle chlorophyll (Ca+b) in a sparse pine forest undergoing significant needle loss and tree mortality. Sentinel-2A scenes were acquired under two extreme viewing geometries (June vs. December 2016) coincident with the acquisition of high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery, and field measurements of needle chlorophyll content and crown leaf area index. Using the high-resolution hyperspectral scenes acquired over 61 validation sites we found the CI chlorophyll index R-750/R-710 and Macc index (which uses spectral bands centered at 680 nm, 710 nm and 780 nm) had the strongest relationship with needle chlorophyll content from individual tree crowns (r(2) = 0.61 and r(2) = 0.59, respectively; p < 0.001), while TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI, originally designed for uniform agricultural canopies, did not perform as well (r(2) = 0.21 and r(2) = 0.01, respectively). Using lower-resolution Sentinel-2A data validated against hyperspectral estimates and ground truth needle chlorophyll content, the red-edge index CI and the Sentinel-specific chlorophyll indices CI-Gitelson, NDRE1 and NDRE2 had the highest accuracy (with r(2) values > 0.7 for June and > 0.4 for December; p < 0.001). The retrieval of needle chlorophyll content from the entire Sentinel-2A handset using the radiative transfer model INFORM yielded r(2) = 0.71 (RMSE = 8.1 mu g/cm(2)) for June, r(2) = 0.42 (RMSE = 12.2 mu g/cm(2)) for December, and r(2) = 0.6 (RMSE = 10.5 mu g/cm(2)) as overall performance using the June and December datasets together. This study demonstrates the retrieval of leaf Ca+b with Sentinel-2A imagery by red-edge indices and by an inversion method based on a hybrid canopy reflectance model that accounts for tree density, background and shadow components common in sparse forest canopies.

AB Bottom reflectance is often the main cause of high uncertainty in Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) estimation for optically shallow waters. This study presents a Landsat-8 based Shallow Water Bio-optical Properties (SBOP) algorithm to overcome bottom effects so as to successfully observe spatial and temporal CDOM dynamics in inland waters. We evaluated the algorithm via 58 images and a large set of field measurements collected across seasons of multiple years in the Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Results showed that the SBOP algorithm reduced estimation errors by as much as 4 times (RMSE = 0.17 and R-2 = 0.87 in the Saginaw Bay) when compared to the QAA-CDOM algorithm that did not take into account bottom reflectance. These improvements in CDOM estimation are consistent and robust across broad range CDOM absorption. Our analysis revealed: 1) the proposed remote sensing algorithm resulted in significant improvements in tracing spatial-temporal CDOM inputs from terrestrial environments to lakes, 2) CDOM distribution captured with high re-solution land-viewing satellite is useful in revealing the impacts of terrestrial ecosystems on the aquatic environment, and 3) Landsat-8 OLI, with its 16 days revisit time, provides valuable time series data for studying CDOM seasonal variations at land-water interface and has the potential to reveal its relationship to adjacent terrestrial biogeography and hydrology. The study presents a shallow water algorithm for studying freshwater or coastal ecology, as well as carbon cycling science.

AB Digital terrain models (DTMs) and vegetation canopy height models (CHMs) are used in a wide range of earth and environmental sciences. An increasing number of CHM products are available from active, passive, and photogrammetric remotely sensed data; however, high-resolution (<= 5 m), wall-to-wall CHMs for the arctic and northern boreal domains that are suitable for detailed spatial analysis are lacking. Recently, a 5-m spatial resolution pan-arctic digital surface model - the ArcticDEM - was created using automated stereopair analysis of high-resolution satellite data. The ArcticDEM is unprecedented in extent and spatial resolution, yet the product generally follows the uppermost surface elevation (i.e., representing a digital surface model, DSM) without regard to whether the surface is comprised of vegetation or bare-earth terrain. To address this limitation, we developed and tested an approach to map vegetation canopy height at a 5-m spatial resolution (hereafter called the local ArcticCHM), and then subtracted these estimated canopy heights from the ArcticDEM in order to create a 5-m resolution DTM (local ArcticDTM). We selected three pilot study areas (total 58 km(2)) across a north-south gradient in Alaska, representing a range of vegetation types and topographic conditions. We estimated and mapped canopy height using random Forest and imputation modeling approaches, with the ArcticDEM and high spatial resolution multispectral satellite data (WorldView-2) used as predictors. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data was used for model calibration and independent validation. Canopy height was reliably predicted across the three study areas, with the best models ranging from root mean square errors (RMSE) 2.2 to 2.6 m and R-2 ranging from 0.59 to 0.76 relative to ALS-based CHM reference data. Similarly, the RMSE between the new local ArcticDTM product and ALS-based DTM reference data was 45-68% less than similar comparisons with the ArcticDEM. Our results offer a means to extend these local ArcticDTM and CHM products to establish high resolution products elsewhere in Alaska of high value for a wide range of earth and environmental sciences research investigations.

AB Tropical forest vegetation structure is highly variable, both vertically and horizontally, and provides habitat to a large diversity of species. The forest-savanna mosaic in the northern part of Lope National Park, Gabon, has a large and complex variation in vegetation structure along a successional gradient. The goal of this research is to assess whether large footprint full-waveform lidar data can be used to distinguish successional vegetation types based on their vertical structure in this area. Eleven vegetation metrics were derived from the lidar waveforms: canopy height, canopy fractional cover, total Plant Area Index (PAI) and vertical profile of PAI. The PAI profiles from airborne waveform lidar showed good agreement with those from Terrestrial Laser Scanning, sampled at eight field plots across different vegetation types (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 0.63, bias = 0.41). The agreement further strengthened our confidence that lidar waveforms can be used to distinguish between the five vegetation types, within the limits of the sampled structure, because TLS was known to provide distinct PAI profiles for these vegetation types. We then employed a Random Forest model, trained with 193 locations of known vegetation type, to classify the entire study area into five successional vegetation types (classification accuracy = 81.3%). The resulting predictive map revealed the overall spatial pattern of vegetation types across the study area. Our results suggest that lidar-derived vegetation profiles can provide valuable information on vegetation type and successional stage. This, in turn, can further help to improve habitat and biodiversity conservation and forest management activities.

AB High-frequency along-track altimetric data only provide direct information on the geostrophic currents orthogonal to the track. A new approach is proposed that combines these across-track current estimates with directional information from remotely-sensed tracer fields, such as surface chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature. The analysis focuses on the South Madagascar region characterised by the strong East Madagascar Current and sharp gradients of surface tracers. The results are compared with in-situ observations from three moorings along the Jason-1 track 196. Accurate information on the total velocity direction is the key factor for obtaining accurate estimates of along-track velocities. Surface tracer fronts can be successfully used to retrieve such information, especially when currents intersect the satellite track at low incidence angles (within +/- 60 degrees from the perpendicular direction). Errors in the reconstructed total velocities tend to grow rapidly for higher angles. Best performance is obtained by retaining information from the strongest fronts only. However, this significantly limits the resolution at which total currents can be reconstructed along the altimeter track.

AB El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex ocean-atmosphere interaction phenomenon occurring in nature that has a profound impact on global atmospheric circulation. As ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon, in addition to the commonly used sea surface temperature (SST), water vapor in the atmosphere can be used to monitor the evolution of ENSO and to investigate its consequences (e.g., droughts and flooding). The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), in addition to its applications for positioning, timing, and navigation, is another established atmospheric observing system used to remotely sense precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere. The accuracy of the GNSS-derived PWV measurements was assessed from 12 stations based on observations made at co-located radiosonde stations as a reference. The results show that mean values of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and biases of 6-hourly GNSS-derived PWV derived from all 12 stations are valued at 1.48 mm and - 0.30 mm, respectively. Regarding monthly means, mean values of the RMSE and biases of the GNSS-derived PWV are valued at 0.66 mm and -0.23 mm, respectively. The variability in PWV estimated from 56 GNSS stations positioned close to the sea indicates that it is significantly affected by ENSO events. Generally, a 1-K increase in SST will lead to an 11% increase in PWV across all of the stations. A case study conducted at the TOW2 station in Australia shows that the non-linear trend of the PWV depicts the evolution of two severe flood events and one severe drought event occurring in this region. Comparative results derived from TOW2 and from another 24 stations show a good agreement between PWV and total precipitation. These results suggest that GNSS-derived PWV together with other climatic variables (e.g., SST) can be used as an indication of the evolution of ENSO events and as a possible indicator of drought and flood occurrence.

AB The potential for estimating streamflow in large continental rivers from satellite observations of river hydraulic variables has been well recognized. However this has not been widely applied to smaller regional rivers. In this study, we investigated the reliability of calibrating a hydrological model for the upper Yalongjiang River Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, based solely on river water surface widths derived from four high spatial resolution commercial satellite images: two from QuickBird and one each from IKONOS and WorldView-1. The model was forced using satellite-based meteorological datasets and calibrated using remotely sensed river widths. In situ gauged data are not used for modeling, making the approach applicable for ungauged basins. To shift the calibration objective from streamflow to river width, the hydrological model is connected to the at-a station hydraulic geometry (AHG) relationship. Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used for automatic calibration and to better quantify simulation uncertainty. After constraining the model parameter space solely to the river width observations, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values for the streamflow simulated using the calibrated model reached 64.3% in the calibration period and 55.8% in the validation period. When calibrating the model using river width datasets with designed measurement error associated with riparian canopy, the influences of error on model simulation were less than expected. This was because the effect of the error was counteracted by adjustment of the AHG parameters. Both superimposing updated ranges for the AHG parameters and further constraining the model output using hydrological signature information following calibration reduced simulation uncertainty, particularly with use of the latter method. This study demonstrates the potential for application of the proposed calibration method to regional ungauged basins lacking ground streamflow observation data, and provides insights into how remote sensing data can be more effectively integrated with hydrological modeling.

AB In cities, vegetation temperature is important for quantifying water use, microclimates, and water and energy fluxes, as demonstrated by urban climate models and in situ studies. Remote sensing is capable of observing land surface temperatures (LST) across a city; however, its ability to quantify vegetation canopy temperatures is limited because of LST variability resulting from urban surface heterogeneity, differences in vegetation fraction and non-vegetated material, and the coarse resolution of available thermal imagery. This study is a large-scale analysis of urban surface composition and temperature variability across the Los Angeles, USA, metropolitan area (4466 km(2)). Sub-pixel fractions of two plant functional types (tree and turfgrass) and four urban materials (impervious surface, commercial roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil) were quantified using hyperspectral imagery (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer). Fractional cover gradients of plant types and non-vegetated materials were developed using 1.7 million pixels, from which we modeled LST changes using simultaneously collected thermal imagery (MODIS-ASTER Airborne Simulator). Vegetation LST variability was mapped by subtracting modeled LST from observed LST and investigated relative to building density and vegetation management. Overall, LST varied significantly among plant functional types and urban material types. Across heterogeneous mixtures, LST and vegetation fraction exhibited a negative, linear relationship, with the slopes of LST change showing significant differences between trees and turfgrass. The map of vegetation LST variability had a standard deviation of 3.5 degrees C, indicating significant variability across Los Angeles independent of vegetation type or fractional cover. Building density was observed to affect tree and turfgrass LST differently, while a negative relationship was observed between vegetation LST and irrigation (R-2 = 0.55). Our results show that an LST signal of vegetation function, distinct from that of vegetation fractional cover, can be observed and modeled at city-scales in fractional mixture analysis, indicating potential for improved understanding of urban microclimates.

AB An effective planning and management to deal with potential impacts of drought requires accurate estimation and analysis of this natural complex phenomenon. Application of new fusion approaches using high-resolution satellite-based products, unlike ground-based observations, can provide accurate drought analysis. This study examines three advanced fusion-based methodologies including Ordered Weighted Averaged (OWA) approach based on ORNESS weighting method (ORNESS-OWA) and ORLIKE weighting method (ORLIKE-OWA) as well as K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) to fuse estimations by five individual estimator models using different remotely sensed data products. The precipitation data from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), CICS High-Resolution Optimal Interpolation Microwave Precipitation from Satellites (CHOMPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), The second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System Version-2 (GLDAS-2) products is utilized in estimating nonparametric-SPI as a meteorological drought index versus ground-based observations analysis. To achieve more accurate drought estimation, ground-based observations are classified in different clusters based on K-means clustering algorithm. Five individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), M5P model tree, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed for each cluster and their best results are used in fusion process. In addition, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization model is utilized to determine optimal weights in weighting methods. Estimation performance of all models are evaluated using statistical error indices of Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). Application of proposed methodology is verified over Fars province in Iran and the results are compared. Results showed that ORNESS-OWA method with lowest estimation error (MARE of 2.51% and R-2 of 95%) had the superb performance in comparison with all other individual AI and fusion-based models. Also, the proposed framework based on remotely sensed precipitation data and fusion-based models demonstrated an effective proficiency in drought estimation.

AB Because of the limited spatiotemporal resolutions in vegetation index (VI) products, land surface phenology (LSP) results may not well capture ground-based phonological changes. This is likely the result of the mixed pixel effect: (1) a pixel in VI products may contain an unknown composition of vegetation species or land cover types; and (2) these species differ in their sensitivity to climatic variations. The mixed pixel effect has induced inconsistent findings in LSP with in situ observations of spring phenology. To this end, this study has designed a series of simulation experiments to initiate the methodological exploration of how the green-up date (GUD) of a mixed pixel could be altered by the endmember GUDs and different non-GUD variables, including the end member composition, minimum and maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the length of the growth period. The study has also compared the sensitivity of two generally adopted GUD identification methods, the relative threshold method and the curvature method (also known as the inflection-point method). The simulations with two endmembers show that even if there is no change in the endmember GUDs, the GUD of the mixed pixel could be substantially altered by the changes in non-GUD variables. In addition, the study has also developed a simulation toolkit for the GUD identification with cases of three or more endmembers. The results of the study provide insights into effective strategies for analyzing spring phonology using VI products: the mixed pixel effect can be alleviated by selecting pixels that are relatively stable in the land cover or species composition. This simulation study calls for in situ phonological observations to validate the LSP, such as conducting climate-controlled experiments on few mixed species at a small spatial scale. The paper also argues for the necessity of isolating GUD trends caused by non-phenological changes in the study of spring phenology.

AB National forest inventories (NFI) provide estimates of forest resources at the national and regional level but are also increasingly used as basis for mapping forest resources based on remotely sensed data. Such maps procure local estimates of forest resources but may also improve precision of national and regional estimates. Supported by a countrywide airborne laser scanning (circa 2014) and a national land-use map (circa 2014), direct (DI), model-assisted (MA), and model calibrated (MC) estimates of wood volume (V) and aboveground biomass (AGB) densities in forest areas derived from the Danish NFI (2012-2016) are presented. Nonlinear models with three LiDAR metrics are used to predict V and AGB in forested areas. According to these models, the predicted values of V and AGB in sample plots missed in the field inventory was lower than in those visited in the field; we therefore opted for estimation with multiple (stochastic) imputations. MA estimates for the country suggested a 2% lower level of both V and AGB densities with errors 45% lower than estimated errors in DI results. National MC estimates were close to the DI estimates with an error approximately 40% lower than errors in DI estimates yet 5% greater than the MA estimates of error. Multiple imputations had the strongest impact on DI estimates, but only a weak impact on MA and MC results.

AB The variables of snow cover extent (SCE), snow cover duration (SCD), and snow albedo (SAL) are primary factors determining the surface energy balance and hydrological response of the cryosphere, influencing snow pack and glacier mass-balance, melt, and runoff conditions. This study examines spatiotemporal patterns and trends in SCE, SCD, and SAL (2000-2016; 16 years) for central Chilean and Argentinean Andes using the MODIS MOD10A1 C6 daily snow product. Observed changes in these variables are analyzed in relation to climatic variability by using ground truth observations (meteorological data from the El Yeso Embalse and Valle Nevado weather stations) and the Multivariate El Nino index (MEI) data. We identified significant downward trends in both SCE and SAL, especially during the onset and offset of snow seasons. SCE and SAL showed high inter-annual variability which correlate significantly with MEI applied with a one-month time-lag. SCE and SCD decreased by an average of similar to 13 +/- 2% and 43 +/- 20 days respectively, over the study period. Analysis of spatial pattern of SCE indicates a slightly greater reduction on the eastern side (similar to 14 +/- 2%) of the Andes Cordillera compared to the western side (similar to 12 +/- 3%). The downward SCE, SAL, and SCD trends identified in this study are likely to have adverse impacts on downstream water resource availability to agricultural and densely populated regions in central Chile and Argentina.

AB Reliable representations of global urban extent remain limited, hindering scientific progress across a range of disciplines that study functionality of sustainable cities. We present an efficient and low-cost machine-learning approach for pixel-based image classification of built-up areas at a large geographic scale using Landsat data. Our methodology combines nighttime-lights data and Landsat 8 and overcomes the lack of extensive ground reference data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, which is implemented in Google Earth Engine, through the development of accurate 30 m resolution maps that characterize built-up land cover in three geographically diverse countries: India, Mexico, and the US. Our approach highlights the usefulness of data fusion techniques for studying the built environment and is a first step towards the creation of an accurate global-scale map of urban land cover over time.

AB Mapping irrigated area, frequency, timing, and amount is important for sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid and arid regions. Various studies exist on the mapping of irrigation using remote sensing and census statistics, but they mainly focus on the mapping of irrigation extent without taking frequency and timing into account. In this study, we proposed a new approach to extract irrigation attributes including irrigation extent, frequency and timing using multi-source data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and ancillary data. A time-series dataset with 30-m spatial resolution was generated by fusing 480-m time-series MODIS and Landsat imagery. We used the greenness index (the ratio of NIR and green spectral bands) to detect irrigation events during the first half of the growing season. Rainfall events were assumed as water supplement events along with irrigation events. The number of water supplement stages were then recorded cumulatively when a water supplement event was detected using a threshold-based model. To estimate the possible dates of each water supplement stage, Gaussian process regression and linear regression models were applied. The new framework was applied to the Hexi Corridor in northwestern China, an intensively irrigated region with a semi-arid climate. Results show that the overall accuracy of water supplement stage using the proposed method is 87%. Validation of the number of water supplement stages and possible dates of water supply by GRP model with a "strict" (or "loose") assessment method shows an overall accuracy of 55% (94%) and 59% (89%), respectively. The good accuracy of the additional independent validations for different years and sites demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method, suggesting the general applicability to other regions. Overall, this research demonstrates that the proposed method is promising in detecting irrigation attributes such as frequency and timing which have not been explored in previous research.

AB Hydrologic models of wetlands enable water resources managers to quantify the environmental and societal roles of wetlands and manage them in ways that sustain their valuable services. However, reliable wetland models require data that are not typically available from in-situ measurements. In this article, we use satellite information from MODIS (500-meter, 8-day composite land surface reflectance product) and limited ground data to quantify the seasonal and inter-annual changes of wetland extent. This information is used to calibrate a new, non-parametric land cover classification approach. Extensive tests demonstrate that the new approach performs well in (i) classifying accurately land cover classes and (ii) delineating reliably seasonal and inter-annual wetland area changes. The new approach is applied to the Sudd wetland in South Sudan, a vast wetland of vital socioeconomic and environmental services, toward developing better, policy-relevant information and tools.

AB The ever-increasing volume and accessibility of remote sensing data has spawned many alternative approaches for mapping important environmental features and processes. For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called "stacked generalization" (or "stacking"), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles.

AB We have studied the regolith landform distribution in the area of Gaoua, western Burkina Faso, using an integration of geophysical and remote sensing data. Concentration maps of K, Th, U, as well as their ratios, were computed from airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data to assess the geochemical composition of the regolith. The mineralogy of the surfaces was mapped via the analysis of multispectral ASTER and Landsat scenes. Pauli-decomposition data retrieved from polarimetric ALOS PALSAR and Radarsat-2 images were included to characterize the surface properties of the regolith material. Morphometric variables such as slope, curvature, and relative relief were derived from the SRTM digital elevation model to quantify the topographic parameters of the different regolith landforms. An artificial neural network implementation, ADVANGEO, was then employed to extract four basic regolith landform units from the satellite and airborne data. Relic ferruginous duricrusts rich in hematite and goethite belonging to the High glacis, erosional surfaces represented by rock outcrops and sub outcrops, alluvial sediments, and soft pediment materials of the Middle and Low glacis were mapped successfully in the region. The results were compared with the existing geomorphological maps, an independent visual classification, and field observations. We found that the distribution and shape of the iron-rich duricrusts are more accurate than portrayed in the current maps. The best results, with an overall accuracy of 94.21% and a kappa value of 0.92, were obtained for a dataset consisting of gamma-ray spectrometry data combined with derivatives of the SRTM digital elevation model augmented by Landsat, and polarimetric radar data. The approach demonstrates for the first time the potential of machine learning in regolith landform mapping. The proposed combined analysis of airborne geophysics and remote sensing data can be adopted easily in other regions with similar long-term lateritic weathering histories worldwide.

AB We present two novel earth observation products derived from the BESD and EMMA XCO2 products which were respectively retrieved from SCIAMACHY and GOSAT observations within the GreenHouse Gas project of ESA's Climate Change Initiative (GHG-CCI). These products are inferred by a Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and consist of net and gross biosphere-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide on a global 0.5 degrees grid. As a further dataset provided by the CCI, the burnt area product developed by its Firei project was used in the CCDAS to prescribe the emission component from biomass burning. The new flux products are provided with per-pixel uncertainty ranges. Fluxes with uncertainty ranges can also be provided aggregated in space and time, e.g. over given regions or as annual means. For both, posterior flux fields inferred from BESD and EMMA products, transport model simulations show reasonable agreement with the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration observed at flask sampling stations. This means that the information provided by the terrestrial and transport models, the respective GHG ECV product, the burnt area ECV product, a product of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation used to drive the model, and the atmospheric flask samples is largely consistent.
   The most prominent feature in the posterior net flux is the tropical source of CO2 inferred from both products. But for the EMMA product this release, especially over South America, is with 300 gC/m(2)/year much more pronounced than for BESD. This confirms findings by a recent intercomparison of transport inversions using GOSAT data by Houweling et a). (2015). The reason for the larger net flux is increased heterotrophic respiration. For both products the posterior 2010 sink over Europe (without Russia) is in the range of a recent compilation of European flux estimates by Reuter et al. (2016b). The posterior 2010 uptake of Australia (including Oceania) inferred from the EMMA product is 1.3 +/- 0.2 PgC/year and appears to confirm the high sink also derived from GOSAT by Detrners et al. (2015) over a slightly different period and area. While for some regions (USA, Canada, Europe, Russia, Asia) the one standard deviation uncertainty ranges derived from BESD and EMMA do overlap, for some other regions (Brazil, Africa, Australia) this is not the case. It is not clear yet whether this is due to the uncertainty specifications in the respective products or the handling of uncertainty in the assimilation chain. Assumptions on correlation of observational uncertainty in space and time have a considerable impact on the inferred flux fields (a 60 gC/m(2)/year). The effect of adding an uncertainty that approximates the error in the retrieval system is of similar size.

AB A slowdown in global agricultural expansion, spurred by land limitations, improved technologies, and demand for specific crops has led to increased agricultural intensification. While agricultural expansion has been heavily scrutinized, less attention has been paid to changes within cropland systems. Here we present a method to detect individual cropland field parcels from temporal Landsat imagery to improve cropland estimates and better depict the scale of farming across South America. The methods consist of multi-spectral image edge extraction and multi-scale contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and adaptive thresholding using Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) products. We tested our methods across a South American region with approximately 82% of the 2000/2001 total cropland area, using a Landsat time series composite with a January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2001 timeframe. A thematic accuracy assessment revealed an overall cropland f-score of 91%, while an object-based assessment of 5480 fields showed low geometric errors. The results illustrate that Landsat time series can be used to accurately estimate cropland in South America, and the low geometric errors of the per-parcel estimates highlight the applicability of the proposed methods over a large area. Our approach offers a new technique of analyzing agricultural changes across a broad geographic scale. By using multi-temporal Landsat imagery with a semi-automatic field extraction approach, we can monitor within-agricultural changes at a high degree of accuracy, and advance our understanding of regional agricultural expansion and intensification dynamics across South America.

AB Many applications require soil moisture estimates over large spatial extents (30-300 km) and at fine-resolutions (10-30 m). Remote-sensing methods can provide soil moisture estimates over very large spatial extents (continental to global) at coarse resolutions (10-40 km), but their output must be downscaled to reach fine resolutions. When large spatial extents are considered, the downscaling procedure must consider multiple coarse-resolution grid cells, yet little attention has been given to the treatment of multiple grid cells. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of different methods for addressing multiple coarse grid cells. To accomplish this goal, the Equilibrium Moisture from Topography, Vegetation, and Soil (EMT + VS) downscaling model is generalized to accept multiple coarse grid cells, and two methods for their treatment are implemented and compared. The first method (fixed window) is a direct extension of the original EMT + VS model and downscales each coarse grid cell independently. The second method (shifting window) replaces the coarse grid cell values with values that are calculated from windows that are centered on each fine grid cell. The window values are weighted averages of the coarse grid values within the window extent, and three weighting methods are considered (box, disk, and Gaussian). The methods are applied to three small catchments with detailed soil moisture observations and one large region. The fixed window typically provides more accurate estimates of soil moisture than the shifting window, but it produces abrupt changes in soil moisture at the coarse grid boundaries, which may be problematic for some applications. The three weighting methods produce similar results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Complete and accurate burned area data are needed to document patterns of fires, to quantify relationships between the patterns and drivers of fire occurrence, and to assess the impacts of fires on human and natural systems. Unfortunately, in many areas existing fire occurrence datasets are known to be incomplete. Consequently, the need to systematically collect burned area information has been recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which have both called for the production of essential climate variables (ECVs), including information about burned area. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. The algorithm can be applied anywhere Landsat and training data are available. For this study, BAECV products were generated for the conterminous United States from 1984 through 2015. These products consist of pixel-level burn probabilities for each Landsat scene, in addition to, annual composites including: the maximum burn probability and a burn classification. We compared the BAECV burn classification products to the existing Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED; 1997-2015) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS; 1984-2013) data. We found that the BAECV products mapped 36% more burned area than the GFED and 116% more burned area than MTBS. Differences between the BAECV products and the GFED were especially high in the West and East where the BAECV products mapped 32% and 88% more burned area, respectively. However, the BAECV products found less burned area than the GFED in regions with frequent agricultural fires. Compared to the MTBS data, the BAECV products identified 31% more burned area in the West, 312% more in the Great Plains, and 233% more in the East. Most pixels in the MTBS data were detected by the BAECV, regardless of burn severity. The BAECV products document patterns of fire similar to those in the GFED but also showed patterns of fire that are not well characterized by the existing MTBS data. We anticipate the BAECV products will be useful to studies that seek to understand past patterns of fire occurrence, the drivers that created them, and the impacts fires have on natural and human systems.

AB An algorithm for the retrieval of the aerosol optical depth over land (ADL) using radiances at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) measured by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is proposed. AVHRR is the only satellite sensor providing nearly continuous global coverage since June 1979, which could generate the longest aerosol climate data records currently available from operational satellites. In the implementation of the ADL algorithm, an analytical model is used which couples an atmospheric radiative transfer model and a land surface reflectance parameterization. The radiation field can be separated into three parts: direct radiance, single scattered radiance, and multiple-scattered. Each of these parts is individually parameterized. To obtain the surface reflectance in an automatic retrieval procedure over land for AVHRR, the aerosol scattering effect at 3.75 gm was assumed to be negligible and relationships between the surface reflectances at 0.64 mu m and 3.75 mu m were evaluated for different surface types and the authors propose to use these to obtain the surface reflectance at the shorter wavelength. The 0.64 mu m surface reflectance was then used in a radiative transfer model to compute AOD at that wavelength using six different aerosol types, where optimal estimation (OE) theory is applied to minimize the difference between modeled and measured radiances.
   The ADL algorithm is applied to re-calibrated Level 1B radiances from the AVHRRs on-board the TIROS-N and the Metop-B satellites to retrieve the AOD over North China and Central Europe. The results show that the AOD retrieved from these two instruments are in agreement with co-located AOD values from ground-based reference networks. Over North China, using AERONET sites, 58% of the ADLAOD values are within an expected error (EE) range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 53% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). For GAW-PFR (World Meteorological Organization, WMO, Global Atmosphere Watch, GAW) sites, part of the European ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure) sites, 79% of the ADL AOD values are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 75% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). Not surprisingly, the agreement is better over Europe with generally lower AOD values. An additional cross comparison of the AOD results with MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) DeepBlue aerosol products shows that the spatial distributions of the two AOD datasets are similar, but with generally lower values for ADL and lower coverage. The temporal variation of the annual mean AOD over selected AERONET sites shows that ADL values are generally between 0.2 and 0.5 over North-Eastem China and trace the MODIS and AERONET data for the overlapping years quite well.

AB Megacities have evolved at an unprecedented rate under the pressure of urban population growth and economic development, particularly in the developing countries. For instance, many cities in China are experiencing a large number of rapid but subtle changes resulting from urban infrastructure construction. Information concerning such small changes is imperative for understanding the local environment and human activity, and can also provide key insights for urban planners. Undoubtedly, high-resolution remotely sensed data should play an essential role for the monitoring of such subtle changes, due to the improved observation capacity of the spatial details. However, few studies have investigated high-resolution data for change detection at a large geographic scale, due to the multi-temporal heterogeneity of the data, e.g., spatial mis-registration, parallax distortion for high architectures, and the different viewing angles. In this study, we attempted to fill this gap and resolve these problems by the use of multi-view ZY-3 satellite data, which are used to generate multi-temporal orthographic images through photogrammetric derivation. In the meantime, we present a general framework for precise urban change analysis in a multi-level ( pixel, grid, and city block) approach. Two typical Chinese megacities-Beijing and Wuhan-are chosen in the experiments. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed multi-level method for monitoring subtle urban changes, achieving Kappa coefficients of similar to 0.8 at the pixel level and a correctness of 93-95% at the grid level. The landscape analysis further indicates that the rapid urban construction led to greater fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity of buildings and decreased minimum distance between building patches ( by similar to 1.0 m between 2012 and 2013). Moreover, the performances of ZY-3 and Landsat for the monitoring of subtle urban changes are compared, revealing that the high-resolution sensor-ZY-3 ( 2.5 m)-is essential for precisely detecting subtle urban changes, whereas the Landsat data ( 30 m) are not sensitive to most of the subtle changes that occur in the urban areas.

AB This paper describes the development and validation of a method to accurately identify snow/ice cover, surface melting, land surface and open water in polar regions using polar-orbiting Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar measurements from the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Observation (CALIPSO) mission. The technique is based on the relationship between integrated attenuated backscatter color ratio and integrated depolarization ratio, and is proven to efficiently separate snow/ice cover and surface melting from open water and land surfaces. The method has been applied to 10 years (2006-2016) of CALIOP data to study the seasonal and inter-annual variability of Arctic sea ice cover and its declining trend. Results show that the area fraction of snow cover over land at latitudes >60 degrees N varied between 0.9 during winter and 0.1 in summer. The CALIOP observations of Arctic sea ice cover exhibit a strong seasonal cycle and significant inter-annual variability, which are consistent with the passive microwave-based sea ice results. The >10 years of CALIOP continuous observations of the snow/ice cover will benefit the communities modeling snow/ice melting and climate change. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The CryoSat-2 satellite, primarily dedicated to precise monitoring of the Cryosphere, is demonstrating its capability to provide valuable altimetric data also over the ocean. Here we present the results of a global assessment and validation of the new Geophysical Ocean Product (GOP) distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) since April 2014, focusing on the sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), the significant wave height (SWH), and the wind speed. Our assessment involves only Low Resolution Mode (LRM) and Pseudo LRM (PLRM) data, since full SAR processing is not already operationally implemented in the GOP. The global assessment is conducted on the basis of measurement noise and along-track spectral and crossover analysis, whereas the validation is performed against a variety of in situ observations such as tide gauges, buoys and Argo floats as well as data from the WaveWatch III (WWIII) model. The performance of the GOP is compared to that of Jason-2 and CryoSat-2 data from the Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS). The mean value of the 20-Hz SSHA noise at 2 m SWH is 6.3 cm for LRM and 10.2 cm for PLRM, and the standard deviation of the crossovers is similar to 5.4 cm. The mean 20 HZ SWH noise over the global oceans is 49.4 cm and 69.8 cm, for LRM and PLRM respectively. CryoSat-2 and Jason-2 show almost identical performance when SSHAs are validated against tide gauges, with a median correlation and root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.78 and 7.1 cm for the GOP, 0.76 and 7.3 cm for Jason-2, and 0.79 and 7.8 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. The median correlation with Argo-derived steric heights is 0.68 for the GOP, 0.74 for Jason-2, and 0.67 for CryoSat-2 from RADS. However, the correlation shows a strong latitudinal dependence, with higher values at low latitudes (median value larger than 0.80 in the 10 degrees S-10 degrees N band). The median RMSD between the SSHAs and steric heights is 5.3 cm for the GOP, 4.6 cm for Jason-2, and 5.1 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. The GOP and Jason-2 show also identical performance when SWHs are compared to buoy data, with a slope and RMS error of 0.98 and 15 cm for GOP, 0.97 and 16 cm for Jason-2, and 1.05 and 17 cm for CryoSat-2 from RADS. On the other hand, the GOP wind speed exhibits a bias of about 2 m/s relative to both Jason-2 and to buoy data. Differences between the GOP and WWIII SWH are smaller than 20% of the SWH almost everywhere. In summary the GOP products are fit for oceanographic applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The impact of human activities via land use/cover changes on NDVI trends is critical for an improved understanding of satellite-observed changes in vegetation productivity in drylands. The dominance of positive NDVI trends in the Sahel, the so-called re-greening, is sometimes interpreted as a combined effect of an increase in rainfall and cropland expansion or agricultural intensification. Yet, the impact of changes in land use has yet to be thoroughly tested and supported by empirical evidence. At present, no studies have considered the importance of the different seasonal NDVI signals of cropped and fallowed fields when interpreting NDVI trends, as both field types are commonly merged into a single 'cropland' class. We make use of the distinctly different phonology of cropped and fallowed fields and use seasonal NDVI curves to separate these two field types. A fuzzy classifier is applied to quantify cropped and fallowed areas in a case study region in the southern Sahel (Fakara, Niger) on a yearly basis between 2000 and 2014. We find that fallowed fields have a consistently higher NDVI than unmanured cropped fields and by using two seasonal NDVI metrics (the amplitude and the decreasing rate) derived from the MODIS time series, a clear separation between classes of fields is achieved (r = 0.77). The fuzzy classifier can compute the percentage of a pixel (250 m) under active cultivation, thereby alleviating the problem of small field sizes in the region. We find a predominant decrease in NDVI over the period of analysis associated with an increased area of cropped fields at the expense of fallowed fields. Our findings couple cropping abandonment (more frequent fallow years) with positive NDVI trends and an increase in the percentage of the cropped area (fallow period shortening) with negative trends. These findings profoundly impact our understanding of greening and browning trends in agrarian Sahelian drylands and in other drylands of developing countries characterized by limited use of fertilizers.

AB How organisms respond to climate change during the winter depends on snow cover, because the subnivium (the insulated and thermally stable area between snowpack and frozen ground) provides a refuge for plants, animals, and microbes. Satellite data characterizing either freeze/thaw cycles or snow cover are both available, but these two types of data have not yet been combined to map the subnivium. Here, we characterized global patterns of frozen ground with and without snow cover to provide a baseline to assess the effects of future winter climate change on organisms that depend on the subnivium. We analyzed two remote sensing datasets: the MODIS Snow Cover product and the NASA MEaSUREs Global Record of Daily Landscape Freeze/fhaw Status dataset derived from SSM/I and SSMIS. From these we developed a new 500-m resolution dataset that captures global patterns of the duration of snow-covered ground (D-ws) and the duration of snow-free frozen ground (D-wos) from 2000 to 2012. We also quantified how D-ws and D-wos, vary with latitude. Our results show that both mean and interannual variation in D-ws and D-wos change with latitude and topography. Mean D-ws increases with latitude. Counter-intuitively though, D-wos has longest duration at about 33 degrees N, decreasing both northward and southward, even though the duration of frozen ground (either snow covered or not) was shorter than that at higher latitudes. This occurs because snow cover in mid-latitudes is low and ephemeral, leaving longer periods of frozen, snow-free ground. Interannual variation in D-ws increased with latitude, but the slopes of this relationship differed among North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, our results show that, for organisms that rely on the subnivium to survive the winter, mid-latitude areas could be functionally colder than either higher or lower latitudes. Furthermore, because interannual variation in D-wos is greater at high latitudes, we would expect organisms there to be adapted to unpredictability in exposure to freezing. Ultimately, the effects of climate change on organisms during winter should be considered in the context of the subnivium, when warming could make more northerly areas functionally colder in winter, and changes in annual variation in the duration of snow-free but frozen conditions could lead to greater unpredictability in the onset and end of winter.

AB Image classification for thematic mapping is a very common application in remote sensing, which is sometimes realized through object-based image analysis. In these analyses, it is common for some of the objects to be mixed in their class composition and thus violate the commonly made assumption of object purity that is implicit in a conventional object-based image analysis. Mixed objects can be a problem throughout a classification analysis, but are particularly challenging in the training stage as they can result in degraded training statistics and act to reduce mapping accuracy. In this paper the potential of using mixed objects in training object-based image classifications is evaluated. Remotely sensed data were submitted to a series of segmentation analyses from which a range of under- to over-segmented outputs were intentionally produced. Training objects were then selected from the segmentation outputs, resulting in training data sets that varied in terms of size (i.e. number of objects) and proportion of mixed objects. These training data sets were then used with an artificial neural network and a generalized linear model, which can accommodate objects of mixed composition, to produce a series of land cover maps. The use of training statistics estimated based on both pure and mixed objects often increased classification accuracy by around 25% when compared with accuracies obtained from the use of only pure objects in training. So rather than the mixed objects being a problem, they can be an asset in classification and facilitate land cover mapping from remote sensing. It is, therefore, desirable to recognize the nature of the objects and possibly accommodate mixed objects directly in training. The results obtained here may also have implications for the common practice of seeking an optimal segmentation output, and also act to challenge the widespread view that object-based classification is superior to pixel-based classification.

AB Trends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite-derived data over Europe (1983-2010) are first presented. The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2 W m(-2) per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference between ground based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983-2010, with higher rates of around 2 W m(-2) per decade over central and eastern Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.

AB Although ground-level measurement of PM2.5 is relatively accurate, this method is limited in spatial and temporal coverage due to the high costs. Recently, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), with high-resolution and wide spatial-temporal coverage has been increasingly applied to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. However, these AOD-based PM2.5 concentrations were spontaneously estimated using the structure fixed models across an entire study period. While these 'structure fixed' simplifications greatly facilitated the efficiency of model developments and enhanced their generalizability, they ignored the fact that the 'contributors' of PM2.5 variation are not always coherent with time. For this, we propose a timely structure adaptive modeling (TSAM) method for satellite based ground PM2.5 estimation in this study by considering the timely variations of modeling predictors and magnitude of predictors at respective optimal spatial scales. Meanwhile, the reliability of TSAM for estimating national scale daily PM2.5 concentrations was tested by employing the AOD data from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014 over China with other multi-source auxiliary data such as meteorological factors, land use etc. While the fitting degree (R-2) of the daily TSAM models is 0.82, the one in 10-fold validation is 0.80, which are relatively higher than previous studies. These results are significantly better than those from structure-fixed models in this study. Additionally, the TSAM simulated PM2.5 concentrations show that the national annual PM2.5 concentration in China during study period is 69.71 mu g/m(3) with significant seasonal changes. These concentrations exceed the Level 2 of CNAAQS in more than 70% Chinese territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that the TSAM is a promising PM2.5 modeling method that is superior to structure-fixed modeling and could be very useful for air pollution mapping over large geographic areas.

AB Fungi are crucial to forest ecosystem function and provide important provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services. As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to forest bio-geochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated with single tree detection, with variables derived from field inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar derived variables performed better than variables derived from field measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong, guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom.

AB Fire is an increasingly important agent of forest degradation in the Amazon, but little attention has been given to the susceptibility of seasonally flooded forests to fire. Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess pre-fire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10% for upland forest but was 71% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI < 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires. This must be considered in assessments of future Amazon fire risks and impacts, including flood forest acting as a potential conduit for spreading fire to upland forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, soil moisture retrievals of surface soil moisture was investigated using L-band brightness temperature under diverse conditions and land cover types. The study focused on the PALS (Passive Active L-band System) radiometer data collected during the SMAPVEXI2 (Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012) field experiment which took place in southern Manitoba, Canada in 2012. The experiment domain covers croplands with high clay content as well as croplands and grasslands with sandy soils. A retrieval algorithm was parameterized for these specific land types. The formulation of the retrieval algorithm is based on a traditional surface scattering assumption. Based on this data set we found that for the clayey croplands the surface scattering assumption is inadequate, and that the algorithm needed significant tuning for the sandy soils. Empirically-based parameters for retrieving soil moisture under these conditions were developed. We also applied the parameterized algorithm to the retrieval of soil moisture for the entire experiment domain. We found that the use of sub grid modeling improves the retrieval performance to a satisfactory level despite the challenging land types encountered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation of chlorophyll concentration in the marine biosphere has been the central topic of ocean color remote sensing since its advent. While various algorithms were proposed in the literature so far and tested for oceanic waters of diverse constituent composition, an independent algorithm evaluation is needed for local ocean waters that have dynamic variation in optically active water constituents such as colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). This paper evaluates the performance of chlorophyll algorithms for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) radiometric data, using in situ measurements collected at 491 stations around Korea Peninsula during 2010-2014 from which there were 130 match-ups with GOCI data. For the evaluation in areas with high variation in SPM, water samples were first classified into three levels of SPM, and then the coefficients of candidate algorithms were newly derived for the turbidity cases using the in situ and GOCI remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data. Functional forms of traditional band ratio algorithms (e.g. OC algorithms (O'Reilly et al., 1998) and Tassan's algorithm (Tassan, 1994)), fluorescence line height algorithm, and near-infrared-to-red band ratio approach were tested. The evaluation results for the coincident in situ pairs of R-rs and chlorophyll measurements showed that the mean uncertainty was <35% with the correlation around 0.8 by using the 00 with turbidity consideration (OCT) and Tassan's algorithm with turbidity dependent coefficients (Tassan-TD). For the GOCI match-ups, the mean uncertainty for all turbidity levels was around 35% with correlation around 0.65, when OCT and Tassan-TD were used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In Sub-Saharan Africa rapid urban growth combined with rising poverty is creating diverse urban environments, the nature of which are not adequately captured by a simple urban-rural dichotomy. This paper proposes an alternative classification scheme for urban mapping based on a gradient approach for the southern portion of the West African country of Ghana. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are used to generate a pattern based definition of the urban context. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is used to classify a Landsat scene into Built, Vegetation and Other land covers. Landscape metrics are estimated for Built and Vegetation land covers for a 450 m uniform grid covering the study area. A measure of texture is extracted from the SAR imagery and classified as Built/Non-built. SMA based measures of Built and Vegetation fragmentation are combined with SAR texture based Built/Non-built maps through a decision tree classifier to generate a nine class urban context map capturing the transition from unsettled land at one end of the gradient to the compact urban core at the other end. Training and testing of the decision tree classifier was done using very high spatial resolution reference imagery from Google Earth. An overall classification agreement of 77% was determined for the nine-class urban context map, with user's accuracy (commission errors) being lower than producer's accuracy (omission errors). Nine urban contexts were classified and then compared with data from the 2000 Census of Ghana. Results suggest that the urban classes appropriately differentiate areas along the urban gradient.

AB Satellite-based monitoring strategies for permafrost remain under development and are not yet operational. Remote sensing allows indirect observation of permafrost, a subsurface phenomenon, by mapping surface features or measuring physical parameters that can be used for permafrost modeling. We have explored high temporal resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence for the period between August 2012 and September 2013 to assess their potential for detecting major seasonal changes to the land surface in a variety of tundra environments within the Lena River Delta, Siberia. The TerraSAR-X signal is believed to be strongly affected by the vegetation layer, and its viability for the retrieval of soil moisture, for example, is therefore limited. In our study individual events, such as rain and snow showers, that occurred at the time of TerraSAR-X acquisition, or a refrozen crust on the snowpack during the spring melt were detected based on back scatter intensity signatures. The interferometric coherence showed marked variability; the snow cover onset and snow melt periods were identified by significant reduction in coherence. Principal component analysis provided a good spatial overview of the essential information contained in backscatter and coherence time series and revealed latent relationships between both time series and the surface temperature.
   The results of these investigations suggest that although X-band SAR has limitations with respect to monitoring seasonal land surface changes in permafrost areas, high-resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter and coherence can provide new insights into environmental conditions.

AB River ice plays an important role in the physical, biological, and human systems in northern regions. Due to the large extent and poor accessibility of many river systems, remote sensing techniques are a potential tool for collecting information and analyzing characteristics of river ice covers. Optical data with high temporal resolution (e.g. MODIS products) are suitable for monitoring river ice phenology and mapping river ice cover extent, while radar data (e.g. RADARSAT-2 imagery) offer an optimal approach to characterizing river ice thickness, ice types and seasonal changes of ice-cover characteristics. An integrated automated approach, utilizing remotely sensed data from both active and passive sensors, was developed and applied to characterize river ice processes along the Slave River, Northwest Territories, Canada. The results show that the analysis of MODIS band 2 (841-876 nm) time series can detect the date of river ice freeze onset (FO) and water clear of ice (WCI) with a deviation of up to 12 days and 3 days, respectively. The rate of river ice breakup is much faster than the rate of river freezeup. The profiles of MODIS band 2 reflectance data along the river, however, showed insignificant differences between different breakup stages and ice types, making it challenging to map breakup ice types. In this case, RADARSAT-2 imagery can be used successfully to characterize and map four classes of water and ice covers during the breakup period, including intact ice, smooth rubble ice, rough rubble ice and open water. In association with hydrometeorological parameters, the thermal deterioration of the ice cover during breakup appears to be the primary breakup event in the Slave River. The results obtained from the analysis of MODIS and RADARSAT-2 data were compared with ground measurements of weather, flow and ice conditions (2000-2015), time-lapse photos and aerial surveys (2013-2015) along the Slave River, and show strong agreement.

AB Arctic permafrost landscapes are among the most vulnerable and dynamic landscapes globally, but due to their extent and remoteness most of the landscape changes remain unnoticed. In order to detect disturbances in these areas we developed an automated processing chain for the calculation and analysis of robust trends of key land surface indicators based on the full record of available Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI data. The methodology was applied to the similar to 29,000 km(2) Lena Delta in Northeast Siberia, where robust trend parameters (slope, confidence intervals of the slope, and intercept) were calculated for Tasseled Cap Greenness, Wetness and Brightness, NDVI, and NDWI, and NDMI based on 204 Landsat scenes for the observation period between 1999 and 2014. The resulting datasets revealed regional greening trends within the Lena Delta with several localized hot-spots of change, particularly in the vicinity of the main river channels. With a 30-m spatial resolution various permafrost-thaw related processes and disturbances, such as thermokarst lake expansion and drainage, fluvial erosion, and coastal changes were detected within the Lena Delta region, many of which have not been noticed or described before. Such hotspots of permafrost change exhibit significantly different trend parameters compared to non-disturbed areas. The processed dataset, which is made freely available through the data archive PANGAEA, will be a useful resource for further process specific analysis by researchers and land managers. With the high level of automation and the use of the freely available Landsat archive data, the workflow is scalable and transferrable to other regions, which should enable the comparison of land surface changes in different permafrost affected regions and help to understand and quantify permafrost landscape dynamics.

AB The potential of retrieving the bottom layer snow density and soil permittivity under dry snow cover conditions from L-band passive microwave observations was analyzed using multi-angular brightness temperatures measured at horizontal and vertical polarization over two test sites in northern Finland. The near-continuous time series of L-band brightness temperatures covers a total of six winter seasons, over both dry mineral soil in a forest clearing, and organic soil over a wetland site. Detailed measurements of snow and soil conditions are available from both sites. Complementing a previous theoretical study, we show that dry snow cover influences the observed L-band brightness temperatures as a result of both impedance matching and changes in the refraction angle at the snow-soil interface. Exploiting these effects, we demonstrate the retrieval of the bottom layer snow density and the influence of dry snow cover on simultaneously retrieved soil permittivity a consideration which is currently not accounted for in Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) retrievals of soil permittivity in the presence of dry snow. Depending on season, the mean bias error between retrieved and in situ snow density measured in the lower snow layers was between 6 kg m(-3) and 15 kg m(-3) for the forest clearing site, and between 37 kg m(-3) and 90 kg m(-3) for the wetland site, demonstrating the feasibility of the retrieval approach at the plot scale. In winter conditions, the ground permittivity retrieved without considering the impact of dry snow on L-band emission was, on average, 35% lower for both test sites, which indicates possible errors in current SMOS ground permittivity retrievals under dry snow conditions. The application of SMOS data to simultaneously retrieve dry snow density and ground permittivity is a complex task due to heterogeneous land cover and snow/soil conditions within SMOS pixels (approximate to 45 km resolution). An approach that considers land cover variations and the spatial variability of snow cover is required to fully determine the feasibility of the methodology to aid e.g. improving estimates snow water equivalent from other sensors, and to take into account effects of dry snow in SMOS-based retrievals of ground permittivities. The results should also be applicable to other L-band sensors in space, such as the recently launched NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal stability of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) vs field-measured leaf CO2 assimilation (A) was assessed over a period of 2 years by means of airborne flights performed at midday and diurnally over a citrus (evergreen) crop canopy. The orchard was cultivated under a control treatment (ET) that received 100% of its water requirements and two regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatments with water supply reduced to 37% and 50% of the control level during the summer. Field measurements consisted of assimilation rate, stomata( conductance, stem water potential, leaf fluorescence and leaf reflectance. The airborne campaigns took place in 2012 and 2013, and were flown on the solar plane in order to acquire hyperspectral imagery at 40 cm resolution, 260 spectral bands and 1.85 nm/pixels in the 400-885 nm spectral region. A thermal camera was installed in tandem in all flights, acquiring imagery in the 7.5-13 mu m spectral region at 640 x 480 pixel resolution, yielding a 50 cm pixel size. The robustness of the SIF quantification through the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle based on three spectral bands (FLD3), as well as the performance of physiological and structural hyperspectral indices, was evaluated in order to understand their ability to track photosynthesis at different phenological and stress stages throughout the season. Solar induced fluorescence quantified as FLD3 was the most robust indicator of photosynthesis in all the airborne campaigns performed in the course of the two-year experiment, which comprised seven midday flights and two diurnals. The relationships between fluorescence (FLD3) and assimilation rates yielded correlation coefficients (R) between 0.64 and 0.82 across all dates, these being statistically significant with p-values between p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001. Fluorescence retrievals performed better than structural and physiological indices, with the structural MTVI1 index being the only other statistically significant indicator throughout the season, although it yielded lower levels of significance than FLD3. A normalization strategy proposed for SIF FLD3 for all dates using control (ET) trees on each flight date as a reference permitted the generation of a single relationship between FLD3 normalized (FLDn) and assimilation rates for the entire year, both at tree (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.0001) and treatment level (r(2) = 0.72; p < 0.0001), a strategy that confirmed the ability of seasonal SIF retrievals to track photosynthesis from broader resolution hyperspectral imagery (i.e. spectral resolution 1-5 nm full-width at half maximum (FWHM)) for applications in the context of precision agriculture and crop-monitoring studies.

AB Assigning uncertainty to ocean-color satellite products is a requirement to allow informed use of these data. Here, uncertainty estimates are derived using the comparison on a 12th-degree grid of coincident daily records of the remote-sensing reflectance R-RS obtained with the same processing chain from three satellite missions, MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. The approach is spatially resolved and produces sigma, the part of the R-RS uncertainty budget associated with random effects. The global average of sigma decreases with wavelength from approximately 0.7-0.910(-3) sr(-1) at 412 nm to 0.05-0.1 10(-3) sr(-1) at the red band, with uncertainties on sigma evaluated as 20-30% between 412 and 555 nm, and 30-40% at 670 nm. The distribution of sigma shows a restricted spatial variability and small variations with season, which makes the multi-annual global distribution of sigma-an estimate applicable to all retrievals of the considered missions. The comparison of sigma with other uncertainty estimates derived from field data or with the support of algorithms provides a consistent picture. When translated in relative terms, and assuming a relatively low bias, the distribution of sigma suggests that the objective of a 5% uncertainty is fulfilled between 412 and 490 nm for oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll-a concentration below 0.1 mg m(-3)). This study also provides comparison statistics. Spectrally, the mean absolute relative difference between R-RS from different missions shows a characteristic U-shape with both ends at blue and red wavelengths inversely related to the amplitude of R-RS. On average and for the considered data sets, SeaWiFS R-RS tend to be slightly higher than MODIS R-RS, which in turn appear higher than MERIS R-RS. Biases between mission-specific R-RS may exhibit a seasonal dependence, particularly in the subtropical belt. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The dynamics of rock glaciers in marginal periglacial environments are poorly understood, especially in Eastern Europe where the enhanced continentality produces a distinct pattern of periglacial phenomena. Multi-temporal image analysis of high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery of the Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania revealed the small dynamic nature and a slow geomorphologic evolution of rock glaciers over a 46-yr period of record (1968-2014). Nine rock glaciers located in glacial cirques and troughs within the central area of Retezat Mountain were included in this study. Overall, the estimated displacement rates are extremely low (i.e., a few cm/year) compared with other active rock glaciers from all over the world. Despite their relative attenuated activity, it appears that Judele, Valea Rea, and Pietrele are still active rock glaciers, but in an evident disequilibrium/imbalance with the actual climate. These findings document the lowest altitude and easternmost active rock glaciers at this latitude from Europe. Quantitative investigations were concentrated on Pietrele rock glacier, subject of recent field campaigns. Optical data analysis indicated a slight acceleration of the horizontal velocities at the surface of Pietrele rock glacier in recent years. This acceleration appears to be caused by an increase in the temperature of permafrost, resulting from an evident warming of external air temperature. Radar data analysis suggested seasonal variability of surface motion, with higher deformation in autumn, whereas in early summer or spring the deformation is negligible. Overall, the results obtained with cross-correlation analysis, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence analysis, and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) multitemporal interferometry, are consistent, displaying similar deformation patterns with the highest creep rates located in the southern and western portions of the glacier. These findings are supported by thermal and geophysical measurements, which suggest the probable presence of permafrost within these areas. The observed displacements were interpreted as permafrost creep, and their very low velocity rates suggest the deforming frozen layers are very thin. These results provide (i) baseline information and decadal-scale trends and a (ii) strategy for future monitoring of the health and integrity of the rock glacier environment in the Carpathian Mountains.

AB The increasing development pressures from urbanization, aquaculture and tourism on worldwide coastal environments and the ecosystem services that mangroves provide make it essential to monitor and manage these environments more effectively. Measuring and monitoring mangrove structure through variables like Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential part of this action. This study investigated the effects of different mangrove environmental settings, satellite image spatial resolutions, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and mapping approaches for LAI estimation. We compared and contrasted the ability of WorldView-2 (WV-2), ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) and Landsat TM (TM) image data (2 m, 10 m and 30 m pixel sizes, respectively), to estimate LAI through regression analysis at sites in Moreton Bay (Australia) and Karimunjawa Island (Indonesia). We also investigated the effect of different pixel averaging windows (3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 pixels) and multi-resolution segmentation scale parameters (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) applied to the WV-2 image for LAI estimation. The results showed that LAI estimation using remote sensing data varies across sites and sensors. Estimation of LAI in this study was influenced by the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.50 to 0.83 across different sensors (TM, AVNIR-2, WV-2), segmentation scales (10, 20,30, 40, 50) and SVIs (SR, NDVI, SAVI, EVI). The sensor and SVIs assessment identified the ALOS AVNIR-2 and NDVI as the optimal estimators of LAI, with R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.54 for Moreton Bay, and R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.31 for Karimunjawa Island. The optimum image pixel size for estimating LAI was related to the average canopy size (about 10 m in diameter) and the field sampling size (10 m). Image segmentation significantly increased the LAI estimation accuracy by approximately 14% for both sites. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the relationship between image spatial resolution, field sampling size and spatial variation of mangrove vegetation for estimating LAI. These findings can be potentially used as a guide for selecting the optimum imagery for LAI estimation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing technologies are some of the most powerful tools for atmospheric monitoring of natural or anthropogenic ecosystems. Extensive developments were observed in the two last decades concerning both satellite, airborne, on-board and ground systems. The present paper focuses on an advanced 3D reconstruction of a gas cloud detected in the atmosphere of an urban area using a scanning infrared (IR) gas system (SIGIS2, Bruker). Several measurements were carried out from 3 different positions in order to monitor an atmospheric volume around 10(8) m(3). The images generated by the imaging remote sensing system correspond to the 2-D projections of the 3-D gas cloud. All the 2-D data are fully georeferenced (x, y, z and t). Each pixel of the 2-D images is associated to an IR spectrum, which was approximated to a linear combination of reference spectra and expressed as a coefficient of correlation (0 to 1). Data with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.75 are selected for 3-D modeling. The method for 3-D reconstruction of gas clouds is based on the combination and relocation of all the oriented and georeferenced measurement data. The 3-D gas cloud is determined from the 2-D images in the volume of interest processing a 3-D interpolation using the gOcad (R) DSI procedure. This integrated approach was applied to a local case study in an urban area. It leads to the identification and the spatial demarcation of a cloud of SO2 with a total volume of 65 x 10(6) m(3). The existence of this pollutant may be related to the presence of ancient underground tanks of gasoline, leaking because of a defect of waterproofness. Another source of SO2 can be the emission of gases stemming from diesel machines used for important public works in this urban area. This study demonstrates that the combination of scanning imaging IR spectroscopy with the measurement setup and the 3-D gOcad (R) processing can be used as a generic approach for 3-D reconstruction of gas clouds applied to any kind of ground emissive sites.

AB Most methods for assessing the loading of particles on plant leaf surfaces involve a cumbersome manual step, and hence are slow to employ. Furthermore, they yield results that are summative, representing total number of particles or total volume or weight of particles in standardized size fractions. Here, we present a novel approach that cannot only accurately quantify the number of particles, but also their size and shape. In addition, the method we present replaces the manual measurement of the particles on leaf surfaces with an automated step. We applied the well-developed object-based image analysis technique to scanning electronic microscope (SEM) micrographs of tree leaf, and tested this approach for replicate SEM micrographs of a common urban tree species. We demonstrated that: 1) this new method automatically identifies the number of particles, as well as their size and shape, in contrast to the commonly used microscopic inspection approach that can only measure the number of particles; and 2) this method achieved similar overall accuracy to that of microscopic inspection (92.17% versus 95.53%), but microscopic inspection takes fourteen times longer. It is expected that the difference in efficiency would be more significant with the increase of micrograph numbers, because micrographs can be batch processed with object-based classification. With the greatly increased efficiency and the ability of the proposed method to capture new variables about particle shape and complexity, this method can facilitate comparative research on the adsorption capacities of different plant species, and potentially identifying the source apportionment of particulate matters based on their morphological characteristics, which may provide insights for species selection for pollutant reduction.

AB This study aimed at developing a geobotanical remote sensing method to explore mineral deposits in areas covered by thick vegetation. For this, a new vegetation index (VI) is proposed using reflectance data from five bands in the visible green to shortwave infrared region. This index is called VIGS (Vegetation Index considering Greenness and Shortwave infrared), developed so that the VI can accurately detect vegetation stress caused by metal contamination of soils. A set of laboratory experiments was conducted to demonstrate the capability of VIGS, which investigates change in reflectance spectra based on the concentration of four selected metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in soils. The results show that VIGS values are more sensitive to vegetation stress than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and can amplify the stress difference, depending on soil metal contents. The VIGS is further examined for a mineralized area containing hydrothermal copper deposits in Jambi, central Sumatra, Indonesia, for which a set of geochemical data of the top layer composed of weathered rocks and soils were systematically obtained. Through kriging of point content data, the spatial distributions of Cu, Pb, and Zn in soil are found to be strongly correlated with the geology and controlled by faults. Using one Landsat ETM + scene image after atmospheric correction, VIGS values are calculated by a combination of reflectances in bands 2, 3,4, 5, and 7. The effectiveness of VIGS is proven by this case study, because VIGS anomalies appeared in high-content zones common to the three metals. This concordance probably originated from the fact that plant formations (mainly primary forest) in the high metal zones are closely related to the geological units. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Automated cloud and cloud shadow identification algorithms designed for Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images have greatly expanded the use of these Earth observation data by providing a means of including only clear-view pixels in image analysis and efficient cloud-free compositing. In an effort to extend these capabilities to Landsat Multispectal Scanner (MSS) imagery, we introduce MSS clear-view-mask (MSScvm), an automated cloud and shadow identification algorithm for MSS imagery. The algorithm is specific to the unique spectral characteristics of MSS data, relying on a simple, rule-based approach. Clouds are identified based on green band brightness and the normalized difference between the green and red bands, while cloud shadows are identified by near infrared band darkness and cloud projection. A digital elevation model is incorporated to correct for topography-induced illumination variation and aid in identifying water. Based on an accuracy assessment of 1981 points stratified by land cover and algorithm mask class for 12 images throughout the United States, MSScvm achieved an overall accuracy of 84.0%. Omission of thin clouds and bright cloud shadows constituted much of the error. Perennial ice and snow, misidentified as cloud, also contributed disproportionally to algorithm error. Comparison against a corresponding assessment of the Fmask algorithm, applied to coincident TM imagery, showed similar error patterns and a general reduction in accuracy commensurate with differences in the radiometric and spectral richness of the two sensors. MSScvm provides a suitable automated method for creating cloud and cloud shadow masks for MSS imagery required for time series analyses in temperate ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The foreland fold-and-thrust belt of northern Pakistan is located at the western end of the Himalayan arc, where salt tectonics is responsible for structural styles, hydrocarbon source areas and seismicity. Three sub-regions of fold-and-thrust belt are the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range, Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin-Khisor Range. The difference in deformation intensity between these regions is mainly attributed to the presence, or absence, of an Infra-Cambrian salt layer. This study investigates the active tectonics of the Potwar Plateau and Salt Range region, emphasizing the role of salt, using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometry (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. Ten PALSAR images and four seismic profiles from western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range region were used. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of around 10 mm/year. Two uplift anomalies were observed, which were interpreted as zones of transpression and salt diapirism. Time-migrated seismic profiles show that the salt layer acts as a detachment. Our results show that salt has different roles in different regions of the fold-and-thrust belt; in the Potwar Plateau region the salt layer acts as a detachment, while in Salt Range salt flow-induced structures are prominent. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation reveals that the deformation of western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is influenced by two main faults, the dextral Kalabagh fault and the Main Frontal Thrust. Finally, this work was compared to the Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt in western China due to their structural similarities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The results of a map accuracy assessment are often summarized by reporting user's accuracy and producer's accuracy for each class in the map legend. Additionally estimating the proportion of area of each class based on the best assessment of ground condition (i.e., the reference classification) of the locations selected in the sample is often of interest for monitoring status and change in land cover. Stratified random sampling is a commonly used sampling design for accuracy assessment, and an important decision for this design is the allocation of sample size to the strata. In this article, the allocation that minimizes the sum of the variances of the estimators of user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and area of a single targeted class for a fixed total sample size is derived for stratified random sampling. For example, the targeted class might be a rare land-cover type such as wetland or in the case of a land-cover change assessment forest loss. An Excel sample allocation calculator implements the optimization and two examples illustrate the application. Practitioners can apply these optimization results to guide sample size allocation decisions when using a stratified random sampling design for accuracy assessment and area estimation.

AB Multi-method ensembles are generally believed to return more reliable results than the application of one method alone. Here, we test if for the quantification of leaf traits an ensemble of regression models, consisting of Partial Least Squares (PLSR), Random Forest (RFR), and Support Vector Machine regression (SVMR) models, is able to improve the robustness of the spectral band selection process compared to the outcome of a single technique alone. The ensemble approach was tested using one artificial and five measured data sets of leaf level spectra and corresponding information on leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water content. PLSR models optimized for the goodness of fit, an established approach for band selection, were used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble. Although the fits of the models within the ensemble were poorer than the fits achieved with the reference approach, the ensemble was able to provide a band selection with higher consistency across all data sets. Due to the selection characteristics of the methods within the ensemble, the ensemble selection is moderately narrow and restrictive but in good agreement with known absorption features published in literature. We conclude that analyzing the range of agreement of different model types is an efficient way to select a robust set of spectral bands related to the foliar properties under investigation. This may help to deepen our understanding of the spectral response of biochemical and biophysical traits in foliage and canopies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) 1st-Water (GCOM-W1) satellite, equipped with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), was launched on May 18, 2012, by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and began observing on July 3, 2012. In this study, we evaluated the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind speed (SSW) data from the AMSR2 (ver. 1) standard product, provided by JAXA, by comparison with mooring buoy data or global products. From a comparison of the AMSR2 and Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TRITON) data, mean differences of 0.21 degrees C and 030 m/s, and root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.49 degrees C and 125 m/s, were inferred for SST and SSW, respectively. During daytime low wind-speed conditions, SSTs from AMSR2 are significantly higher than from TRITON. This implies that SSTs from AMSR2 are strongly affected by diurnal heating. From an intercomparison of global products for the Southern Ocean, the annual-mean SSW from AMSR2 is as much as 1 m/s lower than values from other SSW products. Although the SSW data from AMSR2 have a similar accuracy to data from other products, the AMSR2 data have the advantage of fewer missing data compared with other products. Furthermore, we checked for significant differences in annual means by comparing data from WindSat, AMSR2, and AMSR for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) provided by JAXA. For the Southern Ocean, we found remarkable differences in the annual-mean values of SST and SSW. SSTs from AMSR2 are lower than from WindSat in regions of strong current in the Northern Hemisphere, and SSTs from AMSR-E JAXA are higher than from WindSat in the same regions. However, the results also suggest a risk of artificial trends in the satellite data if AMSR2, AMSR-E JAXA, and WindSat data are used continuously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A variety of vicarious calibration methods over different reference targets have been studied at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admission (NOAA)/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to provide sensor degradation information for the GOES Imager visible channels which do not have any on-board calibration devices. To meet the increasing demand for more accurate satellite measurements, an integrated method is developed mainly to improve the relative calibration accuracy by combining the results from different vicarious methods. In this study, three commonly used vicarious calibration methods, the desert, Deep Convective Cloud (DCC) and ray-matching methods, are applied to the GOES-12 Imager visible data to describe the integrated method. The integrated method first combines the normalized observations of each individual method by anchoring the results on the first day of satellite operation, and then removes the deviated combined observations using a recursive filtering method. This integration is based on the fact that the GOES sensor trending functions from different methods are limy similar within 1% difference over the 7-year study period. The trending uncertainty of the integrated method is less than that of each individual one. The absolute calibration of the integrated method can be achieved by generating the calibration coefficients using the reflectance of reference targets which are well characterized with the Aqua MODIS Collection 6 (C6) data. It is found that there is less than 1% difference between the calibration coefficients derived with the DCC and desert reference targets. It is expected that this integrated method will be a useful tool to validate the GOES-R ABI on-board radiometric calibration accuracy for the solar reflective channels.

AB The spatial and temporal patterns of the forest background reflectance are critically important for retrieving the biophysical parameters of the forest canopy (overstory) and for ecosystem modeling. In this short communication paper, we retrieved the seasonal courses of understoty Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS BRDF data using the semi-empirical and physically-based approach. We compared the satellite-based understory NDVI series to seasonal courses of understory NDVI measured in the forests for three full growing seasons in boreal and hemiboreal sites in Northern Europe. Our results indicated both semi-empirical and physically-based approaches using MODIS BRDF data do have a potential to track seasonal changes in understory NDVI. Differences in the performance between of the two retrieval methods can be expected within the boreal zone depending on the level of forest fragmentation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB In urban areas, leaf area index (LAI) is a key ecosystem structural attribute with implications for energy and water balance, gas exchange, and anthropogenic energy use. In this study, we estimated LAI spatially using airborne lidar in downtown Santa Barbara, California, USA. We implemented two different modeling approaches. First, we directly estimated effective LAI (LAIe) using scan angle- and clump-corrected lidar laser penetration metrics (LPM). Second, we adapted existing allometric equations to estimate crown structural metrics including tree height and crown base height using lidar. The latter approach allowed for LAI estimates at the individual tree-crown scale. The LPM method, at both high and decimated point densities, resulted in good linear agreement with estimates from ground-based hemispherical photography (r(2) = 0.82, y = 0.99x) using a model that assumed a spherical leaf angle distribution. Within individual tree crown segments, the lidar estimates of crown structure closely paralleled field measurements (e.g., r(2) = 0.87 for crown length). LAI estimates based on the lidar crown measurements corresponded well with estimates from field measurements (r(2) = 0.84, y = 0.97x + 0.10). Consistency of the LPM and allometric lidar methods was also strong at 71 validation plots (r(2) = 0.88) and at 450 additional sample locations across the entire study area (r(2) = 0.72). This level of correspondence exceeded that of the canopy hemispherical photography and allometric, ground-based estimates (r(2) = 0.53). The first-order alignment of these two disparate methods may indicate that the error bounds for mapping LAI in cities are small enough to pursue large scale, spatially explicit estimation.

AB Satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) can be used for mapping biogeochemically relevant variables, such as the chlorophyll concentration and the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) of the water, at global scale for use in climate-change studies. Prior to generating such products, suitable algorithms have to be selected that are appropriate for the purpose. Algorithm selection needs to account for both qualitative and quantitative requirements. In this paper we develop an objective methodology designed to rank the quantitative performance of a suite of bio-optical models. The objective classification is applied using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD). Using in situ Rrs as input to the models, the performance of eleven semi-analytical models, as well as five empirical chlorophyll algorithms and an empirical diffuse attenuation coefficient algorithm, is ranked for spectrally-resolved IOPs, chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 489 nm. The sensitivity of the objective classification and the uncertainty in the ranking are tested using a Monte-Carlo approach (bootstrapping). Results indicate that the performance of the semi-analytical models varies depending on the product and wavelength of interest. For chlorophyll retrieval, empirical algorithms perform better than semi-analytical models, in general. The performance of these empirical models reflects either their immunity to scale errors or instrument noise in R data, or simply that the data used for model parameterisation were not independent of NOMAD. Nonetheless, uncertainty in the classification suggests that the performance of some semi-analytical algorithms at retrieving chlorophyll is comparable with the empirical algorithms. For phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm, some semi-analytical models also perform with similar accuracy to an empirical model: We discuss the potential biases, limitations and uncertainty in the approach, as well as additional qualitative considerations for algorithm selection for climate-change studies. Our classification has the potential to be routinely implemented, such that the performance of emerging algorithms can be compared with existing algorithms as they become available. In the long-term, such an approach will further aid algorithm development for ocean-colour studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The accuracies of six global burned area (BA) products for year 2008 were compared using the same validation methods and reference data to quantify accuracy of each product. The selected products include MCD64, MCD45 and Geoland2, and three products developed within the Fire Disturbance project (fire_cci), which is part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. The latter three products were derived from MERIS and VEGETATION sensors (one product from each sensor separately, and a third one from the merging of MERIS and VGT products). The reference fire perimeters were mapped from two multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM + images at 103 non-overlapping Thiessen scene areas (TSA) selected with a stratified random sampling design. The validation results were based on cross tabulated error matrices from which six accuracy measures were computed following the requirements of end-users of burned area products. While overall accuracy (OA) exceeded 99% for all products, overall accuracy was lower for the burned class. Burned area commission error ratio was above 40% for all products and omission error ratio was above 65% for all products. The statistical significance of differences in accuracy between pairs of products was evaluated based on theory of the stratified combined ratio estimator. Statistical tests identified the MCD64 as the most accurate product, followed by MCD45 and the MERIS product. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
