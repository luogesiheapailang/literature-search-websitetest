AB The inverse ocean color problem, i.e., the retrieval of marine reflectance from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, is examined in a Bayesian context. The solution is expressed as a probability distribution that measures the likelihood of encountering specific values of the marine reflectance given the observed TOA reflectance. This conditional distribution, the posterior distribution, allows the construction of reliable multi-dimensional confidence domains of the retrieved marine reflectance. The expectation and covariance of the posterior distribution are computed, which gives for each pixel an estimate of the marine reflectance and a measure of its uncertainty. Situations for which forward model and observation are incompatible are also identified. Prior distributions of the forward model parameters that are suitable for use at the global scale, as well as a noise model, are determined. Partition-based models are defined and implemented for SeaWiFS, to approximate numerically the expectation and covariance. The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem is illustrated, indicating that a large set of ocean and atmospheric states, or pre-images, may correspond to very close values of the satellite signal. Theoretical performance is good globally, i.e., on average over all the geometric and geophysical situations considered, with negligible biases and standard deviation decreasing from 0.004 at 412 nm to 0.001 at 670 nm. Errors are smaller for geometries that avoid Sun glint and minimize air mass and aerosol influence, and for small aerosol optical thickness and maritime aerosols. The estimated uncertainty is consistent with the inversion error. The theoretical concepts and inverse models are applied to actual SeaWiFS imagery, and comparisons are made with estimates from the SeaDAS standard atmospheric correction algorithm and in situ measurements. The Bayesian and SeaDAS marine reflectance fields exhibit resemblance in patterns of variability, but the Bayesian imagery is less noisy and characterized by different spatial de-correlation scales. Experimental errors obtained from match-up data are similar to the theoretical errors determined from simulated data. Regionalization of the inverse models is a natural development to improve retrieval accuracy, for example by including explicit knowledge of the space and time variability of atmospheric variables.

AB There is an undisputed need to increase accuracy of Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) estimation in regions of complex terrain, especially in areas dependent on winter snow accumulation for a substantial portion of their water supply, such as the western United States. The main aim of this research is to develop FSC estimation in complex alpine-forested environments using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology as a fusion framework between multi-sensor remotely sensed data at medium temporal/spatial resolution (e.g.16-day revisit time; 30 m; Landsat), and high spatial resolutions (e.g.1 m; IKONOS). This research is the first known attempt to develop a multi-scale estimator of FSC from surface equivalent reference data derived from IKONOS multispectral data. It is also the first endeavor to estimate FSC values by combining terrain and snow/non-snow reflectance data. The plasticity of the developed ANN Landsat-FSC model accommodates alpine-forest heterogeneity, and renders unbiased, comprehensive, and precise FSC estimates. The accuracy of the ANN Landsat based FSC is characterized by: (1) very low error values (mean error similar to 0.0002; RMSE similar to 0.10; MAE similar to 0.08 FSC), (2) high correlation with the ground equivalent reference datasets derived from I m resolution IKONOS images (r(2) similar to 0.9), and (3) robust FSC estimation that is independent of terrain/vegetation alpine heterogeneity. The latter is supported by a spatially uniform distribution of errors, and lack of correlation between terrain (slope, aspect, terrain shadow distribution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the error (r(2) = 0).

AB A primary focus of this short communication is to show how the operational definition of light use efficiency (LUE) influences the results and interpretation of the LUE model. Our study was motivated by the observation that multiple LUE definitions are reported in the literature. The temporal behavior of three operational definitions of LUE, based on (i) incident radiation, (ii) total absorbed radiation and (iii) radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active/green vegetation was examined for two contrasting crops (soybean and maize) having different physiologies, leaf structures and canopy architectures. Over the course of a growing season, the behavior of these three contrasting LUE definitions was strikingly dissimilar, and the degree of dissimilarity varied with contrasting crops (corn and soybean). This demonstrates that LUE model behavior would vary strongly with the LUE definition used, with resulting implications both for the estimated seasonal productivity, and for the interpretation of the underlying mechanism. Based on these findings, we recommend a standard definition of the LUE model based on radiation absorbed by green vegetation. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of using this simple conceptual model on a dynamic biological system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can accurately observe forest parameters, such as canopy height and forest biomass. In this study, we investigated the potential of spaceborne LiDAR to quantify the effects of forest disturbances caused by typhoons on Hokkaido Island, Japan, after typhoon Songda in 2004. We developed a model to estimate canopy height from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) of the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite. GLAS waveforms are broadened by slopes ("pulse broadening"), so we used the lead10 and train10 values (edge extents referring to 10% and 90% of the cumulative energy returned) to correct for this effect, because they were the parameters most strongly correlated with pulse broadening. We developed the estimation model by dividing GLAS data between gentle and steep slopes, using an empirically determined threshold, and obtained a root-mean-square error of 3.5 m for canopy height. We then applied the model to GLAS data in the area damaged by typhoon Songda to estimate changes in canopy height caused by the typhoon. We used a wind damage map produced in a previous study to identify the damage severity. The model showed that canopy height decreased by an average of 2.7 +/- 1.8 m (95% confidence interval) in heavily damaged areas. The canopy height decreased most in coniferous forests, and especially in Japanese larch forests, that they have very shallow roots. We also assessed the geographic factors that most strongly influenced wind damage risk by means of multivariate analysis. We found serious damage in areas with a gentle slope that sustained strong winds. Understory plants and topography type also affected the risk. Our results show that spaceborne LiDAR can be used to quantify the severity of wind damage caused by forest disturbances, thereby providing guidance for forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Historical baselines of forest cover are needed to understand the causes and consequences of recent changes and to assess the effectiveness of land-use policies. However, historical assessment of the global distribution of forest cover and change has been lacking due to obstacles in image acquisition, computational demands, and lack of retrospective reference data for image classification. As limitations of access to imagery and computational power are overcome, the possibility is increased of an automated retrospective classification of forest cover. We used locally fit classification trees to relate hind-cast observations of "stable pixels" of forest and non-forest cover from circa-2000 to Landsat spectral measurements taken from the circa-1990 epoch of the Global Land Survey collection of Landsat images. Based on analysis of nearly 30,000 Landsat images, forest-cover change between 1990 and 2000 epochs was detected based on joint probabilities of cover in the two epochs. Assessed across a sample of areas with coincident reference data in the conterminous United States, the resulting maps achieved 93% accuracy for forest cover and 84% for forest-cover change comparable or even higher than many previous national efforts. Global accuracy assessment likewise showed accuracy of 88% for forest-cover change. The maps depict the global distribution of gross gains and losses in forest cover, as well as their net change. The initial analysis showed strong effects of extant land use in temperate regions and land-use change in the tropics over the period, while wildfire dominated in the boreal zone. Regions of high net forest loss (e.g., Amazonia) were associated with land-use changes into agriculture, and regions of high gross gains and losses (e.g., southeastern US, Sweden) were associated with intensive forestry. These results, including the global forest cover and forest cover change datasets, will be a basis for the estimation of the efficacy of policies and analyzing correlation between forest cover change and socio-economic factors.

AB The medium resolution imaging spectrometer full resolution (MERIS FR) archive (2002 to 2012) over South Africa has been processed with the maximum peak height (MPH) algorithm for the 50 largest standing water bodies in South Africa. Time series of chlorophyll a (chl-a), cyanobacteria and surface scum area coverage were used to establish the status, seasonality and trends for each of the water bodies. The majority (62%) of the 50 water bodies were hypertrophic (mean chl-a > 30 mg m(-3)), while 23 water bodies had intermediate to extensive cyanobacteria coverage. Cyanobacterial surface scum events posing a high health risk occurred in 26 of the water bodies in varying extents. Analysis of significant trends showed that water bodies both worsened and improved with regard to eutrophication, cyanobacteria and surface scum coverage between 2005 and 2012. Validation of the MPH algorithm using an independent in situ dataset demonstrated that gross trophic status through chl-a can be accurately determined in both eukaryote and cyanobacteria-dominant waters. Chl-a estimation in oligo/mesotrophic waters remains challenging due to a wide range of potential sources of error. This study is the first of its kind providing quantitative chl-a and phytoplankton species information in lakes from a time series of satellite remotely sensed data on a sub-continental scale, demonstrating how global analyses of changes in lake biogeochemistry might be performed in the future. It demonstrates the pivotal role that satellite remote sensing can play in supplementing in situ monitoring efforts, particularly in the developing world. The study concludes that eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms are widespread in South African water bodies and remain issues of critical concern for water quality.

AB This paper presents the Dahra field spectrometer system (DAFIS) sited in Senegal, West Africa. DAFIS is a unique system that automatically measures the spectro-directional reflectance properties of a semi-arid savanna in the spectral range of 350-1800 nm, daily from sunrise to sunset. The instrumental setup allows studying surface anisotropy for different phenological phases. First data retrieved from the Dahra field spectrometer system show distinctive patterns of spectrally dependent anisotropic behavior: during the rainy season normalized reflectance was highest around solar noon for small off-nadir observation angles but for observations of large off-nadir angles highest values were found in the morning or evening hours (both forward and backward scatter direction). Anisotropy factors corresponding to MODIS, SPOT and SEVIRI red, near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) sensor response functions indicated little influence of the anisotropic behavior for savanna but vegetation indices including red/NIR (NDVI) and NIR/SWIR (SIWSI) were found to be sensitive to the view angle (NDVI and SIWSI varied by 5 and 41 %, respectively). Surprisingly, the influence from differences in shading (analyzed by measurements from forward and backward scatter direction) did not have a noticeable impact on the indices (0.2% and 0.5% difference for NDVI and SIWSI in the backward and forward scatter direction, respectively). The presented data show the large potential of continuous time series collected with the DAFIS system for monitoring of plant spectro-directional behavior in semi-arid African savanna for quantitative evaluation of satellite or airborne remote sensing data or development of new Earth Observation (EO) based indices and algorithms to monitor vegetation status or stress.

AB Forest carbon stocks and fluxes are highly dynamic following stand-clearing disturbances from severe fire and harvest and this presents a significant challenge for continental carbon budget assessments. In this work we use forest inventory data to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for specific forest types growing in high and low site productivity class settings. We then apply these trajectories to landscapes and regions based on forest age distributions derived from either the FIA data or from Landsat time series stacks (1985-2006) for 54 representative scenes throughout most of the conterminous United States. We estimate the net carbon uptake in forests caused by post-disturbance growth and decomposition ("regrowth sink") for forested regions across the country. At the landscape scale, the prevailing condition of positive net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is in stark contrast to local patches with large sources, particularly in the west where fires and clear cuts create contiguous disturbed patches. At the continental scale, regional differences in disturbance rates reflect management patterns of high disturbance rates in the Southeastern and South Central states, and lower disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States. Despite low contemporary disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States (0.61 and 0.74% y(-1)), the regrowth sink there remains of moderate to large strength (88 and 57 g C m(-2) y(-1)) owing to the continued legacy from historical clearing. Large regrowth sinks are also found in the Southeast, South Central, and Pacific Southwest regions (85, 86, and 95 g C m(2) y(-1)) where disturbance rates also tend to be higher (1.59, 1.38, and 0.93% y(-1)). Overall, the Landsat-derived disturbance rates are elevated relative to FIA-derived rates (1.19 versus 0.93% y(-1)) particularly for western regions. The differences only modestly adjust regional- and continental-scale carbon budgets, reducing NEP from forest regrowth by about 8%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The trajectory of the urban heat island (UHI) centroid in three dimensions indicates the overall variation of the intensity and distribution of the UHI. This study applied the Gaussian volume model on the daily MODIS/LST products from 2000 to 2012 to derive the UHI centroid in Beijing on a multi-temporal scale. The trajectories indicated that (1) on a diurnal scale during July-September, the daytime and nighttime centroids of the UHI were primarily located in the Xicheng district near the city center, and the mean intensity was from 2.12 to 2.97 degrees C. The daytime centroid was in the south of the nighttime centroid and demonstrated a higher intensity and a larger core area, where Aqua obtains a higher intensity than Terra. The movement of the UHI centroid was also more significant in the north-south direction than in the east-west direction; (2) on a monthly scale, the daytime centroid moved from the northeast to the southwest by (1.85, 2.91) km from July to September, and the intensity varied from 2.16 degrees C (September) to 3.09 degrees C (August), while the nighttime centroid generally moved anticlockwise from January to December, and the intensity varied from 1.98 degrees C (July) to 3.07 degrees C (January); and (3) on an annual scale, the daytime UHI centroid in August and the nighttime UHI centroid moved toward the northeast by (2.15, 131) km and (0.43, 0.89) km, respectively. There was a dramatic change in the UHI prior to 2008, which was most likely caused by the numerous preparation projects for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the hot and medium-hot landscapes exhibited positive contributions to the variation of the horizontal location of UHI centroid, and NDVI and albedo showed positive contributions to the variations of daytime (less than 10%) and nighttime (close to 50%) UHI centroids, respectively. Also, we discussed the relationship between Z-dimension of UHI centroid and other UHI indicators, and the impact of missing data. This study presents scientific insights for urban planning and management in Beijing and motivates the investigation of comprehensive changes in UHI of other metropolises worldwide.

AB Malaria was endemic in Europe for more than two millennia until its eradication in the 1970s. Recent autochthonous cases registered in Greece have increased the awareness regarding the threat of malaria re-emergence in Southern Europe. Currently, the presence of competent vectors, suitable environmental conditions and the evidences of a changing climate may increase the widespread re-emergence of malaria in Southern Europe. This work focused on determining the current relationships between environmental factors and the density of the former malaria vector Anopheles atroparvus in Portugal, a previously endemic country. Adult females were sampled and vector density was estimated in 22 sites in Southern Portugal between 2001 and 2010 and related with land cover and satellite-derived air temperature and vegetation indices. The relationship between vector density and local larval habitat, temperature and, in a broader sense, to environmental suitability, was assessed using a statistical modelling approach.
   Results showed that present environmental conditions are suitable for vector development at high densities and the spatial and temporal patterns closely resemble the ones registered in the past endemic period. The use of satellite-derived data, together with statistical models, allowed the extrapolation of suitable environmental conditions for vector development from site-level to the Portuguese mainland territory. This work also improved the baseline knowledge needed to understand the potential impacts of future environmental changes on vector density and, indirectly, on the risk of malaria re-emergence.

AB Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history, providing evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to plant functioning, greater effort is needed to determine and quantify the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content, the main photosynthetic pigment, as well as its proxy, green leaf area index (CIAO, both used as quantitative measures of plant greenness. The objective of this study is to establish relationships for GPP vs. canopy CM content and GPP vs. GLAI in maize. The main focus of the paper is to reveal fine details of the relationships and understand their features in different stages of maize development. Data on GPP, leaf Chl content and GLAI were collected across ten years (2001-2010) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska over irrigated and rainfed maize. Relationships of GPP vs. total canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI were established for vegetative, tasseling and reproductive stages. In each stage, relationships were close with determination coefficients above 0.9; however, the shapes and slopes of the relationships in vegetative stages were different from reproductive stages. This difference was more pronounced for the GPP vs. CIA! relationship. In part, this difference is due to different leaf Chl contents in vegetative and reproductive stages. Smaller but detectable differences in shape and slope were also found for the GPP vs. canopy Chl relationship. Despite the differences in relationships for vegetative and reproductive stages, for the entire growing season, green LAI (GIAI) explained 90% of GPP variation with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 17%, while total canopy Chl content explained more than 92% of GPP variation with CV = 15%. Quantitative characterization of relationships between GPP and such biophysical characteristics as GLAI and canopy Chl content underlines the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and has significant implications on remote sensing of primary production.

AB Knowing if a forest disturbance is caused by timber harvest or a natural event is crucial for carbon cycle assessments, econometric analyses of timber harvesting, and other research questions. However, while remote sensing of forest disturbance in general is very well developed, discerning between different types of forest disturbances remains challenging. In this work, we developed an algorithm to separate windfall disturbance from clear-cut harvesting using Landsat data. The method first extracts training data primarily based on Tasseled Cap transformed bands and histogram thresholds with minimal user input. We then used a support-vector machine classifier to separate disturbed areas into 'windfall' and 'clear-cut harvests'. We tested our algorithm in the temperate forest zone of European Russia and the southern boreal forest zone of the United States. The forest-cover change classifications were highly accurate (similar to 90%) and windfall classification accuracies were greater than 75% in both study areas. Accuracies were generally higher for larger disturbance patches. At the Russia study site about 60% of all disturbances were caused by windfall, versus 40% at the U.S. study site. Given the similar levels of accuracy in both locations and the ease of application, the algorithm has the potential to fill a research gap in mapping wind disturbance using Landsat data in both temperate and boreal forests that are subject to frequent wind events.

AB Satellite remote sensing products of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) are routinely used for diverse applications in Earth-System and land-surface modelling and monitoring. The availability of numerous products creates a need to Understand the level of consistency between products, and reasons for inconsistencies. We evaluate the consistency of six FAPAR products (MODIS, MERIS, SeaWIFS, MODIS-TIP, SPOT-VEG, and AVHRR) across the Australian continent, using multi-year records. We find that seemingly large differences in FAPAR products over much of Australia can be explained by a simple offset present in certain products. Additional inconsistencies arise from different sensitivities in FAPAR to changes in vegetation cover. These inconsistencies can in turn be partially attributed to changes in biome type that are relevant to certain products and related model-specific assumptions.
   The satellite FAPAR products are compared to similar to 800 observation-based estimates of fractional vegetation cover at field sites across Australia. After accounting for offsets in FAPAR, relatively high agreement occurs at sites classified as grasslands, shrublands and managed land (agriculture). Significant disagreement occurs at sites correctly classified as forests. Consequently, some products show significant differences in FAPAR between regions of similar vegetation cover but different biome classification. We find that all products show a much lower sensitivity to fractional vegetation cover (range in coefficient of linear regression: 0.28-0.61) than is predicted theoretically (0.96-1.18) using a canopy radiative transfer model. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest biomass is a major store of carbon and thus plays an important role in the regional and global carbon cycle. Accurate forest carbon sequestration assessment requires estimation of both forest biomass and forest biomass dynamics over time. Forest dynamics are characterized by disturbances and recovery, key processes affecting site productivity and the forest carbon cycle. Thus, spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of these processes and their drivers are critical for understanding regional carbon cycles. Here, we present a new method that uses satellite data to estimate changes in forest aboveground biomass associated with forest disturbances and recovery at annual time steps. First yearly maps of aboveground biomass between 1985 and 2010 based on Landsat time series and field data were created. Then, we applied a trajectory-based segmentation and fitting algorithm to the yearly biomass maps to reconstruct the forest disturbance and recovery history over the last 25 years.
   We tested the method over a coniferous forest region in the Western Carpathian Mountains, which experienced long-term environmental changes. Overall, 55% (similar to 30,700 ha) of the total coniferous forest experienced a loss of biomass over the observation period, while similar to 30% showed severe or complete removal of forest biomass. At the same time, 11.2% of the area was reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. The total coniferous biomass dropped by 15% between 1985 and 2010, indicating negative balance between the losses and the gains. Disturbance hotspots indicate high insect infestation levels in many areas and reveal strong interactions between biomass loss and climate conditions. Our study demonstrates how spatial and temporal estimates of biomass help to understand regional forest dynamics and derive degradation trends in regard to regional climate change.

AB This work advances the evaluation and interpretation of the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress, over a range of canopy structures and pigment content levels. Very high resolution (VHR) narrow-band multispectral (10 cm) and thermal (20 cm) imagery was acquired diurnally, in four airborne campaigns conducted over an experimental vineyard site undergoing three different irrigation treatments. Field measurements of leaf stomatal conductance (G(s)) and leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) were acquired concurrently with the airborne campaigns and compared against the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), a widely accepted, thermal-based indicator of water stress, and against narrow-band multispectral indices calculated from pure-vegetation pixels. The study proposes a new formulation, a normalized PRI (PRInorm), in which the standard PRI index is normalized by an index that is sensitive to canopy structure (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and by a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content (R-700/R-670). The hypothesis investigated is that the new index, calculated as PRInorm = PRI/[RDVI center dot R-700/R-670], not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf area reduction induced by stress. Results demonstrated that when comparing PRInorm against stomatal conductance (r(2) = 0.79; p <0.001) and leaf water potential (r(2) = 0.77; p < 0.001) measured at midday, the new index performed better than the standard PRI (r(2) = 0.52 and 0.49, respectively). Further, when using the four flights conducted during the diurnal experiment, the relationships with stomatal conductance also showed the superior performance of PRInorm (r(2) = 0.68) as opposed to PRI (r(2) = 0.4). The proposed normalized PRI was highly related (r(2) = 0.75; p <0.001) to the thermal indicator of water stress, CWSI, which was used here as a benchmark. In comparison, the standard PRI index was found to be significantly related to CWSI (p < 0.001), although the relationship was weaker (r(2) = 0.58) than that obtained for PRInorm. In summary, this study demonstrates that PRInorm isolated better than PRI the physiological changes against a changing background of altered pigments and structure, tracking more precisely the diurnal dynamics of the stomatal aperture. Simulations conducted, using leaf and canopy radiative transfer models to elucidate these results, showed that PRInorm is more linearly related to canopy pigment content than the standard PRI, and was more capable of differentiating between stress levels, providing better insight into the results of this diurnal study.

AB We propose to validate regional solutions consisting of 2 degrees surface tiles of surface mass concentration over South America (90 degrees W-30 degrees W; 60 degrees S-20 degrees N) computed using accurate Level-1 GRACE measurements, by confronting them to other GRACE products (i.e., global GRGS and ICA-400 km GFZ/CSR/JPL combined solutions) and independent in situ river level and discharge datasets. For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to all of these types of GRACE-based solutions to extract the corresponding main orthogonal spatial and temporal modes of variability to be compared for 2003-2010. For the first three spatial modes, regional solutions provide a better geographical localization of hydrological structures, especially indicating major surface and groundwater systems of South America. Over hydrological patterns, records of river level versus time are particularly consistent with the GRACE temporal modes, especially for our regional solutions (i.e., correlations generally greater than 0.7). Interannual variations of GRACE-based Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) clearly exhibit the signatures of extreme climatic events as the recent droughts and floods that affected South America. Very significant agreement is also found at interannual time-scale between TWS and discharges in drainage basins dominated by the surface reservoir (more than 0.9 of correlation in the Amazon basin).

AB Forest fires are a major hazard in Mediterranean countries, with an average of 45,000 fires per year. Discrimination of different degrees of burn severity is critical to improve management of fire-affected areas. In this work, an unmixing-based methodology was evaluated in three Mediterranean study areas to estimate burn severity from medium spatial resolution optical satellite data. Post-fire Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were unmixed into four fraction images: non-photosynthetic vegetation and ash (NPV-Ash), green vegetation (GV), soil and shade using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). MESMA decomposes each pixel using different combinations of potential endmembers, overcoming the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis limitation of using the same number of endmembers to model all image pixels. Next, a decision tree was used to classify the shade normalized fraction images into four classes: unburned and low, moderate, and high levels of burn severity. Finally, the burn severity estimates were validated using error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and K statistic. For reference data, we used 50 plots per class defined from a 50 cm post-fire orthophotography (proportion of dead tree < 50%, low severity; proportion of dead tree between 50 and 90%, moderate severity; and proportion of dead tree > 90%, high severity). MESMA-based burn severity estimates showed a high accuracy (0.80, 0.80, and 0.78) for the three test sites. We conclude that the proposed MESMA based methodology is valid to accurately map burn severity in Mediterranean countries from moderate resolution satellite data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This algorithm is based on an empirical rotation model and was tested on Landsat image pairs over the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee; Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Utah; San Juan National Forest, Colorado; and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, California. The illumination correction process successfully eliminated correlation between Landsat reflectance and illumination condition. Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23% to 45%. Validated against high-resolution (1 m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34% at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10% at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field. The correction for topographic illumination should be considered as a standard pre-processing step for land cover classification and land use change detection, especially for mountainous areas.

AB Water levels in lakes and reservoirs can currently be obtained from four different satellite altimetry databases: (i) Global Reservoir and Lake Monitoring (GRLM), (ii) River Lake Hydrology (RLH), (iii) Hydroweb and (iv) ICESat-GLAS level 2 Global Land Surface Altimetry data (ICESat-GLAS). This paper proposes a new method for estimating water volume changes in lakes and reservoirs from these four databases in combination with satellite imagery data, without any in-situ measurements and bathymetry maps. Three lakes/reservoirs with different characteristics were studied, i.e. Lake Mead (U.S.A.), Lake Tana (Ethiopia) and Lake IJssel (The Netherlands). Compared to in-situ water levels, satellite altimetry products provided accurate water level variations for Lake Mead and Lake Tana but not for Lake IJssel. The long-term lowest water level in each satellite altimetry database was used as the reference level for water volume estimation. All water levels were converted to the Water Level Above the Lowest Level (WLALL), and the series of Landsat TM/ETM + imagery data were selected to extract corresponding surface areas for establishing area-WLALL relationships. Subsequently, the relationships of the Water Volume Above the Lowest water Level (WVALL) and WLALL were obtained through the analytical integration of area-WLALL relationships. The WVALL-WLALL relationships are site-specific and database-specific and can be used to convert water levels from the four databases directly into water volumes above the identified minimum levels for the same lake. Validation showed that estimated water volumes agreed well with in-situ measurements (R-2 from 0.95 to 0.99) and the root mean square error (RMSE) was within 4.6 to 13.1% of the mean volumes of in-situ measurements.

AB If a change detection result based on time series of remote sensing data indicates that there was a 10% increase in an ecosystem property between two years over a specific land area, does it mean there was a real change in the ecosystem property, or could it be merely an estimation error? This question must be addressed before ecosystem managers or policy makers can use the result with confidence for addressing related environmental or natural resource management issues. One means of answering this question is through systematic error propagation analysis. In this study, we analyzed error propagation for detecting inter-annual changes in foliage biomass over Wapusk National Park, Canada. Specifically, we first estimated uncertainties in all input data, including sampling errors in foliage and random errors in AVHRR and Landsat data. Secondly, we evaluated the error propagation from inputs to the remote sensing-derived foliage biomass estimates (including the Landsat-based foliage biomass, AVHRR-derived foliage biomass, and the inter-annual changes in foliage biomass), and determined the threshold of detectable change in foliage biomass. Finally, we investigated approaches that can reduce the threshold. Our results indicated that over Wapusk National Park during 1985-2006, the threshold for a clear-sky AVHRR pixel between two single years was similar to 40% with a confidence level of 84%, and can be reduced to 10% for a land cover class with more than 10 clear-sky AVHRR pixels between two 5-year "State of Park" reporting periods.

AB This paper compares three global snow water equivalent (SWE) products, SSM/I (NSIDC), AMSR-E (NSIDC) and Globsnow (v1.0, ESA) to each other, snow covered area (SCA), ground measures of snow depth and meteorological data in an attempt to determine which might be most suitable for testing and developing land surface models. Particular attention is paid to which gives the most accurate peak accumulation, seasonal SWE changes and first and last dates of snow cover.
   SSM/I and AMSR-E are pure earth observation (EO) derived products whilst Globsnow is a combination of EO and ground data. The results suggest that the pure EO products can saturate in deeper snow (SWE> 80-150 mm), can show spurious features during melt and can overestimate SWE due to strong thermal gradients and erroneous forest cover correction factors. Along with the comparison to ground data (only a single point) this suggests that Globsnow is the more accurate product for determining peak accumulation and seasonal SWE cycle.
   The snow start and end dates of the three SWE products were compared to an optically derived SCA (MOD10C1, taken as truth) and found to give large errors of snow start date ( root mean square error of 20 + days, though SSM/I was correct on average). The snow end dates had lower errors (a bias of 1-6 days) although the spread was still on the order of three weeks.
   During the investigation, occasional abrupt changes in Globsnow were observed (in the v1.0 and v1.2 daily and v1.2 weekly products). These only occurred in around 1% of cases examined and seem to be spurious. Care should be taken to corrector avoid these jumps if using Globsnow to validate land surface models or in an assimilation scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study explored the use of narrow-band indices formulated in the visible spectral region at leaf and canopy levels to estimate carotenoid content. The research area was a pine forest affected by decline processes. Spectral reflectance and pigment content including chlorophylls a and b (Ca + b), carotenoid (Cx + c) and xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) were measured in needles for two consecutive years. The study was conducted using radiative transfer modeling methods and high-resolution airborne imagery acquired at 10 nm FWHM bandwidth. Airborne data consisted of high spatial resolution imagery acquired with a narrow-band multispectral camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The imagery had 50 cm resolution and six spectral bands in the 500-800 nm range, enabling the identification of pure crowns to obtain the reflectance of individual trees. The indices evaluated were traditional formulations and new simple ratios developed by combining bands sensitive to Cx + c absorption in the 500-600 nm region. The PROSPECT-5 model was coupled with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to explore the performance of Cx + c-sensitive vegetation indices at leaf and canopy levels. The sensitivity of these indices to structural effects was assessed to study the potential scaling-up of Cx + c-related vegetation indices on heterogeneous canopies. Coefficients of determination between Cx + c content and narrow-band vegetation indices revealed that traditional indices were highly related with Cx + c content at leaf level (r(2) > 0.90; P<0.001 for the CRI index (1/R-515)-(1/R-550)) but highly affected by structural parameters at crown level (r(2) > 0.44; P<0.001). A new simple-ratio vegetation index proposed in this study (R-515/R-570) was found to be significantly related with Cx + c content both at leaf (r(2) > 0.72: P<0.001) and canopy levels (r(2) > 0.71; P<0.001). Remote sensing cameras on board UAV platforms can provide very high multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for mapping biochemical constituents in heterogeneous forest canopies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping carotenoid content to assess the physiological condition of forests.

AB This paper describes the atmospheric correction (AC) component of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC) which introduces a new way to compute parameters of the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse (RTLS) Bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), spectral surface albedo and bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) from satellite measurements obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MAIAC uses a time series and spatial analysis for cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction. It implements a moving window of up to 16 days of MODIS data gridded to 1 km resolution in a selected projection. The RTLS parameters are computed directly by fitting the cloud-free MODIS top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data stored in the processing queue. The RTLS retrieval is applied when the land surface is stable or changes slowly. In case of rapid or large magnitude change (as for instance caused by disturbance), MAIAC follows the MODIS operational BRDF/albedo algorithm and uses a scaling approach where the BRDF shape is assumed stable but its magnitude is adjusted based on the latest single measurement. To assess the stability of the surface, MAIAC features a change detection algorithm which analyzes relative change of reflectance in the Red and NIR bands during the accumulation period. To adjust for the reflectance variability with the sun-observer geometry and allow comparison among different days (view geometries), the BRFs are normalized to the fixed view geometry using the RTLS model. An empirical analysis of MODIS data suggests that the RTLS inversion remains robust when the relative change of geometry-normalized reflectance stays below 15%. This first of two papers introduces the algorithm, a second, companion paper illustrates its potential by analyzing MODIS data over a tropical rainforest and assessing errors and uncertainties of MAIAC compared to conventional MODIS products.

The model is then used to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) using the estimated parameters, atmospheric forcing data (from NLDAS-2) and remotely sensed surface soil moisture (from AMSR-E) and temperature (from AMSR-E and MODIS). By exploiting the statistical relationship between the forcing (e.g., precipitation and radiation) and surface states (soil moisture and temperature), the stationarity-based parameter estimation avoids the restrictive requirements of direct calibration (i.e., the need for ground-truth ET), enabling broad applicability. Modeled annual mean ET rates are compared with benchmark values based on runoff data from Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC), and the root mean square error (RMSE) between them is less than 10 Wm(-2). Spatial patterns of model estimated ET and of key model parameters indicate that radiation and moisture availability are the controlling factors on ET in the study area. The spatial distributions of the estimated parameters appear reasonable: they are smooth and not overly patchy or random; and they are consistent with the land cover and soil moisture distribution through the area. An important feature of the stationarity-based method demonstrated here is that forcing and surface states need not be continuous. In this application, approximately 30% of the daily surface temperature and moisture data were missing. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an algorithm for the retrieval of cloud droplet size distribution parameters (effective radius and variance) from the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) measurements. The RSP is an airborne prototype for the Aerosol Polarimetery Sensor (APS), which was on-board of the NASA Glory satellite. This instrument measures both polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels with central wavelengths ranging from 410 to 2260 nm. The cloud droplet size retrievals use the polarized reflectance in the scattering angle range between 135 degrees and 165 degrees, where they exhibit the sharply defined structure known as the rain- or cloud-bow. The shape of the rainbow is determined mainly by the single scattering properties of cloud particles. This significantly simplifies both forward modeling and inversions, while also substantially reducing uncertainties caused by the aerosol loading and possible presence of undetected clouds nearby. In this study we present the accuracy evaluation of our algorithm based on the results of sensitivity tests performed using realistic simulated cloud radiation fields. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB River floodplains are heterogeneous landscapes composed of a mosaic of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. While flow has frequently been considered as a master variable that controls aquatic biodiversity and species behavior in river floodplains, little is known about thermal heterogeneity and its effect on aquatic biota in complex landscapes. However, quantifying thermal patch dynamics at the river floodplain scale remains a challenging task. In this study, we applied airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterize spatial thermal heterogeneity under high (March 2010) and mean (July 2010) flow conditions in a 347.5 ha lowland river floodplain (Oder River, Germany). Concurrently, we electro-fished all major floodplain water bodies (main channel, side channel, and permanently connected ponds) to identify the composition of associated fish assemblages. In addition, we deployed temperature loggers from March to July across the entire range of floodplain water bodies to assess seasonal temperature patterns at 20 min intervals. Under both flow conditions, the TIR imagery revealed a complex mosaic of thermal patches across the floodplain. Cumulative degree-days and average and maximum temperatures were the main variables that thermally differentiated individual water bodies. The water body types delineated based on spatial and seasonal thermal signatures also contained distinct fish assemblages. Distinct temperature gradients at the floodplain scale and both within and across distinct water body types were resolved with airborne thermal data, providing a fully spatial and concurrently available temperature mosaic. A delay in response of fish distribution to a strong thermal gradient recorded in spring, that has never been predicted or observed elsewhere, could be assessed by the use of TIR imagery. This study demonstrates the potential of airborne remotely sensed TIR imagery as a non-invasive method for detecting and quantifying spatial heterogeneity and ecologically relevant temperature gradients in complex landscapes, thereby facilitating the "up-scaling" of ecosystem processes to the landscape scale and expanding current understanding of fish behavior.

AB This study introduces active contours for multitemporal monitoring of urban trees using fine resolution imagery. In our implementation active contours locally identify tree crown image regions using a localized data energy term and competition of energy forces between adjacent contours. The simultaneous evolution of n contours represents an equivalent number of tree crowns which are initialized based on a fast and efficient image fitting procedure. We incorporate prior information into the multitemporal analysis, as optimized contours are propagated through a sequence of images. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to monitor individual trees and tree groups in two residential areas in the Netherlands using multispectral aerial images acquired over a period of five years. The method allowed the identification of abrupt and gradual tree crown changes in both areas and performed superior to an alternative region growing segmentation approach. We conclude that the method extracts meaningful image objects that facilitate tree crown monitoring and is effective to update tree crown spatial-databases in urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The vast and persistent Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill challenged response capabilities, which required accurate, quantitative oil assessment at synoptic and operational scales. Although experienced observers are a spill response's mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. DWH spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing.
   Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (>0.1 mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps.
   Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however. SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (> 100 mu m) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1 mu m). The UAVSAR's (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional Surface coverage, and emulsification.
   In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation.
   Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH's experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sea surface infrared emissivity is an important parameter in oceanic remote sensing. This article derives the infrared emissivity of two-dimensional (2D) sea surfaces with an analytical model, where one surface reflection (surface-emitted surface-reflected) is considered. Polarization is studied, and the surface slope probability density function is Gaussian and then non-Gaussian to study the skewness and the kurtosis effects. It is shown that sea surface infrared emissivity is sensitive to the zenith observation angle and the wind direction, and the skewness and the kurtosis effects are significant for grazing directions (with zenith angle > 80 degrees). For Gaussian surfaces, surface emissivity for grazing zenith angles reaches maxima in the up-wind and downwind directions. whereas minima are found in the cross-wind direction. After taking into account the skewness and the kurtosis effects, the surface emissivity has the largest value in the down-wind direction. The analytical results are then compared with measurements, which shows that considering one surface reflection significantly improves the agreement for large zenith angles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Kauth-Thomas (K-T) transform, also known as the Tasseled-Cap (T-C) transform, is a widely used metric capable of capturing scene characteristics in related coordinate directions in a defined feature space. There is a perceived apprehension to use the transform because the derivation methods are diverse, and concern that coefficients are only useful for the images from which they were derived. We address these concerns and outline a workflow for future derivations. First, we ensure greater consistency of future K-T transform derivations by creating an empirical approach to identify scenes most favorable for derivations. This approach can be applied to large data archives and provide a "first-cut" criterion for selecting vegetation land cover dominated scenes. The algorithm provides a quantified basis to exclude imagery from a K-T transform derivation because of ill-suited land cover. This empirically derived relationship can be used to sort large imagery archives for vegetation land cover dominated scenes. This "first-cut" method still requires the need for an analyst, but the work load is greatly reduced.
   Each K-T transform matrix is sensor and data-model specific. For every sensor and data type (e.g., radiance, reflectance, DN), a new transform matrix must be derived. As an example of using the work flow we derive the DN-based Landsat 7 ETM + K-T transform coefficients and show the resulting tasseled-cap space. The proposed process uses the first two dominant eigenvalues which are the roots of the characteristic equations solving the variance-covariance matrix of the spectral data. We have discovered that these quantities are discriminative of the land cover type contained in the scene. Not only can these specific types eigenvalues be used to select appropriate scenes for the K-T transform derivation but can also be included in the image header as a useful parameter in imagery database inquiries. Like cloud cover and image quality flags, the In-lambda1 [In(lambda(1))] and ln-lambda2 [In(lambda(2))] values provide general information about the variability and land cover of the scene.

AB Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/).

AB Sensors on Landsat satellites have been collecting images of the Earth's surface for nearly 40 years. These images have been invaluable for characterizing and detecting changes in the land cover and land use of the world. Although initially conceived as primarily picture generating sensors, even the early sensors were radiometrically calibrated and spectrally characterized prior to launch and incorporated some capabilities to monitor their radiometric calibration once on orbit. Recently, as the focus of studies has shifted to monitoring Earth surface parameters over significant periods of time, serious attention has been focused toward bringing the data from all these sensors onto a common radiometric scale over this 40-year period. This effort started with the most recent systems and then was extended back in time. Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+, the best-characterized sensor of the series prior to launch and once on orbit, and the most stable system to date, was chosen to serve as the reference. The Landsat-7 project was the first of the series to build an image assessment system into its ground system, allowing systematic characterization of its sensors and data. Second, the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) (still operating at the time of the Landsat-7 launch and continues to operate) calibration history was reconstructed based on its internal calibrator, vicarious calibrations, pseudo-invariant sites and a tie to Landsat-7 ETM + at the time of the commissioning of Landsat-7. This process was performed in two iterations: the earlier one relied primarily on the TM internal calibrator. When this was found to have some deficiencies, a revised calibration was based more on pseudo-invariant sites, though the internal calibrator was still used to establish the short-term variations in response due to contaminant build up on the cold focal plane. As time progressed, a capability to monitor the Landsat-5 TM was added to the image assessment system. The Landsat-4 TM, which operated from 1982 to 1992, was the third system to which the radiometric scale was extended. The limited and broken use of the Landsat-4 TM made this analysis more difficult. Eight-day separated image pairs from Landsat-5 combined with analysis of pseudo invariant sites established this history. The fourth and most challenging effort was making the Landsat 1-5 Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) sensors' data internally radiometrically consistent. This effort was particularly complicated by the age of the MSS data, varying formats and processing levels in the archive, limited datasets, and limited documentation available. Ultimately, pseudo-invariant sites were identified in North America and used for this effort. Note that most of the Landsat MSS archived data had already been calibrated using the MSS internal calibrators, so this processing was embedded in the result The final effort was developing an absolute scale for Landsat MSS similar to what was already established for the "TM" sensors. This was accomplished by using simultaneous data from Landsat-5 MSS and Landsat-5 TM, accounting for spectral differences between the sensors using EO-1 Hyperion data. The recalibrated history of the Landsat data and implications to users are discussed. The key result from this work is a consistently calibrated Landsat data archive that spans nearly 40 years with total uncertainties on the order of 10% or less for most sensors and bands.

AB The feasibility of using remotely sensed data jointly with shipboard measurements to estimate the carbon dioxide fugacity in the surface water (fCO(2)sw) of the Pacific sector of the Southern Polar Ocean (S>60 degrees S) is evaluated using a data set obtained during austral summer 2006. A comparison between remotely sensed chlorophyll a (chl a) and sea-surface temperature (SST) with in-situ measurements, reveals the largest bias in areas with rapid and large concentration changes such as at the ice edge, the polar front and in the Ross Sea Polynya. The correlation between fCO(2)sw and SST, chl a, biological productivity estimates and mixed layer depth (MLD) are evaluated, and single and multiple regression methods are used to develop fCO(2)sw algorithms. Single regressions between the study parameters and fCO(2)sw show that most of the fCO(2)sw variability is explained by chl a. The Multi-Parameter Linear regressions were used to create fCO(2)sw algorithms derived from field measurements, and using solely remote-sensing products. Based on the best fits from the two data sets fCO(2)sw estimates have a root means square deviation of +/- 14 mu atm and coefficient of determination of 0.82. The addition of satellite derived estimates of biological productivity in the algorithm does not significantly improve the fit. We use the algorithm with remotely sensed chl a and SST data to produce an fCO2sw map for the entire high-latitude Southern Ocean south of 55 degrees S. We analyze and discuss the seasonal and spatial robustness of the algorithm based on the remotely sensed data and compare with climatologic fCO(2)sw data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pixel-based and object-based image analysis approaches for classifying broad land cover classes over agricultural landscapes are compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM). Overall classification accuracies between pixel-based and object-based classifications were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when the same machine learning algorithms were applied. Using object-based image analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between maps produced using the DT algorithm compared to maps produced using either RF (p = 0.0116) or SVM algorithms (p = 0.0067). Using pixel-based image analysis. there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between results produced using different classification algorithms. Classifications based on RF and SVM algorithms provided a more visually adequate depiction of wetland, riparian, and crop land cover types when compared to DT based classifications, using either object-based or pixel-based image analysis. In this study, pixel-based classifications utilized fewer variables (15 vs. 300), achieved similar classification accuracies, and required less time to produce than object-based classifications. Object-based classifications produced a visually appealing generalized appearance of land cover classes. Based exclusively on overall accuracy reports, there was no advantage to preferring one image analysis approach over another for the purposes of mapping broad land cover types in agricultural environments using medium spatial resolution earth observation imagery.

AB Variation in the leaf optical properties imposed by variation in genetics and location has been addressed in recent literature, but those stemming from forest seasonality and phenology have been less well explored. Here, we explore the effect of inter-seasonal spectral variation on the potential for automated classification methods to accurately discern species of trees and lianas from high-resolution spectral data collected at the leaf level at two tropical forest sites. Through the application of a set of data reduction techniques and classification methods to leaf-level spectral data collected at both rainforest and seasonally dry sites in Panama, we found that in all cases the structure and organization of spectrally-derived taxonomies varied substantially between seasons. Using principle component analysis and a non-parametric classifier, we found at both sites that species-level classification was possible with a high level of accuracy within a given season. Classification across season was not, however, with accuracy dropping on average by a factor of 10. This study represents one of the first systematic investigations of leaf-level spectro-temporal variability, an appreciation for which is crucial to the advancement of species classification methods, with broad applications within the environmental sciences.

AB Mutual shading of needles in coniferous shoots and small-scale variations in needle area density both within and between shoots violate conventional assumptions used in the definition of the elementary volume in radiative transfer models. In this paper, we test the hypothesis if it is possible to scale needle spectral albedo up to shoot spectral albedo using only one structural parameter: the spherically averaged shoot silhouette to total area ratio (STAR). To test the hypothesis, we measured both structural and spectral properties of ten Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) shoots and their needles. Our results indicate that it is possible to upscale from needle to shoot spectral albedo using STAR. The upscaling model performed best in the VIS and SWIR regions, and for shoots with high STAR values. As STAR is linearly related to photon recollision probability, it is also possible to apply the upscaling model as integral part of radiative transfer models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The accuracy of land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) was assessed in a test site in Valencia, Spain from 2002 to 2008. AATSR LSTs were directly compared with concurrent ground measurements over homogeneous, full-vegetated rice fields in the conventional temperature-based (T-based) method. We also applied the new radiance-based (R-based) method over bare soil and water surfaces, where ground LST measurements were not available. In the R-based method, ground LSTs are simulated from AATSR brightness temperatures in the 11 mu m band and radiative transfer simulations using surface emissivity data and atmospheric water vapor and temperature profiles. The accuracy of the R-based ground LSTs depends on how well the profiles used in simulations represent the actual atmosphere at the time of AATSR observations. This can be checked with the difference delta(T-11-T-12) between the actual AATSR and the profile-based simulated difference in the 11 and 12 mu m brightness temperatures (T-11 and T-12, respectively). We found that for -0.6 K<delta(T-11-T-12)< 0.6 K, the R-based LSTs were accurate within +/- 1.0 K and can be used for LST validation. For the data analyzed here, the AATSR operational algorithm overestimated the ground LST by 2 to 5 K, showing that the auxiliary data utilized within the retrieval scheme (biome classification and fractional vegetation cover maps at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution) should be improved and provided at the same spatial resolution as the AATSR data (1 km(2)). When the AATSR algorithm was optimized with biome and fractional vegetation cover selected according to the nature of each surface, LST errors showed negligible average biases and rmse = +/- 0.5 K for full vegetation and water, and +/- 1.1 K for bare soil. Furthermore, we checked an alternative algorithm explicitly dependent on emissivity, which provided accurate LSTs for all the surfaces studied, with small biases, rmse from +/- 0.4 to +/- 0.6 K and most LST errors within +/- 1.0 K The algorithm requires monthly emissivity maps at 1 km(2), which can be derived from classification and fractional vegetation cover estimated from optical AATSR data. The results of this paper show the high LST accuracy achievable with AATSR data in ideal conditions. While it is necessary to establish and maintain highly homogeneous T-based validation sites, the R-based method provides an alternative for the semi-operational, long-term evaluation of LST products at global scale, since it is applicable over surfaces with varied LST and atmospheric regimes where ground LST measurements are not feasible.

AB Remote sensing of canopy chemistry could greatly advance the study and monitoring of functional processes and biological diversity in humid tropical forests. Imaging spectroscopy has contributed to canopy chemical remote sensing, but efforts to develop general, globally-applicable approaches have been limited by sparse and inconsistent field and laboratory data, and lacking analytical methods. We analyzed leaf hemispherical reflectance and transmittance spectra, along with a 21-chemical portfolio, taken from 6136 fully sunlit humid tropical forest canopies, and developed an up-scaling method using a combination of canopy radiative transfer, chemometric and high-frequency noise modeling. By integrating these steps, we found that the accuracy and precision of multi-chemical remote sensing of tropical forest canopies varies by leaf constituent and wavelength range. Under conditions of varying canopy structure and spectral noise, photosynthetic pigments, water, nitrogen, cellulose, lignin, phenols and leaf mass per area (LMA) are accurately estimated using visible-to-shortwave infrared spectroscopy (VSWIR; 400-2500 nm). Phosphorus and base cations are retrieved with lower yet significant accuracy. We also find that leaf chemical properties are estimated far more consistently, and with much higher precision and accuracy, using the VSWIR range rather than the more common and limited visible to near-infrared range (400-1050 nm; VNIR). While VNIR spectroscopy proved accurate for predicting foliar LMA, photosynthetic pigments and water, VSWIR spectra provided accurate estimates for three times the number of canopy traits. These global results proved to be independent of site conditions, taxonomic composition and phylogenetic history, and thus they should be broadly applicable to multi-chemical mapping of humid tropical forest canopies. The approach developed and tested here paves the way for studies of canopy chemical properties in humid tropical forests using the next generation of airborne and space-based high-fidelity imaging spectrometers.

TI Model-assisted regional forest biomass estimation using LiDAR and InSAR
   as auxiliary data: A case study from a boreal forest area

AB There is a need for accurate inventory methods that produce relevant and timely information on the forest resources and carbon stocks for forest management planning and for implementation of national strategies under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). Such methods should produce information that is consistent across various geographical scales. Airborne scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is among the most promising remote sensing technologies for estimation of forest resource information such as timber volume and biomass, while acquisition of three dimensional data with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from space is seen as a relevant option for inventory in the tropics because of its ability to "see through the clouds" and its potential for frequent updates at low costs. Based on a stratified probability sample of 201 field survey plots collected in a 960 km(2) boreal forest area in Norway, we demonstrate how total above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated at three distinct geographical levels in such a way that the estimates at a smaller level always sum up to the estimate at a larger level. The three levels are (1) a district (the entire study area), (2) a village, local community or estate level, and (3) a stand or patch level. The LiDAR and InSAR data were treated as auxiliary information in the estimation. At the two largest geographical levels model-assisted estimators were employed. A model-based estimation was conducted at the smallest level. Estimates of AGB and corresponding error estimates based on (1) the field sample survey were compared with estimates obtained by using (2) LiDAR and (3) InSAR data as auxiliary information. For the entire study area, the estimates of AGB were 116.0, 101.2, and 111.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Corresponding standard error estimates were 3.7, 1.6, and 3.2 Mg ha(-1). At the smallest geographical level (stand) an independent validation on 35 large field plots was carried out. RMSE values of 17.1-17.3 Mg ha(-1) and 42.6-53.2 Mg ha(-1) were found for LiDAR and InSAR, respectively. A time lag of six years between acquisition of InSAR data and field inventory has introduced some errors. Significant differences between estimates and reference values were found, illustrating the risk of using pure model-based methods in the estimation when there is a lack of fit in the models. We conclude that the examined remote sensing techniques can provide biomass estimates with smaller estimated errors than a field-based sample survey. The improvement can be highly significant, especially for LiDAR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission, based on an aperture synthesis L-band radiometer was successfully launched in November 2009. In the context of a validation campaign for the SMOS mission, intensive airborne and in situ observations were performed in southwestern France for the SMOS CAL/VAL, from April to May 2009 and from April to July 2010. The CAROLS (Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies) bi-angular (34 degrees-0 degrees) and dual-polarized (V and H) L-band radiometer was designed, built and installed on board the French ATR-42 research aircraft. During springs of 2009 and 2010, soil moisture observations from the SMOSMANIA (Soil Moisture Observing System-Meteorological Automatic Network Integrated Application) network of Meteo-France were complemented by airborne observations of the CAROLS L-band radiometer, following an Atlantic-Mediterranean transect in southwestern France. Additionally to the 12 stations of the SMOSMANIA soil moisture network, in situ measurements were collected in three specific sites within an area representative of a SMOS pixel. Microwave radiometer observations, acquired over southwestern France by the CAROLS instrument were analyzed in order to assess their sensitivity to surface soil moisture (w(g)). A combination of microwave brightness temperature (T(b)) at either two polarizations or two contrasting incidence angles was used to retrieve w(g) through regressed empirical logarithmic equations with good results, depending on the chosen configuration. The regressions derived from the CAROLS measurements were applied to the SMOS T(b) and their retrieval performance was evaluated. The retrievals of w(g) showed significant correlation (p-value < 0.05) with surface measurements for most of the SMOSMANIA stations (8 of 12 stations) and with additional field measurements at two specific sites, also. Root mean square errors varied from 0.03 to 0.09m(3) M(-3) (0.06 m(3) M(-3) on average). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using MODIS 250-m resolution data, we developed a novel approach to derive the bottom topography of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China (>3000 km(2) at maximum inundation) for every year between 2000 and 2009. The approach differs from other traditional methods (sonar, Lidar, optical inversion, and Radar) but takes advantage of the fast-changing nature of the lake's inundation area. On every image, the water/land boundary is effectively a topographic isobath after correction for the water level gradient. Thus, the -10/year carefully selected MODIS images provided incremental topographic isobaths, from which bottom topography was derived every year. Such-derived topographic maps were validated using limited historical data and other consistency checks. Most of the lake bottom showed an elevation of 12 m to 17 m (referenced against the elevation reference of the Woosung Horizontal Zero). Significant inter-annual variability of the bottom topography from 2000 to 2009 was found for some of the lake's bottom, with more areas associated with bottom elevation increases than decreases. The changes and inter-annual variability in the bottom topography were attributed to the combined effect of human activities (e.g., sand dredging and levee construction) and weather events. One example was the increased bottom elevation from 2002 to 2003, which was apparently due to the excessive precipitation in 2002 and the impoundment of the Three-Gorges Dam in 2003. The 10-year record of the bottom topography of this highly dynamic lake provides baseline information to monitor the impact of future engineering and management activities, to estimate the lake's water and sediment budgets, and to aid ship navigation.

AB We develop herein the theoretical foundations for a new satellite concept, utilizing multi-angle, along track spectral measurements to infer photosynthesis and gross primary production, at the landscape level over time. We validate the theory using both tower and space-borne sensors. The concept, originated in Hall et al. (2008), and Hilker et al. (2008a) and is based on two principles: (1) The first derivative of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) with respect to shadow fraction viewed by the sensor partial derivative PRI/partial derivative alpha(s), is proportional to light-use efficiency c. (2) This behavior can be shown both theoretically and empirically to be independent of vegetation structure and optical properties. These two principles provide the basis for a robust photosynthesis algorithm that can be applied consistently both spatially and temporally. We develop the general theoretical concept using a canopy reflectance model that incorporates a dependence of leaf reflectance on illumination strength, permitting the leaf reflectance at 531 nm to depend on the intensity of photosynthetic down-regulation. Using this model we are able to show that using PRI alone to infer e is confounded by the shadow fraction viewed by a sensor, the PRI value in a non-down-regulated physiological state, and the sunlit canopy reflectance. We are able to demonstrate that these difficulties are mitigated by using partial derivative PRI/partial derivative alpha(s)-not PRI-as the primary measure of canopy level c. We demonstrate our concept using tower and satellite data acquired over three years, in two distinct biomes and vegetation types to show that PRI/partial derivative alpha(s) and c are related by a single function. Building on these ideas we propose the development of a new satellite concept that can utilize a spatially and temporally robust algorithm to map photosynthesis at landscape scales and its temporal variation.

AB The global savanna biome is characterized by enormous diversity in the physiognomy and spatial structure of the vegetation. The foliage clumping index can be calculated from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. It measures the response of the darkspot reflectance to increased shadow associated with clumped vegetation and is related to leaf area index. Clumping index theoretically declines with increasing woody cover until the tree canopy begins to become uniform. In this study, clumping index is calculated for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BRDF data for the Australian tropical savanna, the tropical savannas of South America, and the tropical savannas of east, west and southern Africa and compared with site-based measurements of tree canopy cover, and with area-based classifications of land cover. There were differences in sensitivity of clumping index between red and near-infrared reflectance channels, and between savanna systems with markedly different woody vegetation physiognomy. Clumping index was broadly related to foliage cover from historical site data in Australia and in West Africa and Kenya, but not in Southern Africa nor with detailed site-based demographic data in the cerrado of Brazil. However, clumping index decreased with proportion of woody cover in land cover datasets for east Africa, Australia and the Colombian Llanos. There was overlap in the range of clumping index values for forest, cerrado and campo land covers in Brazil. Clumping index was generally negatively correlated with percentage tree cover from the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product, but regional differences in the relationship were evident. There were large differences in the frequency distributions of clumping index from savanna, woody savanna and grassland land cover classes between global ecoregions. The clumping index shows differing sensitivity to savanna woody cover for red and NIR reflectance, and requires regional calibration for application as a universal indicator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The composite nature of remotely sensed spectral information often masks diagnostic spectral features and hampers the detailed identification and mapping of targeted constituents of the earth's surface. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) is a well established and effective technique to address this mixture problem. SMA models a mixed spectrum as a linear or nonlinear combination of its constituent spectral components or spectral endmembers weighted by their subpixel fractional cover. By model inversion SMA provides subpixel endmember fractions. The lack of ability to account for temporal and spatial variability between and among endmembers has been acknowledged as a major shortcoming of conventional SMA approaches using a linear mixture model with fixed endmembers. Over the past decades numerous efforts have been made to circumvent this issue. This review paper summarizes the available methods and results of endmember variability reduction in SMA. Five basic principles to mitigate endmember variability are identified: (i) the use of multiple endmembers for each component in an iterative mixture analysis cycle, (ii) the selection of a subset of stable spectral features, (iii) the spectral weighting of bands, (iv) spectral signal transformations and (v) the use of radiative transfer models in a mixture analysis. We draw attention to the high complementarities between the different techniques and suggest that an integrated approach is necessary to effectively address endmember variability issues in SMA.

AB This paper presents a method for mapping fuel types using LiDAR and multispectral data. A two-phase classification method is proposed to discriminate the fuel classes of the Prometheus classification system, which is adapted to the ecological characteristics of the European Mediterranean basin. The first step mapped the main fuel groups, namely grass, shrub and tree, as well as non-fuel classes. This phase was carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification combining LiDAR and multispectral data. The overall accuracy of this classification was 92.8% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9. The second phase of the proposed method focused on discriminating additional fuel categories based on vertical information provided by the LiDAR measurements. Decision rules were applied to the output of the SVM classification based on the mean height of LiDAR returns and the vertical distribution of fuels, described by the relative LiDAR point density in different height intervals. The final fuel type classification yielded an overall accuracy of 88.24% with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Some confusion was observed between fuel types 7 (dense tree cover presenting vertical continuity with understory vegetation) and 5 (trees with less than 30% of shrub cover) in some areas covered by Holm oak, which showed low LiDAR pulses penetration so that the understory vegetation was not correctly sampled.

AB The ground surface temperature is one of the key parameters that determine the thermal regime of permafrost soils in arctic regions. Due to remoteness of most permafrost areas, monitoring of the land surface temperature (LST) through remote sensing is desirable. However, suitable satellite platforms such as MODIS provide spatial resolutions that cannot resolve the considerable small-scale heterogeneity of the surface conditions characteristic for many permafrost areas. This study investigates the spatial variability of summer surface temperatures of high-arctic tundra on Svalbard, Norway. A thermal imaging system mounted on a mast facilitates continuous monitoring of approximately 100 x 100 m of tundra with a wide variability of different surface covers and soil moisture conditions over the entire summer season from the snow melt until fall. The net radiation is found to be a control parameter for the differences in surface temperature between wet and dry areas. Under clear-sky conditions in July, the differences in surface temperature between wet and dry areas reach up to 10 K. The spatial differences reduce strongly in weekly averages of the surface temperature, which are relevant for the soil temperature evolution of deeper layers. Nevertheless, a considerable variability remains, with maximum differences between wet and dry areas of 3 to 4 K. Furthermore, the pattern of snow patches and snow-free areas during snow melt in July causes even greater differences of more than 10 K in the weekly averages. Towards the end of the summer season, the differences in surface temperature gradually diminish. Due to the pronounced spatial variability in July, the accumulated degree-day totals of the snow-free period can differ by more than 60% throughout the study area. The terrestrial observations from the thermal imaging system are compared to measurements of the land surface temperature from the MODIS sensor. During periods with frequent clear-sky conditions and thus a high density of satellite data, weekly averages calculated from the thermal imaging system and from MODIS LST agree within less than 2 K. Larger deviations occur when prolonged cloudy periods prevent satellite measurements. Furthermore, the employed MODIS L2 LST data set contains a number of strongly biased measurements, which suggest an admixing of cloud top temperatures.
   We conclude that a reliable gap filling procedure to moderate the impact of prolonged cloudy periods would be of high value for a future LST-based permafrost monitoring scheme. The occurrence of sustained subpixel variability of the summer surface temperature is a complicating factor, whose impact needs to be assessed further in conjunction with other spatially variable parameters such as the snow cover and soil properties.

AB Methods for the estimation of forest growing stock volume (GSV) are a major topic of investigation in the remote sensing community. The boreal zone contains almost 30% of global forest by area but measurements of forest resources are often outdated. Although past and current spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter data are not optimal for forest-related studies, a multi-temporal combination of individual GSV estimates can improve the retrieval as compared to the single-image case. This feature has been included in a novel GSV retrieval approach, hereafter referred to as the BIOMASAR algorithm. One innovative aspect of the algorithm is its independence from in situ measurements for model training. Model parameter estimates are obtained from central tendency statistics of the backscatter measurements for unvegetated and dense forest areas, which can be selected by means of a continuous tree canopy cover product, such as the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. In this paper, the performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using hyper-temporal series of C-band Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) images acquired in ScanSAR mode at 100 m and I km pixel size. To assess the robustness of the retrieval approach, study areas in Central Siberia (Russia), Sweden and Quebec (Canada) have been considered. The algorithm validation activities demonstrated that the automatic approach implemented in the BIOMASAR algorithm performed similarly to traditional approaches based on in situ data. The retrieved GSV showed no saturation up to 300 m(3)/ha, which represented almost the entire range of GSV at the study areas. The relative root mean square error (RMSE) was between 34.2% and 48.1% at 1 km pixel size. Larger errors were obtained at 100 m because of local errors in the reference datasets. Averaging GSV estimates over neighboring pixels improved the retrieval statistics substantially. For an aggregation factor of 10 x 10 pixels, the relative RMSE was below 25%, regardless of the original resolution of the SAR data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) measurements have greatly advanced our knowledge of carbon exchange in terrestrial ecosystems. However, appropriate techniques are required to upscale these spatially discrete findings globally. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities in this respect, but remote sensing of the photosynthetic light-use efficiency (epsilon), one of the key components of Gross Primary Production, is challenging. Some progress has been made in recent years using the photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index centered at 531 and 570 nm. The high sensitivity of this index to various extraneous effects such as canopy structure, and the view observer geometry has so far prevented its use at landscape and global scales. One critical aspect of upscaling PRI is the development of generic algorithms to account for structural differences in vegetation. Building on previous work, this study compares the differences in the PRI: epsilon relationship between a coastal Douglas-fir forest located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and a mature Aspen stand located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using continuous, tower-based observations acquired from an automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC II) installed at each site, we demonstrate that PRI can be used to measure epsilon throughout the vegetation season at the DF-49 stand (r(2)= 0.91, p<0.00) as well as the deciduous site (r(2) = 0.88, p <0.00). It is further shown that this PRI signal can be also observed from space at both sites using daily observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and a multi-angular implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) (r(2) = 0.54 DF-49; r(2) = 0.63 SOA; p<0.00). By implementing a simple hillshade model derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to approximate canopy shadow fractions (alpha(s)), it is further demonstrated that the differences observed in the relationship between PRI and epsilon at DF-49 and SOA can be attributed largely to differences in alpha(s). The findings of this study suggest that algorithms used to separate physiological from extraneous effects in PRI reflectance may be more broadly applicable and portable across these two climatically and structurally different biome types, when the differences in canopy structure are known.

AB Satellite remote sensing is an invaluable tool to monitor agricultural resources. However, spatial patterns in agricultural landscapes vary significantly across the Earth resulting in different imagery requirements depending on what part of the globe is observed. Furthermore, there is an increasing diversity of Earth observation instruments providing imagery with various configurations of spatial, temporal, spectral and angular resolutions. In terms of spatial resolution, the choice of imagery should be conditioned by knowing the appropriate spatial frequency at which the landscape must be sampled with the imaging instrument in order to provide the required information from the targeted fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework to define quantitatively such requirements for both crop area estimation and crop growth monitoring based on user-defined constraints. The methodological development is based on simulating how agricultural landscapes, and more specifically the fields covered by a crop of interest, are seen by instruments with increasingly coarser resolving power. The results are provided not only in terms of acceptable pixel size but also of pixel purity which is the degree of homogeneity with respect to the target crop. This trade-off between size and purity can be adjusted according to the end-user's requirements. The method is implemented over various agricultural landscapes with contrasting spatial patterns, demonstrating its operational applicability. This diagnostic approach can be used: (i) to guide users in choosing the most appropriate imagery for their application, (ii) to evaluate the adequacy of existing remote sensing systems for monitoring agriculture in different regions of the world and (iii) to provide guidelines for space agencies to design future instruments dedicated to agriculture monitoring.

AB Plant structure and chlorophyll content strongly affect rates of photosynthesis. Rapid, objective, and repeatable methods are needed to measure these vegetative parameters to advance our understanding and modeling of plant ecophysiological processes. Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) can be used to measure structural and potentially chemical properties of objects by quantifying the x,y,z coordinates and intensity of laser light, respectively, returned from an object's surface. The objective of this study was to determine the potential usefulness of TLS with a green (532 nm) laser to simultaneously measure the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and b content (Chl(ab)), leaf area (LA), and leaf angle (LAN). The TLS measurements were obtained from saplings of two tree species (Quercus macrocarpa and Acer saccharum) and from an angle-adjustable cardboard surface. The green laser return intensity value was strongly correlated with wet-chemically determined Chlab (r(2) = 0.77). Strong agreement was shown between measured and TLS-derived LA (r(2) = 0.95, intercept = 1.43, slope = 0.97). The TLS derived LANs of both species followed a plagiophile LAN distribution, and the measured angles of the cardboard surface allowed us to quantify that these LAN values were strongly correlated with TLS derived angles (r(2) = 1.0, intercept and slope = 0.98). Our results show that terrestrial laser scanners are feasible for simultaneous measurement of LA, LAN, and Chl(ab), in simple canopies of small broadleaved plants. Further research is needed in more complex and larger canopies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODIS-Aqua) provides a viable data stream for operational water quality monitoring of Chesapeake Bay. Marine geophysical products from MODIS-Aqua depend on the efficacy of the atmospheric correction process, which can be problematic in coastal environments. The operational atmospheric correction algorithm for MODIS-Aqua requires an assumption of negligible near-infrared water-leaving radiance, nL(w)(NIR). This assumption progressively degrades with increasing turbidity and, as such, methods exist to account for non-negligible nL(w)(NIR) within the atmospheric correction process or to use alternate radiometric bands where the assumption is satisfied, such as those positioned within shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum. We evaluated a decade-long time-series of nL(w)(lambda) from MODIS-Aqua in Chesapeake Bay derived using NIR and SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. Low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the SWIR bands of MODIS-Aqua added noise errors to the derived radiances, which produced broad, flat frequency distributions of nL(w)(lambda) relative to those produced using the NIR bands. The SWIR approach produced an increased number of negative nL(w)(lambda) and decreased sample size relative to the NIR approach. Revised vicarious calibration and regional tuning of the scheme to switch between the NIR and SWIR approaches may improve retrievals in Chesapeake Bay, however, poor SNR values for the MODIS-Aqua SWIR bands remain the primary deficiency of the SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach.

AB This paper presents a new algorithm for the detection of oil spill from SAR intensity images. The proposed algorithm combines the marked point process, Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. In this paper, the candidates of oil spills or dark spots in a SAR intensity image are characterized by a Poisson marked point process. The marked point process is formed by a group of random points (as a point process modelling the locations of oil spills) and a set of parameters including geometric parameters of windows centred at the random points and gamma distribution parameters (as the marks attaching to each point). As a result, the candidates of oil spills are represented by a group of windows, in which the intensities of pixels follow independent and identical gamma distribution with lower mean than that for the identical gamma distribution of the pixels out of windows. Following the Bayesian paradigm, the posterior distribution, which characterizes the locations and statistical distributions of oil spills, can be obtained up to a normalizing constant. In order to simulate from the posterior distribution and to estimate the parameters of the posterior distribution, the Revisable Jump MCMC (RJMCMC) algorithm is used. The optimal locations and sizes of dark spots are obtained by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. The proposed approach is tested using Radarsat-1 SAR images with oil spills indicated by human analysts. The results show that the proposed approach works well and is very promising.

AB Shrub cover appears to be increasing across many areas of the Arctic tundra biome, and increasing shrub cover in the Arctic has the potential to significantly impact global carbon budgets and the global climate system. For most of the Arctic, however, there is no existing baseline inventory of shrub canopy cover, as existing maps of Arctic vegetation provide little information about the density of shrub cover at a moderate spatial resolution across the region. Remotely-sensed fractional shrub canopy maps can provide this necessary baseline inventory of shrub cover. In this study, we compare the accuracy of fractional shrub canopy (>0.5 m tall) maps derived from multi-spectral, multi-angular, and multi-temporal datasets from Landsat imagery at 30 m spatial resolution, Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) imagery at 250 m and 500 m spatial resolution, and MultiAngle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) imagery at 275 m spatial resolution for a 1067 km(2) study area in Arctic Alaska. The study area is centered at 69 degrees N, ranges in elevation from 130 to 770 m, is composed primarily of rolling topography with gentle slopes less than 10, and is free of glaciers and perennial snow cover. Shrubs >0.5 m in height cover 2.9% of the study area and are primarily confined to patches associated with specific landscape features. Reference fractional shrub canopy is determined from in situ shrub canopy measurements and a high spatial resolution IKONOS image swath. Regression tree models are constructed to estimate fractional canopy cover at 250 m using different combinations of input data from Landsat, MODIS, and MISR. Results indicate that multi-spectral data provide substantially more accurate estimates of fractional shrub canopy cover than multi-angular or multi-temporal data. Higher spatial resolution datasets also provide more accurate estimates of fractional shrub canopy cover (aggregated to moderate spatial resolutions) than lower spatial resolution datasets, an expected result for a study area where most shrub cover is concentrated in narrow patches associated with rivers, drainages, and slopes. Including the middle infrared bands available from Landsat and MODIS in the regression tree models (in addition to the four standard visible and near-infrared spectral bands) typically results in a slight boost in accuracy. Including the multi-angular red band data available from MISR in the regression tree models, however, typically boosts accuracy more substantially, resulting in moderate resolution fractional shrub canopy estimates approaching the accuracy of estimates derived from the much higher spatial resolution Landsat sensor. Given the poor availability of snow and cloud-free Landsat scenes in many areas of the Arctic and the promising results demonstrated here by the MISR sensor, MISR may be the best choice for large area fractional shrub canopy mapping in the Alaskan Arctic for the period 2000-2009.

AB Impervious surface area (ISA) from the Landsat TM-based NLCD 2001 dataset and land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS averaged over three annual cycles (2003-2005) are used in a spatial analysis to assess the urban heat island (UHI) skin temperature amplitude and its relationship to development intensity, size, and ecological setting for 38 of the most populous cities in the continental United States. Development intensity zones based on %ISA are defined for each urban area emanating outward from the urban core to the non-urban rural areas nearby and used to stratify sampling for land surface temperatures and NDVI. Sampling is further constrained by biome and elevation to insure objective intercomparisons between zones and between cities in different biomes permitting the definition of hierarchically ordered zones that are consistent across urban areas in different ecological setting and across scales.
   We find that ecological context significantly influences the amplitude of summer daytime UHI (urban-rural temperature difference) the largest (8 degrees C average) observed for cities built in biomes dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. For all cities combined, ISA is the primary driver for increase in temperature explaining 70% of the total variance in LST. On a yearly average, urban areas are substantially warmer than the non-urban fringe by 2.9 degrees C, except for urban areas in biomes with and and semiarid climates. The average amplitude of the UHI is remarkably asymmetric with a 4.3 degrees C temperature difference in summer and only 1.3 degrees C in winter. In desert environments, the LSTs response to ISA presents an uncharacteristic "U-shaped" horizontal gradient decreasing from the urban core to the outskirts of the city and then increasing again in the suburban to the rural zones. UHI's calculated for these cities point to a possible heat sink effect. These observational results show that the urban heat island amplitude both increases with city size and is seasonally asymmetric for a large number of cities across most biomes. The implications are that for urban areas developed within forested ecosystems the summertime UHI can be quite high relative to the wintertime UHI suggesting that the residential energy consumption required for summer cooling is likely to increase with urban growth within those biomes.

AB Pathogen and pest outbreaks are recognized as key processes in the dynamics of Western forest ecosystems, yet the spatial patterns of stress and mortality are often complex and difficult to describe in an explicit spatial context, especially when considering the concurrent effects of multiple agents. Blister rust, a fungal pathogen, and mountain pine beetle, an insect pest, are two dominant sources of stress and mortality to high-altitude whitebark pine within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In whitebark pine populations infested with blister rust or mountain pine beetle, the shift from green to red needles at the outer-most branches is an early sign of stress and infestation. In this analysis, we investigated a method that combines field surveys with a remote sensing classification and spatial analysis to differentiate the effects of these two agents of stress and mortality within whitebark pine. Hyperspectral remotely sensed images from the airborne HyMap sensor were classifled to determine the locations of stress and mortality in whitebark pine crowns through sub-pixel mixture-tuned matched-filter analysis in three areas of the GYE in September 2000 and July 2006. Differences in the spatial pattern of blister rust and mountain pine beetle infestation allowed us to separate areas dominated by mountain pine beetle versus blister rust by examining changes in the spatial scale of significant stress and mortality clusters computed by the Ripley's K algorithm. At two field sites the distance between clusters of whitebark pine stress and mortality decreased from 2000 to 2006, indicating domination by the patchy spatial pattern of blister rust infestation. At another site, the distance between significant stress and mortality clusters increased from 2000 to 2006, indicating that the contiguous pattern of mountain pine beetle infestation was the primary source of disturbance. Analysis of these spatial stress and mortality patterns derived from remote sensing yields insight to the relative importance of blister rust and mountain pine beetle dynamics in the landscape.

AB We use the time-average of a series of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from 2005 to 2007 to identify grounded icebergs in the western Weddell Sea. Satellite laser altimetry along repeated ground tracks confirms that regions of high mean backscatter are associated with stationary, tabular icebergs. The altimeter data also provide iceberg freeboard, from which we infer maximum ice draft assuming the lightly-grounded limit and a two-layer density model consistent with a source at Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The maximum iceberg draft agrees very well with the ocean depth at a point where the bathymetry is well constrained by ship soundings. However, for an extensive region near 71 degrees S, south of Larsen C Ice Shelf, the maximum grounding depth for several icebergs reveals the ocean to be locally more than 200 m shallower than in bathymetry products. This previously uncharted bank is expected to have a profound effect on the northward flow of the western Weddell Gyre and the cross-slope transport of offshore warm deep water towards the eastern Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves. Passive microwave data also show that sea-ice concentration is reduced in the vicinity of this group of grounded icebergs, indicating an iceberg influence on ocean/atmosphere heat and freshwater exchanges.

AB Immediately before an April 2007 snow survey and passive microwave radiometer field campaign in the Northwest Territories, Canada, a rain-on-snow event deposited a thin (similar to 3 mm) continuous layer of ice on the surface of the snowpack. At eight sites the brightness temperature (T-b) of the undisturbed snow pack was measured with a multi-frequency dual polarization (6.9, 19, 37, and 89 GHz) ground based radiometer system. The ice lens was then carefully removed and the T(b)s were measured again. The individual V-pol channels and the 37 V - 19 V difference were largely unaffected by the presence of the ice lens, exhibiting a systematic shift of about 3 K. In comparison, the ice lens had a considerable effect on the H-pol T-b at all frequencies, with a mean difference (ice lens present-ice lens removed) of - 9 K (+/- 5.3 K) at 6.9 GHz, - 40 K (+/- 11.3 K) at 19 GHz, - 33 K (+/- 7.6 K) at 37 GHz, and - 19 K (+/- 8.0 K) at 89 GHz. The effect of the ice lens on H-pol measurements was also observed with spaceborne data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) satellite data.
   Simulations of T-b were produced for each site using a new two layer formulation of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model. The ice lens was used as the top layer and the underlying snowpack considered as a homogenous second layer. The agreement between observations and simulations was variable, with agreement strongest at 19 GHz. A comparison with simulations produced using the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) suggests HUT model uncertainty is related not to the ice lens, but to difficulties in simulating emission from deep snow. Overall, the observations and simulations suggest H-poll measurements are capable of detecting new ice layers across the tundra snowpack, while V-pol measurements are more appropriate for snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals due to their relative insensitivity to ice layers.

AB Topography and accuracy of image geometric registration significantly affect the quality of satellite data, since pixels are displaced depending on surface elevation and viewing geometry. This effect should be corrected for through the process of accurate image navigation and orthorectification in order to meet the geolocation accuracy for systematic observations specified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirements for satellite climate data records. We investigated the impact of orthorectification on the accuracy of maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composite data for a mountain region in north-westem Canada at various spatial resolutions (1 km, 4 km, 5 km, and 8 km). Data from AVHRR on board NOAA-11 (1989 and 1990) and NOAA-16 (2001, 2002, and 2003) processed using a system called CAPS (Canadian AVHRR Processing System) for the month of August were considered. Results demonstrate the significant impact of orthorectification on the quality of composite NDVI data in mountainous terrain. Differences between orthorectified and non-orthorectified NDVI composites (ANDVI) adopted both large positive and negative values, with the 1% and 99% percentiles of ANDVI at 1 km resolution spanning values between -0.16<Delta NDVI<0.09. Differences were generally reduced to smaller numbers for coarser resolution data, but systematic positive biases for non-orthorectified composites were obtained at all spatial resolutions, ranging from 0.02 (1 km) to 0.004 (8 km). Analyzing the power spectra of maximum NDVI composites at 1 km resolution, large differences between orthorectified and non-orthorectified AVHRR data were identified at spatial scales between 4 km and 10 km. Validation of NOAA-16 AVHRR NDVI with MODIS NDVI composites revealed higher correlation coefficients (by up to 0.1) for orthorectified composites relative to the non-orthorectified case. Uncertainties due to the AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) sampling scheme introduce an average positive bias of 0.02 +/- 0.03 at maximum NDVI composite level that translates into an average relative bias of 10.6% +/- 19.1 for sparsely vegetated mountain regions. This can at least partially explain the systematic average positive biases we observed relative to our results in AVHRR GAC-based composites from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and Polar Pathfinder (PPF) datasets (0.19 and 0.05, respectively). With regard to the generation of AVHRR long-term climate data records, results suggest that orthorectification should be an integral part of AVHRR preprocessing, since neglecting the terrain displacement effect may lead to important biases and additional noise in time series at various spatial scales.

Gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) are routinely derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard satellites Terra and Aqua, and estimates generally agree with independent measurements at validation sites across the globe. However, the accuracy of GPP and NPP estimates in some regions may be limited by the quality of model input variables and heterogeneity at fine spatial scales. We developed new methods for deriving model inputs (i.e., land cover, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies) from airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) and Quickbird multispectral data at resolutions ranging from about 30 m to 1 km. In addition, LiDAR-derived biomass was used as a means for computing carbon-use efficiency. Spatial variables were used with temporal data from ground-based monitoring stations to compute a six-year GPP and NPP time series for a 3600 ha study site in the Great Lakes region of North America. Model results compared favorably with independent observations from a 400 m flux tower and a process-based ecosystem model (BIOME-BGC), but only after removing vapor pressure deficit as a constraint on photosynthesis from the MODIS global algorithm. Fine-resolution inputs captured more of the spatial variability, but estimates were similar to coarse-resolution data when integrated across the entire landscape. Failure to account for wetlands had little impact on landscape-scale estimates, because vegetation structure, composition, and conversion efficiencies were similar to upland plant communities. Plant productivity estimates were noticeably improved using LiDAR-derived variables, while uncertainties associated with land cover generalizations and wetlands in this largely forested landscape were considered less important.

AB Accurate estimation of live and dead biomass in forested ecosystems is important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity, wildfire behavior, and for forest management. Lidar remote sensing has been used successfully to estimate live biomass, but studies focusing on dead biomass are rare. We used lidar data, in conjunction with field measurements from 58 plots to distinguish between and map standing live and dead tree biomass in the mixed coniferous forest of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA. Lidar intensity and canopy volume were key variables for estimating live biomass, whereas for dead biomass, lidar intensity alone was critical for accurate estimation. Regression estimates of both live and dead biomass ranged between 0 and 600 Mg ha(-1), with means of 195.08 Mg ha(-1) and 65.73 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Cross validation with field data resulted in correlation coefficients for predicted vs. observed of 0.85 for live biomass (RMSE = 50 Mg ha(-1) and %RMSE (RMSE as a percent of the mean) = 26). For dead biomass, correlation was 0.79, RMSE was 42 Mg ha(-1), and %RMSE was 63. Biomass maps revealed interesting patterns of live and dead standing tree biomass. Live biomass was highest in the ponderosa pine zone, and decreased from south to north through the mixed conifer and spruce-fir forest zones. Dead biomass exhibited a background range of values in these mature forests from zero to 100 Mg ha(-1), with lower values in locations having higher live biomass. In areas with high dead biomass values, live biomass was near zero. These areas were associated with recent wildfires, as indicated by fire maps derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Project (MTBS). Combining our dead biomass maps with the MTBS maps, we demonstrated the complementary power of these two datasets, revealing that MTBS burn intensity class can be described quantitatively in terms of dead biomass. Assuming a background range of dead biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1), it is possible to estimate and map the contribution to the standing dead tree biomass pool associated with recent wildfire.

AB We present a large-scale study of the relationships between selective logging and forest phenology in the Brazilian Amazon. Time-series analysis of MODIS satellite data of selectively logged forests in Mato Grosso, Brazil, shows that relatively low levels (5-10%) of canopy damage cause significant and long-lasting (more than 3 years) changes in forest phenology. Partial clearing slows forest green-up in the dry season, progressively dries the canopy, and induces overall seasonal deficits in canopy moisture and greenness. Given large and increasing geographic extent of selective logging throughout Amazonia, this phenological disturbance has a potential to impact carbon and water fluxes, nutrient dynamics, and other functional processes in these forests.

AB It has been suggested that airborne laser scanning (ALS) with high point densities could be used to monitor changes in the alpine tree line. The overall goal of this study was to assess the influence of ALS sensor and flight configurations on the ability to detect small trees in the alpine tree line and on the estimation of their heights. The study was conducted in a sub-alpine/alpine environment in southeast Norway. 342 small trees (0.11-5.20 m tall) of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and downy birch were precisely georeferenced and measured in field. ALS data acquired with two different instruments and at different flying altitudes (700-1130 m a.g.l.) with different pulse repetition frequencies (100, 125, and 166 kHz) were collected with a point density of all echoes of 7.7-11.0 m(-2). For each acquisition, three different terrain models were used to process the ALS point clouds in order to assess the effects of different preprocessing parameters on the ability to detect small trees. Regardless of acquisition and terrain model, positive height values were found for 91% of the taller trees (>1 m). For smaller trees (<1 m), 29-61% of the trees displayed positive height values. For the lowest repetition frequencies (100 and 125 kHz) in particular, the portion of trees with positive laser height values increased significantly with increasing terrain smoothing. For the highest repetition frequency there were no differences between smoothing levels, likely because of large ALS measurement errors at low laser pulse energy levels causing a large portion of the laser echoes to be discarded during terrain modeling. Error analysis revealed large commission errors when detecting small trees. The commissions consisted of objects like terrain structures, rocks, and hummocks having positive height values. The magnitude of commissions ranged from 709 to 8948% of the true tree numbers and tended to increase with increasing levels of terrain smoothing and with acquisitions according to increasing point densities. The accuracy of tree height derived from the ALS data indicated a systematic underestimation of true tree height by 0.35 to 1.47 m. depending on acquisition, terrain model, and tree species. The underestimation also increased with increasing tree height. The standard deviation for the differences between laser-derived and field-measured tree heights was 0.16-0.57 m. Because there are significant effects of sensor and flight configurations on tree height estimation, field calibration of tree heights at each point of time is required when using airborne lasers for tree growth monitoring.

AB Imaging spectrometry, or hyperspectral imaging as it is now called, has had a long history of development and measured acceptance by the scientific community. The impetus for the development of imaging spectrometry came in the 1970's from field spectral measurements in support of Landsat-1 data analysis. Progress required developments in electronics, computing and software throughout the 1980's and into the 1990's before a larger segment of the Earth observation community would embrace the technique. The hardware development took place at NASA/JPL beginning with the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) in 1983. The airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) followed in 1987 and has proved to this day to be the prime provider of high-quality hyperspectral data for the scientific community. Other critical elements for the exploitation of this data source have been software, primarily ENVI, and field spectrometers such as those produced by Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. In addition, atmospheric correction algorithms have made it possible to reduce sensor radiance to spectral reflectance, the quantity required in all remote sensing applications. The applications cover the gambit of disciplines in Earth observations of the land and water. The further exploitation of hyperspectral imaging on a global basis awaits the launch of a high performance imaging spectrometer and more researchers with sufficient resources to take advantage of the vast information content inherent in the data.

AB Many of the habitats and resources which influence ecological functioning within National Parks, and protected areas in general, are located outside of their borders in unprotected areas. Hence, land use and land cover changes in surrounding areas may substantially influence the natural resources within parks. The US National Park Service has recognized these threats and incorporated land use and land cover monitoring into its Inventory and Monitoring Program. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework based on a conceptual approach for planning and implementing monitoring within this Program. We present a conceptual model, based on ecological theory, which illustrates how land use and land cover change impact park resources, and helps to identify monitoring indicators that will measure relevant attributes of land use and land cover change. We also discuss potential sources of data for quantifying indicators of land use and land cover change over time, including remote sensing data and ancillary spatial datasets. Finally, we describe steps for analyzing monitoring data so that the intensity and direction of changes in land use and land cover over time are quantified, as well as trends in the status of important park resources impacted by these changes. Integration of land use and land cover monitoring data and park resource data will allow for analysis of change from past to present, and can be used to project trends into the future to provide knowledge about potential land use and land cover change scenarios and ecological impacts. We illustrate our monitoring approach with an example from the Inventory and Monitoring Program's Greater Yellowstone Network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Various remote sensing products are used to identify spatial-temporal trends in snow cover in river basins originating in the Himalayas and adjacent Tibetan-Qinghai plateau. It is shown that remote sensing allows detection of spatial-temporal patterns of snow cover across large areas in inaccessible terrain, providing useful information on a critical component of the hydrological cycle. Results show large variation in snow cover between years while an increasing trend from west to east is observed. Of all river basins the Indus basin is, for its water resources, most dependent on snow and ice melt and large parts are snow covered for prolonged periods of the year. A significant negative winter snow cover trend was identified for the upper Indus basin. For this basin a hydrological model is used and forced with remotely sensed derived precipitation and snow cover. The model is calibrated using daily discharges from 2000 to 2005 and stream flow in the upper Indus basin can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. From the analysis it is concluded that there are indications that regional warming is affecting the hydrology of the upper Indus basin due to accelerated glacial melting during the simulation period. This warming may be associated with global changes in air temperature resulting from anthropogenic forcings. This conclusion is primarily based on the observation that the average annual precipitation over a five year period is less than the observed stream flow and supported by positive temperature trends in all seasons.

AB This study describes a comprehensive method to produce routinely regional maps of seasonal snow cover in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (upper Waitaki basin) on a subpixel basis, and with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The method uses an image fusion algorithm to produce snow maps at an improved 250 m spatial resolution in addition to the 500 m resolution snow maps. An iterative approach is used to correct imagery for both atmospheric and topographic effects using daily observations of atmospheric parameters. The computation of ground spectral reflectance enabled the use of image-independent end-members in a constrained linear unmixing technique to achieve a robust estimation of subpixel snow fractions. The accuracy of the snow maps and performance of the algorithm were assessed carefully using eight pairs of synchronic MODIS/ASTER images. 'Pixel-based' metrics showed that subpixel snow fractions were retrieved with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.8% at 250 m spatial resolution and 5.1% after aggregation at 500 m spatial resolution. In addition, a 'feature-based' metric showed that 90% of the snowlines were depicted generally within 300 m and 200 m of their correct position for the 500-m and 250-m spatial resolution snow maps, respectively. A dataset of 679 maps of subpixel snow fraction was produced for the period from February 2000 to May 2007. These repeated observations of the seasonal snow cover will benefit the ongoing effort to model snowmelt runoff in the region and to improve the estimation and management of water resources.

AB Conventional hydrologic analyses of digital elevation models (DEMs) perform well in areas of high topographic relief, where surface water flow is typically unidirectional, convergent, spatially static, and directed toward a single discharge point at the edge of a catchment. Such analyses do not perform well on landscapes with low topographic relief (e.g., floodplains, river deltas, coastal wetlands, and estuaries) where surface water flow is influenced by subtle topographic depressions and may be bidirectional, divergent, and spatially dynamic in response to hydrologic forcing such as tides or variation in river discharge. We developed a framework for hydrologic analysis of low-relief landscapes using a high-resolution (1 m) DEM derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data collected over a -8.8 km(2) section of the Umatilla River Floodplain, Oregon, USA. Our approach assessed the pattern and characteristics of "hydrologic facets" (landscape patches that have high internal surface water connectivity and therefore function as a single hydrologic unit), where facet boundaries were defined by subtle topographic divides across the floodplain. We initially identified nearly 6000 small (fine-scale) hydrologic facets using standard GIS processing algorithms. We located the divide between each pair of adjacent facets, and determined "hydrologic impedance" (i.e., the maximum change in river stage necessary to inundate the divide) for each divide (n = -17,000). Using hydrologic impedance values, we analyzed patterns of surface water connectivity among the fine-scale facets and aggregated groups of adjacent facets that had high connectivity. This process yielded a reduced number of larger facets useful for hydrologic analysis at coarser spatial scales. We compared results derived using several alternate rule sets for aggregating facets. With appropriate aggregation rules, the results are useful for generating optimal link-and-node flow networks to support hydrologic modeling of surface water flux across low-relief landscapes.

AB A deterministic approach for downscaling similar to 40 km resolution Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observations is developed from 1 km resolution MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To account for the lower soil moisture sensitivity of MODIS surface temperature compared to that of L-band brightness temperature, the disaggregation scale is fixed to 10 times the spatial resolution of MODIS thermal data (10 km). Four different analytic downscaling relationships are derived from MODIS and physically-based model predictions of soil evaporative efficiency. The four downscaling algorithms differ with regards to i) the assumed relationship (linear OF nonlinear) between soil evaporative efficiency and near-surface soil moisture, and ii) the scale at which soil parameters are available (40 km or 10 km). The I km resolution airborne L-band brightness temperature from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2006 (NAFE'06) are used to generate a time series of eleven clear sky 40 km by 60 km near-surface soil moisture observations to represent SMOS pixels across the three-week experiment. The overall root mean square difference between downscaled and observed soil moisture varies between 1.4% v/v and 1.8% v/v depending on the downscaling algorithm used, with soil moisture values ranging from 0 to 15% v/v. The accuracy and robustness of the downscaling algorithms are discussed in terms of their assumptions and applicability to SMOS. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,

AB Reefs of the tube-building polychaete Lattice conchilega are known to represent hotspots of biodiversity, within inter- and subtidal soft sediments of the North Sea. However, because of their patchy distribution, point sampling does not appropriately map their subtidal spatial distribution. This study evaluated the feasibility to detect L. conchilega reefs by very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery. A subtidal very-high resolution (410 kHz) side-scan survey, combined with grab sampling, revealed high densities of L. conchilega (up to 1979 ind. m(-2)) to coincide with a higher reflectivity, patchy and grainy acoustic facies. From the side-scan sonar imagery, individual reefs were estimated to reach a maximum size of 15 m(2). To ground truth the acoustic facies, the distribution of intertidal L. conchilega reefs was mapped at low tide and side-scan sonar imagery was recorded during the following high tide. Intertidal L. conchilega reefs had a patch size of 0.8 m(2) up to 11.6 m(2), elevated 7.5 to 11.5 cm above the surrounding seafloor and covered approximately 10% of the selected area. The very-high (445 kHz) resolution side-scan sonar imagery revealed a similar acoustic facies as in the subtidal. Lower-resolution (132 kHz) side-scan sonar imagery was less efficient to detect physically less developed L. conchilega reefs. We conclude that (1) there are no major technical restrictions to map L. conchilega reefs using side-scan sonar, (2) the developmental stage of L. conchilega reefs impacts the detectability of the reefs, and (3) very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery is considered a necessity when mapping small-scale structures, such as L. conchilega reefs.

AB An edge detection algorithm was developed that is capable of objectively detecting significant edges in remotely sensed images of the surface ocean. The algorithm utilizes a gradient-based edge detector that is less sensitive to noise in the input image than previously used detectors and has the ability to detect edges at different length scales. The algorithm was used to provide a statistical view of surface front occurrences in the Southern California Bight using six years of satellite observations of sea-surface temperature (AVHRR) and chlorophyll (SeaWiFS). Regions of high front occurrence probability were identified near capes, headlands, and islands. In onshore direction, chlorophyll concentration increased and temperature decreased, indicative of coastal upwelling. The algorithm was further applied to coincident time series of temperature and chlorophyll to investigate the event-scale dynamics of mesoscale features and the spatial relationships between physical and biological processes. A simple scheme for identifying and classifying eddies delineated by the edge detection algorithm was developed to yield a Census of eddy occurrence in the Southern California Bight.

AB Satellite soil moisture products, such as those from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), require diverse landscapes for validation. Semi-arid landscapes present a particular challenge to satellite remote sensing validation using traditional techniques because of the high spatial variability and potentially rapid rates of temporal change in moisture conditions. In this study, temporal stability analysis and spatial sampling techniques are used to investigate the representativeness of ground observations at satellite scale soil moisture in a semi-arid watershed for a long study period (March 1, 2002 to September 13, 2005). The watershed utilized, the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, has a dense network of 19 soil moisture sensors, distributed over a 150 km(2) study region. In conjunction with this monitoring network, intensive gravimetric soil moisture sampling conducted as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment in 2004 (SMEX04), contributed to the calibration of the network for large-scale estimation during the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). The sensor network is shown to be an excellent estimator of the watershed average with an accuracy of approximately 0.01 m(3)/m(3) soil moisture. However, temporal stability analysis indicated that while much of the network is stable, the soil moisture spatial pattern, as represented by mean relative difference, is not replicated by the network mean relative difference pattern. Rather, the network is composed of statistical samples. Geophysical aspects of the watershed, including topography and soil type are also examined for their influence on the soil moisture variability and stability. Soil type, as characterized by bulk density, clay and sand content, was responsible for nearly 50% of the temporal stability. Topographic effects were less important in defining representativeness and stability. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing-based variables including soil moisture (from AMSR-E), surface heat fluxes (from MODIS) and precipitation rates (from TRMM) are combined with North American Regional Reanalysis derived atmospheric components to examine the degree of hydrological consistency throughout these diverse and independent hydrologic data sets. The study focuses on the influence of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS) over the southwestern United States, and is timed to coincide with the SMEX04 North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME). The study is focused over the Arizona portion of the NAME domain to assist in better characterizing the hydrometeorological processes occurring across Arizona during the summer monsoon period. Results demonstrate that this multi-sensor approach, in combination with available atmospheric observations, can be used to obtain a comprehensive and hydrometeorologically consistent characterization of the land surface water cycle, leading to an improved understanding of water and energy cycles within the NAME region and providing a novel framework for future remote observation and analysis of the coupled land surface-atmosphere system.

AB Airborne scanning LiDAR systems are used to predict a range of forest attributes. However, the accuracy with which this can be achieved is highly dependent on the sensor configuration and the structural characteristics of the forest examined. As a result, there is a need to understand laser light interactions with forest canopies so that LiDAR sensor configurations can be optimised to assess particular forest types. Such optimisation will not only ensure the targeted forest attributes can be accurately and consistently quantified, but may also minimise the cost of data acquisition and indicate when a survey configuration will not deliver information needs.
   In this paper, we detail the development and application of a model to simulate laser interactions within forested environments. The developed model, known as the LiDAR Interception and Tree Environment (LITE) model, utilises a range of structural configurations to simulate trees with variable heights, crown dimensions and foliage clumping. We developed and validated the LITE model using field data obtained from three forested sites covering a range of structural classes. Model simulations were then compared to coincident airborne LiDAR data collected over the same sites. Results indicate that the LITE model can be used to produce comparable estimates of maximum height of trees within plots (differences <2.42 m), mean heights of first return data (differences <2.27 m), and canopy height percentiles (r(2) =0.94, p<0.001) when compared to airborne LiDAR data. In addition, the distribution of airborne LiDAR hits through the canopy profile was closely matched by model predictions across the range of sites. Importantly,, this demonstrates that the structural differences between forest stands can be characterised by LITE. Models that are capable of interpreting the response of small-footprint LiDAR waveforms can facilitate algorithm development, the generation of corrections for actual LiDAR data, and the optimisation of sensor configurations for differing forest types, benefiting a range of experimental and commercial LiDAR applications. As a result, we also performed a scenario analysis to demonstrate how differences in forest structure, terrain, and sensor configuration can influence the interception of LiDAR beams.

AB The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) technique has become extremely popular for a variety of forest inventory mapping and estimation applications. Much of this popularity may be attributed to the non-parametric, multivariate features of the technique, its intuitiveness, and its ease of use. When used with satellite imagery and forest inventory plot data, the technique has been shown to produce useful estimates of many forest attributes including forest/non-forest, volume, and basal area. However, variance estimators for quantifying the uncertainty of means or sums of k-NN pixel-level predictions for areas of interest (AOI) consisting of multiple pixels have not been reported. The primary objectives of the study were to derive variance estimators for AOI estimates obtained from k-NN predictions and to compare precision estimates resulting from different approaches to k-NN prediction and different interpretations of those predictions. The approaches were illustrated by estimating proportion forest area, tree volume per unit area, tree basal area per unit area, and tree density per unit area for 10-km AOIs. Estimates obtained using k-NN approaches and traditional inventory approaches were compared and found to be similar. Further, variance estimates based on different interpretations of k-NN predictions were similar. The results facilitate small area estimation and simultaneous and consistent mapping and estimation of multiple forest attributes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing represents a powerful tool to derive quantitative and qualitative information about ecosystem biodiversity. In particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales, attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data, researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation. This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness) heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within square plots of 100 m(2) nested in macroplots of 10,000 m(2). Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of 3 m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial resolution of 15 m for bands 1 to 3 and 30 m for bands 4 to 9), an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band 7 used; spatial resolution, 30 m), a resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically highly significant correlation with species richness (r=0.69) while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results (r=0.43, r=0.67, and r=0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+, and the resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery. Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus, one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial framework but even to a spectral one.

AB In this paper, we consider the direct solution of the kernel-based bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models for the retrieval of land surface albedos. This is an ill-posed problem due to nonuniqueness of the solution and the instability induced by error/noise and small singular values of the linearized system or the linear BRDF model. A robust inversion algorithm is critical for the BRDF/albedo retrieval from the limited number of satellite observations. We propose a promising algorithm for resolving this kind of ill-posed problem encountered in BRDF model inversion using remote sensing data.
   New techniques for robust estimation of BRDF model parameters are needed to cope with the scarcity of the number of observations. We are reminded by Cornelius Lanczos' dictum: "Lack of information cannot be remedied by mathematical trickery." Thus identifying a priori information or appropriate constraints, and the embedding of the information or constraints into the regularization algorithm, are pivotal elements of a retrieval algorithm. We develop a regularization method, which is called the numerically truncated singular value decomposition (NTSVD). The method is based on the spectrum of the linear driven kernel, and the a priori information/constraint is based on the minimization of the l(2) norm of the parameters vector. The regularization algorithm is tested using field data as well as satellite data. Numerical experiments with a subset of measurements for each site demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm.

AB Tree detection is a major focus in the field of (semi-) automatic extraction of forest information from very high resolution remote sensing data. Many existing tree crown delineation algorithms require a set of seed pixels to start the process of image segmentation. In this study, different methods of obtaining seed pixels (semi-) automatically from orthophotos and digital surface models derived from stereo digital camera imagery are tested and compared. The UltracamD digital camera provides images with a stereo overlap of about 90% and this paper presents a new method of DSM generation based on multiple stereo pairs. The evaluation of the DSMs shows that by using a multiple image approach, also referred to as block-based approach, the quality is significantly increased: the mean difference between the estimated values and 356 measured upper layer tree heights is only 0.77 m with a standard deviation of 2.39 m.
   In terms of seed generation, the morph algorithm (2d) used in this paper detected 64% of the trees visible in the aerial photos with an error margin of around 25% both for commission and omission in a dense natural forest. The orthophoto-based local maximum approach generally yielded lower accuracies and more multiple hits than the morph algorithm. 3d seed generation from the block based model returned about 70% correct hits for the upper tree canopy layer. All evaluations are performed based on field measurements and visual aerial photo interpretation. Furthermore, the dependence of successful tree detection on the dominance of a tree within the stand is analyzed. As expected, suppressed trees are more likely to be omitted. The segmentation proved to be useful, as the automatically generated segments had a similar number of correct hits as achieved by visual interpretation, with the only drawback being a higher error of commission.

AB The k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) algorithm is widely applied for the estimation of forest attributes using remote sensing data. It requires a large amount of reference data to achieve satisfactory results. Usually, the number of available reference plots for the kNN-prediction is limited by the size of the area covered by a terrestrial reference inventory and remotely sensed imagery collected from one overflight. The applicability of kNN could be enhanced if adjacent images of different acquisition dates could be used in the same estimation procedure. Relative radiometric calibration is a prerequisite for this. This study focuses on two empirical calibration methods. They are tested on adjacent LANDSAT TM scenes in Austria. The first, quite conventional one is based on radiometric control points in the overlap area of two images and on the determination of transformation parameters by linear regression. The other, recently developed method exploits the kNN-cross-validation procedure. Performance and applicability of both methods as well as the impact of phenology are discussed.

AB Burn severity is mapped after wildfires to evaluate immediate and long-term fire effects on the landscape. Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide important information about fine-scale ground cover components that are indicative of burn severity after large wildland fires. Airborne hyperspectral imagery and ground data were collected after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado to assess the application of high resolution imagery for burn severity mapping and to compare it to standard burn severity mapping methods. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), a partial spectral unmixing algorithm, was used to identify the spectral abundance of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation in the burned area. The overall performance of the MTMF for predicting the ground cover components was satisfactory (r(2) = 0.21 to 0.48) based on a comparison to fractional ash, soil, and vegetation cover measured on ground validation plots. The relationship between Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values and the ground data was also evaluated (r(2) -0.20 to 0.58) and found to be comparable to the MTMF. However, the quantitative information provided by the fine-scale hyperspectral imagery makes it possible to more accurately assess the effects of the fire on the soil surface by identifying discrete ground cover characteristics. These surface effects, especially soil and ash cover and the lack of any remaining vegetative cover, directly relate to potential postfire watershed response processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Greenland ice sheet has been the subject of mass balance and melt measurements over the past two decades and its margins have shown significant thinning in recent years. Surface characteristics of the ice sheet margins are strongly modified by the annual process of snow accumulation and melt. In this work, we explore spatial and temporal relationships between near-infrared albedo and surface roughness from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA's Terra satellite. Our study area is a region in western Greenland in the vicinity of Jakobshavn Glacier and its upland drainage basin. We compute near-infrared albedo from MISR data using imagery over the April to September period for 2000 through 2005. Near-infrared albedo is inversely related to both snow age and melt intensity. We map surface roughness using the Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) applied to MISR atmospherically corrected surface hemispherical-directional reflectance. In previous work, the NDAI has been correlated with surface roughness on the scale of about 70 m. We have further substantiated that relationship here. The NDAI and albedo images for each of the six years are used in an ISODATA unsupervised classification. Classification results for the individual years show year-to-year differences, which appear to depend on the number and temporal distribution of images with minimal cloud cover as well as interannual differences in ice sheet surface properties. The year 2003, which had the greatest number of images with minimal cloud cover, shows good correspondence with previously mapped glacier zones. However, we do not have an ISODATA class that corresponds to the dry-snow zone and we see greater differentiation between zones at lower elevations. Within each ISODATA class, distinct relationships between near-infrared albedo and surface roughness emerge and in all cases but one there is an inverse temporal relationship between albedo and roughness. The one class that shows a direct relationship between albedo and surface roughness is hypothesized to be the superimposed-ice zone. While still somewhat preliminary, these results suggest that concurrent measurements of near-infrared albedo and surface roughness have significant potential for ice sheet surface characterization as well as for ongoing monitoring.

AB . While nadir-viewing passive multispectral sensors have limited utility for characterizing the full dimensionality of forest canopies, multi-angle remote sensors such as the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) may improve detection of canopy architecture, canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI) of forest canopy versus understory vegetation. Our objective was to determine whether data from the MISR sensor could improve estimates of LAI across a post-fire ponderosa pine forest located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. We measured LAI during the 2002 and 2003 growing seasons and created continuous LAI maps using Landsat TM and ETM+ data (mean R-2=0.81). We fit linear regression models of total and canopy LAI, using a series of MISR at-nadir and off-nadir or anisotropic vegetation indices as predictor variables, for each of five sampling periods. We found the best LAI model fits using either a new hotspot-adjusted normalized difference vegetation index, NDVIHS, NDVI calculated from the -60 degrees view angle, or NDVI at-nadir and either the Hotspot-DarkSpot Index (RDS) or the normalized difference anisotrophic index (NDAX) (R-2 = 0.56-0.91). However, differences in fits of these best models and those including NDVI at-nadir ranged from only 1 to 8%. Reflectance anisotropy patterns related strongly to understory vegetation phenology. We found that the relationships among NDVI or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and canopy or total LAI showed little variation across view angles when the understory vegetation was senesced and significant anisotropy when understory green LAI was greatest. These findings demonstrate the value of multi-temporal measurements during periods of understory phenological change, even if the overstory LAI is relatively stable. We also evaluated the performance of the MISR LAI product and found moderate fits between the MISR LAI and our field- and Landsat-derived canopy LAI (R-2 =0.21-0.44). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Scanning Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) were analyzed to determine (1) which of the three sensor systems most accurately predicted forest biomass, and (2) if LiDAR and SAR/InSAR data sets, jointly considered, produced more accurate, precise results relative to those same data sets considered separately. LiDAR ranging measurements, VHF-SAR cross-sectional returns, and X- and P-band cross-sectional returns and interferometric ranges were regressed with ground-estimated (from dbh) forest biomass in ponderosa, pine forests in the southwestern United States. All models were cross-validated. Results indicated that the average canopy height measured by the scanning LiDAR produced the best predictive equation. The simple linear LiDAR equation explained 83% of the biomass variability (n = 52 plots) with a cross-validated root mean square error of 26.0 t/ha. Additional LiDAR metrics were not significant to the model. The GeoSAR P-band (lambda=86 cm) cross-sectional return and the GeoSAR/InSAR canopy height (X-P) captured 30% of the forest biomass variation with an average predictive error of 52.5 t/ha. A second RaDAR-FOPEN collected VHF (lambda similar to 7.8 m) and cross-polarized P-band (lambda = 88 cm) cross-sectional returns, none of which proved useful for forest biomass estimation (cross-validated R-2 =0.09, RMSE=63.7 t/ha). Joint consideration of LiDAR and RaDAR measurements produced a statistically significant, albeit small improvement in biomass estimation precision. The cross-validated R-2 increased from 83% to 84% and the prediction error decreased from 26.0 t/ha to 24.9 t/ha when the GeoSAR X-P interferometric height is considered along with the average LiDAR canopy height. Inclusion of a third LiDAR metric, the 60th decile height, further increased the R-2 to 85% and decreased the RMSE to 24.1 t/ha. On this I I km(2) ponderosa pine study area, LiDAR data proved most useful for predicting forest biomass. RaDAR ranging measurements did not improve the LiDAR estimates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this communication, we evaluate the performance of the relevance vector machine (RVM) for the estimation of biophysical parameters from remote sensing data. For illustration purposes, we focus on the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations from remote sensing reflectance just above the ocean surface. A variety of bio-optical algorithms have been developed to relate measurements of ocean radiance to in situ concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, and ultimately most of these algorithms demonstrate the potential of quantifying chlorophyll-a concentrations accurately from multispectral satellite ocean color data. Both satellite-derived data and in situ measurements are subject to high levels of uncertainty. In this context, robust and stable non-linear regression methods that provide inverse models are desirable.
   Lately, the use of the support vector regression (SVR) has produced good results in inversion problems, improving state-of-the-art neural networks. However, the SVR has some deficiencies, which could be theoretically alleviated by the RVM. In this paper, performance of the RVM is evaluated in terms of accuracy and bias of the estimations, sparseness of the solutions, robustness to low number of training samples, and computational burden. In addition, some theoretical issues are discussed, such as the sensitivity to training parameters setting, kernel selection, and confidence intervals on the predictions.
   Results suggest that RVMs offer an excellent trade-off between accuracy and sparsity of the solution, and become less sensitive to the selection of the free parameters. A novel formulation of the RVM that incorporates prior knowledge of the problem is presented and successfully tested, providing better results than standard RVM formulations, SVRs, neural networks, and classical bio-optical models for SeaWIFS, such as Morel, CalCOFI and OC2/OC4 models.

AB Land surface phenology is an important process for real-time monitoring and short-term forecasting in diverse land management, health, and hydrologic modeling applications. Yet current efforts to characterize phenological processes are limited by remote sensing challenges and lack of uncertainty estimates. Here, for a global distribution of phenologically and climatically similar phenoregions, we used the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to develop a conceptually and computationally simple technique for real-time and forecast applications. Our overall approach was to analyze the phenological behavior of groups of pixels without recourse to smoothing or fitting. We used a 3-step initial process: (1) define a phenoregion specific normalized difference vegetation index threshold; (2) for all days from 19822003, calculate the percent of pixels above the threshold (PAT); (3) calculate daily 1982-2003 empirical distributions of PAT. For real-time monitoring, the current PAT may then be compared to the historical range of variability and visualized in relation to user-defined levels. Using similar concepts, we projected daily PAT up to one month in the future and compared predicted and actual dates at which a hypothetical PAT was reached. We found that the maximum lead-time of phenological forecasts could be analytically defined for user-specified uncertainty levels. The approach is adaptable to different remote sensing technologies and provides a foundation for ascribing a sequence of ground conditions (e.g. snowmelt, vegetative growth, pollen production, insect phenology) to remotely sensed land surface phenology observations.

AB Field experiments (SMEX02) were conducted to evaluate the effects of dense agricultural crop conditions on soil moisture retrieval using passive microwave remote sensing. Aircraft observations were collected using a new version of the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) that provided four C band and four X band frequencies. Observations were also available from the Aqua satellite Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at these same frequencies. SMEX02 was conducted over a three-week period during the summer near Ames, Iowa. Corn and soybeans dominate the region. During the study period the corn was approaching its peak water content state and the soybeans were at the mid point of the growth cycle. Aircraft observations are compared to ground observations. Subsequently models are developed to describe the effects of corn and soybeans on soil moisture retrieval. Multiple altitude aircraft brightness temperatures were compared to AMSR-E observations to understand brightness temperature scaling and provide validation. The X-band observations from the two sensors were in reasonable agreement. The AMSR-E C-band observations were contaminated with anthropogenic RFI, which made comparison to the PSR invalid. Aircraft data along with ancillary data were used in a retrieval algorithm to map soil moisture. The PSR estimated soil moisture retrievals on a field-by-field comparison had a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 5.5%. The error reduced when high altitude soil moisture estimates were aggregated to 25 km resolution (same as AMSR-E EASE grid product resolution) (SEE similar to 2.85%). These soil moisture products provide a validation of the AMSR retrievals. PSR/CX soil moisture images show spatial and temporal patterns consistent with meteorological and soil conditions. The dynamic range of the PSR/CX observations indicates that reasonable soil moisture estimates can be obtained from AMSR, even in areas of high vegetation biomass content (similar to 4-8 kg/m2).

AB Remote sensing has become a common and effective method for estimating the areal coverage of land cover classes. One class of particular interest is agriculture as area estimates of cultivated lands are important for purposes such as estimating yields or irrigation needs. The synoptic coverage of satellite imagery and the relative ease of automated analysis have led to widespread mapping of agriculture using remote sensing. The accuracy of area estimates derived from these maps is known to be related to the accuracy of the maps. However, even in the situation where the map is very accurate, errors in area estimates may occur. These errors result from the behavior of the distribution of subpixel proportions of cultivated areas, and how that behavior changes as a result of sensor spatial resolution and class definitions. The sensitivity of estimates of cultivated areas to sensor spatial resolution and to the choice of threshold used to define cultivated land is explored in six agriculturally distinct locations around the world. Using a beta model for the distribution of subpixel proportions that is parameterized using variograms, it is possible to model the distribution of subpixel proportions for any spatial resolution. When the spatial resolution is small with respect to the spatial structure of the landscape (as measured by the variogram range) use of any class definition threshold produces an estimate very close to the true area coverage. On the other hand, as the resolution becomes coarse in relation to the variogram range, the subpixel proportions are no longer concentrated at the extremes of the distribution and the difference between the estimated and the true area has greater sensitivity to the selected threshold used to define classes. Thus, for the cases examined here, both the resolution and the class definition threshold have a strong influence on area estimates. The spatial resolutions where errors can be large depend on landscape spatial structure, which can be quantified using variograms. The net effect is that for the same spatial resolution, some places will exhibit much larger errors in area estimates than others. For the site in the Anhui province of China, where agricultural fields are very small (0.07 ha on the average), area estimates are highly sensitive to class definition thresholds even at the relatively fine resolution of 45 in. Conversely, in California (USA) spatial resolutions as coarse as 500 m can be used to reliably estimate cultivated areas. Results also suggest that the proportion of the total area that is cultivated significantly influences the accuracy of area estimates. When the area proportion is low, the class definition threshold must also be low to achieve an accurate area estimate. Conversely, in areas dominated by agriculture, a very stringent class definition of cultivated lands is required for accurate area estimates. While explored in the context of estimation of cultivated areas, the findings presented here are generic to the problem of area estimation using remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The primary goal of the SMOS mission is to deliver global fields of sea surface salinity and surface soil moisture using L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometry. Within the context of the preparation of SMOS activities over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January 2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both bare soil and fallow plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX combines land-surface-atmosphere observations, passive microwave measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years. The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal, seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over bare soil and fallow area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19 months). Soil freezing is shown to be drastically different for bare soil and vegetation covered plots, with a large threshold effect on microwave surface emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate spatial information on the location and extent of mountain pine beetle infestation is critical for the planning of mitigation and treatment activities. Areas of mixed forest and variable terrain present unique challenges for the detection and mapping of mountain pine beetle red-attack damage, as red-attack has a more heterogeneous distribution under these conditions. In this study, mountain pine beetle red-attack damage was detected and mapped using a logistic regression approach with a forward stepwise selection process and a set of calibration data representing samples of red-attack and non-attack from the study area. Variables that were considered for inclusion in the model were the enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) derived from a time series of Landsat remotely sensed imagery, elevation, slope, and solar radiation (direct, diffuse, and global). The output from the logistic regression was a continuous probability surface, which indicated the likelihood of red-attack damage. Independent validation data were used to assess the accuracy of the resulting models. The final model predicted red-attack damage with an accuracy of 86%. These results indicate that for this particular site, with mixed forest stands and variable terrain, remotely sensed and ancillary spatial data can be combined, through logistic regression, to create a mountain pine beetle red-attack likelihood surface that accurately identifies damaged forest stands. The use of a probabilistic approach reduces dependence upon the definition of change by the application of thresholds (upper and lower bounds of change) at the image processing stage. Rather, a change layer is generated that may be interpreted liberally or conservatively, depending on the information needs of the end user. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wildfire temperature retrieval commonly uses measured radiance from a middle infrared channel and a thermal infrared channel to separate fire emitted radiance from the background emitted radiance. Emitted radiance at shorter wavelengths, including the shortwave infrared, is measurable for objects above a temperature of 500 K. The spectral shape and radiance of thermal emission within the shortwave infrared can be used to retrieve fire temperature. Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were used to estimate fire properties and background properties for the 2003 Simi Fire in Southern California, USA. A spectral library of emitted radiance endmembers corresponding to a temperature range of 500-1500 K was created using the MODTRAN radiative transfer model. A second spectral library of reflected solar radiance endmembers, corresponding to four vegetation types and two non-vegetated surfaces, was created using image spectra selected by minimum endmember average root mean square error (RMSE). The best fit combination of an emitted radiance endmember and a reflected solar radiance endmember was found for each spectrum in the AVIRIS scene. Spectra were subset to reduce the effects of variable column water vapor and smoke contamination over the fire. The best fit models were used to produce maps of fire temperature, fire fractional area, background land cover, land cover fraction, and RMSE. The highest fire temperatures were found along the fire front, and lower fire temperatures were found behind the fire front. Saturation of shortwave infrared channels limited modeling of the highest fire temperatures. Spectral similarity of land cover endmembers and smoke impacted the accuracy of modeled land cover. Sensitivity analysis of modeled fire temperatures revealed that the range of temperatures modeled within 5% of minimum RMSE was smallest between 750 and 950 K. Hyperspectral modeling of wildfire temperature and fuels has potential application for fire monitoring and modeling. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A simple scheme is proposed to estimate instantaneous net radiation over large heterogeneous areas for clear sky days using only remote sensing observations. Our method attempts to develop an algorithm which primarily uses remote sensing information and eliminates the need for ground information as model input, by using various land and atmospheric data products available from Terra-MODIS. It explicitly recognizes the need for spatially varied parameters and provides a distributed net radiation map over large heterogeneous domain with fine spatial resolution. Since instantaneous net radiation estimates have limited scope compared to daily average values or diurnal cycle, a sinusoidal model is proposed to estimate diurnal cycle of net radiation. The sinusoidal model is capable of retrieving the diurnal variations of net radiation with a single instantaneous net radiation estimate from the satellite. Preliminary results, using data over Southern Great Plains, show good agreement with ground-based observations. It appears that the methodology presented here can estimate instantaneous and daily net radiation with comparable accuracy to those of current methods that use ground-based observations and mainly provide point estimates.

AB A complete and detailed map of the ice-velocity field on mountain glaciers is obtained by cross-correlating SPOT5 optical images. This approach offers an alternative to SAR interferometry, because no present or planned RADAR satellite mission provides data with a temporal separation short enough to derive the displacements of glaciers. The methodology presented in this study does not require ground control points (GCPs). The key step is a precise relative orientation of the two images obtained by adjusting the stereo model of one "slave" image assuming that the other "master" image is well georeferenced. It is performed with numerous precisely-located homologous points extracted automatically. The strong ablation occurring during summer time on the glaciers requires a correction to obtain unbiased displacements. The accuracy of our measurement is assessed based on a comparison with nearly simultaneous differential GPS surveys performed on two glaciers of the Mont Blanc area (Alps). If the images have similar incidence angles and correlate well, the accuracy is on the order of 0.5 m, or 1/5 of the pixel size. Similar results are also obtained without GCPs. An acceleration event, observed in early August for the Mer de Glace glacier, is interpreted in term of an increase in basal sliding. Our methodology, applied to SPOT5 images, can potentially be used to derive the displacements of the Earth's surface caused by landslides, earthquakes, and volcanoes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The carbon budget resulting from the dynamics of forest vegetation was estimated spatially for a study region with intensive land use change in the Central Amazonia forest. Vegetation height was recovered from airborne SAR interferometry, and was used along with an established relationship between forest height and age for mapping the successional stages of vegetation. A map of forest ages could be generated and validated (age RMSE was 3.5 years). Biomass stocks and annual rates of increment in biomass could be attributed to the forest ages by a comprehensive growth model for forests in the study area. A conceptual model of land use change was developed for the study area that accounts for four different types of land use: primary forest, secondary forest, degraded forest and nonforest. The transition probabilities between those land use types were recovered from internal modeling of available data, from literature sources, and from large-scale remote sensing results. The land use change matrix, area-age densities of secondary forests, and a growth model, yield a spatialized estimate of the carbon budget. The committed emissions from annual land use change were computed. For the year 2000-2001 the carbon balance was negative, on an area of ca. 5700 ha, land use dynamics resulted in a release of approximately 16,000 t of carbon, mainly arising from the cutting of primary forest for agricultural purposes. The secondary forest carbon budget was almost balanced, and forest degradation was revealed less important. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Lineaments of tectonic origin are often characterised by periodicity and characteristic spatial pattern. Unlike traditional methods of autocorrelation, variogram, lineament density and Fourier analysis, wavelet analysis is capable of capturing and describing both periodicity and spatial pattern of lineaments. In this paper, a case study is shown for the application of wavelet analysis to morphotectonic lineament investigation. Results of wavelet analysis are compared to traditional methods. Although this study involves DEM-derived morphological lineaments, the presented wavelet analysis can be also used for lineaments derived from remotely sensed images. These results hold for this case study and provide a good assessment of the relative abilities of wavelet analysis, but it remains to be seen how effective it is for other data sources, areas and geological terrain.

AB Regular estimates of regional pasture growth rate (PGR) would prove invaluable for wool producers in the agricultural zone of Western Australia (WA) wishing to adopt efficient techniques of managing the supply of annual pasture. Data from the AVHRR sensor are routinely processed to provide bi-monthly NDVI (normalised difference vegetation index) composite images of the agricultural zone of WA. We used a time series of NDVI imagery for 1995 to 1998 together with coincident climate layers in a light use efficiency (LUE) model to generate PGR maps for WA. We only operated the model for areas of the agricultural zone where pasture constituted more than 60% of the land cover. The regional estimates were compared with whole-farm averages made at three farms using pasture exclosures positioned across the main land management units (LMUs) on each property. Significant relationships were obtained between predicted and observed PGR for the three farms Kojonup, Porongurup and Williams of R-2 0.67, 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. A validation study in 1999 at five farms used a potential productivity index for LMUs to scale the regional estimates down to paddock level. The relationship between predicted and observed PGR, for data averaged by LMU, had an R-2 of 0.69. Given that little information on regional PGR currently exists, estimates generated by such LUE models from in-line AVHRR processing made available on the internet or by subscription can greatly improve the basis for feed management across wool growing enterprises in the south west of WA. This approach could readily be applied to other highly seasonal grazing systems around the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring the dynamics of the circumpolar boreal forest (taiga) and Arctic tundra boundary is important for understanding the causes and consequences of changes observed in these areas. This ecotone, the world's largest, stretches for over 13,400 km and marks the transition between the northern limits of forests and the Southern margin of the tundra. Because of the inaccessibility and large extent of this zone, remote sensing data can play an important role for mapping the characteristics and monitoring the dynamics. Basic understanding of the capabilities of existing space borne instruments for these purposes is required. In this study we examined the use of several remote sensing techniques for characterizing the existing tundra-taiga ecotone. These include Landsat-7, MISR, MODIS and RADARSAT data. Historical cover maps, recent forest stand measurements and high-resolution IKONOS images were used for local ground truth.
   It was found that a tundra-taiga transitional area can be characterized using multi-spectral Landsat ETM+ summer images, multi-angle MISR red band reflectance images, RADARSAT images with larger incidence angle, or multi-temporal and multi-spectral MODIS data. Because of different resolutions and spectral regions covered, the transition zone maps derived from different data types were not identical, but the general patterns were consistent.

AB The Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02) were conducted in Iowa between June 25th and July 12th, 2002. A major aim of the experiments was examination of existing algorithms for soil moisture retrieval from active and passive microwave remote sensors under high vegetation water content conditions. The data obtained from the passive and active L and S band sensor (PALS) along with physical variables measured by in situ sampling have been used in this study to demonstrate the sensitivity of the instrument to soil moisture and perform soil moisture retrieval using statistical regression and physical modeling techniques. The land cover conditions in the region studied were predominantly soybean and corn crops with average vegetation water contents ranging from 0 to similar to5 kg/m(2). The PALS microwave sensitivity to soil moisture under these vegetation conditions was investigated for both passive and active measurements. The performance of the PALS instrument and retrieval algorithms has been analyzed, indicating soil moisture retrieval errors of approximately 0.04 g/g gravimetric soil moisture. Statistical regression techniques have been shown to perform satisfactorily with soil moisture retrieval error of around 0.05 g/g gravimetric soil moisture. The retrieval errors were higher for the com than for the soybean fields due to the higher vegetation water content of the corn crops. However, the algorithms performed satisfactorily over the full range of vegetation conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB When assessing fire danger, interpolation of the dependent variable historic fire occurrence-is required in order to statistically compare and analyze it with human factors, environmental parameters and census statistics. To confirm the compatibility between the distinct data types, occasionally, for this kind of spatial analysis, historical observations of the primary wildland fire (given as x and y coordinates) must be transformed either to continuous surfaces or to area data. The simple overlay approach converts single point observations to area data. However, this procedure assumes lack of spatial uncertainties that would otherwise result in serious errors caused by the positional inaccuracies of the original point observations.
   Here, we used kernel density interpolation to convert the original data on wildland fire ignition into an expression of areal units, defined by a raster grid and, subsequently, by the administrative borders of the municipalities in two study areas in Spain. By overlaying a normal bivariate probability density function (kernel) over each point observation, each ignition point was considered an uncertain point location rather than an exact one.

AB Although the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data, derived from NOAA/AVFIRR, SPOT/VEGETATION, TERRA or AQUA/MODIS, has been successfully used in research regarding global environmental change, residual noise in the NDVI time-series data, even after applying strict pre-processing, impedes further analysis and risks generating erroneous results. Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Structural and functional analyses of ecosystems benefit when high accuracy vegetation coverages can be derived over large areas. In this study, we utilize IKONOS, Landsat 7 ETM+, and airborne scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) to quantify coniferous forest and understory grass coverages in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated ecosystem in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Linear spectral mixture analyses of IKONOS and ETM+ data were used to isolate spectral endmembers (bare soil, understory grass, and tree/shade) and calculate their subpixel fractional coverages. We then compared these endmember cover estimates to similar cover estimates derived from lidar data and field measures. The IKONOS-derived tree/shade fraction was significantly correlated with the field-measured canopy effective leaf area index (LAI(c)) (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001) and with the lidar-derived estimate of tree occurrence.(r(2) = 0.79, p < 0.001). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated from IKONOS imagery showed a negative correlation with the field measured tree canopy effective LAI and lidar tree cover response (r(2) = 0.30, r = 0.55 and r(2) = 0.41, r = -0.64, respectively; p < 0.001) and further analyses indicate a strong linear relationship between EVI and the IKONOS-derived grass fraction (r(2) = 0.99, p < 0.001). We also found that using EVI resulted in better agreement with the subpixel vegetation fractions in this ecosystem than using normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI). Coarsening the IKONOS data to 30 in resolution imagery revealed a stronger relationship with lidar tree measures (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001) than at 4 in resolution (r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.001). Unmixed tree/shade fractions derived from 30 in resolution ETM+ imagery also showed a significant correlation with the lidar data (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the power of using high resolution lidar data to validate spectral unmixing results of satellite imagery, and indicate that IKONOS data and Landsat 7 ETM+ data both can serve to make the important distinction between tree/shade coverage and exposed understory grass coverage during peak summertime greenness in a ponderosa pine forest ecosystem.

AB Individual trees can be detected using high-density airborne laser scanner data. Also, variables characterizing the detected trees such as tree height, crown area, and crown base height can be measured. The Scandinavian boreal forest mainly consists of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and deciduous trees. It is possible to separate coniferous from deciduous trees using near-infrared images, but pine and spruce give similar spectral signals. Airborne laser scanning, measuring structure and shape of tree crowns could be used for discriminating between spruce and pine. The aim of this study was to test classification of Scots pine versus Norway spruce on an individual tree level using features extracted from airborne laser scanning data. Field measurements were used for training and validation of the classification. The position of all trees on 12 rectangular plots (50 X 20 in 2) were measured in field and tree species was recorded. The dominating species (>80%) was Norway spruce for six of the plots and Scots pine for six plots. The field-measured trees were automatically linked to the laser-measured trees. The laser-detected trees on each plot were classified into species classes using all laser-detected trees on the other plots as training data. The portion correctly classified trees on all plots was 95%. Crown base height estimations of individual trees were also evaluated (r=0.84). The classification results in this study demonstrate the ability to discriminate between pine and spruce using laser data. This method could be applied in an operational context. In the first step, a segmentation of individual tree crowns is performed using laser data. In the second step, tree species classification is performed based on the segments. Methods could be developed in the future that combine laser data with digital near-infrared photographs for classification with the three classes: Norway spruce, Scots pine, and deciduous trees.

AB Up-to-date, accurate topographic data are a crucial resource for volcanic research and risk mitigation efforts, in particular, for modeling volcanic flow processes at a detailed spatial resolution. In this paper, we examine the utility of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument currently operating on the NASA Terra satellite, which provides near infrared (VNIR) stereo imaging from which topography can be derived. We wrote software to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) from the ASTER level 1A product, which employs an automated stereo matching technique to calculate the parallax offsets between the images acquired by the nadir- and aft-looking sensors. Comparison of ASTER DEMs with DEMs derived from other sources (digitized 1:50 K topographic maps and aerial interferometric radar) at Ruapehu volcano reveal an RMS error of about 10 in for the ASTER DEM, in the absence of significant atmospheric water vapor. A qualitative assessment of surface features showed that the ASTER DEM is superior to the interpolated 1:50 K map product but falls short of the detail provided by aerial interferometric radar, especially in terms of stream channel preservation. A second ASTER DEM was generated for Taranaki volcano, where previously only 1:50 K topographic map data were available. Although the 2000 Space Shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) will largely remedy the previous global paucity of adequate topographic data at volcanoes, such as Taranaki, we anticipate the problem that at active volcanoes, the topography may change significantly following activity, rendering the SRTM data inaccurate. With the high temporal coverage of the dataset, ASTER not only provides a means to update significant (>10 in) topographic measurements at active volcanoes via a time-series of DEMs, but also provides a simultaneous means to map surface cover and localized land-use via the near infrared sensors. Thus we demonstrate the potential for up-to-date volcanic economic risk assessment using geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The so-called hot spot is a fine directional signature of the surface reflectance observed for phase angles close to zero. In this paper, we analyze and discuss several such signatures acquired from the airborne POLDER and HyMap instruments during the DAISEX'99 campaign over agricultural crops. The observed signatures are very similar to those acquired from space at a resolution of several tens of kilometers [J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)], which provides further evidence that the hot spot is a scale-free feature. The hot spots can be fitted by a two-parameter function (amplitude and width) of the phase angle derived from canopy radiative transfer modeling. The model predicts that the amplitude is directly related to the leaf reflectance, while the width is a function of the canopy structure. The retrieved leaf reflectance values over a wide spectral range are in very good agreement with noncoincident laboratory measurement. The retrieved half widths are on the order of 1degrees with no significant variability between the analyzed targets. There is an apparent spectral variability in the half width, a feature in contradiction with the modeling, although the variations are not larger than the uncertainties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth is performed by inverting Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures at 19 and 37 GHz using artificial neural network ANN-based techniques. The SSM/I used data, which consist of Pathfinder Daily EASE-Grid brightness temperatures, were supplied by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC). They were gathered during the period of time included between the beginning of 1996 and the end of 1999 all over Finland. A ground snow data set based on observations of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) was used to estimate the performances of the technique. The ANN results were confronted with those obtained using the spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm, the HUT model-based iterative inversion and the Chang algorithm, by comparing the RMSE, the R-2, and the regression coefficients. In general, it was observed that the results obtained through ANN-based technique are better than, or comparable to, those obtained through other approaches, when trained with simulated data. Performances were very good when the ANN were trained with experimental data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Among microphytobenthic species (unicellular algae and cyanobacteria), benthic diatoms are often the most common photosynthetic organisms colonizing shallow marine environment such as an intertidal flat. As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic, diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll e. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration.

AB Ten IKONOS images of different coral reef sites distributed around the world were processed to assess the potential of 4-m resolution multispectral data for coral reef habitat mapping. Complexity of reef environments, established by field observation, ranged from 3 to 15 classes of benthic habitats containing various combinations of sediments, carbonate pavement, seagrass, algae, and corals in different geomorphologic zones (forereef, lagoon, patch reef, reef flats). Processing included corrections for sea surface roughness and bathymetry, unsupervised or supervised classification, and accuracy assessment based on ground-truth data. IKONOS classification results were compared with classified Landsat 7 imagery for simple to moderate complexity of reef habitats (5-11 classes). For both sensors, overall accuracies of the classifications show a general linear trend of decreasing accuracy with increasing habitat complexity. The IKONOS sensor performed better, with a 15-20% improvement in accuracy compared to Landsat. For IKONOS, overall accuracy was 77% for 4-5 classes, 71% for 7-8 classes, 65% in 9-11 classes, and 53% for more than 13 classes. The Landsat classification accuracy was systematically lower, with an average of 56% for 5-10 classes. Within this general trend, inter-site comparisons and specificities demonstrate the benefits of different approaches. Pre-segmentation of the different geomorphologic zones and depth correction provided different advantages in different environments. Our results help guide scientists and managers in applying IKONOS-class data for coral reef mapping applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere(LBA) experiment in Amazonia represents a unique opportunity to make a comprehensive study of the Amazon region and its component ecosystems. To make sense of the field studies and to generalize the results from them, remote sensing techniques and comprehensive mapping are critical elements for producing region-wide science results. In this paper, we present the processing work done for one such mapping campaign, that of the JERS-1 L-band two season (low and high-flood) SAR data collected in 1995 and 1996. Specifically, to make a useable resource for other LBA researchers to explore, the datasets from the two seasons had to be coregistered (to a sub-pixel level), radiometrically calibrated, and interpreted to verify the quality of the data. This paper describes the techniques used to achieve these goals and an estimate of the land cover based on a simple classification of the data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral reflectance (438 to 884 nm) data were recorded at five different growth stages of winter wheat in a field experiment including two cultivars, three plant densities, and four levels of N application. All two-band combinations in the normalized difference vegetation index (lambda1 - lambda2)/(lambda1 +lambda2) were subsequently used in a linear regression analysis against green biomass (GBM, g fresh weight m(-2) soil), leaf area index (LAI, m(2) green leaf m(-2) soil), leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl(conc), mg chlorophyll g(-1) leaf fresh weight), leaf chlorophyll density (Chl(density), mg chlorophyll m(-2) soil), leaf nitrogen concentration N-conc, mg nitrogen g(-1) leaf dry weight), and leaf nitrogen density (N-density, g nitrogen m(-2) soil). A number of grouped wavebands with high correlation (R-2>95%) were revealed. For the crop variables based on quantity per unit surface area, i.e. GBM, LAI, Chl(density), and N-density, these wavebands had in the majority (87%) of the cases a center wavelength in the red edge spectral region from 680 to 750 nm and the band combinations were often paired so that both bands were closely spaced in the steep linear shift between R-red and R-nir, The red edge region was almost absent for bands related to Chl(conc) and N-conc, where the visible spectral range, mainly in the blue region, proved to be better. The selected narrow-band indices improved the description of the influence of all six-crop variables compared to the traditional broad- and short-band indices normally applied on data from satellite, aerial photos, and field spectroradiometers. For variables expressed on the basis of soil or canopy surface area, the relationship was further improved when exponential curve fitting was used instead of linear regression. The best of the selected narrow-band indices was compared to the results of a partial least square regression (PLS). This comparison showed that the narrow-band indices related to LAI and Chl(conc), and to some extent also Chl(density) and N-density, were optimal and could not be significantly improved by PLS using the information from all wavelengths in the hyperspectral region. However, PLS improved the prediction of GBM and N-conc by lowering the RMSE with 22% and 24%, respectively, compared to the best narrow-band indices. It is concluded that PLS regression analysis may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied on hyperspectral reflectance data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations predict that a complete deforestation of the Amazon basin would lead to a significant climate change; however, it is more difficult to determine the amount of deforestation that would lead to a detectable climate change. This paper examines whether cloudiness has already changed locally in the Brazilian arc of deforestation, one of the most deforested regions of the Amazon basin, where over 15% of the primary forest has been converted to pasture and agriculture. Three pairs of deforested/forested areas have been selected at a scale compatible with that of climate model grids to compare changes in land cover with changes in cloudiness observed in satellite data over a 10-year period from 1984 to 1993. Analysis of cloud cover trends suggests that a regional climate change may already be underway in the most deforested part of the arc of deforestation. Although changes in cloud cover over deforested areas are not significant for interannual variations, they are for the seasonal and diurnal distributions. During the dry season, observations show more low-level clouds in early afternoon and less convection at night and in early morning over deforested areas. During the wet season, convective cloudiness is enhanced in the early night over deforested areas. Generally speaking, the results suggest that deforestation may lead to increased seasonality; however, some of the differences observed between deforested and forested areas may be related to their different geographical locations.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural property of vegetation canopy and is also one of the basic quantities driving the algorithms used in regional and global biogeochemical, ecological and meteorological applications. LAI can be estimated from remotely sensed data through the vegetation indices (VI) and the inversion of a canopy radiative transfer (RT) model. In recent years, applications of the genetic algorithms (GA) to a variety of optimization problems in remote sensing have been successfully demonstrated. In this study, we estimated LAI by integrating a canopy RT model and the GA optimization technique. This method was used to retrieve LAI from field measured reflectance as well as from atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ data. Four different ETM+ band combinations were tested to evaluate their effectiveness. The impacts of using the number of the genes were also examined. The results were very promising compared with field measured LAI data, and the best results were obtained with three genes in which the R 2 is 0.776 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.064.

AB The utility of multi-angle optical remote sensing for terrestrial carbon cycle estimation is demonstrated through theoretical development, POLDER data analysis, and a case study of carbon cycle in a boreal forest. Progress in canopy-level photosynthesis modeling suggests that simpler big-leaf photosynthesis models are giving ways to more complex sunlit/shaded leaf separation models. This advancement in ecological modeling has increased the demand for advanced description of canopy architecture. Such demand may be mostly met through the use of multi-angle remote sensing techniques. In addition to leaf area index (LAI), another canopy parameter, the foliage clumping index, can be derived from multi-angle remote sensing. These two parameters are the basis for separating sunlit and shaded leaves. As leaf photosynthesis is nonlinearly related to incident radiation, such separation avoids the problems of big-leaf models that only make use of the total radiation absorption by the canopy without considering the distribution of radiation among leaves. A practical conclusion is that the traditional way of mapping the net primary productivity (NPP) through its correlation with the remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by plant canopies is only a very crude approximation and could be replaced with mapping LAI and clumping index and modeling NPP with advanced photosynthesis models. This is a step forward in remote sensing applications because single-angle remote sensing can only acquire information on the effective LAI related to the canopy gap fraction in the viewing direction and the amount of shaded leaf area is unknown.

AB Ordination and cluster analysis are two common methods used by plant ecologists to organize species abundance data into discrete "associations". When applied together, they offer useful information about the relationships among species and the ecological processes occurring within a community. Remote sensing provides surrogate data for characterizing the spatial distribution of ecological classes based on the assumption of characteristic reflectance of species and species associations. Currently, there exists a need to establish and clarify the link between theories and practices of classification by ecologists and remote sensing scientists. In this study, high spatial resolution Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) reflectance data were examined and compared to plant community data for a peatland complex in northern Manitoba, Canada. The goal of this research was to explore the relationship between classification of species cover and community data and reflectance values. Ordination and cluster analysis techniques were used in conjunction with spectral separability measures to organize clusters of community-based data that were suitable for classification of CASI reflectance data, while still maintaining their ecological significance. Results demonstrated that two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) clusters did not correspond well to spectral reflectance and gave the lowest classification results of the methods investigated. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with ecological classes defined by combining the information obtained from a suite of analysis techniques (i.e., TWINSPAN, correspondence analysis (CA), and signature separability analysis), albeit not statistically superior to the classification obtained from the signature separability analysis alone.

TI Stratified estimation of forest area using satellite imagery, inventory
   data, and the <i>k</i>-Nearest Neighbors technique
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VOLUME
AB For two large study areas in Minnesota, USA, stratified estimation using classified Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery as the basis for stratification was used to estimate forest area. Measurements of forest inventory plots obtained for a 12-month period in 1998 and 1999 were used as the source of data for within-stratum estimates. These measurements further served as calibration data for a k-Nearest Neighbors technique that was used to predict forest land proportion for image pixels. The continuum of forest land proportion predictions was separated into strata to facilitate stratified estimation. The k-Nearest Neighbors technique is carefully explained, five precautions are noted, and a plea is made for an objective approach to calibrating the technique. The variances of the stratified forest area estimates were smaller by factors as great as 5 than variances of the arithmetic mean calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling. In addition, when including all plots over a 5-year plot measurement cycle, the forest area precision estimates may be expected to satisfy national standards. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Forest succession is a fundamental ecological phenomenon, which has significant implications for sustainable ecosystem management as well as biological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing is perhaps the only viable option for monitoring changes in forest ecosystems over large areas in a timely and cost efficient manner. This study investigates the spatial manifestation of forest succession in optical imagery through three types of models: a two-component spatial model, a canopy reflectance model (Geometric-Optical and Radiative Transfer, GORT) and a forest ecosystem dynamics model (ZELIG). The latter two models provide inputs to the former one to predict the spatial properties of images as a function of the combined effects of tree size and density, the spectral signatures of scene components and pixel size. An important source of information that is diagnostic of canopy structure has been identified: the spatial properties of multiresolution imagery. The sill of variograms of images of forest stands decrease with regularization, and in particular the rate of decrease is related to the size of trees. For stands with larger trees the sills of variograms decrease more slowly with increasing regularization than for stands with smaller trees. However, the spatial patterns for a scene with multiresolution imagery are also dependent on tree cover. This implies that the use of spatial patterns to estimate tree size will require independent estimates of tree cover as a preliminary step. Concept verification with an Ikonos 1-m panchromatic image for stands at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascade Range of Oregon indicates the simulated spatial patterns exist in multiresolution imagery. This study demonstrates the potential to map tree size automatically from multiresolution imagery. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) mission provided satellite observations of Total Column Water Vapour (TCWV) over land, in clear sky conditions, between November 1996 and June 1997. For this study, POLDER TCWV estimates are corrected for the calibration and surface biases pointed out previously by validation work. ECMWF analyses of humidity are then compared to POLDER fields on a daily basis and on monthly average. They appear in good agreement with POLDER over most Northern Hemisphere continents except the Asian plateau showing significant discrepancies in June. The major differences appear in tropical regions where few radiosondes are available, especially over the eastern part of Africa with persistent excess of moisture between March and May and over South America with more variable situations. Differences appear mainly off the maximum intensity of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) showing a problem of the forecasting system in positioning the convective activity when it is not forced by appropriate observations. The position and intensity of discrepancies vary along the year depending on the seasonal variations of the ITCZ and on how dense the radiosonde network is in convective areas.

AB Airborne multispectral data were acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectral Imager (CASI) for an agricultural area in Denmark with the purpose of quantifying vegetation amount and variations in the physiological status of the vegetation. Spectral reflectances, vegetation indices, and red edge positions were calculated on the basis of the CASI data and compared to field measurements of green leaf area index (LAI; L) and canopy nitrogen concentrations (N-c) sampled at 16 sites. Because of the variety of the samples with respect to vegetation type, leaf age, and phenological developmental stage, the data of L and Nc were uncorrelated. The scattering effect of leaves effectuated a robust linear relationship between L and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance (r=.93), whereas the N-c (vegetative period) was significantly correlated with the spectral reflectance in the green (r=-.88) and far-red wavebands (r=-.94). The correlations between vegetation indices and L were also important, in particular, for the enhanced vegetation index (EVI; r=.88), whereas the red edge position correlated less significantly with N-c (r=.78). Assuming L and Nc to be responsible for most of the spatial variability in the CO2 assimilation rates, remote sensing-based maps of these variables were produced for use in a coupled sun/shade photosynthesis/transpiration model. The predicted rates of net photosynthesis and transpiration compared reasonably with eddy covariance measurements Of CO2 and water vapour fluxes recorded at four different crop fields. The results allowed evaluation of the spatial variations in the photosynthetic light, nitrogen, and water use efficiencies. While photosynthesis was linearly related to the transpiration, the light use efficiency (LUE) was found to be dependent on nitrogen concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID CATCHMENT
AB The statistical structure of soil moisture fields was examined using large-scale images (40 x 250 km) obtained during the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP'97) hydrology experiment. In particular, empirical scaling analysis was conducted to investigate the linkages between the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, and landscape characteristics including terrain, soils, and vegetation. The results show that the soil moisture fields exhibit multiscaling and multifractal behavior varying with the scales of observation and hydrometeorological forcing. A break in statistical symmetry (multiscaling behavior) was identified, which separates the spatial and temporal evolution of the statistical structure of soil moisture fields for wavelengths below and above 10 km, the alpha- and beta-scale ranges, respectively. Specifically, the multiscaling behavior is consistent with the scaling behavior of soil hydraulic properties as described by soil texture parameters such as sand and clay content. The multifractal behavior is associated with the temporal evolution of drying and wetting regimes, reflecting the nonlinear character of soil moisture dynamics. Finally, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was conducted to explain the relationship between the spatial structure of estimated soil moisture and that of ancillary data including topography, soil texture, and vegetation cover. Topography appears to dominate the spatial structure of soil moisture only during and immediately after rainfall. In interstorm periods, the spatial evolution of soil moisture is closely associated with the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties when the soil is above field capacity, while vegetation dominates the evolution of soil moisture fields through evapotranspiration as the landscape dries down.

AB Coastal polynyas in the Arctic basin from the A inter period (January to April) are characterized using ESA European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS)-1/2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Precision (Precise Image, PRI) and Browse images. A SAR polynya algorithm is used to delineate open water, new ice, and young ice, and to define the size and shape of polynyas. In order to extract radiometric and contextual information in the ERS SAR PRI images. three different image classification routines are developed and applied. No in situ data have been available for verification of the polynya shapes and sizes, but one of the ice classification routines have been verified earlier using ground truth data. The SAR polynya algorithm is demonstrated to be able to discriminate between the polynya and the surrounding ice area for 85 analyzed cases. The results from the SAR algorithm are compared to ERS Browse images. passive microwave data (a recent Polynya Signature Simulation Method (PSSM), and the Bootstrap and the NASA Team ice concentration algorithms), and a numerical polynya model (NPM) forced by National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) wind fields and air temperatures. The ERS SAR Browse images show a relatively good correlation with the ERS SAR PRI images (.88) while the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Bootstrap and the NASA Team ice concentration algorithms both have low correlation coefficients (below .3). The PSSM calculates the polynya shape and size, and delineates open water and thin ice. For polynyas of all sizes it has a correlation of .69 compared to the SAR PRI images. For polynyas with widths greater than 10 km the correlation increases to .83. The NPM computes offshore coastal polynya widths, heat exchange. and ice production. Compared to SAR data, it overestimates the maximum size of the polynya by about 15% and has a correlation of .71 compared to the analyzed SAR PRI images. The polynyas in our main investigation area, located at Franz Josef Land, are found to be primarily wind driven. The surrounding large-scale ice drift and tidal currents have little effect on the polynya behavior. One overall conclusion from this investigation is that SAR images processed through the SAR polynya algorithm in combination with the NPM is a powerful tool for investigating and characterizing polynyas at various scales in the Arctic.

AB Because of the importance of detecting climate change signals over Antarctica, we examined the dependence of the snow's effective temperature times its emissivity (brightness temperature) on surface air temperatures over Antarctica. A range of microwave frequencies and various time scales from daily to yearly is considered. Reasonable accuracy of the air temperature should be obtained without including the annual variation of the emissivity. We studied the sensitivity of the inferred air temperature to penetration depth, a determinant parameter for the effective temperature, and used a snow dielectric constant model derived from strong fluctuation theory. Below 10 GHz. the snow cover temperature and layering determine this depth, whereas above 20 GHz, the determinant factor is the snow crystal sized all parameter have an effect at intermediate frequencies. The penetration depth ranges for the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) channels are the following: 20-40 m at 6.6 GHz. 6-16 in at 10.7 GHz, about 1-5 m at 18 GHz, and 0.1-1.4 m at 37 GHz. Analysis of the effective temperature revealed that the snow effective temperature can explain short-term fluctuations at 37 GHz and annual trends for all SMMR channels, For short-term fluctuations (< 10 days), calculations and measurements showed that the brightness temperature at 3 7 GHz starts to respond immediately to the air temperature changes, even though the time to reach the maximum is delayed by a day or less: furthermore, the amplitude of the resulting fluctuation was sufficiently large to be detectable in most cases. Indeed, short-term fluctuations of the air temperature can clearly be detected from significant variations of the air temperature over 3 days. but small amplitude fluctuations shorter than 1 day will hardly be detectable through the brightness temperature. This limits use of the brightness temperature at 37 GHz. and this is a point to consider for inversion models, Nevertheless, air temperature fluctuations over 2-3 days can be detected: thus, this technique could be used to observe the winter warming periods in Antarctica that often occur, even during cloudy periods.

AB In this paper, the rain detection capability of the dual-frequency (Ku and C band) radar altimeter onboard, the non-sun-synchronous TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite is exploited to study the diurnal variability of rainfall over Indian oceanic regions during the southwest monsoon season. The study is done using three consecutive years (1993, 1994 and 1995) of T/P altimeter data. Based on the difference of normalized backscattered coefficient, Delta sigma degrees (C-Ku band), the T/P satellite observations are categorized into three different classes of "no rain." "low rain," and "high rain." The data is further divided into 12 time intervals of 2 h each, starting from 0000 to 2400 Z. The uneven distribution of observations in each time interval due to orbit characteristics of T/P satellite is removed. The histograms of rain events are plotted for the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea to study diurnal and regional variability of rain events. The variation of rainfall intensity, within "high-rain" category, over the two regions is also studied. The results showed that there is no consistent diurnal variability of rainfall exist over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal regions from year to year. However, the 3-year composite data shows more rain events over the Arabian Sea at early morning hours between 0000 and 0200 GMT. This is verified by concurrently available TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR) observations of rain events. The intensity of rain rate also does not show any marked diurnal variability. The probability of rain events is significantly high over the Bay of Bengal region compared to the Arabian Sea region. This is also verified with TMR-based analysis. Further, interannual variability of rain events and amount over the two regions from Delta sigma degrees -based analysis is also discussed in association with interannual variations in the monsoon activities over these two regions.

AB The scattering from arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) model was combined with the Jasinski geometric model to simulate canopy spectral reflectance and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR),) for discontinuous canopies. This model is called the GeoSail model. Tree shapes are described by cylinders or cones distributed over a plane. Spectral reflectance and transmittance of trees are calculated from the SAIL model to determine the reflectance of the three components of the geometric model: illuminated canopy, illuminated background, and shadowed background. Although the GeoSail model is relatively simple, calculations of canopy reflectance and fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (F-IPAR) compared well with measurements collected in field experiments in forests in Minnesota and Oregon.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Ecological survey maps are used (1) to calibrate and validate land cover classifications from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and (2) as contextual information to improve spatial accuracies of the classified imagery. An objective function measures thematic accuracy, and spatial accuracies are calculated by pixel counts. Preclassification of the imagery into land classes - areas in which the combined influences of altitude, slope, aspect, geology, climate, soil, and biotic factors are believed to operate distinctively on land cover - improves classification accuracies. The usefulness of land class as a preclassifier of satellite imagery and of ecological surveys as a source of contextual information are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SURFACE
AB A Front-Following Algorithm provides a new approach to determining the position and characteristics of thermal oceanic fronts using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) imagery. This algorithm differs from standard line enhancement, threshold edge detection, or classical contour techniques. Instead it utilizes a hyperbolic tangent function in a surface-fitting technique to follow an oceanic front. It has the advantage of describing the characteristics of an oceanic thermal front (including mean SST, SST difference, width and gradient across the front) and extracting information on the position and characteristics of the front into parameter form. Thus, the algorithm has the added benefit of recording the changes in the characteristics of the thermal front as it tracks along the front. The algorithm was applied to AVHRR SST imagery on part of the Subtropical Front known as the Southland Front (SF) off the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, where subantarctic surface waters and subtropical surface waters converge. The algorithm was tested on examples of the SF and also compared with a standard gradient operator. The results showed that the algorithm performed well when following the SF, with low standard errors of parameter estimates, good visual verification of tracking, and consistent standards of accepted data. The algorithm estimated gradients better than a gradient operator. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB In 1997 HUT, FEI, and FGI started a joint project that aims to develop an operational snow; monitoring system: in Finland This project should apply both traditional methods (in situ measurements and hydrological models) and satellite-borne data (ERS-2 SAR and NOAA AVHRR). The emphasis of the;project is to develop methods to monitor the snow: melt period during spring time. The test site is located in northern Finland, and it consists of the drainage area of River Kemi, which is the largest river in Finland. A total of 18 ERS-2 SAR and six cloudless AVHRR images have been acquired from the test site during the spring of 1997 These images cover totally the snow melt period starting from dry snow and ending to snow-free ground. The optical and microwave radar data sets were compared to each other and to in situ measurements made on the weather stations which are used for current operative snow mapping. The results show that SAR-derived snow cover maps agree reasonably urea with ground based observations, and they have a good correlation with AVHRR reflectance for open areas (r=0.82), and even in the presence of vegetation the correlation is relatively high (r=0.77).

AB Seasonal changes in the density of photosynthetically active vegetation have been observed in derivative-based green vegetation index (DGVI) values derived from AVIRIS reflectance spectra of arid land shrub and salt-grass communities adjacent to Mono Lake, California. The study was conducted using AVIRIS datasets acquired in late August and early October of 1992. 2DZ_DGVI (second-order DGVI-derived in reference to zero baseline) showed a strong linear relationship (r(2)>0.93 for August and October) with green leaf area index (LA1) values of ten bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) sample stands. After accounting for background errors introduced to the calculation of 1DL_DGVI (first-order DGVI-derived in reference to local rock-soil baseline), a modified 1DL_DGVI (1DL_MDGVI) exhibited a high linear correlation (r(2)>0.92 for both seasons) with green LAI values of the bitterbrush stands. 2DZ_DGVI was applied to the two AVIRIS scenes acquired for the two periods to quantify and compare green vegetation cover. Areas covered by saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. stricta) showed the largest change in 2DZ_DGVI from August to October. Shrubs, including bitterbrush and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), changed less during the same period. The lowest seasonal change in 2DZ_DGVI occurred in barren areas and locations covered by Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi). The DGVI concept has potential for monitoring ecosystems in arid and semiarid lands where the influence of exposed rock-soil backgrounds reduces the effectiveness of broadband red-vs.-NIR vegetation indices.

AB Measured nadir-viewed narrow-bond reflectances rn red and near infrared channels simulating AVHRR Channels 1 and 2 are compared with measured integrated solar spectrum hemispherical albedo. Reflectances and albedos rc;ere measured from an aircraft over four widely different vegetation surfaces in southeastern Tasmania (Australia). A linear function is used to simultaneously correct for narrow band to broad band conversion errors and to convert nadir viewed reflectances to hemispherical albedos. While the application of the conversion equation presented is limited to the vegetation types of the study, the equation is independent of vegetation type. Results indicate that the reflectance front the rough surface of a forest canopy is not Lambertian and that the use of a directional to hemispherical albedo conversion using a Lambertian assumption may lead to errors as great as 35%.

AB The two variants of the box method (with one and two lids) has been rigorously analysed. As a result of this analysis, a correction factor that takes into account the nonideality of the materials used for the box, as well as its geometry, has been derived. A simple method for determining the effective downward atmospheric temperature that uses only the temperature measurement at the zenith also has been proposed. Finally, by using one of the two variants of the box method, 72 in situ emissivity measurements in the 8-14 mu m wave-band region of typical vegetation, soils, and rocks of Europe and South America, has been obtained. The use of these data for the emissivity correction of satellite thermal measurements has been analyzed, and emissivities for the Landsat Thematic Mapper band 6 and NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer channels 4 and 5 have been derived.

AB Polarimetric L- and C-band radar imagery from the shuttle imaging radar-C (SIR-C) were acquired over wetlands of the Yucatan Peninsula during the dry (April) and wet (October) seasons of 1994. Field surveys during the flights recorded biophysical data and water depth in 11 marsh sites containing communities of three principal emergent macrophytes: Cladium jamaicense, Typha domingensis, and Eleocharis cellulosa. The only major seasonal change was in flooding. Seasonal changes in polarimetric backscatter magnitude (HH, VV, and CS=(HV+ VH)/2) and phase [\H-V phase difference\ = PD) were extracted for a stable evergreen mangrove forest calibration site, which confirmed that the absolute calibration of the Yucatan imagery exceeded: the SIR-C system calibration. We estimate that seasonal changes of greater than or equal to 2dB in backscatter magnitude and greater than or equal to 10 degrees in phase (PD) are significant in our data. Seasonal changes in L- and C-band magnitude and phase were extracted from the 11 marshes, and significant changes above the calibration limit were noted. Increased flooding in the mac-shes was detected by: 1) an increase in backscatter magnitude in marshes with tall, dense cover; 2) a decrease in backscatter magnitude in marshes with short, sparse cover and 3) an increase in PD in all types of marshes. Magnitude increases result from an increase in double-bounce interactions between the emergent vegetation and water surface, whereas decreases result from an increase in forward scattering off the open water. Average PD values increase owing to an absolute or relative increase in double- compared with single-bounce interaction. Changes from dry or partially flooded to completely flooded as well as increases in water depth, could be detected by most of the polarimetric parameters, but changes from dry to partially flooded could not. C-band PD (CPD) was the radar parameter most sensitive to flooding. CPD changed significantly for all eleven marshes, followed by L-band PD (LPD) and LVV (nine marshes) and LHH, LCS, and CVV (seven marshes). CHH detected significant changes in five marshes but produced changes of +/-1.8-1.9 dB (just below our estimated calibration limit) in. four others. An evaluation of current spaceborne radars indicates that a combination of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1,2) and Radarsat radars could detect seasonal flooding in a wide variety of marsh ecosystems, excluding partial flooding and flooding in small patches of short, sparse vegetation.

ID SURFACES
AB Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) of natural surfaces which are best represented by measured biconical reflectance factors (BCRFs) frequently do not fulfill the Helmboltz reciprocity requirement, although theory does not permit deviations. A new set of measured radiance data has been used to derive the BCRF by two different techniques to investigate the validity of the reciprocity requirement in measured data. Both techniques consider sky radiance. The interpolation technique replaces missing measurements by interpolated values. The resulting BCRFs show deviations front reciprocity but reproduce the measured radiances perfectly. This technique has been previously used. The new reciprocity technique replaces missing measurements by the requirement of reciprocity. The resulting BCRFs fulfull reciprocity completely but partly fail to reproduce the measurements. A discussion is given on the differences between the two sets of BCRFs, which are mostly small, and their possible reasons. The conclusion is that the truth is not known but nay be in between the results obtained from the two techniques.

AB The distinction between the performance of a classifier and the accuracy of the resulting thematic map is discussed. Sampling the map itself is recommended as the preferred method for testing its accuracy. It is shown, nonetheless, that map accuracy can also be determined from the performance of a classifier, as assessed from testing data, provided the prior probabilities of class membership are well estimated. Unfortunately, that is rarefy done in practice so that errors are often made in reported map accuracy figures if they are inferred from classifier behavior. Examples are presented to illustrate how an apparently well-behaved classifier can give poor results for certain classes, because of the proportions of those classes in the region being imaged.

ID FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATE; CHEMISTRY; CANOPY; MODEL
AB This study presents a methodology to estimate the leaf biochemical compounds specific absorption coefficients and to use them to predict leaf biochemistry. A wide range of leaves was collected including variations in species and leaf status. All the leaves were dried out. The biochemical composition was measured rising classical wet chemistry techniques to determine lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, and protein contents. Concurrently, leaf reflectance and transmittance were measured with a high spectral resolution spectrophotometer in the 800-2500 nm range with approximately 1 nm spectral resolution and sampling interval. In addition, infinite reflectance achieved by stacking leaves was also measured. The PROSPECT leaf optical properties model was first inverted over a selection of wavebands in the 800-2400 nm domain to provide estimates of the scattering characteristics using leaf reflectance, transmittance, and infinite reflectance data. Then, the model was inverted again over all the wavelengths to estimate the global absorption coefficient, using the previously estimated scattering properties. The global absorption coefficient was eventually explained using the measured biochemical composition by fitting the corresponding specific absorption coefficients after substraction of the measured contribution of the residual structural water absorption. Results show that the derived specific absorption coefficients are quite robustly estimated. Further, they are in good agreement with known absorption features of each biochemical compound. The average contribution of each biochemical compound to leaf absorption feature is also evaluated. Sugar, cellulose, and hemicellulose are the main compounds that contribute to absorption. Results demonstrate the possibility of modeling leaf optical properties of dry leaves with explicit description of leaf biochemistry. Estimates of the detailed biochemical composition obtained by model inversion over the 1300-2400 nm spectral domain show poor predictive performances. In particular, the protein content is very poorly retrieved. The retrieval performances of several combinations of the biochemical compounds are investigated. Results show that the total amount of dry matter per unit leaf area is the only variable to be accurately retrieved. Possible improvements of these results are discussed.

AB This article reviews conceptually the current state of inclusion of land surface processes in climate models and requirements for further observations The atmospheric component of the climate model provides inputs of precipitation and incident surface radiation. Atmospheric model parameterizations of moist convection and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) provide important links to land surface sensible and latent fluxes. The land surface parameterizations provide albedos to determine solar absorption, various resistances to fluxes of heat and moisture from canopy and soil, descriptions of various welter reservoirs, and mechanisms for water to be lost to runoff These parameterizations consist of the algorithms for these processes and the numerical parameter values required by those algorithms. A wide variety of heterogeneities affect fluxes between land surfaces and the atmosphere and occur on scales that are small compared to the spatial resolution of global climate models. These heterogeneities need to be accounted for in terms of statistical distributions and/or relatively fine spatial resolution for specification of land properties. Representation of land properties on a spatial scale of 25-50 km (0.5 degrees) should be adequate for climate modeling requirements over the next decade.

AB For monitoring agricultural crop production, growth of crops is modeled, for example, by using simulation models. Estimates of crop growth often are inaccurate for practical field conditions. Therefore, model simulations must be improved by incorporating information on the actual growth and development of field crops, for example, by using remote sensing data. Such data can be used to initialize, calibrate, or update crop growth models, and it can yield parameter estimates to be used as direct input into growth models: 1) leaf area index (LAI), 2) leaf angle distribution (LAD), and 3) leaf colour (optical properties in the PAR region). LAI and LAD determine the amount of light interception. Leaf (or crop) color influences the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and the maximum (potential) rate of photosynthesis of the leaves. A framework is described for integrating optical remote sensing data from various sources in order to estimate the mentioned parameters. In this article, the above concepts for crop growth estimation are elucidated and illustrated using groundbased and airborne data obtained during the MAC Europe 1991 campaign. Quantitative information concerning both LAI and LAD was obtained by measurements at two viewing angles (using data from the CAESAR scanner in dual-look mode). The red edge index was used for estimating the leaf optical properties (using AVIRIS data). Finally, a crop growth model (SUCROS) was calibrated on time series of optical reflectance measurements to improve the estimation of crop yield.

AB The global water cycle is perhaps the most important of all the biogeochemical cycles, and land surface evaporation, which is a significant component of the water cycle, is also linked with heat and carbon cycles. Long-term, regional and global land surface evaporation have been computed using meteorological and river runoff data, although much uncertainties remain due to inadequacy of the input data. Multispectral observations could aid in estimating evaporation by providing spatially representative, multitemporal data for surface characteristics and fluxes. Estimation of evaporation using the residual method with coarse resolution multispectral satellite observations in the optical region is briefly reviewed. Then, semiempirical equations are used to relate unstressed transpiration to potential evaporation and vegetation indices, and correlations among multispectral data are discussed in the context of estimating evaporation.

TI VALIDATION OF THE USE OF MULTIPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION AS A TOOL FOR

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB When estimating agricultural production, we are faced with a problem of scale, be they scales of observation, modeling, or representation. In the context of the farming landscape of Europe, the relationships between scales and modeling take on special importance as the aim is to extract information on a smaller scale than the scale of observation, the latter necessarily being large relative to the average size of fields in order to obtain the required time resolution. This article presents a method for unmixing coarse resolution signals (of the NOAA-AVHRR type) through the use of multiple linear regression. This allows the signal for each mixed coarse resolution pixel to be broken down thanks to a knowledge of land use and a linear mixture model. It is then possible to calculate the individual radiometric contribution of each constituent of a mixed pixel. The work presented here is an assessment of the performance of this method using SPOT-HRV data, degraded to simulate the coarse resolution and as normally provided to produce the land use information. Simulation with SPOT-HRV data also enables various parameters to be calculated, from which it is possible to verify the interest and reliability of multiple linear regression as a method for spectral unmixing.

AB To test a forest ecosystem model in the Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research (OTTER) project, it is desirable to find forest canopy parameters via radar remote sensing measurements. Conventionally,forest biomass, along with quantities such as the leaf area index, drives the model. However, it is shown from the SAR data collected over the OTTER sites that the backscatter is not uniquely related to biomass. A sensitivity study is carried out using a scattering model to determine the variation of radar cross section as a function of several forest parameters. The results verify the above observation, and lead to the selection of suitable quantities to be recovered via radar experiments. Since this forest scattering model cannot be easily used for inversion of unknown parameters, the use of simplified models in forest parameter estimation schemes is suggested.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Delayed light emission (DLE) of chlorophyll has the same excitation and emission spectra as chlorophyll fluorescence and was formerly called delayed fluorescence. DLE has a much longer time response than true chlorophyll fluorescence and is detectable for times ranging from milliseconds to many minutes. DLE is induced by back reactions of the photosynthetic pathway and therefore requires functional chloroplasts. It is detectable only in the dark following light excitation, yields very low energy, and decays very rapidly. DLE repetitively excited over time, which we term refreshed DLE (RDLE), shows a shoulder and broad peak in our measurements, indicating participation of at least two energy pools. DLE is altered by physiological stresses that affect chloroplasts or photosynthesis, and as illustration, plant species known to be very susceptible or very tolerant to chilling were exposed to chilling temperatures for varying times. RDLE at 0.3 s (the initial shoulder on our curves) rose in response to chilling damage in the susceptible species. The major RDLE peak was greatly inhibited in the susceptible species and showed only small changes in the tolerant species. Fluorescence measurements made on the chilling-tolerant species indicated similar responses and similar coefficients of determination were derived. These results indicate that measurement of precisely timed delayed light emission or of refreshed delayed light emission at a less precisely controlled time can be used to detect chilling stress.

AB Integrated analysis of imaging spectrometer data and field spectral measurements were used in conjunction with conventional geologic field mapping to characterize bedrock and surficial geology at the northern end of Death Valley, California and Nevada. A knowledge-based expert system was used to automatically produce image maps showing the principal surface mineralogy from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Linear spectral unmixing of the AVIRIS data allowed further determination of relative mineral abundances and identification of mineral assemblages and mixtures. The imaging spectrometer data show the spatial distribution of spectrally distinct minerals occurring both as primary rock-forming minerals and as alteration and weathering products. Field spectral measurements were used to verify the mineral maps and field mapping was used to extend the remote sensing results. Geographically referenced image maps produced from these data form new base maps from which to develop improved understanding of the processes of deposition and erosion affecting the present land surface.

AB Radiometric and atmospheric corrections are formulated with a view to computing vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from surface reflectances rather than the digital signal levels recorded at the sensor. In particular, look-up table (LUT) results from an atmospheric radiative transfer code are used to save time and avoid the complexities of running and maintaining such a code in a production environment. The data flow for radiometric image correction is very similar to commonly used geometric correction data flows. The role of terrain elevation in the atmospheric correction process is discussed and the effect of topography on NDVI is highlighted.

TI CHANGE OF SCALE IN MODELS OF REMOTE-SENSING - A GENERAL-METHOD FOR
   SPATIALISATION OF MODELS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGES
AB Models used in remote sensing are based mostly on a relationship between a parameter and the measured reflectance at a given wavelength. They are generally built on the basis of physical considerations at a scale enough small enough so that the media can be considered to be homogeneous. The general practice in remote sensing is to apply these models to reflectances measured from satellites on heterogeneous surfaces, without considering making any correction in order to compensate for the change of scale. It is shown that this usual practice generates errors, the lower and upper bounds of which are given in the form of two functions associated with the physical model. Finally, a general method is proposed to build a new model connected to the physical one, reducing the error introduced by the heterogeneity of the analysed surface. An application to the role of resolution change for the quantification of covered area is also considered.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION; LEAF-AREA INDEX; WHEAT; GROWTH;
   YIELD; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
AB Numerous studies have reported a linear relation between phytomass production and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) for a wide range of plant species. Related work has shown that APAR may be estimated from multispectral (visible and near infrared) remotely sensed observations. The combination of these two concepts may provide the basis for development of physically-based agronomic monitoring systems. These concepts are subjected to examination for two primary, mid-latitude crops; corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max Merr.). Phytomass, green leaf area index (LAI), absorbed PAR, and multispectral reflectance factors of corn and soybean were measured periodically from planting to mid-grain fill in two growing seasons. As green LAI increased, the fractional APAR asymptotically approached a maximum value between 0.95 and 0.97. Fractional APAR displayed a linear relation to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is relatively independent of species, throughout the growing seasons. However, deviations in the relation were observed between pre- and post-onset of senescence. For both corn and soybean, a linear relation between cumulative APAR and cumulative above-ground phytomass production was found. However, the rate of accumulation per unit APAR was more than twice as great for corn as for soybean. This agrees with previous reports comparing C4 grasses and C3 legumes. These results indicate that remotely sensed measurements contribute valuable information concerning energy/mass accumulation in plant canopies. However, implementation of this approach in crop monitoring will clearly require a capability to discriminate between, at least, corn and soybean. The influence of stress events, such as drought, nutrient limitations, and disease, will also require further consideration.

AB Ground-based measurements of forest canopy transmittance provide a ready means of estimating intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) for use in calibrating satellite remotely sensed estimates of forest canopy structure.  The relationship between canopy transmittance and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) near IR / red radiance ratio data was examined for a temperate coniferous forest study site in northwestern Montana.  Semivariogram analysis showed that the canopy transmittance and the TM near IR / red ratio had a similar spatial autocorrelation structure.  Due to the fine scale patchiness of the forest canopy, the canopy transmittance and TM data were averaged at the coarser scale of the hillslope terrain units for regression analysis.  These hillslope averaged data sets showed a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.66).  The transmittance measurements were converted to leaf area index (LAI) but comparison with previous results obtained for coniferous forests in Oregon (Peterson et al., 1987) shows some differences in the relationship between LAI and TM near IR / red ratio.

AB Surface fuel information is an essential input for models of fire behaviour and fire effects. However, spatially explicit, continuous information on surface fuel loads and fuelbed depth is scarce because the collection of field data is laborious, while suitable methods for deriving estimates from remote sensing data are still at an early stage of development. Fine-scale surface fuel mapping using both passive and active remote sensing has not yet been carried out in Central European forest types, and it remains unexplored how prediction uncertainties of different fuel components affect modelled fire behaviour. This study combines very detailed airborne lidar and multispectral satellite data to extract metrics describing forest structure and composition in two forested areas in southwestern Germany. These metrics were used to predict field-sampled surface fuel components using random forest regression. Accuracies of continuous fuel load predictions were compared to accuracies that could be achieved if only forest type-specific average fuels were assigned. Results revealed that models based on remotely sensed metrics explain part of the variance in litter and fine dead woody fuels (R2=0.27-0.41), but not in coarser dead woody fuels. Estimates for herb and shrub fuels were fairly accurate (R2=0.55-0.64) but limited for the more fire-relevant fine fraction of shrub fuels (R2=0.39). Fuelbed depth was moderately well predicted based on remote sensing data (R2=0.44). Lidar-derived metrics were particularly useful for predicting understory fuels and fuelbed depth. Litter and fine woody fuel predictions were linked to canopy characteristics captured with both lidar and multispectral data and similarly accurate estimates could be obtained using average values based on forest type. We used the fine-scale surface fuel maps derived from remote sensing to predict potential surface fire behaviour in the study area and analysed the sensitivity of modelled fire behaviour to errors in the predicted loads of different surface fuel components: fire behaviour was most sensitive to errors in litter and especially shrub fuel loads, hence estimates of these components need to be improved. Overall, this study showed that statistical relationships between remotely sensed metrics describing forest composition and structure and surface fuels have some potential for estimating fuel loads in Central European forest types and should be further developed to provide starting points for realistic fire behaviour models.

AB Several satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) products have progressively emerged and have been developed in recent years. However, till date, no direct validation has been conducted on existing satellite-based SIF products. In this study, validation of two groups of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF products, namely TROPOSIFCaltech (containing far-red and red TROPOSIFCaltech datasets) and TROPOSIFESA (containing TROPOSIF735 and TROPOSIF743 datasets that are retrieved from two different retrieval windows), was conducted using tower-based SIF measurements over seven sites. Several issues and potential obstacles emerged while matching satellite-based and in situ SIF retrievals, including spatial scale mismatch. To overcome the spatial scale mismatch between the satellite data and ground observations, a near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)-scaled approach was employed to mitigate the spatial difference between the locations of specific sites and the matched TROPOSIF samples using Sentinel-2 imagery. Other issues related to retrival methods and instrument differences were examined. Subsequently, the 3FLD retrieval method was chosed for the in situ data. The validation results showed that the three far-red TROPOSIF datasets exhibit slightly different performances in terms of the validation accuracy; the R2 for TROPOSIFCaltech, TROPOSIF735, and TROPOSIF743 was 0.43, 0.33 and 0.40, respectively, which is asociated with root-mean-square error(RMSE) values of 0.59, 0.42 and 0.57 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1, respectively. However, red TROPOSIFCaltech exhibited no significant correlation with tower-based SIF with R2 of 0.02 and RMSE of 0.34 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1. Furthermore, the validation results at different sites varied, with R2 ranging from 0.01 to 0.70. Uncertainties still exist in the validation of the four TROPOSIF datasets, which are attributed to some unresolved issues, such as the limited quality of in situ SIF retrievals and the spatial scaling difference. Thus, to fully utilize satellite-based SIF products for wide ranging applications, further improvements in SIF product quality are urgently required at both ground and satellite scales.

AB Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors , include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize , distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration.

AB Atmospheric pollutant data retrieved through satellite sensors are continually used to assess changes in air quality in the lower atmosphere. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies started to use satellite mea-surements to evaluate changes in air quality in many different regions worldwide. However, although satellite data is continuously validated, it is known that its accuracy may vary between monitored areas, requiring regionalized quality assessments. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether satellites could measure changes in the air quality of the state of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil, during the COVID-19 outbreak; and to verify the relationship between satellite-based data [Tropospheric NO2 column density and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)] and ground -based concentrations [NO2 and particulate material (PM; coarse: PM10 and fine: PM2.5)]. For this purpose, tropospheric NO2 obtained from the TROPOMI sensor and AOD retrieved from MODIS sensor data by using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm were compared with concentrations obtained from 50 automatic ground monitoring stations. The results showed low correlations between PM and AOD. For PM10, most stations showed correlations lower than 0.2, which were not significant. The results for PM2.5 were similar, but some stations showed good correlations for specific periods (before or during the COVID-19 outbreak). Satellite-based Tropospheric NO2 proved to be a good predictor for NO2 concentrations at ground level. Considering all stations with NO2 measurements, correlations >0.6 were observed, reaching 0.8 for specific stations and periods. In general, it was observed that regions with a more industrialized profile had the best correlations, in contrast with rural areas. In addition, it was observed about 57% reductions in tropospheric NO2 throughout the state of Sa similar to o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak. Variations in air pollutants were linked to the region economic vocation, since there were reductions in industrialized areas (at least 50% of the industrialized areas showed >20% decrease in NO2) and increases in areas with farming and livestock characteristics (about 70% of those areas showed increase in NO2). Our results demonstrate that Tropospheric NO2 column densities can serve as good predictors of NO2 concentrations at ground level. For MAIAC-AOD, a weak relationship was observed, requiring the evaluation of other possible predictors to describe the relationship with PM. Thus, it is concluded that regionalized assessment of satellite data accuracy is essential for assertive estimates on a regional/local level. Good quality information retrieved at specific polluted areas does not assure a worldwide use of remote sensor data.

AB The inversion of wave spectrum is the embodiment of the fine observation of ocean swells by synthetic aperture radar. Due to the nonlinear distortion from velocity bunching, the operational Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) level-2 (L2) Ocean (OCN) wave products retrieved by quasi-linear inversion are still quite different from the real wave spectrum, requiring further calibration. Limited by the azimuth cut-off, the quasi-linear inversed wave spectrum mostly concentrates on swells with a wavelength longer than 150 m. 2D spectral partitioning separates different swell systems, denoted as partitions in the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN product. We compared and calibrated the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products' swell partitions (More specifically partitioned integral ocean wave parameters: partitioned wave height, partitioned wavelength, and partitioned wave direction) with WAVEWATCH III (WW3) in different polarization modes (HH and VV polarization) and different incidence angles (-23 degrees -WV1 and - 36 degrees- WV2).The accuracy of swell partitions in the OCN products varies with peak wave direction relative to the Sentinel-1 flight direction, and it is difficult to calibrate the partitions derived from quasi-linear inversion unless deleting partitions severely distorted by nonlinearity and large-scale features. A machine learning method is proposed to calibrate the wave partitions. Spectral distances of collocated Sentinel-1 and WW3 partition pairs larger than two are considered "bad" partitions to be filtered. Inputting high-dimensional features (twenty-one features) derived from Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model can effectively reduce the bias (root-mean-square error, RMSE) of significant wave height (SWH) of all the partitions from-0.10 m (-0.70 m) to-0.00 m (-0.46 m) and the bias (RMSE) of wavelengths of all the partitions from-20 m (-35 m) to-0.20 m (-26 m) compared with WW3 swell partitions. This method improves the precision of the wave partition and retains more partitions in the Sentinel-1 WV L2 OCN products than previous studies, especially for wave partitions with moderate wave height (< 4 m), potentially improving the understanding of swell dynamics globally.

AB Savannas have complex, discontinuous woody vegetation structures that vary greatly in vertical and spatial arrangement and change due to climatic, ecological and management impacts. While airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have provided detailed information on vertical vegetation structure and is widely used in ecological studies, it is lacking in availability and repeat frequency. Although the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) waveform Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and algorithms were optimized for measuring dense forests, it was anticipated that GEDI metrics could provide useful characterization of lower stature, sparse savannas structures. This study provided the first baseline validation of Version 2 GEDI (L2A) relative height 98 (RH98) by comparing the on-orbit GEDI-RH98orb to the simulated GEDI-RH98sim derived from ALS data across diverse savanna vegetation. It furthermore determined the influence of various factors on error, e.g. algorithm setting group (SGs), beam type, day vs. night, beam sensitivity, and vegetation phenology. After applying quality flags, 22,813 GEDI footprints were analyzed across 11 sites. SGs 4-6 that are aimed at dense forests had much larger errors than SGs 1-3. The phenological conditions at the time of GEDI data acquisition had a very large influence on the error of RH98orb. During leaf-on conditions for savanna vegetation with RH98sim < 15 m, RH98orb was very accurate with R2 = 0.61, mean bias =-0.55 m, %bias = -11.1%, RMSE = 1.64 m and % RMSE = 29.8%. In leaf-off conditions where RH98sim < 15 m, RH98orb was less accurate with R2 = 0.43, mean bias =-1.47 m, %bias =-26.5%, RMSE = 2.03 m and %RMSE = 40.9%. During leaf-off conditions, the GEDI LiDAR signal at the start of the waveform may be weaker as it interacts with denuded branches and may be truncated as noise, leading to a large negative height bias. Therefore, assessments of deciduous vegetation structures should be conducted during leaf-on periods. In leaf-on conditions, GEDI's RH98orb was very accurate between canopy heights of 3 and 7 m, with a mean bias of-0.79 m (-10%). The bias of RH98orb was not influenced by canopy cover. Due to the GEDI LiDAR pulse width of 15.6 ns, the GEDI-RH98 data product cannot reliably estimate canopy heights of shrubs below 2.34 m and will require more complex deconvolution of the waveform. GEDI's RH98 accurately estimates the canopy height of trees between 3 and 15 m allowing assess-ment of canopy heights over vast savanna areas.

AB Cover cropping between cash crop growing seasons is a multifunctional conservation practice. Timely and accurate monitoring of cover crop traits, notably aboveground biomass and nutrient content, is beneficial to agricultural stakeholders to improve management and understand outcomes. Currently, there is a scarcity of spatially and temporally resolved information for assessing cover crop growth. Remote sensing has a high potential to fill this need, but conventional empirical regression operated with coarse-resolution multispectral data has large uncertainties. Therefore, this study utilized airborne hyperspectral imaging techniques and developed new process-guided machine learning approaches (PGML) for cover crop monitoring. Specifically, we deployed an airborne hyperspectral system covering visible to shortwave-infrared wavelengths (400-2400 nm) to acquire high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (3-5 nm) resolution reflectance over 23 cover crop fields across Central Illinois in March and April of 2021. Airborne hyperspectral surface reflectance with high spectral and spatial resolution can be well matched with field data to quantify cover crop traits. Furthermore, the PGML models were pretrained by synthetic data from soil-vegetation radiative transfer modeling (one million records), and then fine-tuned with field data of cover crop biomass and nutrient content. Results show that airborne hyperspectral data with PGML can achieve high accuracy to predict cover crop aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.72, relative RMSE = 15.16%) and nitrogen content (R2 = 0.69, relative RMSE = 16.59%) through leave-one-field-out crossvalidation. Unlike the pure data-driven approach (e.g., partial least-squares regression), PGML incorporated radiative transfer knowledge and obtained higher predictive performance with fewer field data. Meanwhile, with field data for model fine-tuning, PGML predicted biomass more accurately than the inversion of radiative transfer models. We also found that the red edge has a high contribution in quantifying aboveground biomass and nitrogen content, followed by green and shortwave spectra. This study demonstrated the first attempt of utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing to accurately quantify cover crop traits. We highlight the strength of PGML in exploiting sensing data to quantify ecosystem variables to advance agroecosystem monitoring for sustainable agricultural management.

AB Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) advances our ability to monitor gross primary productivity. Because SIF is usually <5% of recorded canopy radiance, sources of measurement error must be reduced for accurate SIF retrieval. Here we quantify the impact of spectral stray light on SIF retrieval using a high-resolution imaging spectrometer. We first derived the FLD retrieval solution in the presence of stray light under the simplifying assumptions that SIF, reflectance, and stray light are constant across the region of the spectrum used in the retrieval. We show that stray light contributions from the canopy and reference spectra could cancel out if obtained from the same instrument. In practice however, the simplifying assumptions are unlikely to hold because SIF and reflectance vary across regions of the spectrum commonly exploited by the FLD retrieval, and stray light can also vary across the spectrum, as we demonstrate with an empirical example. To quantify the impact of spectral stray light on SIF retrievals in more realistic scenarios, we performed a sensitivity analysis. We used a stray light signal distribution function and measurements of spectral radiance and SIF to generate spectra with known quantities of SIF and stray light over four orders of magnitude of stray light. We then quantified the bias in retrieved SIF using four SIF retrieval approaches-standard FLD, 3FLD, a spectral fitting method (SFM), and a method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)-applied to the red and/or far-red spectral domains. We found that spectral stray light can cause either a positive or negative bias in SIF estimates. In the highest stray light scenario, with spectral stray light one order of magnitude smaller than the radiance signal, the stray light error ranged from < +/- 1% of SIF (for O2-A band retrievals with FLD, 3FLD, and SFM methods, and for far-red retrievals in the 748 nm to 756 nm domain with SVD-based and 3FLD methods applied to Fraunhofer lines) to >30% of SIF (O2-B band retrieval with SFM, and 3FLD applied to Fraunhofer lines in the red domain). For context, a bias of 27% of SIF is a comparable magnitude to seasonal variation in SIF observed in the Amazon basin, and to SIF differences among plant functional types. However, when spectral stray light was three orders of magnitude smaller than the radiance signal, mean bias was < +/- 2% for all retrieval methods. Our analysis informs when spectral stray light corrections must be performed for SIF remote sensing.

AB Forest canopy structural complexity (CSC) describes the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of canopy ele-ments, and has become an emergent forest attribute mediating forest ecosystem functioning along with species diversity. Light detection and ranging (lidar), especially the emerging near-surface lidar platforms (e.g., terrestrial laser scanning/TLS, backpack laser scanning/BLS, unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning/ULS), can depict 3D canopy information with high efficiency and accuracy, providing an ideal data source for forest CSC quantification. However, current existing lidar-based CSC quantification indices may share common limitations of getting saturated in structurally complex forest stands and not fully capturing within-canopy structural var-iations. In this study, we introduced the concept of entropy into forest CSC quantification, and proposed a new forest CSC index, namely canopy entropy (CE). Two major bottlenecks were addressed in the CE calculation procedure, including (1) using a Mann-Kendall (MK) test-based resampling strategy to address the issue of incongruent sampling chances of canopy elements at different locations from different lidar systems, and (2) using a kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method to reduce its dependence on point density. The effec-tiveness and generality of CE were evaluated by simulating TLS and ULS point clouds from nine forest stands and collecting TLS, BLS, and ULS point clouds from 110 field plots distributed in five forest sites, covering a large variety of forest types and forest CSC conditions. The results showed that CE was an effective forest CSC quantification index that successfully captured CSC variations caused by both tree density and the number of vertical canopy layers. It had significant positive correlations with four widely used CSC indices (i.e., canopy cover, foliage height diversity, canopy top rugosity, and fractal dimension; R2: 0.32 to 0.67), but outperformed them by overcoming their common limitations. CE estimates from multiplatform lidar point clouds agreed well with each other (R2 >= 0.70, RMSE <= 0.10), indicating it has generality in cross-platform forest CSC quantification practices. We believe the proposed CE index has great potential to help us unravel the correlations among forest CSC, species diversity, and forest ecosystem functions, and therefore improve our understanding on forest ecosystem processes.

AB Spatial predictions of biomass production and biodiversity at regional scale in grasslands are critical to evaluate the effects of management practices across environmental gradients. New generations of remote sensing sensors and machine learning approaches can predict these grassland characteristics with varying accuracy. However, such studies frequently fail to cover a sufficiently broad range of environmental conditions, and their prediction models are often case-specific. To address this gap, we have modelled above-ground biomass and species richness in 150 spatially independent grassland plots of three geographical regions in Germany. These regions follow a North-South climate gradient and differ in soil types, topography, elevation, climatic conditions, historical contexts, and management intensities. The predictors tested in this study are Sentinel-1 backscatter, Sentinel-2 time series of surface reflectance along with derived vegetation indices and Rao's Q, and a set of topoedaphic variables. We compared the performance of a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) with a random forest (RF) regression algorithm. The DNN achieved the best estimations of biomass (r2 = 0.45) when trained with Sentinel-2 surface reflectance only. Moreover, the DNN showed a higher generalizability than RF during spatial cross-validations (i.e., calibrating and validating in different regions, r2 = 0.38 vs. 0.26). Species richness pre-dictions by both algorithms improved when the full time series of Sentinel-2 surface reflectance values were used (highest r2 = 0.42 achieved by the DNN), but both performed poorly during spatial cross-validations. Overall, the DNN-based models were more robust than RF models, showed a lower bias and lower systematic error, and required fewer inputs. Explainability analysis indicated that red-edge and near infrared information from May and October was the most relevant to predict species richness. This study presents an important step forward in generating robust spatially explicit predictions of grassland attributes and biodiversity variables across large areas, environmental gradients, and phenological stages.

AB While strides have been made in their accuracy and availability, the overall utility of satellite-derived surface soil moisture (SM) datasets derived from passive microwave radiometry is still reduced by their relatively coarse spatial resolution (typically >30 km). In response to this shortcoming, many independent satellite-based SM downscaling approaches have been introduced recently. However, owing to limitations in the spatial sampling characteristics of existing SM ground-monitoring networks, it has proven difficult to obtain reliable reference SM observations at the target downscaling resolution for these approaches (typically 1 to 10 km). As a result, the objective evaluation of SM downscaling approaches is often challenging and/or limited to very localized conditions. Here, we introduce and evaluate a point-scale downscaling (PSD) benchmarking strategy whereby spatially sparse, long-term, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks are utilized for the objective benchmarking of downscaled satellite-based SM products. First, we define criteria that must be met for a given SM downscaling strategy to add either temporal accuracy or spatial skill relative to its coarse-resolution SM baseline. Next, we illustrate, both analytically and numerically, that such criteria can be accurately evaluated using sparse, point-scale SM observations available from existing ground-based SM networks. Finally, we apply our new PSD benchmarking approach to evaluate existing fine-scale SM products. Results demonstrate that the PSD approach, in concert with existing ground-based network data, can be leveraged to robustly evaluate SM downscaling approaches.

AB The model-assisted difference and regression estimators are increasingly used with forest inventory and remotely sensed data to increase the precision of estimates of inventory parameters. Although these estimators date back at least 50 years and appear in multiple current sampling textbooks, the associated terminology is inconsistently defined, even among the prominent authorities. Further, two of the most prominent statistical sampling textbooks, Cochran (1977) and Sa spacing diaeresis rndal et al. (1992), use considerably different notation.The study focused on three objectives: (1) to formulate consistent and operationally useful definitions via a synthesis of the literature, (2) to construct a bridge between the more complex Sa spacing diaeresis rndal et al. (1992) notation and the more commonly used Cochran (1977) notation, and (3) to assess sample size, model form and g-weight effects on the unbiasedness of the regression estimators of both the population mean and the variance of its estimate.The data analyses entailed Monte Carlo simulations using an artificial population constructed using inventory and airborne laser scanning data and both across- and within-dataset analyses for 11 inventory datasets representing six countries on four continents. The analyses focused on assessing the unbiasedness of the regression estimators of both the mean and variance, the role of the g-weights on the unbiasedness of the variance estimator, and differences for linear versus nonlinear models. Key terminological distinctions were that the generalized estimators accommodate unequal probability sampling and that the difference estimator of the mean is unbiased whereas the regression estimator of the mean is only asymptotically unbiased, meaning it only approaches unbiasedness as the sample size increases.The key analytical conclusions were threefold: (1) the regression variance estimator was confirmed as asymptotically unbiased, (2) the form of the regression variance estimator that incorporated the g-weights was more accurate, and (3) the regression variance estimator was more accurate for linear models than for nonlinear models.

AB Calibration and validation of aboveground biomass (AGB) (AGB) products retrieved from satellite-borne sensors require accurate AGB estimates across hectare scales (1 to 100 ha). Recent studies recommend making use of non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) based techniques for individual tree AGB estimation that provide unbiased AGB predictors. However, applying these techniques across large sites and landscapes remains logis-tically challenging. Unoccupied aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS) has the potential to address this through the collection of high density point clouds across many hectares, but estimation of individual tree AGB based on these data has been challenging so far, especially in dense tropical canopies. In this study, we investigated how TLS and UAV-LS can be used for this purpose by testing different modelling strategies with data availability and modelling framework requirements. The study included data from four forested sites across three biomes: temperate, wet tropical, and tropical savanna. At each site, coincident TLS and UAV-LS campaigns were con-ducted. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were estimated from TLS point clouds. Individual tree AGB was estimated for & GE;170 trees per site based on TLS tree point clouds and quantitative structure modelling (QSM), and treated as the best available, non-destructive estimate of AGB in the absence of direct, destructive measurements. Individual trees were automatically segmented from the UAV-LS point clouds using a shortest-path algorithm on the full 3D point cloud. Predictions were evaluated in terms of individual tree root mean square error (RMSE) and population bias, the latter being the absolute difference between total tree sample population TLS QSM estimated AGB and predicted AGB. The application of global allometric scaling models (ASM) at local scale and across data modalities, i.e., field-inventory and light detection and ranging LiDAR metrics, resulted in individual tree prediction errors in the range of reported studies, but relatively high popu-lation bias. The use of adjustment factors should be considered to translate between data modalities. When calibrating local models, DBH was confirmed as a strong predictor of AGB, and useful when scaling AGB esti-mates with field inventories. The combination of UAV-LS derived tree metrics with non-parametric modelling generally produced high individual tree RMSE, but very low population bias of & LE;5% across sites starting from 55 training samples. UAV-LS has the potential to scale AGB estimates across hectares with reduced fieldwork time. Overall, this study contributes to the exploitation of TLS and UAV-LS for hectare scale, non-destructive AGB estimation relevant for the calibration and validation of space-borne missions targeting AGB estimation.

AB This paper introduces a method for estimating a series of sea state parameters from satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The method was realized in a near real time (NRT) application which allows for the processing of data from different satellites and modes. The algorithm estimates the total significant wave height Hs, dominant and secondary swell and windsea wave heights, first, and second moment wave periods, the mean wave period and the period of wind sea. The algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW), Extra Wide (EW) and Wave Mode (WV) Level-1 (L1) products and also extended to X -band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) StripMap (SM) products. The scenes are processed in raster and result in continuous sea state fields, with the exception of S1 WV, where averaged values for sea state parameters for along-orbit imagettes of 20 km x 20 km are presented. The developed empirical algorithm consists of two parts: a first CWAVE_EX (extended CWAVE) part, based on a linear regression approach, and a subsequent machine learning part using the support vector machine (SVM) technique. A series of new data preparation steps (i.e. filtering, denoising) and new features estimated from SAR images are also introduced. The algorithm was tuned and validated using two independent global wave model hindcasts, WaveWatch-3 and MFWAM as well as National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. The achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) for CWAVE_EX for the total Hs are 0.60 m for low-resolution modes S1 IW (10 m pixel) and EW (40 m pixel) and 0.35 m for S1 WV and TS-X SM (pixel spacing ca.1-4 m) in comparison to model predictions. The RMSEs of the retrieved wave periods are in the range of 0.45-0.90 s for all of the satellites and models considered. Similarly, the dominant and secondary swell, and wind sea wave height RMSEs are in the range of 0.35-0.80 m. The SVM postprocessing improves the accuracy of the initial results of CWAVE_EX for Hs and reaches an RMSE of 0.25 m for S1 WV. Comparisons to 64 NDBC buoys, collocated at distances shorter than 50 km to S1 WV imagettes worldwide, result in an RMSE of 0.41 m. All results and the methods presented are novel in terms of the accuracy achieved, combining the classical approach with machine learning techniques, and performing an automatic NRT processing of multiparametric sea state fields from L1 data with automatic switching for different satellites and modes. The complete archive of S1 WV L1 Single Look Complex products from December 2014 until February 2021 was processed to create a sea state parameter database and validated using model hindcast and buoy mea-surements. The derived parameters are available to the public within the scope of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative.

AB Global surface temperature has been setting new record highs in the recent decades, imposing increasing environmental challenges for societies and ecosystems worldwide. Global warming rates of the 20th century have been documented by a number of studies, nevertheless, the warming rates in the most recent decades in the 21st century are of particular interest for understanding the ongoing climate change. Analyzing temperature trends demands data with high spatial resolution and broad geographical coverage to allow for analyzing trends and changes on a regional scale. Land Surface Temperature data from NASA MODIS with global resolution of 0.05 & DEG; and Skin Temperature data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis with global resolution of 0.1 fulfill these demands. In this study, we analyze the remote-sensing -based MODIS data to estimate land surface temperature change rates over the period 2001-2020 in global, continental, and pixel-wise scales with statistical significance indicated. The model-based ERA5-Land data are also analyzed in parallel, extending the period of analysis back to 1981. These two independently-sourced datasets, one from satellites above the atmosphere and one from combining surface modeling and observations, are shown to produce highly consistent results. It is revealed that the trends in the shorter period 2001-2020 are spatially conforming to the trends in the longer period 1981-2020 despite the shorter time length. For the period 2001-2020, we show that the global average land surface temperature rate of change was 0.26 -0.34 C per decade, with substantially different warming rates in different regions. The Arctic, Europe, and Russia show statistically significant warming in both datasets. The Arctic, in particular, warmed at a rate 2.5-2.8 times the global average, and data in the 40-year period 1981-2020 suggest that warming is accelerating in almost all the continents or large regions. Most noticeably, the two independent datasets both indicate that Arctic permafrost regions had the world's highest warming rate at the onset of the 21st century, reaching > 2 ? per decade in some areas.

AB Managed grasslands cover about one third of the European utilized agricultural area. Appropriate grassland management is key for balancing trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. The timing and frequency of mowing events are major factors of grassland management. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mowing events using remote sensing time series from optical and radar satellites. In this study, we present a new method combining the regular observations of Sentinel-1 (S1) and the better accuracy of Sentinel-2 (S2) grassland mowing detection algorithms. This multi-source approach for grassland monitoring was assessed over large areas and in various contexts. The method was first validated in six European countries, based on Planet image interpretation. Its performances and sensitivity were then thoroughly assessed in an independent study area using a more precise and complete reference dataset based on an intensive field campaign. Results showed the robustness of the method across all study areas and different types of grasslands. The method reached a F1-score of 79% for detecting mowing events on hay meadows. Furthermore, the detection of mowing events along the growing season allows to classify mowing practices with an overall accuracy of 69%. This is promising for differentiating grasslands in terms of management intensity. The method could therefore be used for largescale grassland monitoring to support agri-environmental schemes in Europe.

AB The determination of the amount of precipitable water vapor (PWV) from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is restricted to a limited number of ground-based stations with low spatial resolution. The PWV obtained by the multi-source data fusion method has a low spatial resolution because of the low spatial resolution of the data used. Therefore, it is difficult to retrieve PWV maps with sub-km resolution. Therefore, retrieving PWV with high spatial resolution becomes the focus of this study. A dual-scale method for retrieving PWV maps, based on heterogeneous earth data, is proposed, which can obtain sub-kilometer resolution PWV, while maintaining accuracy. First, an approach for analyzing the spatial correlation between land cover types (LCT) and ground-based PWV was proposed, and the meteorological, ecological, topographic, and LCT variables affecting changes in PWV in the near-earth atmosphere were determine, Subsequently, three different regression models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), were used to construct the functional model linking heterogeneous earth observation data and ground-based GNSSderived PWV. Finally, the PWV map with sub-kilometer resolution was generated based on the dual-scale method. Unlike the PWV obtained by data fusion and remote sensing technology, the proposed dual-scale retrieval method can generate PWV maps at 300 m spatial resolution. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the RMS of the PWV derived from the proposed method was less than 2.2 mm, and the bias was close to 0, thereby filling the gap in the sub-kilometer high-precision PWV products.

AB Detailed and up-to-date coastline morphology data underpins our understanding of coastline change over time. The development of an automated and scalable coastline extraction methodology from satellite imagery is currently limited by the low availability of open, globally distributed and diverse labelled data with which to develop and benchmark techniques. Therefore, in this study we present the Sentinel-2 Water Edges Dataset (SWED), a new and bespoke labelled image dataset for the development and bench-marking of techniques for the automated extraction of coastline morphology data from Sentinel-2 images. Composed of 16 labelled training Sentinel-2 scenes, and 98 test label-image pairs, SWED is globally distributed and contains examples of many different coastline types and natural and anthropogenic coastline features. To provide a baseline of model performance against SWED we train and test four convolutional neural network models, based on the U-Net model architecture. Models are optimised using Categorical Cross-entropy Loss, Sorensen-Dice Loss and two novel loss functions we present for the focusing of model training attention to the boundary between land and water. Through a hybrid quantitative and qualitative model assessment process we demonstrate that the model trained using our novel Sobel-edge loss function has greater sensitivity to fine-scale, narrow coastline features whilst possessing near top quantitative performance demonstrated by Categorical Cross-entropy. The SWED dataset is published openly for use by the remote sensing and machine learning communities, whilst the Sobel-edge loss is available for use in machine learning applications where sensitivity to boundary features is important.

AB The reliance on ground-based measurements has been a long-standing barrier toward deriving river discharge for ungauged headwaters, which are quite sensitive to climate change due to relatively high contributions of snow and glacier meltwater to river discharge. In addition, information pertaining to discharge is scarce and inconsistent across the globe due to economic, geographic, and political reasons. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of river discharge in ungauged headwaters is extremely challenging, particularly in high mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study presents a methodology of estimating daily continuous discharge using multisource remote sensing and a hydrological model that can simulate cryospheric processes including snow and glacier accumulation and melt. The hydrological model is forced and calibrated purely by satellite-observed information, particularly by river widths derived from high-spatial-resolution images without using in situ river discharge measurements. Poorly gauged or ungauged headwaters with river widths on the order of 100 m, including the Lhasa (the tributary of the upper Brahmaputra River), Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers originating on the TP were chosen to test the methodology. At-a-section river widths were derived from high-resolution satellite images (i.e., IKONOS, QuickBird, RapidEye-1/2/4/5, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2) and Landsat archives. As exemplified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values (NSE) (up to 0.8 and higher than 0.5 overall), simulated daily continuous discharge was reliable in the four testbeds with different river bathymetry, narrow river widths, and complex terrain. Uncertainties associated with the accuracy, number, and variability of calibration references (i.e., remotely sensed widths) and optimization algorithms were fully discussed. This study highlights the potential of deriving daily continuous discharge without a priori information on river flow, paving the way for discharge estimation in ungauged headwaters globally and providing important implications for satellite-based discharge estimation in narrow rivers across high-mountain regions.

AB This article presents the evaluation of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) operational terrestrial products corresponding to the green instantaneous Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and its associated rectified channels. These products are estimated using OLCI spectral measurements acquired at the top of the atmosphere by a physically-based approach and are available operationally at full (300 m) and reduced (1.2 km) spatial resolution daily. The evaluation of the quality of the FAPAR OLCI values was based on the availability of data acquired over several years by Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel 3B (S3B). The evaluation exercise consisted of several stages: first, an overall comparison of the two S3 platform products was carried out during the tandem phase; second, comparison with an FAPAR climatology derived from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) provided information on the seasonality of various types of land cover. Then, direct comparisons were made with the same type of FAPAR products retrieved from two sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and with several ground-based estimates. In addition, an analysis of the efficiency of the retrieval algorithm with 3D radiative transfer simulations was performed. The results indicated that the consistency between daily and monthly S3A and S3B on a global scale was very good during the tandem phase (RMSD = 0.01 and a correlation R-2 of 0.99 with a bias of 0.003); we found an agreement with a correlation of 0.95 and 0.93 (RMSD = 0.07 and 0.09) with JRC FAPAR S2 and JRC FAPAR MODIS, respectively. Compatibility with the ground-based data was between 0.056 and 0.24 in term of RMSD depending on the type of vegetation with an overall R-2 of 0.89. Immler diagrams demonstrate that their variances were lower than the total uncertainties. The quality assurance using 3D radiative transfer model has shown that the apparent performance of the algorithm depends strongly on the type of in-situ measurement and canopy type.

AB We report a new version and an empirical evaluation of a forest reflectance model based on photon recollision probability (p). For the first time, a p-based approach to modeling forest reflectance was tested in a wide range of differently structured forests from different biomes. To parameterize the model, we measured forest canopy structure and spectral characteristics for 50 forest plots in four study sites spanning from boreal to temperate biomes in Europe (48 degrees -62 degrees N). We compared modeled forest reflectance spectra against airborne hyperspectral data at wavelengths of 450-2200 nm. Large overestimation occurred, especially in the near-infrared region, when the model was parameterized considering only leaves or needles as plant elements and assuming a Lambertian canopy. The model root mean square error (RMSE) was on average 80%, 80%, 54% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests, respectively. We suggest a new parameterization that takes into account the nadir to hemispherical reflectance ratio of the canopy and contribution of woody elements to the forest reflectance. We evaluated the new parameterization based on inversion of the model, which resulted in average RMSE of 20%, 15%, and 11% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests. The model requires only few structural parameters and the spectra of foliage, woody elements, and forest floor as input. It can be used in interpretation of multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data, as well as in land surface and climate modeling. In general, our results also indicate that even though the foliage spectra are not dramatically different between coniferous and broadleaved forests, they can still explain a large part of reflectance differences between these forest types in the near-infrared, where sensitivity of the reflectance of dense forests to changes in the scattering properties of the foliage is high.

AB Forest edges are an increasingly common feature of Amazonian landscapes due to human-induced forest frag-mentation. Substantial evidence shows that edge effects cause profound changes in forest biodiversity and productivity. However, the broader impacts of edge effects on ecosystem functioning remain unclear. Assessing the three-dimensional arrangement of forest elements has the potential to unveil structural traits that are scalable and closely linked to important functional characteristics of the forest. Using over 600 high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning measurements, we present a detailed assessment of forest structural metrics linked to ecosystem processes such as energy harvesting and light use efficiency. Our results show a persistent change in forest structural characteristics along the edges of forest fragments, which resulted in a significantly lower structural diversity, in comparison with the interior of the forest fragments. These structural changes could be observed up to 35 m from the forest edges and are likely to reflect even deeper impacts on other ecosystem variables such as microclimate and biodiversity. Traits related to vertical plant material allocation were more affected than traits related to canopy height. We demonstrate a divergent response from the forest understory (higher vegetation density close to the edge) and the upper canopy (lower vegetation density close to the edge), indicating that assessing forest disturbances using vertically integrated metrics, such as total plant area index, can lead to an erroneous interpretation of no change. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of terrestrial laser scanning for benchmarking broader-scale (e.g. airborne and space-borne) remote sensing assessments of forest distur-bances, as well as to provide a more robust interpretation of biophysical changes detected at coarser resolutions.

AB Reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) are an essential food source for caribou especially during winter. They can also be a valuable indicator for ecosystem health and climate change. Inventory of lichen abundance at regional scales is required to assess availability within caribou ranges, and assess potential declines from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have mapped lichen cover and volume using remote sensing, but these efforts were often constrained by the limited availability of ground truth information needed for model calibration and validation. In this study, we leveraged unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and WorldView (WV) satellite scenes in a nested upscaling approach in order to expand the number of training samples at the 30 m Landsat resolution. These were used to develop machine learning models to map fractional reindeer lichen cover in Eastern Canada. We found that the best correlation between UAV and WV derived lichen coverages exists at an optimal scale that is slightly larger than 30 m and varies with landscape type and observation geometry. Based on training data from UAV-calibrated lichen coverage from WV data, a neural network model with simple structure achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.07 and R-2 = 0.79 for mapping fractional lichen cover from Landsat without the use of ancillary data. We then applied our model and Landsat data to produce a lichen fractional cover map for the Red Wine Mountain caribou herd range in Labrador, NL and the Manicouagan caribou herd range in Que ' bec. Validation against domain-averaged lichen cover in eight UAV survey sites suggests an accuracy with RMSE = 0.04, MAE = 0.03 and R-2 = 0.62 for low lichen cover. Compared to aggregated lichen cover at 30 m from UAV surveys, map accuracy decreases to RMSE = 0.09, MAE = 0.06, and R-2 = 0.49, partially due to registration error between UAV and Landsat images. Our study demonstrates that upscaling of lichen cover from UAV data to Landsat via an intermediate image scale is an effective regional-scale mapping approach.

AB Over the past decades, solar panels have been widely used to harvest solar energy owing to the decreased cost of silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, and therefore it is essential to remotely map and monitor the presence of solar PV modules. Many studies have explored on PV module detection based on color aerial photography and manual photo interpretation. Imaging spectroscopy data are capable of providing detailed spectral information to identify the spectral features of PV, and thus potentially become a promising resource for automated and operational PV detection. However, PV detection with imaging spectroscopy data must cope with the vast spectral diversity of surface materials, which is commonly divided into spectral intra-class variability and interclass similarity. We have developed an approach to detect PV modules based on their physical absorption and reflection characteristics using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. A large database was implemented for training and validating the approach, including spectra-goniometric measurements of PV modules and other materials, a HyMap image spectral library containing 31 materials with 5627 spectra, and HySpex imaging spectroscopy data sets covering Oldenburg, Germany. By normalizing the widely used Hydrocarbon Index (HI), we solved the intra-class variability caused by different detection angles, and validated it against the spectragoniometric measurements. Knowing that PV modules are composed of materials with different transparencies, we used a group of spectral indices and investigated their interdependencies for PV detection with implementing the image spectral library. Finally, six well-trained spectral indices were applied to HySpex data acquired in Oldenburg, Germany, yielding an overall PV map. Four subsets were selected for validation and achieved overall accuracies, producer's accuracies and user's accuracies, respectively. This physics-based approach was validated against a large database collected from multiple platforms (laboratory measurements, airborne imaging spectroscopy data), thus providing a robust, transferable and applicable way to detect PV modules using imaging spectroscopy data. We aim to create greater awareness of the potential importance and applicability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data for PV modules identification.

AB Indonesia recently implemented a novel, technology-driven approach for conducting agricultural production surveys, which involves monthly observations at many thousands of strategic locations and automated data logging via a cellular phone application. Data from these comprehensive field surveys offer immense value for advancing remote sensing technology to map crop production across Indonesia, particularly through the development of machine learning approaches to relate survey data with satellite imagery. The objective of this study was to compare different machine learning scenarios for classifying and mapping the temporal progression of paddy rice production stages across West Java, Indonesia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Monthly paddy rice survey data at 21,696 locations across West Java from November 2018 through April 2019 were used for model training and testing. Five classes related to rice production stage or other field conditions were defined, including rice at tillering, heading, and harvest stages, rice fields with little to no vegetation present, and non-rice areas. A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) nodes provided optimal performance with classification accuracies of 79.6% and 75.9% for model training and testing, respectively, and reduced computational effort. Other approaches that incorporated a convolutional neural network (CNN) either reduced classification accuracy or increased computational effort. Deep machine learning methods (RNN and CNN) generally outperformed other non-deep classifiers, which achieved up to 63.3% accuracy for model testing. Classification accuracies were optimized by inputting two Sentinel-1 channels (VH and VV polarizations) and ten Sentinel-2 channels. Temporal patterns of paddy rice production stages were consistent between the monthly ground-based agricultural survey data and 10-m, satellite-based rice classification maps obtained by applying the LSTM-based RNN across West Java. The results demonstrated the value of combining modern agricultural survey data, satellite remote sensing, and a recurrent neural network to develop multitemporal maps of paddy rice production stages.

AB Earthquakes can trigger numerous landslides and cause other significant changes in the landscape over large areas. This study presents a new processing scheme combining radar (Copernicus Sentinel-1) and optical satellite data (Copernicus Sentinel-2) to quickly and easily map landscape changes such as landslides, coastal uplift and changes in water bodies caused by a severe event such as an earthquake. The processing scheme has been tested for the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake (Mw 7.8), New Zealand, which impacted vast and mostly inaccessible areas, causing hundreds of landslides. The workflow combines the following change-detection methods: i) Sentinel-1 amplitude change detection ii) Sentinel-2-based detection of non-vegetated areas that occurred after the event using the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI). To get a more complex view of the surface changes caused by the Kaikoura earthquake, the available online services and tools were further tested (open source via the European Space Agency) allowing automatic detection of vertical displacements and deformations. It was concluded, that the above-mentioned approaches facilitated the assessment of earthquake-triggered changes in a comprehensive manner. The methodology is an example of how to detect earthquake landscape changes in an automatic and rapid manner. The new processing scheme for the synergic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data has high potential to be used for operational and scientific purposes, since it relies on globally available, free data and provides high spatial and temporal resolution. The results can be obtained and made available only a few days after an event, therefore providing significant insights into earthquake impact assessment and may also be helpful for prioritizing field work.

AB Endemic species comprise 16% of the floral species on Guadalupe Island, including three arboreal species. Almost 96% of the forest coverage was lost due to impacts related to feral goats and wildfires. To date, goats have been eradicated and the restoration of the native vegetation communities is underway. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D Structural Classification Method (3D-SCM) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for mapping the vertical structure of the forest and to automatically characterize its physical attributes. Several TLS scans were performed in July 2016 to assess this recovery, particularly the succession progression. The 3D-SCM used the Forest Condition Classification (FCC) based on radiometric intensity and height values, and the Individual Shape Index (ISI) based on geometry and intensity parameters. It was designed to classify vegetation by stratum using a trial-and-error model to semi-automatically identify impacted areas and succession. The 3D-SCM was able to differentiate the vegetation strata by each forest community at the stand level with a precision of 93% as well as the tree structure parts (stem, branches, and leaves) with a precision of 97%, it also fits the best characteristic shape for the Guadalupe cypress (decagon) and for the pine (droplet). The resulting 3D-SCM provide precise physical specifications, demonstrates a high correlation R-2 = 0.949 for (Diameter Breast Height) DBH, R-2 = 0.974 for the crown and R-2 = 0.97 for heights between maximum laser pulse of tree heights and crowns with respect to field measurements. Mapping 3D vertical forest measurements are important for quantifying the success of management practices and to assist future restoration actions, as it will allow quantification of forest dynamics and carbon sequestration on this island.

AB This paper presents a method for joint retrieval of the ocean surface wind and current vectors using the backscatter and the Doppler frequency shift measured by spaceborne single-beam single-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The retrieval method is based on the Bayesian approach with the a priori information provided by atmospheric and oceanic models for surface wind and currents, respectively. The backscatter and Doppler frequency shift are estimated from the along-track interferometric SAR system TanDEM-X data. The retrieval results are compared against in-situ measurements along the Swedish west coast. It is found that the wind retrieval reduces the atmospheric model bias compared to in-situ measurements by about 1 m/s for wind speed, while the bias reduction in the wind direction is minor as the wind direction provided by the model was accurate in the studied cases. The ocean model bias compared to in-situ measurements is reduced by about 0.04 m/s and 12 circle for current speed and direction, respectively. It is shown that blending SAR data with model data is particularly useful in complex situations such as atmospheric and oceanic fronts. This is demonstrated through two case studies in the Skagerrak Sea along the Swedish west coast. It is shown that the retrieval successfully introduces small scale circulation features detected by SAR that are unresolved by the models and preserves the large scale circulation imposed by the models.

AB Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is one of the main producers in inland lakes. Tracking the temporal and spatial changes in SAV is crucial for the identification of state changes in lacustrine ecosystems, such as changes in light, nutrients, and temperature. However, the available SAV classification algorithms based on remote sensing are highly dependent on field survey data and/or human interventions, prohibiting the extraction of large-scale and/or long-term patterns. Here, we developed an automatic SAV classification algorithm using Landsat imagery, where the thresholds of two key parameters (the floating algae index (FAI) and reflectance in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band) are automatically determined. The algorithm was applied to eight Landsat images of four Yangtze Plain lakes and obtained a mean producer accuracy of 82.9% when gauged against field-surveyed datasets. The algorithm was further employed to obtain long-term SAV areal data from Changdang Lake on the Yangtze Plain from 1984 to 2018, and the result was highly consistent with lake transparency data. Numerical simulations indicated that our developed algorithm is insensitive to the Chl-a concentration of the water column. Yet, it has a detection limit of similar to 0.35 m below the water surface, and such a limit changes with different fractions of vegetation coverage within a pixel. The automatic classification algorithm proposed in this study has the potential to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of SAV in other shallow lakes where SAV grows in lakes sharing similar hydrological characteristics as the lakes in the Yangtze Plain.

AB The recent development of small form-factor (<6 kg), full range (400-2500 nm) pushbroom hyperspectral imaging systems (HSI) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) poses a new range of opportunities for passive remote sensing applications. The flexible deployment of these UAV-HSI systems have the potential to expand the data acquisition window to acceptable (though non-ideal) atmospheric conditions. This is an important consideration for time-sensitive applications (e.g. phenology) in areas with persistent cloud cover. Since the majority of UAV studies have focused on applications with ideal illumination conditions (e.g. minimal or non-cloud cover), little is known to what extent UAV-HSI data are affected by changes in illumination conditions due to variable cloud cover. In this study, we acquired UAV pushbroom HSI (400-2500 nm) over three consecutive days with various illumination conditions (i.e. cloud cover), which were complemented with downwelling irradiance data to characterize illumination conditions and in-situ and laboratory reference panel measurements across a range of reflectivity (i.e. 2%, 10%, 18% and 50%) used to evaluate reflectance products. Using these data we address four fundamental aspects for UAV-HSI acquired under various conditions ranging from high (624.6 - 16.63 W.m(2)) to low (2.5 - 0.9 W.m(2)) direct irradiance: atmospheric compensation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral vegetation indices and endmembers extraction. For instance, two atmospheric compensation methods were applied, a radiative transfer model suitable for high direct irradiance, and an Empirical Line Model (ELM) for diffuse irradiance conditions. SNR results for two distinctive vegetation classes (i.e. tree canopy vs herbaceous vegetation) reveal wavelength dependent attenuation by cloud cover, with higher SNR under high direct irradiance for canopy vegetation. Spectral vegetation index (SVIs) results revealed high variability and index dependent effects. For example, NDVI had significant differences (p < 0.05) across illumination conditions, while NDWI appeared insensitive at the canopy level. Finally, often neglected diffuse illumination conditions may be beneficial for revealing spectral features in vegetation that are obscured by the predominantly non-Lambertian reflectance encountered under high direct illumination. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a full range pushbroom UAV sensor (400-2500 nm) for assessing illumination effects on the aforementioned variables. Our findings pave the way for understanding the advantages and limitations of ultra-high spatial resolution full range high fidelity UAV-HSI for ecological and other applications.

AB Satellite remote sensing has been widely used for the evaluation of wildfire burn severity in various ecosystems. While a variety of remote sensing-based burn severity indices have been developed, the Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) presents the most widely-used approach to burn severity assessment for fire research and management. Although dNBR-based approaches have been continuously updated, including the development of the relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), one key obstacle for the reliable applications of the burn severity indices in the high northern latitudes has not been adequately addressed. Specifically, optimal Landsat image pairs are very rarely available for the calculation of the burn severity indices in certain regions of the high northern latitudes (HNL), resulting in the burn severity index outputs calculated for a large number of wildfires being considerably affected by non-fire-related factors. The suboptimal selection of image pairs may have partially contributed to the lack of consistency in the performance of the burn severity indices in the HNL regions. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the impacts of sub-optimal image pairs on signal stability through two sets of analyses conducted at different spatial scales. First, at the regional scale, we examined the burn severity indices calculated for a selection of wildfires in Alaska. Here, we demonstrate the inconsistent performance of the same index calculated based on Landsat data that are typically considered as "optimal". In addition, we show that the calculated indices may be more prone to the negative impacts of these inconsistencies, thus leading to reduced reliability, when there is limited Landsat data availability. Second, at the continental scale, we show that certain areas in the HNL, especially Alaska during the pre-2000 era, are subject to the potentially strong negative impact associated with the limited data availability. Through systematically analyzing this issue, we hope to not only divert more attention to it but also to provide potential solutions, based on which further improvements that may be of particular importance for research on Arctic wildfires could be made.

AB Electron transport rate (ETR), estimated from chlorophyll fluorescence, is a widely-used indicator of photosynthetic activity. However, net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate (A) does not linearly correlate with ETR when the fraction of electron partitioning into photosynthesis and photorespiration changes under fluctuating environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature and soil moisture).
   Here, we propose a practical approach to estimate A based on ETR with integration of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf temperature, taking intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i)- and temperature-dependent electron partitioning into account.
   A estimated with the present approach was in good agreement with A measured under i) various CO2 concentrations and light intensities in seedlings of Japanese beech and Japanese white birch, and ii) under 400 and 800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and temperatures of 15-40 degrees C, and iii) in progress of drought stress after a water withholding in seedlings of Japanese white birch. Furthermore, canopy-level CO2 uptake could be estimated based on the spectroscopic and flux observations over a Japanese beech stand, under a wide range of environmental conditions.
   The present approach is advantageous because it does not require biochemical information, such as the maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport, providing a more forward approach to estimate terrestrial carbon flux through remote sensing approaches.

AB The continuous, synoptical and high spatio-temporal resolution of thermal and visible satellite observations constitute an asset when characterizing and monitoring biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value <0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r(2) = 0.64, MAPD = 7%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r(2) = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.

AB While mesoscale eddies can trap and transport chlorophyll (CHL) within the water columns, satellite measurements can only observe CHL at the sea surface. Here, we estimate the eddy-induced CHL distribution based on satellite observations, Argo float measurements, and global empirical models. The combination of satellite altimeter data and Argo measurements is used to detect eddy boundaries by tracking the outermost closed contours of potential vorticity (PV) at depth; then, sea surface CHL from satellite observations, together with their vertical distributions estimated from models are used to derive the CHL within eddy boundaries. We find that the CHL trapped by eddies can reach 3.2 x 10(12) g, which is about half of the total CHL in the ocean; the global time-mean CHL eddy-induced zonal transport adds up to 5.7 x 10(3) g/s westward. The results show that oceanic mesoscale eddies play an important role in the elevated CHL in the interior of the ocean.

AB Systematic tracking of individual eddies during their entire lifetimes marks a significant milestone in satellite oceanography over the first two decades of this century. Assuming that the geometry and properties of an oceanic eddy are orientation-sensitive, an angularly aligned composite analysis of over 40 million eddy-focused surface topographic "snapshots" obtained by merging tandem altimeter data from January 1993 through January 2019 reveals that oceanic vortices appear to have a characteristic surface shape of "egg" rather than circle or ellipse as previously understood. Consequently, a second-order moment in eddy morphology is revealed which leads to a similar to 10 km departure from a standard ellipse in terms of major axis. Furthermore, the sharp poles of oceanic eddies exhibit two quasi-orthogonal modes of orientation: primarily meridional and secondarily zonal. The additional submesoscale asymmetry in eddy shape is confirmed by a consistent anisotropy in a normalized eddy-centric velocity field derived from over 25 thousand drifters. The high-order moments in terms of geometric asymmetry and dynamic anisotropy associated with mesoscale eddies (which are found to be statistically significant at 99% level) may have profound geophysical and biological impacts on energy transport, substance entrainment, as well as ecosystem dynamics in the ocean. In particular, it is demonstrated that some of the previously identified patterns in eddy properties obtained by non-rotated normalization may be notably biased due to the ignorance of existing eddy orientation.

AB Salt marshes are one of the most productive but vulnerable ecosystems on Earth; and due to the continued intensification of natural and anthropogenic pressures on them, accurate and timely information on the distribution of plant species in salt marshes is needed for effective coastal management. Time-series approaches have been widely applied to classify plant species; however, developing time-series with high spatial and temporal resolution over coastal zones remains challenging due to the influence caused by frequent cloud cover and periodic tidal fluctuations. In this study, aiming at the above challenges, we presented a saltmarsh vegetation classification method using phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 pixel-differential time-series (PDTS): first, a PDTS that each pixel has a different distribution of observations was constructed using a time series cloud mask; second, a tidal filter determined by the threshold and frequency of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was used to exclude tide-related observations from the PDTS; third, phenological parameters that highlight the differences among salt marsh vegetation were extracted from a two term Fourier fitting curve as classification features; and finally, the random forest algorithm was used for plant species classification with the assistance of sample data. Six common plant species (Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa, Tamarix chinensis, Imperata cylindrica, and Scirpus mariqueter) from three representative coastal sites in China were analyzed. The major results were as follows: (1) The MNDWI demonstrated superior ability in identifying flooding pixels, with an overall accuracy of similar to 0.91. After tidal filtering, the R-2 of the fitting curve for more than 70% of the vegetated salt marsh pixels was improved with an average increase of 0.113. (2) The six plant species exhibit unique phenological characteristics. In particular, P. australis has an advanced green-up season, 19-42 days earlier than that of the other plant species mentioned above, whereas S. alterniflora senesces one to two months later than the native plant species. (3) The average overall accuracy of the plant species classification based on the PDTS was 81.5%. Compared with a single-image based classification, the PDTS-based classification demonstrated a 5.1% improvement in overall accuracy, which is expected to serve the annual monitoring dynamics of the salt marsh.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key hydrologic variable linking the Earth's water, carbon and energy cycles. At large spatial scales, remote sensing-based (RS) models are often used to quantify ET. Despite the large number of RS ET models available, few include soil moisture as a key environmental input, which can degrade model accuracy and utility. Here, we use model assimilation enhanced soil moisture estimates from the NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission as a water supply control in the MOD16 ET algorithm framework. SMAP-derived daily surface (0-5 cm depth) and root zone (0-1 m depth) soil moisture are used with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation observations, and 4 km gridded regional surface meteorology (Gridmet) as primary inputs for estimating daily ET and underlying model soil and stomatal conductance terms. We calibrated the model environmental response parameters using tower eddy covariance ET observations representing major North American biomes. The model ET results were validated using a holdout set of tower observations spanning a large regional climate gradient. The updated ET estimates outperform the baseline MOD16 product across all tower validation sites (RMSE = 0.758 vs 1.108 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.68 vs 0.45, respectively). Smaller relative improvements were obtained using a recalibrated model with 4 km Gridmet meteorology, but no soil moisture control (RMSE = 0.813 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.66), indicating that these changes are essential for the improved model performance. The soil moisture-constrained model improvements and relative benefits from the SMAP observations are greater in arid climates, consistent with stronger soil moisture control on ET in water-limited regions. The use of SMAP soil moisture as an additional model constraint improves MOD16 regional performance and provides a new framework for investigating both soil and atmosphere controls on ET.

   Earthquake deformation; 1978 Tabas-e-Golshan earthquake
AB Historical aerial photographs are a valuable source of data for investigating past earthquakes, volcanic activities, ice mass balance and land changes in the pre-modern era. Scan resolution for digitising the historical archives is an important factor in photogrammetric processes, but the effects have not been quantified yet. In this paper, we use the 1978 Ms 7.4 Tabas-e-Golshan earthquake in eastern Iran as a case study to test how scan resolution affects digitisation and hence the measurements of deformation. We scanned 6 aerial photographs that were acquired in 1956 with 150, 300, 600 and 1200 dots per inch (dpi), and generated four sets of pre-earthquake digital elevation model (DEM) covering the Tabas fold. By differencing the pre-earthquake DEMs and the post earthquake DEM derived from SPOT-6 data acquired in 2013, we made four measurements of slip on the Tabas fold. We compared our measurements to the published model which was derived from matching the pre earthquake Hexagon Keyhole-9 US image and the post-earthquake SPOT-2 and SPOT-6 images, and found that the 600 dpi scans yield the most consistent result among the four different resolutions, with a misfit of 0.7 m. A different resolution might well be better for a different set of aerial photographs, depending on the quality and photographic scale of the images. We scanned 20 aerial photographs that cover the Kurit fold to the south of the Tabas fold with 600 dpi and used them to investigate the slip on that segment. Similarly, DEMs were extracted first to produce the DEM of difference (DoD). Five swath profiles taken from the DoD show clear discontinuities across two fault strands, i.e. the main Kurit fault (the western strand) and a back thrust (the eastern strand). Based on the profile measurements, we implemented Monte Carlo modelling of elastic dislocation and obtained a slip of 1.4 m and 2.2 m on the western and eastern strands respectively. By combining all the information about the earthquake and postseismic slip, we inferred a coseismic slip of 3.5 m on the detachment fault by which most of the seismic moment was released. This slip enhanced the applied load on part of the Kurit fault, which is partly responsible for the long-lasting postseismic deformation in the region.

AB We construct and present the first baseline, time series evolution of L-band SAR microwave backscatter (sigma 0HH) for landfast Arctic first-year (FYI) and multi-year (MYI) sea ice from ALOS PALSAR. We compare the winter to freeze-up seasonal L-band sigma 0HH signatures with C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR imagery and Ku-band QuikSCAT scatterometer data. We also explored the utility of L-band sigma 0HH to detect FYI and MYI melt onset dates. For both ice types, L-band exhibited a similar sigma 0HH evolution to Cand Ku-bands. A rise in L-band sigma 0HH was observed from winter to melt onset, however, with a lower magnitude attributed to the larger penetration of L-band microwaves through the snow-covered sea ice medium. Over FYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) exhibited the most robust response and greater diversity in melt onset signature, compared to Cand Ku-bands. Over MYI, L-band sigma(0)(HH) declined during the winter to melt onset transition contrasting the Cand Ku-band evolution of sigma(0)(HH) during melt onset. Although, a distinct L-band sigma(0)(HH) response was not found during pond onset, a very strong sigma(0)(HH) response was found during sea ice break-up, which could operationally be utilized to identify sea ice break-up timing. During freeze-up, L-band sigma(0)(HH) showed greater diversity compared to Cand Ku-bands. Our study also found that, L-band detected melt onset dates were up to 6 days later than Cand Ku-band detected dates, for both ice types. The melt response was the strongest at L-band for FYI, where C-band detected a robust melt onset date for MYI. Therefore, for operational sea ice monitoring, L-band suits better for FYI, whereas C-band is still a better choice for MYI. In the warming Arctic, where FYI has become the dominant ice type, L-band demonstrates promise to be the optimal choice for sea ice operational monitoring with high spatiotemporal data acquisition from existing, upcoming and proposed L-band SAR missions.

AB In cold regions where soils freeze and thaw annually, the ground surface deforms due to the density difference between groundwater and ground ice. Here we mapped thaw subsidence and frost heave signals over the Toolik Lake area on the North Slope of Alaska using 12 ALOS PALSAR Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) scenes (2006-2010). For the first time, we jointly analyzed InSAR observations with a large number of soil measurements collected within similar to 100 km of the Toolik Field Station. We found that the InSAR-observed deformation patterns are mainly related to soil water content and the seasonal active layer freeze-thaw (FT) cycle. We did not observe any substantial long-term subsidence trend outside the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire scar. This suggests that the magnitude of the maximum annual thaw subsidence did not change much outside the fire zone during the study period. The joint analysis of InSAR and field observations allows us to show that the amplitude of the seasonal thaw subsidence is proportional to the total amount of ice that has melted into liquid water at any given time. We note that topography influences the spatial distribution of soil water content, and the availability of soil water influences the type of vegetation that can grow. As a result, we found that the average seasonal thaw subsidence increases along a geomorphic-ecohydrologic transect with heath vegetation on the drier ridge-tops, tussock tundra on hillslopes, and sedge tundra at the wet lowland riparian zones. In addition, we detected a net uplift between late July and early September, mostly in the wetter riparian zone that experienced a larger seasonal thaw subsidence. Toolik Field Station in-situ records suggest that the air temperature fluctuated around or below freezing in early September during the ALOS PALSAR data acquisition times (at similar to 12 am local time). In this scenario, ice can be formed at the top of the soil, which leads to frost heave in saturated soils. Our results highlight how InSAR can improve our understanding of active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments.

AB Over the past half century, the Yangtze Plain of China has experienced rapid economic development. Lake reclamation (i.e., conversion of natural lake/wetland areas to agricultural/urban land or aquaculture, thereby reducing the area of natural waters) in particular has greatly contributed to meeting the increasing demands for food and urban development. However, until now, a comprehensive quantification and understanding of historical anthropogenic lacustrine exploitation in this region has been lacking, prohibiting assessment of the impacts of these activities. We used Landsat observations from 1973 to 2018 to track reclamation-induced changes in 112 large lakes (97.8% of the total lake area) in the Yangtze Plain. We show that 41.6% (6056.9 km(2)) of the total lake area has been reclaimed since the 1970s. The expansion of agricultural and built-up lands dominated the reclamation activities in the 1970s, while the increase of aquaculture zones has prevailed since the mid-1980s. Reclamation activities were closely connected to government policies and major socio-economic events and had strong impacts on lake hydrology, flood risk mitigation capacity, and water quality as revealed by satellite and in situ observations. This new quantitative understanding of anthropogenic reclamation and its associated impacts on Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes can underpin the development of strategies to reduce the impacts of lake reclamation on environmental quality. The study has also demonstrated the unique strength of using long-term series satellite images in tracking historical environmental changes in a substantial region of the world, and the methods used here are potentially extendable to other inland and coastal areas to understand similar human-environment interaction problems.

AB The angle-dependent scattering effect of aerosols in the atmosphere not only influences climate through radiative forcing effects but also impacts trace gas remote sensing by modifying the path of radiation through the atmosphere. The aerosol phase function, which characterizes the angular signature of scattering, has been continuously monitored from ground-based and space-borne observations. However, the range of scattering angles these instruments can sample is very limited. Here, we report multi-year measurements from a mountain-top remote sensing instrument: the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS), which overlooks the Los Angeles megacity. The observational geometries of CLARS-FTS provide a wide range of scattering angles, from about 20 degrees (forward) to about 140 degrees (backward), which is larger than the range provided by any existing aerosol remote sensing instrument. We then quantify the aerosol angular scattering effect using the O-2 ratio, which is the ratio of retrieved O-2 Slant Column Density (SCD) to geometric O-2 SCD. The O-2 ratio quantifies the light path modification due to aerosol scattering, with a value of 1 representing an aerosol-free scenario. The lower the O-2 ratio value than 1, the stronger the aerosol loading. CLARS-FTS measurements are highly sensitive to the angular scattering effect of aerosols in the Los Angeles (LA) urban atmosphere, due to the long light path going through the boundary layer and the wide range of observational angles. The differences in aerosol scattering between different surface reflection points targeted by CLARS-FTS can be explained by differences in their angular scattering geometries. The correlation between measurements at different targets can be used to quantify the strength of the angular dependence of the aerosol phase function. Applying the correlation technique to CLARS-FTS measurements, we find that, from 2011 to 2018, there is no significant trend in the aerosol phase function in the LA megacity. Overall, this study provides a practical observing strategy for quantifying the angular dependence of aerosol scattering in urban atmospheres that could potentially contribute towards improved greenhouse gas remote sensing in megacities.

AB Quantifying urban areas is crucial for addressing associated urban issues such as environmental and sustainable problems. Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets - population, road, and nighttime light - to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (kappa = 0.69-0.85, mean kappa = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.

AB The launch of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Sumo-NPP satellite in 2011 ushered in a new era of using visible light and shortwave radiation at night to characterize aerosol and fire distributions from space. In order to exploit the full range of unprecedented observational capabilities of VIIRS, we have developed a nighttime shortwave radiative transfer model capability in the UNified and Linearized Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM). This capability is based on the use of additional source functions to treat illumination from the Moon, from fires, and from artificial lights. We have applied this model to address fundamental questions associated with the VIIRS sensing of aerosol and fire at night. Detailed description of model developments and validation (either directly with surface measurements of lunar spectra or indirectly through cross validation) are presented. Our analysis reveals that: (a) when convolution with the broad-range (500-900 nm) relative spectral response (RSR) function of the VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) is omitted, AOD retrieval from the DNB have uncertainties up to a factor of two in conditions with low or moderate AOD (<0.5 in mid-visible); (b) using a wavelength independent spectrum for the surface illumination source can lead to an AOD bias of -10% over surfaces illuminated by light-emitting diodes and fluorescent lamps, and -30% illuminated by high-pressure sodium lamps; and (c) a DNB-equivalent narrow band for AOD retrieval over the surfaces illuminated by the three types of bulbs studied in this paper is found to be centered at 585 nm at which the look-up table can be generated for AOD retrieval from DNB. Furthermore, while uncertainty in AOD retrievals from the DNB decreases as AOD increases, fire characterization can be affected by AOD; for a smoke-scenario AOD of 2.0, the DNB and SWIR (1.6 mu m) radiances can be reduced by 50% depending on the fire area fraction and temperature within VIIRS pixel. DNB is overall more sensitive to smaller and cooler fires than SWIR and can be used to retrieve AOD over bright surfaces. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effects and the non-collimated nature of most artificial light sources are neglected in this 1D radiative transfer (plane-parallel) model, resulting in possibly large uncertainties (e.g., the inability to reproduce side-illumination of clouds by city lights) that should be studied in future.

AB Earth remote sensing using reflected GNSS signals is currently an emerging trend especially in ocean surface wind measurements. Unlike the existing scatterometer missions, GNSS-R uses L-Band navigation signals that can penetrate through clouds and rain. Rain may have a negligible impact on the transmitted signal in terms of path attenuation at this wavelength. However, there are other effects due to rain, such as changes in surface roughness and rain induced local winds, which can significantly alter the measurements. Currently, there is no observation-based characterization of all possible impacts of rain on radar forward scatter, which is the nature of operation of GNSS-R missions. In this study, we propose a 3-fold rain model which accounts for attenuation, surface effects of rain and rain induced local winds. We utilize the large dataset of measurements made by the CYGNSS mission to separate these different effects of rain. The attenuation model suggests that a total of at least 96% transmissivity exists at L-Band up to a rain rate of 30 mm/h. A perturbation model is used to characterize the other rain effects. It suggests that rain is accompanied by an overall reduction in the scattering cross-section of the ocean surface and, most importantly, this effect is observed only up to surface wind speeds of 15 m/s, beyond which the gravity capillary waves dominate the scattering in the quasi-specular direction. Observations also suggest that, at very low wind speeds, the lower bound on wavenumber of the portion of the surface roughness spectrum that influences the measurements deviates from the geometric optics approximation normally used. This work binds together several rain-related phenomena and enhances our overall understanding of rain effects on GNSS-R measurements.

AB Sentinel-1 mission with its wide spatial coverage (250 km), short revisit time (6 days), and rapid data dissemination opened new perspectives for large-scale interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis. However, the spatiotemporal changes in troposphere limits the accuracy of InSAR measurements for operational deformation monitoring at a wide scale. Due to the coarse node spacing of the tropospheric models, like ERA-Interim and other external data like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the interpolation techniques are not able to well replicate the localized and turbulent tropospheric effects. In this study, we propose a new technique based on machine learning (ML) Gaussian processes (GP) regression approach using the combination of small-baseline interferograms and GNSS derived zenith total delay (ZTD) values to mitigate phase delay caused by troposphere in interferometric observations. By applying the ML technique over 12 Sentinel-1 images acquired between May-October 2016 along a track over Norway, the root mean square error (RMSE) reduces on average by 83% compared to 50% reduction obtained by using ERA-Interim model.

AB Growing demands for temporally specific information on land surface change are fueling a new generation of maps and statistics that can contribute to understanding geographic and temporal patterns of change across large regions, provide input into a wide range of environmental modeling studies, clarify the drivers of change, and provide more timely information for land managers. To meet these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey has implemented a capability to monitor land surface change called the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative. This paper describes the methodological foundations and lessons learned during development and testing of the LCMAP approach. Testing and evaluation of a suite of 10 annual land cover and land surface change data sets over six diverse study areas across the United States revealed good agreement with other published maps (overall agreement ranged from 73% to 87%) as well as several challenges that needed to be addressed to meet the goals of robust, repeatable, and geographically consistent monitoring results from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. First, the high spatial and temporal variability of observational frequency led to differences in the number of changes identified, so CCDC was modified such that change detection is dependent on observational frequency. Second, the CCDC classification methodology was modified to improve its ability to characterize gradual land surface changes. Third, modifications were made to the classification element of CCDC to improve the representativeness of training data, which necessitated replacing the random forest algorithm with a boosted decision tree. Following these modifications, assessment of prototype Version 1 LCMAP results showed improvements in overall agreement (ranging from 85% to 90%).

AB The Atacama Desert is considered as one of the driest places on Earth. At the coastline, however, small-scale fog oases harbor a specialized vegetation and fauna, living from moisture by fog, which is used by humans to feed water demands of industrial projects. To date, knowledge about fog and low stratus (FLS) clouds as well as their physical properties is limited in that only local observations or spatial products from satellites with coarse resolutions are available generally failing to capture local patterns resulting from the complex topography. Consequently, we provide the first climatology of FLS with 30 m spatial resolution based on over 400 Landsat scenes acquired since 1986. The new product provides valuable estimates of FLS optical and micro-physical properties. FLS over the Pacific Ocean featured cloud optical depth values around 13.5 declining over land to 4.2. Effective radii were around 5.3 mu m. Liquid water path was between 71.0 gm(-2) over the Ocean and 14.9 gm(-2) over land surfaces. The climatologies of the new Landsat product were successfully validated against those of the MODIS cloud property product over homogeneous surfaces. Over areas with heterogeneous topographies, the new product outperforms existing ones with coarse spatial resolutions if compared against in situ measurements. This shows the general need for cloud products with high spatial resolutions in areas where the development of small scale clouds is favored e.g., by a complex topography leading to systematical biases in existing retrievals.

AB Functional zone reflects city's spatial structures, and as a carrier of social and economic activities, it is of critical significance to urban management, resource allocation and planning. However, most researches on functional zone division are based on a large spatial scale such as blocks or other scales larger than it. Aiming at a subtle fine functional result, the concept of Super Object (SO) was especially explained, also a Super Object - Convolutional Neural Network (SO-CNN) based urban functional zone fine division method with very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing image was proposed. The original image was firstly segmented into different SOs which correspond to the basic functional zone units in geography. A random point generation algorithm was used to generate the voting points for functional zone category identification, and then a trained CNN model was employed to assign functional attributes to those voting points. Then a statistical method was involved to count the frequency of the classified voting points of different functional attributes in each basic functional zone units. By voting process, the functional attribute with the highest frequency was assigned to the basic functional zone unit, which corrected the misclassification results of CNN to some extent. This paper also explored the scale effect of the SO on the final functional zone classification result from two aspects, spatial scale of SO and the sampling window size of CNN model. Because of the natural differences between functional zone division and land cover classification, region based overall accuracy assessment method was used to evaluate functional zone division result. Compared with other methods, SO-CNN method can generate higher accuracy and subtle result, based on which larger spatial scale results can be available by scaling-up, so SO-CNN method plays a great significant role on small scale functional space structure research.

AB Protocols for structural safety assessment methods for Cultural Heritage assets affected by ground instability phenomena have still not been standardized. Accordingly, huge attention is directed towards the development of innovative and reliable approaches for the damage analysis of the Cultural Heritage assets. Within this framework, this paper deals with an integrated approach for the combination of deformation time series, derived from the Tomographic processing of X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation, with ground-based measurements obtained by in-situ survey, laser scanner acquisition and structural analysis. The approach exploits satellite deformation measurements to validate the first interpretation of the structural behaviour of a construction threatened by ground instability based on visual inspection and the analysis of the crack pattern, when geotechnical studies and interpretation, as well as in-situ monitoring systems, are not available.
   The methodology has been tested on the St. Gerlando Cathedral, located on the westernmost and highest area of the Agrigento hill. The Cathedral is affected by complex ground instability phenomena, that have led to several and continuous cracks over centuries. The spatially dense Tomographic SAR measurements allows accessing differential displacement trends in the different sections of the Cathedral and thereby analyzing the overall kinematic behavior of such a complex and heterogeneous structure. This provides essential information for the definition of the structural models, which are fundamental to better understand the behavior and damage evolution of structures subject to ground instabilities and consequently address the most suitable restoration actions.

AB A 10-year-long evolution of ice thickness and volume of the Marmolada glacier is presented. Quantitative measurements have been performed by using two different Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) datasets. A ground-based survey using two different ground-coupled systems equipped with 100 MHz and 35 MHz antennas was performed in 2004. In 2015 the dataset was collected by using a helicopter-borne step frequency GPR equipped with a 100 MHz antenna. Through a critical discussion of the two different methodologies, we show how both approaches are useful to estimate the ice volume within a glacier, as well as its morphological characteristics and changes with time, even if datasets are acquired in different periods of the year.
   The observed 2004-2014 ice volume reduction of the Marmolada glacier is equal to about 30%, while the area covered by ice decreased by about 22%. The glacier is now splitted in several separated units. It is very likely that the fragmentation of the Marmolada glacier observed in the period 2004-2014 was accelerated due to irregular karst topography. By applying the observed 2004-2014 ice-melting trend for the future although the Marmolada glacier might behave slightly differently compared to glaciers on non-karstic terrains owing to dominant vertical subglacial drainage, it will likely disappear by the year 2050. Only few isolated very small and thin ice patches will eventually survive due to avalanche feeding and shading at the foot of the north-facing cliffs.

AB Data assimilation (DA) has a broad category of mathematical procedures for updating and calibrating existing predictions or parameter estimates using new observations. Typical DA procedures such as the Kalman filter require that the observations of a variable of interest used in a forecast of this variable to be collected just prior to the updating procedure and that they continue to be collected over time, a requirement that is not always practical for forest inventory problems. Distinct from the Kalman filter, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) circumvents this time constraint, because it can calibrate the predicted values of a variable of interest using observations from other variables correlated with this variable of interest. Remote sensing played a major role in this study by providing the latter observations. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to propose and illustrate a DA calibration procedure that incorporates simultaneous predictions and BLUP to improve prediction accuracy; (2) to expand this procedure in the framework of model-based inference; and (3) to compare the inferential properties before and after DA calibration for multiple scenarios. Four major conclusions are relevant. First, the prediction accuracies for all variables of interest were consistently increased by 10%-74% after implementing the DA procedure. Second, the DA procedure supported simultaneous inference, and the precision of the simultaneously estimated population means for the variables of interest were increased by 55%-76% after implementing this procedure. Third, the parametric bootstrap procedures used to estimate the inferential precisions for this complex estimation problem were effective and converged rapidly. In addition, this DA calibration procedure is universally applicable for DA calibrations using other data sources such as airborne or terrestrial laser scanning and spectral data, given that cross-model correlations exist. Overall, the proposed procedure demonstrated considerable potential for better serving forest inventory with respect to both simultaneous inference and inferential precision.

AB In coastal areas, the concentrations and the optical properties of the water components have a large spatial and temporal variability, due to river discharges and meteo-marine conditions, such as wind, wave and current, and their interaction with shallow water bathymetry. This large temporal variability cannot be captured using the standard Ocean Colour Radiometry (OCR) polar orbiting satellites, the latter providing almost one image per day. On the contrary, the use of OCR geostationary sensors, like the Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI), centred above the Korean Peninsula, enable to capture the short-term variability of the optical properties. To compensate the lack of a geostationary sensor similar to GOCI over other coastal environments, like the North Adriatic Sea (NAS), the multiple observations provided during the same day by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) mounted on the SUOMI NPP satellite, can be exploited. Indeed, due to its large swath of 3060 km, the VIIRS orbits can overlap over the NAS during the same day within 1 h and 42 min, an important feature that can be useful in capturing the short term variability of the optical properties.
   A large number of VIIRS overlaps in the NAS are characterized by high sensor zenith angle (SZA) of the observation, resulting in a large portion of images masked by the high satellite zenith flag. In order to make available those observations and, in general, to reduce the dependence of the VIIRS observations from the SZA, an adjustment based on a multi linear regression scheme, which exploits radiometric in situ observations, was here applied.
   This study aims to prove the suitability of the adjusted overlapping VIIRS in capturing the short time scale dynamics of particulate backscattering, and this was demonstrated by the analysis of a case study for the 21st and 22nd of March 2013. In order to evaluate the advantages in using multiple observations during the same day, also the similar to 24 h dynamics was analysed, comparing the overlapping VIIRS results with the ones obtained from the daily product.

AB The changing climate is shifting the seasonality of photosynthesis in vegetation, including the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (LOS) of the growing season, and the peak photosynthesis timing (PPT). While the SOS, EOS, and LOS have been widely investigated, the PPT of grasslands - as a proxy for the response of seasonal plant photosynthesis to climate change - has been overlooked. In this study, we propose a hybrid generalized additive model (HGAM) method to extract PPT using the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM)-based gross primary production (GPP) product, and we examine the dynamics, drivers, and consequences of PPT changes in temperate and alpine grasslands in China over 2000-2016. We found that the PPTs in temperate and alpine grasslands have exhibited advancing (with -0.68 days yr(-1), p < 0.05) and delaying (with 0.29 days yr(-1), p = 0.158) trends, respectively. In addition, preseason precipitation and soil moisture were positively correlated with the PPT in temperate and alpine grasslands, respectively, while the preseason temperature consistently controlled the PPT changes in both grasslands. Furthermore, we found that an earlier PPT was associated with higher annual production in the temperate grasslands but not in the alpine grasslands in China. The divergent PPT patterns indicated the varied adaptation characteristics to climatic constraints in the temperate and alpine grasslands and also caused different consequences on carbon uptake. This study highlights the importance of PPT in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis and the carbon cycle under a changing climate.

AB Increasing availability of dense time series of moderate spatial resolution satellite data for mapping global burned areas calls for mapping algorithms designed to easily integrate data at different spatial and temporal resolutions, irrespective of particular grid constraints. In this paper, we describe a novel hybrid approach for global burned area mapping that combines active fire data and time series of surface reflectance using graphs, which provide a flexible and efficient way of extracting spatiotemporal consistent patches.
   Our approach has three main steps. Firstly, we analyze burn-sensitive vegetation index time series to determine for each location a set of events, which are the dates for which the spectral-temporal signal indicates the possibility of a burn. Secondly, we explore the spatiotemporal distribution of all events and active fires to determine a subset of events with strong evidence of corresponding to burned areas. Those events are used as positive occurrences for training a one-class maximum entropy classifier and obtain, for each candidate event, a likelihood of it actually corresponding to a burn. Finally, we build a graph that combines all previous information, from which we extract spatiotemporal patches of densely connected events. Patches with strong evidence of burning determine the burned area map at any given time period.
   This research is part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) and aims ultimately at generating Sentinel-3 daily global burned area products at 500 m spatial resolution. Towards that end, we test our approach with spatially and spectrally similar MODIS gridded surface reflectance (MOD/MYDO9GA), as well as non-gridded active fire (MCD14ML) 2008 data and CCI global land cover maps. Using 105 independent Landsat fire reference perimeters to validate global results, we show that our algorithm applied to MOD/MYDO9GA data (PT-M09) has very similar accuracy (44%) measured by the Dice coefficient compared with MCD64A1 v006 (45%). Moreover, PT-M09 exhibits a higher commission error but a lower omission error than MCD64A1. Due to their coarse resolution, this kind of product cannot capture very small burn areas. The bias relative to the reference burned area indicates that the algorithm presented in the current study underestimates burned area by 14% of the area actually burned according to reference data, which is lower than the underestimation in MCD64A1 (28%).
   We also analyzed the temporal accuracy of the patch based algorithm and concluded that the average time difference to active fires detection is 3.43 days, which is similar to MCD64A1 (3.75 days). Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis which shows that total mapped burned areas varies only 3% when the main algorithm threshold that separates "burned" and "unburned" patches varies from quantile 45% to 55%.

AB SMAP satellite has provided us the first 9-km global soil moisture (SM) product, which is retrieved from the combined L-band radiometer and radar observations with a balance between accuracy and resolution. However, SMAP's radar failed on July 7, 2015, making the continuous production of the 9-km SM impossible, which has considerably affected the application of SMAP in hydrological monitoring. This study was aimed at extending the SMAP 9-km SM by developing a non-local filter based spatio-temporal fusion model (STFM). With the auxiliary of the historical 9-kmand 36-km products, the STFM was used to downscale the daily 36-km product to 9-km. Two-year 9-km product was estimated using STFM in the study. It shows that the estimated product has the detailed information retention of 9-km product and the comparable accuracy with 36-km product, which makes it feasible to improve the application potential of the current SMAP SM products.

AB Data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution are increasingly available. While this allows more accurate prediction of plant traits at different spatial scales, it raises concerns about a lack of independence between observations. Hyperspectral wavelengths are serially correlated provoking multicollinearity among the predictors. As collection of ground reference points for validation remains time-consuming and difficult in many environments, empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths. Moreover, any set of observations collected from a continuous surface is also likely to be spatially autocorrelated. Machine learning regression facilitates the task of selecting the most informative wavelengths, and then transforming them into latent variables to avoid the problem of multicollinearity. However, these regression methods do not solve the problem of spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. In this study we show that, when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed, models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit a higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regressions do. However, for these models to work, the number of (hyperspectral) bands included in the models has to be drastically reduced and the model can not be directly extrapolated to a new (unobserved) location in another area. We conclude that quantifying spatial autocorrelation a-priori in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and the spectral dimensions should be modelled together or not.

AB Reclaimed lands account for a large portion of the developable territories in Hong Kong. Towards better construction planning for the follow-up civil works, stability monitoring is usually required at these artificial sites. The Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technique can provide bi-weekly updates of high resolution (up to 1 m) and high precision (millimeter level) ground motion maps at low costs, which overcomes the limitations of ground-based instruments. However, rapid settlement during the early stage of soil consolidation can result in significant temporal decorrelation to phase signals and impact InSAR detection, especially over newly reclaimed areas. Here, we give a first demonstration on how the introduction of in-situ extensometer measurements can help improve InSAR capabilities for signal recovery of the early consolidation process. We integrate persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) in our processing chain to establish a two-tier monitoring network. Magnetic extensometers are used to estimate local consolidation models, which are then utilized to replace the linear part in the conventional functional phase model. For nonlinear deformation, both hyperbolic and exponential models were considered. The proposed method was applied to 61 TerraSAR-X images covering the Penny's Bay Reclamation Stage 2 (PBR2) in Hong Kong. The consolidation history of the new reclamation site has been successfully extracted, with cumulative subsidence exceeding 1.6 m between May 2008 and Dec. 2011. Approximately 84% of the settlement of the non-dredged region was found to be from compaction of underlying soft marine deposits, not the filling materials. In addition to highlighting the spatiotemporal characteristics of the deformation, InSAR also helps reveal the compaction evolution of the underlying deposit. The results benefit our understanding of the early consolidation process in PBR2 and inform extra reinforcement plans if necessary.

AB Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typically dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines. The history of mangrove remote sensing (RS) can be traced back to 1956. Over the last six decades, hot spot topics in the field of mangrove RS have evolved from mangrove distribution mapping, biophysical parameters inversion, to ecosystem process characterization. Although several review articles have been published to summarize the progress in this field, none of them highlighted the key milestones of historical developments pertinent to major research topics or key drivers that stimulate such milestones.
   In this review, we aim to identify key milestones in mangrove RS by associating the emergence of major research topics with the occurrence of new sensors in four historical phases, i.e. before 1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2018. For each identified research topic, an in-depth theoretical understanding was achieved by analyses of both the first published article and the most-cited article. Based on the analyses, the current state of knowledge as well as existing limitations were summarized. In addition, in order to gain insights on driving forces for emergence of new research topics, we compared the chronological evolution of mangrove RS with that of terrestrial forest RS.
   Interestingly, we found that key research topics in mangrove RS replicated those of forest RS yet with varying time lags. This can be attributed to the following two facts: 1) mangrove forests often appear as more elongated patches than terrestrial forests; 2) field work is more challenging in mangrove habitat. Along with the RS sensors' advancement, various topics that had been studied in terrestrial forests were later transformed to mangrove studies. Based on the projected growth of foreseeing earth observation capacity, insights on future research directions in mangrove RS were also presented.

AB Satellite image time series (SITS) data have been widely used in resource investigations and environmental monitoring. However, three characteristics of geographic objects (i.e., spatiotemporal heterogeneity, spatio-temporal correlation and scale characteristics) pose great challenges to SITS analysis; while, existing studies ignore these characteristics, leading to unsatisfactory SITS analysis results including land-cover classification and change detection. Aiming at integratively measuring and expressing these three characteristics, this study proposes a spatiotemporal cube model and a spatiotemporal multi-resolution segmentation (ST-MRS) method for analyzing SITS. First, the novel spatiotemporal model, ST-cube, is introduced to reduce the spectral heterogeneity in spatial and temporal domains. Both spatial and temporal heterogeneities are considered and defined while constructing the spatiotemporal segmentation model. Second, the ST-MRS method is proposed by extending the existing mono-temporal MRS method into spatiotemporal domain to segment SITS into relatively homogeneous ST-cubes. Third, a novel unsupervised method is developed to evaluate the segmentation results of the ST-MRS method. In experiments, we apply this method to Shunyi District in Beijing, China, generate ST-cubes at different spatiotemporal scales, and compare our method with existing ones for SITS classification. Furthermore, the intra-annual seasonal changes of land covers are detected based on ST-cubes classification results. The results indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the ST-cubes in representing geographic objects and analyzing spatiotemporal characteristics over existing pixel- and object-based methods, contributing to a wider range of applications and analysis of SITS.

AB Barataria Basin, a deltaic marsh-estuary system in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the coastal ecosystem. To assess DOM dynamics, monthly measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and colored DOM (CDOM; an optical proxy for DOC) absorption were obtained over a three-year period (2008-2011) along a transect encompassing the upper, middle and lower regions of the Barataria Basin estuary. While CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) generally decreased and spectral slope at 275-295 nm (S275-295) increased along the transect from the upper to lower basin, deviations were observed associated with hydrologic and meteorological influences. An application of wavelet analysis to the time-series of a(g)355 and various freshwater sources revealed a spatiotemporal resonance of ag355 with freshwater input from the Mississippi River (MR), the controlled freshwater discharge from the Davis Pond freshwater diversion, and rainfall in the lower, middle and upper basins, respectively. Field measurements and Landsat/MODIS data spanning across different seasons between 2008 and 2011 were used to develop optimized a(g)355 empirical algorithms for the high river flow, cold front, and normal conditions. Power law models relating a band ratio (green/red) of a satellite sensor to a(g)355 showed good performance for the MODIS-Aqua (R-2 similar to 0.81-0.83, N = 581) and Landsat-5 TM (R-2 similar to 0.72-0.79, N = 304) imagery. a(g)355-DOC relationships (R-2 similar to 0.77-0.84, N = 306) applied to historical Landsat-5 TM (1985-2011) and MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2012) showed strong environmental influences on multi-decadal CDOM and DOC spatiotemporal trends. Satellite-derived DOC agreed reasonably well with in-situ measured DOC (averaged R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.13). While the time-series DOC showed seasonality and decreasing gradients from the upper to lower basin, an overall increase in DOC was observed in the upper and middle basins from 1985 to 2012. However, in the lower basin, DOC increased from 1985 to 2006 but decreased from 2007 to 2012, likely due to the impact of two major hurricanes in 2005. Furthermore, relationships between satellite-derived DOC and land cover variations (1985-2011) along the wetland-estuary interfaces derived from Landsat-5 TM supervised classification showed an increase in DOC with corresponding increase in developed area in the upper basin, while in the lower basin, DOC increased by 41% (R-2 = 0.54) between 1985 and 2006 corresponding to a 17% decrease in salt marsh area, suggesting strong land use/land loss impact on the long-term DOC trends in Barataria Basin.

AB Invasive plant species can pose major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Satellite based remote sensing has evolved as an important technology to spatially map the occurrence of invasive species in space and time. With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination, the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R-2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in the UAV data.

AB The primary objective of the European Space Agency's 7th Earth Explorer mission, BIOMASS, is to determine the worldwide distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) in order to reduce the major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes associated with the terrestrial biosphere, including carbon fluxes associated with Land Use Change, forest degradation and forest regrowth. To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200 m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50 m resolution (where "global" is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7 months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30 m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.

AB Formal planning and development of what became the first Landsat satellite commenced over 50 years ago in 1967. Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality.
   Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and followup with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop-justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.

AB The effect of terrain slope on large footprint lidar waveforms is still a great challenge to the accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB), although previous studies have made significant progress for slopes lower than 15 degrees. A new method was proposed to calculate slope-adaptive waveform metrics for forest AGB mapping over mountainous areas. First, a theoretical model was proposed to calculate lidar waveforms of bare ground with known terrain slopes. The forest waveform and its corresponding calculated bare ground waveform were then aligned by the signal ending points. Their energy quartiles were extracted separately by taking the signal ending points as references. The height differences between the corresponding energy quartiles were defined as slope-adaptive waveform metrics, which were then used as independent variables for the estimation of the forest AGB. The proposed method was examined with both simulated lidar waveforms of forest stands and real waveforms acquired by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Two typical footprint sizes (i.e., 25 m and 70 m in diameter) and 21 terrain slopes (i.e., from 0 degrees to 40 degrees at an interval of 2 degrees) were used in the simulation of the lidar waveforms. The terrain slopes of the GLAS waveforms were between 5.54 degrees and 34.08 degrees. The results showed that the terrain stretching on the forest waveform could be compensated for by the bare ground waveform. Compared with the Gaussian decomposition and waveform parameter methods, the proposed method gave the best estimation of the forest AGB with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 15.95 Mg/ha using simulated waveforms with a footprint size of 70 m and R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 34.99 Mg/ha using the GLAS waveforms. The results demonstrated that the proposed method had great potential for the estimation of forest AGB using lidar waveforms over mountainous areas.

AB The 190 km(2) Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory in the Piedmont region of South Carolina, USA lies in an ancient, highly weathered landscape transformed by historic agricultural erosion. Following the conversion of largely hardwood forests to cultivated fields and pastures for similar to 200 years, excess runoff from fields led to extreme sheet, rill, and gully erosion across the landscape. Roads, terraces, and a variety of other human disturbances have increased the landscapes surface roughness. By the 1950s, cultivation-based agriculture was largely abandoned across most of the Southern Piedmont due to soil erosion, declining agricultural productivity, and shifting agricultural markets. Secondary forests, dominated by loblolly and shortleaf pines, have since regrown on much of the landscape, including the 1500 km(2) Sumter National Forest, which was purchased from farmers and private land owners in the 1930s. Although this landscape was intensively farmed for approximately 150 years, there are a few hardwood forest stands and even entire small watersheds that have never been plowed and degraded by farming. Such relatively old hardwood stands and watersheds comprise relic landforms whose soils, regoliths, and vegetation are of interest to hydrologists, environmental historians, biogeochemists, geomorphologists, geologists, pedologists, and others interested in understanding the legacy of land-use history in this severely altered environment.
   In this work we champion the need for high-resolution terrain mapping and demonstrate how Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) data and microtopographic terrain roughness analyses (MTRA) can be used to infer land use history and management. This is accomplished by analyzing fine scale variation in terrain slope across the 1190 km(2) CCZO using data derived from three independent and overlapping LiDAR datasets at varying spatial resolutions. Terrain slope variability MTRA is further compared to three other methods of capturing and quantifying fine-scale surface roughness. We lastly demonstrate how these analyses can be employed in concert with historic aerial photography from the 1930's, contemporary Landsat remote sensing data, and ecological field data to identify reference relic landforms: hardwood stands, hillslopes, and small watersheds that have experienced minimal anthropogenic erosion for study and conservation.

AB A locally-adapted multitemporal two-phase burned area (BA) algorithm has been developed using as inputs Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measurements in the short and near infrared wavebands plus the active fires detected by Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. An initial burned area map is created in the first step, from which tile dependent statistics are extracted for the second step. The whole Sub-Saharan Africa (around 25 M km(2)) was processed with this algorithm at a spatial resolution of 20 m, from January to December 2016. This period covers two half fire seasons on the Northern Hemisphere and an entire fire season in the South. The area was selected as existing BA products account it to include around 70% of global BA. Validation of this product was based on a two-stage stratified random sampling of Landsat multitemporal images. Higher accuracy values than existing global BA products were observed, with Dice coefficient of 77% and omission and commission errors of 26.5% and 19.3% respectively. The standard NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) showed a similar commission error (20.4%), but much higher omission errors (59.6%), with a lower Dice coefficient (53.6%). The BA algorithm was processed over > 11,000 Sentinel-2 images to create a database that would also include small fires (< 100 ha). This is the first time a continental BA product is generated from medium resolution sensors (spatial resolution = 20 m), showing their operational potential for improving our current understanding of global fire impacts. Total BA estimated from our product was 4.9 M km(2), around 80% larger area than what the NASA BA product (MCD64A1 c6) detected in the same period (2.7 M km(2)). The main differences between the two products were found in regions where small fires (< 100 ha) account for a significant proportion of total BA, as global products based on coarse pixel sizes (500 m for MCD64A1) unlikely detect them. On the negative side, Sentinel-2 based products have lower temporal resolution and consequently are more affected by cloud/cloud shadows and have less temporal reporting accuracy than global BA products. The product derived from S2 imagery would greatly contribute to better understanding the impacts of small fires in global fire regimes, particularly in tropical regions, where such fires are frequent. This product is named FireCCISFD11 and it is publicly available at: https://www.esa-fire-cci.org/node/262, last accessed on November 2018.

AB A radiative transfer and process-based model, called Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE), relates remote sensing signals with plant functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and evapotranspiration). Relying on optical remote sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state variables: (i) vapor pressure (e(i)), both in the soil pore space and leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) by a soil moisture dependent stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (r(ss)) through approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3 grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004. By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled e(i); (ii) with modeled ei and V-cmax; and (iii) with modeled e(i) V-cmax and r(ss). The outputs of all four simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements. The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in thermal observations.

AB Monitoring temporal changes in phytoplankton dynamics in high latitude lakes is particularly timely for understanding the impacts of warming on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed 33-years of high resolution (30 m) Landsat (LT) data for reconstructing seasonal patterns of chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in four lakes across Finland, between 60 degrees N and 64 degrees N. Chl a models based on LT spectral bands were calibrated using 17-years (2000-2016) of field measurements collected across the four lakes. These models were then applied for estimating chl a using the entire LT-5 and 7 archives. Approximately 630 images, from 1984 to 2017, were analyzed for each lake. The chl a seasonal patterns were characterized using phenology metrics, and the time-series of LT-based chl a estimates were used for identifying temporal shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a concentration. Our results showed an increase in the length of phytoplankton growth season in three of the lakes. The highest increase was observed in Lake Koylionjarvi, where the length of growth season has increased by 28 days from the baseline period of 1984-1994 to 2007-2017. The increase in the length of season was mainly attributed to an earlier start of phytoplankton blooms. We further analyzed surface temperature (T-s) and precipitation data to verify if climatic factors could explain the shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a. We found no direct relationship between T-s and chl a seasonal patterns. Similarly, the phonological metrics of Ts, in particular length of season, did not show significant temporal trends. On the other hand, we identify potential links between changes in precipitation patterns and the increase in the phytoplankton season length. We verified a significant increase in the rainfall contribution to the total precipitation during the autumn and winter, accompanied by a decline in snowfall volumes. This could indicate an increasing runoff volume during the beginning of spring, contributing to an earlier onset of the phytoplankton blooms, although further assessments are needed to analyze historical streamflow values and nearby land cover data. Likewise, additional studies are needed to better understand why chl a patterns in some lakes seem to be more resilient than in others.

   of forest loss and degradation using probability sampling in Guyana

AB Guyana is a high forest cover, low deforestation country. Since 2011-2014 the Guyana Forestry Commission (GFC) has used visual interpretation of 5 m resolution RapidEye imagery to map forest loss and nearby degradation for the entire country. According to the GFC produced national map, 58% of all forest loss events cover less than 1 ha, so forest loss is very rare and occurs at a scale that can be difficult to detect and monitor. Nearly all (similar to 97%) of the forest loss and nearby degradation is due to small-scale mining and its associated infrastructure. For any country wanting to accurately map and monitor forest loss, sample-based area estimation can be considerably less expensive than wall-to-wall mapping. To quantify the tradeoff between precision and cost, we evaluated the standard errors of area estimators for several sample-based strategies using Guyana as a case study. We partitioned Guyana into 374 blocks, with each block 24 km x 24 km to align with the image tiles provided by RapidEye's 3A product. The area of forest loss and area of degradation for each of the 374 blocks were determined from the GFC map to create the population data used to evaluate the precision of different sample-based strategies. We compared the standard errors of estimators of area of forest loss and area of degradation obtained from simple random, stratified random and systematic sampling as applied to these population data. To construct strata for the stratified design, we evaluated two forest loss maps produced from Landsat data, a 30 m global forest loss product and a 30 m national forest loss map produced specifically for Guyana. For both of these maps, several options for defining stratum boundaries and allocating sample size to strata were evaluated. All stratified design options reduced the standard error of the area estimators relative to simple random sampling. The Dalenius-Hodges and Jenks methods for choosing stratum boundaries yielded greater improvements in precision than the Equal Area method. For this Guyana case study, optimal and equal allocation of sample size to strata led to substantially better precision than proportional allocation. Only small improvements in precision were attained by increasing the number of strata from three to five. For simple random sampling, incorporating the global and national forest loss map information in a regression estimator reduced standard errors of estimated area of forest loss and area of degradation relative to the standard error of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator that does not incorporate the forest loss map information. However, the best performing stratified sampling design options had better precision than the regression estimator. RapidEye data cost 800 USD per '3A' tile so the annual imagery cost for mapping Guyana would be 274,000 USD. For an investment of 75,200 USD (the cost of 94 RapidEye tiles, the largest sample size evaluated), the best performing stratified random sample achieved a relative standard error (100% times the standard error divided by area) of 7% for estimating area of forest loss and 6% for estimating area of degradation. This study demonstrates the utility of Landsat-based forest loss maps to provide effective strata to improve precision of area estimators produced from a sample of RapidEye imagery in a country for which forest loss and degradation are very rare features of the landscape.

AB Leaf area dynamics offer information about changes in forest biomass and canopy function critical to understanding the role of forests in the climate system and carbon cycle. Airborne small footprint lidar is a potential major source for the detection of variation in leaf area density (LAD), LAD vertical profiles, and total leaf area (leaf area index, LAI), from sites to regional scales. However, the sensitivities of lidar-based LAD and LAI estimation are not yet well known, particularly in dense forests, over landscape heterogeneity, sensor system, and survey differences, and through time. To address these questions, we compared 16 pairs of multitemporal airborne lidar surveys with four different laser sensors across six Amazon forest sites with resurvey intervals ranging from one to nine years. We tested whether the different laser sensors, and the pulse return density of laser sampling (variable between and within each survey) introduce systematic biases. Laser sensors created consistent biases that accounted for up to 18.20% of LAD differences between surveys, but biases could be corrected with a simple regression approach. Lidar pulse return density had little appreciable bias impact when above 20 returns per m(2). After correction, repeated mean and site maximum LAI estimates became significantly correlated (R-2 similar to 0.8), while LAD profiles revealed site differences. Heterogeneity and change in LAD structure were detectable at the ecologically relevant 1/4 ha forest neighborhood grid scale, as evidenced by the high correlation of profile variation between surveys, with the strength of correlation (R-2 value) significantly decreasing with increasing survey interval (0.74 to 0.16 from one to nine years), consistent with accumulating effects of forest dynamics. Sensor-induced biases trended towards correlation with lidar footprint (beam width). The LAD estimation and bias correction approach developed in this study provides the standardization critical for heterogeneous lidar networks that offer high throughput functional ecological monitoring of climatically important forests like the Amazon.

AB Foliar functional traits refer to a range of biochemical and physiognomic characteristics of vegetation that control photosynthesis, nutrient and water cycling, and can be used to describe the functional diversity of ecosystems. In this study, we utilize NASA AVIRIS - Next Generation imaging spectroscopy data to map 15 foliar functional traits in a grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, a Long-Term Ecological Research site in Central Minnesota, across three years. To estimate traits, we compared the widely used partial least squares regression (PLSR) with Gaussian processes regression (GPR) to assess differences in model performance and uncertainty estimates. PLSR is attractive for its straightforward implementation and interpretation, but requires bootstrapping-based methods to estimate and map prediction uncertainties. On the other hand, GPR is more complex to implement and interpret, but provides explicit estimates of uncertainties. Our results indicated that foliar functional traits can be retrieved in these grasslands with moderate to high accuracies using either method. Highest validation accuracies were obtained for leaf mass per area (LMA), soluble cell contents, hemicellulose and cellulose (all with R-2 > 0.8), and lower accuracies for lignin, nitrogen, and some pigments with both techniques. The estimations for the mass-based pigments were more accurate than the area-based pigments (at least 5% improvement in normalized RMSE). Overall, GPR and PLSR performed comparably with respect to both skill of predictions and the selection of most informative spectral regions. Maps of uncertainties corresponded well between the two models, with highest uncertainties related to low vegetation cover, high diversity levels, or under irrigation and nitrogen treatments (not represented in the field sampling). The maps showed that trait values in each plot were relatively stable across three years of managed species richness. Our results provide a template for mapping foliar traits and their uncertainties in grasslands, and point to the need for extensive ground data across time to properly evaluate performance of trait mapping algorithms.

AB The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

AB We evaluate different techniques that rebuild reservoir bathymetry by combining multi-satellite imagery of surface water elevation and extent. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are processed in two distinct ways in order to determine 3-D reservoir bathymetry. They are defined as (a) linear extrapolation and (b) linear interpolation. The first one linearly extrapolates the land slope, defining the bottom as the intersection of all extrapolated lines. The second linearly interpolates the uppermost and lowermost pixels of the reservoir's main river, repeating the process for all other tributaries. A visible bathymetry, resulting from the combination of radar altimetry and water extent masks, can be coupled with the DEM, improving the accuracy of techniques (a) and (b). Envisat and Altika-based altimetric time series is combined to a Landsat-based water extent database over the 2002-2016 period in order to generate the visible bathymetry, and topography is derived from the 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS DEM. Fourteen 3-D bathymetries derived from the combination of these techniques and datasets, plus the inclusion of upstream and downstream riverbed elevations, are evaluated over Lake Mead. Accuracy is measured using ground observations, and show that metrics improve as a function of added data requirement and processing. Best bathymetry estimates are obtained when the visible bathymetry, linear extrapolation technique and riverbed elevation are combined. Water storage variability is also evaluated and shows that best results are derived from the aforementioned combination. This study contributes to our understanding and representation of reservoir water impoundment impacts on the hydrological cycle.

AB Many arid and semiarid grasslands around the world are suffering from shrub encroachment to a great extent. However, the process of shrub encroachment is still poorly understood. Particularly, there has been limited historical datasets and inadequate field samples about the encroachment species. Shrub age can serve as an important indicator of the shrub encroachment history; and the population structure based on the shrub age distribution can reflect the population dynamics of an encroachment species. Using a high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing data, this paper estimates the age and population structure of a typical shrub, the Caragana genus (hereafter shrubs) in the temperate arid and semiarid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. The primary methods include: (1) building a shrub age estimation model considering different shrub crown growth rates affected by different precipitation regimes in the Inner Mongolian grassland; (2) identifying shrub individuals from multiple HSR remote sensing images and estimating the age of shrub individuals using the developed shrub age estimation model; (3) establishing a shrub age histogram, fitting the population structure, and calculating the survival rate and regeneration count using a negative exponential function. The results indicate that this shrub age estimation model performs better than a simple statistical regression using only the shrub crown area. Further, employing the negative exponential function for research on shrub encroachment provides supporting evidence of its effective role in capturing the population structure. Result also identifies that the survival rate increases with precipitation.

AB Arch bridges are important transportation infrastructures widely distributed in China, but they are prone to structural defects due to aging without routine inspection and maintenance. Therefore, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of these bridges is urgently needed by civil engineers to effectively reduce the risk of bridge damage or collapse on public safety. An essential method for SHM, the modem Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique, can detect subtle deformation of bridges at relatively low costs. Nevertheless, identifying dense point-like targets (PTs) on such partially coherent arch bridges in SAR image is more difficult than that for other man-made objects, owing to their complex structures and backscattering behaviors. Furthermore, the complex mechanical properties of arch bridges, due to the varying arch-beam interactions, make it hard to separate the surface deformation and thermal dilation accurately, and the lack of specific structural knowledge, that can help to understand the deformation evolution process, limits the global structural risk assessment. Aiming at these problems, we developed a structure-driven multi-temporal DInSAR approach for arch bridge-specific SHM. By introducing three structure-driven steps, i.e. backscattering geometrical interpretation, linear thermal dilation estimation and validation, and Deformation Feature Points (DFPs) based risk assessment, into the traditional DInSAR method, the reliability of PTs identification, thermal dilation separation, and structural risk assessment for arch bridges are significantly improved. The effectiveness of our approach was fairly presented by two case studies of the Rainbow and Lupu bridges, and the experimental results were verified by leveling benchmark validation, cross-sensor comparison, as well as structural-reliability assessment. Our results revealed that arch bridges exhibit a similar pattern of PTs distribution that is dense around piers and sparse on the spans, as well as a symmetrical progressive pattern of surface deformation with the subsidence increasing from piers and reaching a peak at the central spans. In contrast, magnitudes and mechanisms of thermal dilation are different, and highly dependent on the materials and structural characteristics of specific bridges.

TI STAIR: A generic and fully-automated method to fuse multiple sources of
   optical satellite data to generate a high-resolution, daily and

AB Surface reflectance data with high resolutions in both space and time have been desired and demanded by scientific research and societal applications. Standard satellite missions could not provide such data at both high resolutions. Fusion approaches that leverage the complementary strengths in various satellite sources (e.g. MODISNIIRS/GOES-R's sub-daily revisiting frequency and Landsat/Sentinel-2's high spatial resolution) provide a viable means to simultaneously achieve both high resolutions in the fusion data. In this paper, we presented a novel, generic and fully-automated method, STAIR, for fusing multi-spectral satellite data to generate a high frequency, high-resolution and cloud-/gap-free data. Building on the time series of multiple sources of satellite data, STAIR first imputes the missing-value pixels (due to cloud cover or sensor mechanical issues) in satellite images using an adaptive-average correction process, which takes into account different land covers and neighborhood information of miss-value pixels through an automatic segmentation. To fuse satellite images, it employs a local interpolation model to capture the most informative spatial information provided by the high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat) and then performs an adjustment step to incorporate the temporal patterns provided by the high-frequency data (e.g., MODIS). The resulting fused products contain daily, high spatial resolution and cloud-/gap-free fused images. We tested our algorithm to fuse surface reflectance data of MODIS and Landsat in Champaign County at Illinois and generated daily time series for all the growing seasons (Apr 1 to Nov 1) from 2000 to 2015 at 30 m resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAIR not only captures correct texture patterns but also predicts accurate reflectance values in the generated images, with a significant performance improvement over the classic STARFM algorithm. This method is computationally efficient and ready to be scaled up to continental scales. It is also sufficiently generic to easily include various optical satellite data for fusion. We envision this novel algorithm can provide effective means to leverage historical optical satellite data to build long-term daily, 30 m surface reflectance record (e.g. from 2000 to present) at continental scales for various applications, as well as produce operational near-realtime daily and high-resolution data for future earth observation applications.

AB Radar data have been used to retrieve and monitor the surface soil moisture (SM) changes in various conditions. However, the calibration of radar models whether empirically or physically-based, is still subject to large uncertainties especially at high-spatial resolution. To help calibrate radar-based retrieval approaches to supervising SM at high resolution, this paper presents an innovative synergistic method combining Sentinel-1 (Si) microwave and Landsat-7/8 (L7/8) thermal data. First, the S1 backscatter coefficient was normalized by its maximum and minimum values obtained during 2015-2016 agriculture season. Second, the normalized S1 backscatter coefficient was calibrated from reference points provided by a thermal-derived SM proxy named soil evaporative efficiency (SEE, defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation). SEE was estimated as the radiometric soil temperature normalized by its minimum and maximum values reached in a water-saturated and dry soil, respectively. We estimated both soil temperature endmembers by using a soil energy balance model forced by available meteorological forcing. The proposed approach was evaluated against in situ SM measurements collected over three bare soil fields in a semi-arid region in Morocco and we compared it against a classical approach based on radar data only. The two polarizations VV (vertical transmit and receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) of the S1 data available over the area are tested to analyse the sensitivity of radar signal to SM at high incidence angles (39 degrees-43 degrees). We found that the VV polarization was better correlated to SM than the VH polarization with a determination coefficient of 0.47 and 0.28, respectively. By combining Si (VV) and L7/8 data, we reduced the root mean square difference between satellite and in situ SM to 0.03 m(3) m(-3) which is far smaller than 0.16 m(3) m(-3) when using SI (VV) only.

AB Unprecedented droughts hit southern Amazonia in 2005 and 2010, causing a sharp increase in tree mortality and carbon loss. To better predict the rainforest's response to future droughts, it is necessary to understand its behavior during past events. Satellite observations provide a practical source of continuous observations of Amazonian forest. Here we used a passive microwave-based vegetation water content record (i.e., vegetation optical depth, VOD), together with multiple hydrometeorological observations as well as conventional satellite vegetation measures, to investigate the rainforest canopy dynamics during the 2005 and 2010 droughts. During the onset of droughts in the wet-to-dry season (May July) of both years, we found large-scale positive anomalies in VOD, leaf area index (LAI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) over the southern Amazonia. These observations are very likely caused by enhanced canopy growth. Concurrent below-average rainfall and above average radiation during the wet-to-dry season can be interpreted as an early arrival of normal dry season conditions, leading to enhanced new leaf development and ecosystem photosynthesis, as supported by field observations. Our results suggest that further rainfall deficit into the subsequent dry season caused water and heat stress during the peak of 2005 and 2010 droughts (August October) that exceeded the tolerance limits of the rainforest, leading to widespread negative VOD anomalies over the southern Amazonia. Significant VOD anomalies were observed mainly over the western part in 2005 and mainly over central and eastern parts in 2010. The total area with significant negative VOD anomalies was comparable between these two drought years, though the average magnitude of significant negative VOD anomalies was greater in 2005. This finding broadly agrees with the field observations indicating that the reduction in biomass carbon uptake was stronger in 2005 than 2010. The enhanced canopy growth preceding drought-induced senescence should be taken into account when interpreting the ecological impacts of Amazonian droughts.

AB The glaciers of the Franz Josef Land (FJL) archipelago in the Russian Arctic are subjected to rapidly-warming temperatures but are small contributors to sea level. We analyze ice surface elevation data derived from satellite stereo imagery (WorldView and SPOT), radar altimetry (CryoSat-2), and a digitized 1953 cartographic map to calculate elevation change rates (dh/dt). Mass loss from FJL doubled between 2011 and 2015 compared to 1953-2011/2015, increasing from a rate of -2.18 +/- 0.72 Gt yr(-1) to -4.43 +/- 0.78 Gt yr(-1). This 2011-2015 rate indicates an acceleration in ice loss from that observed in 2003-2009 by multiple studies using ICESat and GRACE. Glacier thinning rates are spatially highly variable. We observe glacier thinning rates of up to 10 m per year, and in general we see a trend of increased thinning from the NE towards the SW. Glacier retreat is widespread and has led to the creation of at least one new island. Historically, ice wastage from FJL is thought to have been relatively small, but accelerating ice loss may be the new normal for this archipelago in a warming Arctic.

AB Chlorophyll (Chl) is an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity and stress of vegetation. Remote sensing provides fast and nondestructive methods for estimating leaf Chl content based on its optical characteristics in visible and near-infrared spectrum. Multispectral lidar (MSL) systems have been developed to combine spectral and spatial detection abilities. Statistical relationships of plant biochemical constituents can be established through MSL measurements. However, empirical models cannot be readily extended to independent datasets. Simultaneously, the few spectral bands of MSL limit the use of a physical model. Hence, the development of hyperspectral lidar (HSL) systems offers a wider range of spectrum. This study investigated the possibility of adopting an HSL system with 32 channels covering 539-910 nm to estimate foliar Chl through a physical model. This study aimed to (1) Determine whether reflectance at the 32 channels is sufficient to retrieve Chl content through PROSPECT model inversion and (2) Considering the difference between passively and actively measured reflectance, investigate whether HSL measurements can be applied into PROSPECT model inversion for leaf biochemical constituents. Three kinds of datasets were used: a synthetic dataset simulated by running the PROSPECT model in forward mode, a public dataset ANGERS taking the channels of the HSL system, and an experimental dataset of paddy rice measured by the HSL system. Results showed HSL measurements can be directly used to retrieve leaf Chl content through PROSPECT-4 model inversion (R-2 = 0.55). These measurements also exhibit higher accuracy than that of support vector regression (threefold cross validation; 100 repetitions: median R-2 = 0.47). This validation work provides basis in the determination of vegetation physiological status directly from HSL measurements through model inversion with the PROSPECT model.

AB Coastal saltmarshes provide a range of ecosystem services, such as flood protection and carbon sequestration, but face rapid global losses. Managed realignment (MR) is an increasingly popular method to artificially recreate these habitats by reinstating tidal regimes to reclaimed land. However, to improve MR design, better knowledge of the processes that control morphological evolution in natural saltmarshes is needed. In this paper, we develop tools to assist in the monitoring of creek network evolution towards dynamic morphological equilibrium, a state of landform stability under current physical forcings. Using lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) datasets, we combined a semi-automated creek extraction algorithm, based on elevation and slope thresholds, with a novel algorithm for morphometric creek analysis. A comprehensive suite of morphological creek characteristics was extracted for 13 natural British saltmarshes, including: amplitude, length, sinuosity ratio, junction angle, width, depth, cross-sectional area, creek order, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, and drainage efficiency. Results closely matched with field-validated manual digitization results, and were significantly faster and less subjective to produce. Morphological equilibrium relationships from the literature were found to be applicable to the new dataset, despite yielding high prediction errors due to the inherent variety of creek network shapes in salt marshes. New equilibrium relationships were also defined relating the creek network drainage efficiency to the mouth cross-sectional area and the marsh elevation. To improve future scheme designs, these tools will be used in further studies to monitor rates of evolution towards equilibrium in MR sites depending on their initial conditions.

AB Worldwide the coastal land-sea interface is increasingly subject to natural and anthropogenic hazards. Monitoring this crucial interface may be addressed with satellite imagery as a cost-efficient mapping solution. Topography and bathymetry, defining the structural complexity of the coast, are commonly studied separately given specific thematic and methodological contexts, yet many science questions and societal challenges require an integrated approach (e.g., coastal inundation). In such cases, triplet multispectral imagery represents an affordable solution based on a single satellite product. Here we examine how Pleiades-1 triplet imagery may be used to retrieve a seamless and accurate topobathymetry digital surface model (DSM, from -20 to 1207 m) over an entire, socio-ecologically complex island: Moorea, French Polynesia. Creation of the topography DSMs was based on stereo and tri-stereo photogrammetry, and the bathymetry DSMs relied on quasi-nadiral multispectral data subject to light/water interaction modelling. Results were compared with over 3.9 million airborne LiDAR topobathymetry measurements to quantify how the spatio-spectral mode, the third imagery, and the level of radiometric correction act on two-and three-dimensional accuracy. Horizontal accuracy of the tri-stereo panchromatic dataset (E-RMSE = 4.22 and N-RMSE = 7.59 m) was better than the multispectral (E-RMSE = 5.06 and N-RMSE = 7.51 m) dataset. Topography point cloud density increased by a factor of three in the tri-stereo panchromatic (9.11 points/m(2)) or multispectral (0.23 points/m(2)) datasets. Topography vertical accuracy enhanced with tri-stereo + level-1 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.40 m) for panchromatic and with stereo + level-1/-2 radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.77/7.77 m) as well as tri-stereo without radiometric correction (RMSE = 7.85 m) for multispectral datasets. Bathymetry vertical accuracy improved with level-2 (atmospheric) correction (RMSE = 0.83 m). Topobathymetry DSM derived from this optimized method has a wide spectrum of applications along coastal margins.

AB Several thousands of moraine-dammed and supraglacial lakes spread over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, and some have grown rapidly in past decades due to glacier retreat. The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91%. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering similar to 10% of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice. Yet our processing chain is robust and has the potential for being applied on the greater HKH and mountain ranges elsewhere, opening the door for objectively expanding the knowledge base on GLOF activity over the past three decades.

AB Aerosols represent one of the dominant uncertainties in radiative forcing, partly because of their very high spatiotemporal variability, a still insufficient knowledge of their microphysical and optical properties, or of their vertical distribution. A better understanding and forecasting of their impact on climate therefore requires precise observations of dust emission and transport. Observations from space offer a good opportunity to follow, day by day and at high spatial resolution, dust evolution at global scale and over long time series. Infrared observations allow retrieving dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) as well as the mean dust layer altitude, daytime and nighttime, over oceans and over continents, in particular over desert. Moreover, coarse mode particles are preferentially observed in the infrared, when, in the visible, both larger and finer particles are observed making the distinction between the two modes difficult. Therefore, they appear complementary to observations in the visible. In this study, a decade of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) on board European Satellite Metop-A observations, from July 2007 to December 2016, has been processed pixel by pixel, using a "Look-Up-Table"(LUT) physical approach. Important improvements have been brought to our former approach in order to extend it to: 1) daytime retrieval, 2) mid-latitude retrieval, 3) retrieval at the IASI pixel resolution, 4) near real time retrieval (day-1). Moreover, over continents, surface characteristics (pressure, temperature, as well as emissivity spectrum) are now better accounted for. Here, a particular attention is given to the validation of the IASI-retrieved AOD through comparisons with the Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (SDA) 500 nm coarse mode AOD observed at 70 ground-based Aerosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites during the 114 months processed. Even if such a comparison requires converting AOD from infrared to visible, inherently leading to significant uncertainties, the two AOD datasets compare well, with an overall correlation of 0.8. For a large majority of sites, correlation ranges from 0.7 to 0.9. Sites with highest correlation are well distributed within the "dust belt" (Sahara, Arabian Peninsula, Mediterranean basin, India and also the Caribbean). Correlations obtained for East-Asia are in general smaller, which might be due to a more complex dust structure (i.e., impact of pollution) and partly due to an increase of the AERONET coarse-mode AOD uncertainty. More generally, the good overall agreement between our restitutions and AERONET AOD demonstrates the ability of infrared sounders to infer dust properties, which opens interesting perspective for a synergy with visible observations.

AB Remote sensing assessment of crop residue cover (f(R)) and tillage intensity can improve predictions of the environmental impact of agricultural practices and promote sustainable management. Spectral indices for estimating f(R) are sensitive to soil and crop residue water contents, therefore the uncertainty of f(R) estimates increases when moisture conditions vary. Our goals were to evaluate the robustness of spectral residue indices based on the shortwave infrared region (SWIR) for estimating f(R) and to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions on f(R) estimates. Ten fields with center pivot irrigation systems (eight partially irrigated and two uniformly dry fields) were identified in Worldview-3 satellite imagery acquired for a study site in Maryland (USA). The fields were mid-irrigation at the time of imagery acquisition, allowing comparison of residue cover under dry and wet conditions. Fields were subdivided into approximately equal-size wedges within the dry and wet portions of each field, and the SWIR bands were extracted for each pixel. Two crop residue indices (Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI); Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) and a water index (WI) were calculated. Reflectance in each band was moisture-adjusted based on the WI difference between wet and dry wedges, and updated NDTI and SINDRI were calculated. Finally, the probability density distributions of f(R) estimated from the residue indices were calculated for each field. SINDRI was more robust than NDTI for estimating f(R). Moisture corrections of spectral bands reduced the root mean square error of NDTI f(R) estimates from 22.7% to 4.7%, and SINDRI f(R) estimates from 6.0% to 2.2%. The mean and variance of the probability density distribution of f(R) estimated from residue indices, before and after moisture correction, were greatly reduced in the partially irrigated fields, but only slightly in fields with uniform water distribution. The estimation of f(R) should be based on SINDRI if appropriate bands are available, but f(R) can be reliably estimated by combining NDTI with a water content index to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions.

AB Understanding the role that the vast north Australian savannas play in the continental carbon cycle requires reliable quantification of their carbon stock at landscape and regional scales. LiDAR remote sensing has proven efficient and accurate for the fine-scale estimation of above-ground tree biomass (AGB) and carbon stocks in many ecosystems, but tropical savanna remain under studied. We utilized a two-phase LiDAR analysis procedure which integrates both individual tree detection (ITC) and area-based approaches (ABA) to better understand how the uncertainty of biomass estimation varies with scale. We used estimations from individual tree LiDAR measurements as training/reference data, and then applied these data to develop allometric equations related to LIDAR metrics. We found that LiDAR individual tree heights were strongly correlated with field-estimated AGB (R-2 = 0.754, RMSE = 90 kg), and that 63% of individual trees crowns (ITC) could be accurately delineated with a canopy maxima approach. Area-based biomass estimation (ABA), which incorporated errors from the ITC steps, identified the quadratic mean of canopy height (QMCH) as the best single independent variable for different plot sample sizes (e.g. for 4 ha plots: R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.4 Mg ha(-1); and 1 ha plots: R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.0 Mg ha(-1)). Our results show how ITC and ABA approached can be integrated to understand how biomass uncertainty varies with scale across broad landscapes. Understanding these scaling relationships is critical for operationalizing regional savanna inventories, monitoring and mapping.

AB Over the past few decades, wide encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) into the prairies of the U.S. Great Plains has affected wildlife habitats, forage and livestock production, and biogeochemical cycles. This study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of juniper forest encroachment into tallgrass prairies by generating juniper forest encroachment maps from 1984 to 2010 at 30 m spatial resolution. A pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm was used to produce the time series maps of juniper forest encroachment using a combination of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic data from 2010 and Landsat 5 and 7 data (10,871 images from 1984 to 2010). We analyzed the resultant maps to understand the dynamics of juniper forest encroachment at state and county spatial scales and examined juniper occurrence by geographic region and soil type. The juniper forest maps were generated over five multi-year periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010). We also produced a map of time since stand detection of juniper forests in 2010. Our major findings include: (1) juniper forests have expanded linearly in time at an annual rate of similar to 40 km(2)/year since 1984; (2) juniper forests had notable spatial clusters in its expansion process; (3) similar to 65% of juniper forests in 2010 were < 15 years after stands have been detected; and (4) juniper forests in 2010 were mainly distributed in sandy and loamy soils with relatively low available water storage in the top soils. This study demonstrates the potential of combining a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), time series optical images (Landsat), and microwave images to document the spatial-temporal dynamics of juniper forest encroachment into prairies since the 1980s at the regional scale. The results can be used to study the causes, consequences, and potential future distribution of juniper encroachment, which are relevant to the sustainable management of prairie ecosystems.

AB In this paper, the discrete electromagnetic model developed at the Tor Vergata University of Rome (hereafter, TV-DEM) is used to simulate both active and passive L-band signals using a single set of input parameters. The simulations are compared to Aquarius observations collected from a view angle of 28.7 degrees over the Maqu study area located near the north-eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The TV-DEM parameters litter biomass, litter moisture factor, plant moisture and standard deviation of height variations are calibrated for Aquarius observations collected during the 2012 and 2013 warm seasons. The calibrated parameters are used to reproduce the brightness temperature (T-b) and backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees) for the 2014 and 2015 warm season as an independent assessment.
   The results show that the calibrated TV-DEM simulations capture Aquarius observations reasonably well with coefficients of determination (R-2's) varying from 0.75 to 0.86 for the T-b's and from 0.36 to 0.68 (-) for the sigma degrees's depending on the polarization and adopted matchup set (e.g. calibration or validation). The simulations, however, systematically overestimate the H polarized Aquarius observation and underestimate the V polarized observations. The calibrated TV-DEM is also utilized for soil moisture retrieval from three combinations of Aquarius data, including a set of both active and passive microwave observations. The obtained error metrics indicate that the soil moisture estimates from the active/passive data have the smallest bias (-0.008 m(3) m(-3)) and the lowest unbiased root mean squared difference (0.021 m(3) m(-3)), while soil moisture retrieved using a calibrated tau (optical depth)-omega (single scattering albedo) model based algorithm provided the best R-2. These results warrant further investigation of the synergistic use of active/passive data for soil moisture retrieval as well as the use of complex physically radiative transfer model as part of well-established algorithms.

AB The impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has led to significant inundation shrinkage and water level decrease in China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake. However, little is known about the influence on the lake's wetland landscapes. Here, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and a phenology-based decision tree approach, we present the spatial and temporal changes of the major wetland cover types from 2000 to 2014. Over the 15-year period, both total coverage of vegetation (Carex spp., Triarrhena lutarioriparia L. - Phragmites, sparse grass, and Zizania latifolia communities) and the area of each community (excluding floating aquatic macrophytes community or FAM) showed significantly increasing trends, with vegetation expanded towards the lake center. In contrast, the areas of water and mudflat have decreased significantly since the TGD impoundment, and they were mainly replaced by prominently expanded vegetated areas. The transition maps during 2000-2014 show that the vegetation community transitions occurred mainly from hydrophilic cover types to those adapted to dryer conditions. Despite the significant changes in wetland cover types, the most preferable water depth for each cover type remained stable before and after the TGD. In conclusion, the vegetation compositions are primarily controlled by water depth, indicating that the recent wetland changes can be directly linked to the TGD-induced hydrological regime-shift. These results provide a critical reference for local authorities to assess the potential influence of the newly proposed dam in this lake and to optimize its. future operations with respect to modulating water levels.

AB The classical multi-spectral Atmospheric Correction (AC) algorithm is inadequate for the new generation of spaceborne hyperspectral sensors such as NASA's first hyperspectral Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) onboard the anticipated Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission. The AC process must estimate and remove the atmospheric path radiance contribution due to the Rayleigh scattering by air molecules and scattering by aerosols from the measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance, compensate for the absorption by atmospheric gases, and correct for reflection and refraction of the air-sea interface. In this work, we present and evaluate an improved AC for hyperspectral sensors developed within NASA's SeaWiFS Data Analysis System software package (SeaDAS). The improvement is based on combining the classical AC approach of multi-spectral capabilities to correct for the atmospheric path radiance, extended to hyperspectral, with a gas correction algorithm to compensate for absorbing gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor. The SeaDAS-hyperspectral version is capable of operationally processing the AC of any hyperspectral airborne or spaceborne sensor. The new algorithm development was evaluated and assessed using the Hyperspectral Imager for Coastal Ocean (HICO) scenes collected at the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY) site, and other SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) and AERosol Robotic NETwork-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) coastal sites. A hyperspectral vicarious calibration was applied to HICO, showing the validity and consistency of HICO's ocean color products. The hyperspectral AC capability is currently available in SeaDAS to the scientific community at hreps://oceancolongsfc.nasa.govi.

AB In this study, three previously proposed echo waveform retracking techniques are assessed for their performances in measuring lead and sea ice elevations from Cryosat-2 (CS-2) SAR L1b data. These derived CS-2 sea ice elevations and freeboards are compared with those from seven Operation IceBridge (OIB) flights, dedicated as the CS-2 underflights during the late winter/early spring of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Results show that sea ice elevation measured by CS-2 is mostly ranged between similar to similar to 1-0 m, after the mean sea surface (MSS) is subtracted. The mean absolute biases between the CS-2 and ATM elevations in different underflights are mostly ranged between similar to 0.02-0.71 m. For multi-year ice, empirical lead and threshold floe retracker (ELTF) is the best choice for ice elevation measurement and the waveform fitting retracker (WfF) is the best choice for ice freeboard retrieval. For first year ice, the WfF is the best choice for ice elevation measurement and the threshold first maximum retracker (TFMRA) is the best choice for ice freeboard retrieval. This study also suggests, when the TFMRA retracker is used to retrieve lead elevation, a 70% threshold of the first local maxima power is better than the 50% threshold previously used.

AB Ocean-colour radiometry is recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) according to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), because of its capability to observe significant properties of the marine ecosystem at synoptic to global scales. Yet the value of ocean colour for climate-change studies depends to a large extent not only on the decidedly important quality of the data per se, but. also on the qualities of the algorithms used to convert the multi-spectral radiance values detected by the ocean-colour satellite into relevant ecological, bio-optical and biogeochemical variables or properties of the ocean. The algorithms selected from the pool of available algorithms have to be fit for purpose: detection of marine ecosystem responses to climate change. Marine ecosystems might respond in a variety of ways to changing climate, including perturbations to regional distributions in the quantity and in the type of phytoplankton present, their locations and in their seasonal dynamics. The ideal algorithms would be capable of distinguishing between abundance and type, and would not mistake one for the other. They would be robust to changes in climate, and would not rely on assumptions that might be valid only under current climatic conditions. Based on such considerations, we identify a series of ideal qualitative traits that algorithms for climate-change studies would possess. Necessarily, such traits would have to complement the quantitative requirements for precision, accuracy and stability in the data over long time scales. We examine the extent to which available algorithms meet the criteria, according to the work carried out in the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative, and where improvements are still needed.

TI Landsat-based classification in the cloud: An opportunity for a paradigm

AB Satellite-derived land cover maps play an important role in many applications, including monitoring of smallholder-dominated agricultural landscapes. New cloud-based computing platforms and satellite sensors offer opportunities for generating land cover maps designed to meet the spatial and temporal requirements of specific applications. Such maps can be a significant improvement compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser than 300 m, are often not representative of areas with fast-paced land use change, and have a fixed set of cover classes. Here, we present two approaches for land cover classification using the Landsat archive within Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification was performed with (1) season-based composites, where median values of individual bands and vegetation indices were generated from four years for each of four seasons, and (2) metric-based composites, where different quantiles were computed for the entire four-year period. These approaches were tested for six land cover types spanning over 18,000 locations in Zambia, with ground "truth" determined by visual inspection of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. The methods were trained on 30% of these points and tested on the remaining 70%, and results were also compared with existing land cover products. Overall accuracies of about 89% were achieved for the season- and metric-based approaches for individual classes, with 93% and 94% accuracy for distinguishing.cropland from non-cropland. For the latter task, the existing Globeland30 dataset based on Landsat had much lower accuracies (around 77% on average), as did existing cover maps at coarser resolutions. Overall, the results support the use of either season or metric-based classification approaches. Both produce better results than those obtained from previous classifiers, which supports a general paradigm shift away from dependence on standard static products and towards custom generation of on-demand cover maps designed to fulfill the needs of each specific application.

TI Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES): A framework for monitoring

ID GLOBAL CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; SCIENCE; VISION; ISSUES
AB Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best.
   With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale.
   This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (10) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.

AB The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).
   A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.

AB Sea surface salinity (SSS) is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes, yet its remote estimation in coastal waters has been difficult because satellite sensors designed to "measure" SSS lack sufficient resolution and coverage, and higher-resolution ocean color measurements suffer from optical and biogeochemical complexity when used to estimate SSS. In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through modeling, validation, and extensive tests in contrasting environments. Specifically, using extensive SSS datasets collected by many groups spanning > 10 years and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) estimated remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 412, 443, 488 (490), 555, and 667 (670) nm and sea surface temperature (SST), a multilayer perceptron neural network-based (MPNN) SSS model has been developed and validated with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The MPNN was selected over many other empirical approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), decision tree, random forest, and supporting vector machines (SVMs) after extensive evaluations. The MPNN was trained by a back-propagation learning technique with LevenbergMarquardt optimization and Bayesian regularization. The model showed an overall performance of root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.2, with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.86, mean bias (MB) = 0.0, and mean ratio (MR) = 1.0 for SSS ranging between 1 and 37 (N = 3640). Validation using an independent dataset showed a RMSE of 1.1, MB of 0.0, and MR of 1.0 for SSS ranging between 27 and 37 (N = 412). The model with its original parameterization has been tested in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya coastal region, Florida's Big Bend region, and in the offshore Mississippi River plume, with satisfactory performance obtained in each case. Comparison with concurrent Aquarius-derived SSS maps (110-km resolution) showed similar agreement in offshore waters as indicated above, but the new 1-km resolution SSS maps revealed more finer-scale features as well as salinity gradients in coastal waters. The sensitivity of the model to realistic model input errors in satellite derived SST and Rrs was also thoroughly examined, with uncertainties in the model-derived SSS being always < 1 for SSS > 30. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity test all indicated the robustness of the MPNN model in estimating SSS in most, if not all, coastal waters and offshore plumes in the northern GOM. Thus, the model provided a basis for generating near real-time 1-km resolution SSS maps from satellite measurements. However, the model showed limitations when applied to regions with known algal blooms or up welling as they both led to low Rrs in the blue bands that may be falsely recognized as caused by low SSS.

AB Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters, Albedo quantities, and Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VITAS), on the Suomi-NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite are evaluated with spatially representative in situ tower albedometer measurements and through comparison with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long term record. White Sky Albedo (WSA), Black Sky Albedo (BSA), NBAR, and Quality Assurance (QA) results show that the VIIRS algorithm is performing well at the global scale and is able to provide global data products comparable with the heritage MODIS (with an absolute bias of 0.0069 for short-wave broadband WSA) despite the spectral, angular, and effective spatial resolution differences between the two sensors. Both VIIRS and MODIS albedo are shown to agree well with in situ albedo measurements at a number of spatially representative sites. This evaluation provides confidence that the high quality, daily VIIRS BRDF model parameters, Albedo, and NBAR products will be able to provide the long term continuity required by the modeling and monitoring communities.

AB Space-borne LiDAR systems can potentially assist large-area assessments of forest resources, in particular when a subset of the acquired LiDAR footprints is combined with field surveys of forest stand characteristics at footprint location. When combined, space-borne LiDAR geolocation error and the footprint size may however have considerable effects on the estimation accuracy of forest stand variables, such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this study was to draw recommendations for future space-borne LiDAR systems, which should deliver data for unbiased AGB assessments. The recommendations were drawn from AGB estimations based on space borne LiDAR waveforms simulated over a 1300 ha large study site in southern Sweden. Large-footprint, nadir looking satellite waveforms were simulated by stacking individual small-footprint, airborne LiDAR waveforms observed near a predefined sampling pattern. The stacked waveforms, represented by their metrics, were used as input for a two-phase systematic sampling in combination with model-assisted estimation or hybrid inference for estimating AGB and its variance. The second-phase sample included 264 inventory plots, whereas the first-phase sample included 1010 sample locations, where satellite waveforms were simulated. After simulating satellite waveforms with different footprint sizes and analyzing the AGB variance, the recommendation is to have a footprint size that is similar to the size of the field plots used for collecting reference data, i.e. 20 m diameter in our case. For the optimal footprint size, AGB was estimated with a precision of 2.9 Mg per hectare (2.9% of the average). The results also showed that variance estimates increased constantly with increasing geolocation error. For a geolocation error of 14 m, variance estimates increased by 17%, which justifies investing additional efforts in minimizing it.

AB TerraSAR-X/FanDEM-X form the first space-borne interferometer providing full-PoIInSAR acquisitions with a near-zero temporal gap. This paper explores the potential of X-band SAR data for forest height estimation over tropical Indian forests. Unique TanDEM-X data sets with varied spatial baselines are acquired over a tropical, deciduous Indian forest Multiple dual polarimetric and fully polarimetric acquisitions are analysed and the best performance is achieved using fully polarimetric data acquired over both high- and low-biomass forests (r(2) =0.86 and r(2)=0.80 respectively). It is shown for the first time that, for deciduous Indian tropical forests, seasonal changes such as leaf-fall affect the PoIInSAR based height inversion performance. For species exhibiting leaf-fall, acquisition during leaf-on season provides better height inversion accuracy (r(2)=0.75) than for leaf-fall season (r(2)=0.65). Results show consistent PoIInSAR height inversion performance for both high- and low-biomass forests in both natural and managed forest tracts. Spatial baseline is a critical factor for selection of suitable acquisitions for PoIInSAR based height estimation. The effect of spatial baseline on height inversion performance is also discussed.

AB Understanding past and current patterns of species richness is essential for predicting how these patterns may be affected by future global change. The species energy hypothesis predicts that higher abundance and richness of animal species occur where available energy is higher and more consistently available. There is a wide range of remote sensing proxies for available energy, such as vegetation productivity, but it is not clear which best predict species richness. Our goal here was to evaluate different proxies for annual plant productivity from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and to determine how well they predict the richness of breeding bird species in six functional guilds across the conterminous United States. The DHIs are measures of vegetation productivity over the course of a year and consist of three components: (1) cumulative productivity (DHI Cum), (2) minimum productivity (DHI Min), and (3) intra-annual variation of productivity (DHI Var). We hypothesized that increases in cumulative and minimum productivity and reductions in intra-annual variation will be associated with higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs from a range of MODIS 1000-m vegetation productivity data sets for 20032014, i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We summarized bird species richness of different guilds within ecoregions (n = 85) based on abundance maps derived from the >3000 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey for 2006 to 2012. Generally, we found all the DHI5 had high explanatory power for predicting breeding bird species richness. However, the strength of the associations between the DHI5 and bird species richness depended on habitat, nest placement, and migratory behavior. We found highest correlations for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland breeding species (R-adj(2) 0.66-0.73 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2) 0.41-0.61 for minimum DHI) and woodland breeding species (R-adj(2), 0.34-0.60 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2), 0.26-0.51 for cumulative DHI). The strong relationship between the DHI5 and bird species richness reinforces the importance of vegetation productivity as a determinant of species diversity patterns, and the usefulness of satellite data for applying the species energy hypothesis to predictions in service to conservation.

AB Phenology is a key indicator of vegetation response to global change. Satellite observations from coarse resolution sensors (i.e., MODIS and AVHRR) have been widely used to study impacts of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology. The advantage of coarse resolution sensors are daily observations across the entire globe, but the coarse spatial resolution, as well as the relatively short time span covered by MODIS, are significant drawbacks in analyzing landscape-scale trends in phenology. Time series data from the medium resolution sensor Landsat may overcome these issues. However, because of Landsat's lower observation frequency, phenological methods developed with coarse resolution data are not directly transferable. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating inter-annual variation in vegetation phonology from Landsat time series while controlling for spatial variation. The method pools all available observations to estimate the spatial variation in phonological parameters, while specifically modeling inter-annual variation as random effect terms. The advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from other phenology and climate observations to reduce variability in the estimates, as well as a more robust estimation of uncertainty. We demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework with a case study of changing spring phenology in broad-leaved trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southern Germany. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation in phonological parameters precisely. Temporal variation in start of season showed overall strong agreement with ground-based measures of bud-break variability (r = 0.82 [0.80-0.841). Our proposed modeling framework will help to better monitor and understand changes in vegetation phonology at scales yet unexplored by the phonological community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a process for predicting spatially the land cover classes within mixed pixels. In existing SPM methods, the effect of point spread function (PSF) has seldom been considered. In this paper, a generic SPM method is developed to consider the PSF effect in SPM and, thereby, to increase prediction accuracy. We first demonstrate that the spectral unmixing predictions (i.e., coarse land cover proportions used as input for SPM) are a convolution of not only sub-pixels within the coarse pixel, but also sub-pixels from neighboring coarse pixels. Based on this finding, a new SPM method based on optimization is developed which recognizes the optimal solution as the one that when convolved with the PSF, is the same as the input coarse land cover proportion. Experimental results on three separate datasets show that the SPM accuracy can be increased by considering the PSF effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Image segmentation is the decisive process in object-based image analysis, but segmenting a landscape scene into meaningful geo-objects remains a challenge. In recent years, there has been growing interest in hybrid methods that combine initial segmentation with subsequent region merging, because they exploit spectral signals across an entire geo-object, including both the boundary signals used to delineate the initial segments, and the interior signals used to merge similar segments. However, existing algorithms commonly use a single, global parameter to control the process of region merging, thereby limiting the goodness-of-fit between segments and geo-objects, since homogeneous and heterogeneous segments are treated equally. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new hybrid segmentation method that employs local spectral angle (SA) thresholds for region merging. We implemented our local SA method in three very different landscapes, then compared our region merging method to the global SA method, as well as the global elevation method used in System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA). In all three landscapes, the results revealed that the local SA segmentation provides a better fit to reference polygons than the two global threshold methods, as measured using a modified discrepancy measure for the purpose of geo-object recognition (QR(M)). We also found that the local SA method produced segments with a greater variation in size, indicating the method is effective for achieving multi-scale segmentation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB A variety of approaches are available to fill the gaps in the time series of vegetation parameters estimated from satellite observations. In this paper, a scheme considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability was proposed to evaluate the gap-filling approaches. Six approaches for gap filling were globally evaluated pixel-by-pixel based on a reference NDVI generated from MODIS observations during the past 15 years. The evaluated approaches include the Fourier-based approach (Fourier), the double logistic model (DL), the iterative interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR), the Whittaker smoother (Whit), the Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) andthe locally adjusted cubic spline capping approach (LACC). Considering the five aspects, the ranks of the overall performance are LACC > Fourier > IDR > DL > SG > Whit. The six approaches are similar in filling the gaps and remaining the curve stability but there are large difference in protection of key points and noise resistance. The SG is sensitive to noises and the Whit is poor in protection of key points. In the monsoon regions of India, all evaluated approaches don't work well. This paper provides some new views for evaluating the gap filling approaches that will be helpful in selecting the optimal approach to reconstruct the time series of parameters for data applications.

AB This paper evaluates a methodology to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from SMOS and AMSR-E into a single, consistent dataset retrieved by the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). In a first step, the SMOS LPRM soil moisture retrievals were used as the baseline for optimizing the internal parameterization (i.e. surface roughness and single scattering albedo) of the AMSR-E LPRM retrievals. Secondly, to overcome the uniqueness of these datasets a linear scaling approach was applied resulting in a consistent soil moisture dataset. The new parameter set from the first step is similar for the two (low) frequencies of AMSR-E (i.e. C-and X-band) further improving their inter-comparability for both soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. Soil moisture retrievals from these AMSR-E frequencies were globally merged based on the availability of brightness temperatures that are free from RFI contamination (resulting in AMSR-E LPRMN). This new product was evaluated against both the SMOS LPRM product in the overlapping period (July2010 to October 2011), as well as the standard, publicly available AMSR-E LPRM dataset (AMSR-E LPRMv3) for an almost 9 year period (January 2003 to October 2011). For the overlapping period, the AMSR-E and SMOS LPRM products show high temporal correlation coefficients (0.60 < R< 0.90) and low root mean square errors (rmse < 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) for NDVI values up to 0.60. Their agreement tends to drop over the well-known challenging areas such as the arctic region and tropical rainforest. A detailed evaluation over in situ sites from 5 in situ networks worldwide showed that AMSR-E LPRMN often outperforms SMOS LPRM in sparsely vegetated areas, with generally higher correlation coefficients in areas with NDVI <03, and in general a lower unbiased rmse (ubrmse). In line with theoretical expectations, SMOS LPRM outperforms the AMSR-E LPRM product over the more densely vegetated areas. The newly developed AMSR-E LPRMN product was also compared against AMSR-E LPRMv3, revealing a significant increase (from 0.48 to 0.55) in temporal correlation coefficient over 16 in situ networks. This finding was confirmed through a large scale (50 degrees N -50 degrees S) precipitation based verification technique, the so-called R-value, which shows a superior performance of the newly developed AMSR-E LPRMN product. Additionally, the linear scaling of AMSR-E LPRMN to the SMOS LPRM leads to further reducing the ubrmse from 0.09 to 0.06 m(3) m(-3) and the average bias from 0.14 to 0.00 m(3) m(-3) over these stations. The AMSR-E LPRMN was furthermore compared against the top layer of two re-analysis models (i.e. from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications-Land and ERA-Interim/Land models) generally demonstrating increased correlation coefficients and reduced ubrmse with the exception of the challenging areas. As a result, this study shows the significant potential of SMOS LPRM to be a successful integrator to build a long term soil moisture record based on multiple passive microwave sensors.

AB The Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors provide multi-spectral image data with similar spectral and spatial characteristics that together provide improved temporal coverage globally. Both systems are designed to register Level 1 products to a reference image framework, however, the Landsat-8 framework, based upon the Global Land Survey images, contains residual geolocation errors leading to an expected sensor-to-sensor misregistration of 38 m (24 These misalignments vary geographically but should be stable for a given area. The Landsat framework will be readjusted for consistency with the Sentinel-2 Global Reference Image, with completion expected in 2018. In the interim, users can measure Landsat-to-Sentinel tie points to quantify the misalignment in their area of interest and if appropriate to reproject the data to better alignment.

AB Remotely sensed data have been widely used in recent years for mapping and estimating biomass. However, the characterization of the uncertainty of mapped or estimated biomass in previous studies was either based on ad-hoc approaches (e.g., using model fitting statistics such root mean square errors derived from purposive samples) or mostly limited to the analysis of mean biomass for the whole study area. This study proposed a novel uncertainty analysis method that can characterize biomass uncertainty across multiple spatial scales and multiple spatial resolutions. The uncertainty analysis method built on model-based inference and can propagate errors from trees to field plots, individual pixels, and small areas or large regions that consist of multiple pixels (up to all pixels within a study area). We developed and tested this method over northern Minnesota forest areas of approximately 69,508 km(2) via a unique combination of several datasets for biomass mapping and estimation: wall-to-wall airborne lidar data, national forest inventory (NFI) plots, and destructive measurements of tree aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that the pixel-level AGB prediction error is dominated by lidar-based AGB model residual errors when the spatial resolution is near 380 m or finer and by model parameter estimate errors when the spatial resolution is coarser. We also found that the relative error of AGB predicted from lidar can be reduced to approximately 11% (or mean 5.1 Mg/ha; max 43.6 Mg/ha) at one-hectare scale (or at 100 m spatial resolution) over our study area. Because our uncertainty analysis method uses model-based inference and does not require probability samples of field plots, our methodology has potential applications worldwide, especially over tropics and developing countries where NFI systems are not well-established.

AB The Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) global forest-cover and -change dataset is a multi-temporal depiction of long-term (multi-decadal), global forest dynamics at high (30-m) resolution. Based on per-pixel estimates of percentage tree cover and their associated uncertainty, the dataset currently represents binary forest cover in nominal 1990, 2000, and 2005 epochs, as well as gains and losses over time. A comprehensive accuracy assessment of the GLCF dataset was performed using a global, design-based sample of 27,988 independent, visually interpreted reference points collected through a two-stage, stratified sampling design wherein experts visually identified forest cover and change in each of the 3 epochs based on Landsat and high-resolution satellite images, vegetation index profiles, and field photos. Consistent across epochs, the overall accuracy of the static forest-cover layers was 91%, and the overall accuracy of forest-cover change was >88% among the highest accuracies reported for recent global forest- and land-cover data products. Both commission error (CE) and omission error (OE) were low for static forest cover in each epoch and for the stable classes between epochs (CE < 3%, OE < 22%), but errors were larger for forest loss (45% <= CE < 62%, 47% < OE < 55%) and gain (66% <= CE < 85%, 61% < OE < 84%). Accuracy was lower in sparse forests and savannahs, i.e., where tree cover was at or near the 30% threshold used to discriminate forest from non-forest cover. Discrimination of forest had a low rate of commission error and slight negative bias, especially in areas with low tree cover. After adjusting global area estimates to reference data, 39.28 +/- 1.34 million km(2) and 38.81 +/- 1.34 million km(2) of forest were respectively identified in 2000 and 2005 globally, and 33.16 +/- 1.36 million km(2) of forest were estimated in the available coverage of Landsat data circa-1990. Forest loss and gain were estimated to have been 0.73 +/- 0.38 and 0.28 +/- 0.26 million km(2) between 2000 and 2005, and 1.08 +/- 0.53 and 0.53 +/- 0.47 million km(2) between 1990 and 2000. These estimates of accuracy are required for rigorous use of the data in the Earth sciences (e.g., ecology, economics, hydrology, climatology) as well as for fusion with other records of global change.

AB Accurate information on land cover changes is critical for global change studies, land cover mapping and ecosystem management Although there are numerous change detection methods, pseudo changes can occur if data are acquired from different seasons, which presents a significant challenge for land cover change detection. In this study, land cover change detection by integrating object-based data blending model of Landsat and MODIS is proposed to solve this issue. The Estimation of Scale Parameter (ESP) tool under Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) restriction is employed to identify the optimal scale for Landsat image segmentation. The Object Based Spatial and Temporal Vegetation Index Unmixing Model (OB-STVIUM) disaggregates MODIS NDVIs to Landsat objects using the spatial analysis and the linear mixing theory. Then, the change detection method of NDVI Gradient Difference (NDVI-GD) is developed to detect change and no-change objects considering the NDVI shape and value differences simultaneously. The results of the study indicate that the approach proposed in this study can effectively detect change areas when Landsat images are acquired from different seasons. OB-STVIUM is more suitable for change detection application compared with the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and NDVI Linear Mixing Growth Model (NDVI-LMGM), because it is less sensitive to the number and acquisition time of Landsat images.

AB The accurate detection and mapping of plant invasions is important for an effective weed management strategy in forest plantations. In this study, the utility of WorldView-2 was investigated to automatically map the occurrence of Solanum mauritianum (bugweed) found as an anomaly in forest margins, open areas and riparian zones. The unsupervised methodology developed, proved to be an effective and an accurate framework in detecting and mapping the invasive alien plant (IAP). Using the random forest (RF) proximity matrix, similarity measures between pixels were successfully transformed into scores (Eigen weights) for each pixel using eigenvector analysis. Neighbourhood windows with minimum variance revealed the most important information from localized surrounding pixels to detect potential anomalous pixels. Bugweed occurrence in forest margins, open areas and riparian zones were successfully mapped at accuracies of 91.33%, 85.08%, and 67.90%, respectively. This research has demonstrated the unique capability of using an automated unsupervised RF approach for mapping IAPs using new generation multispectral remotely sensed data.

AB Soil moisture is one of the essential climate variables for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) that has been prioritized by the ESA's Climate Change Initiative to construct its homogeneous long-term climate record. This requires a consistent characterization of the error structures in the individual data sets, which vary due to changes in instrument configuration and calibration, and retrieval algorithm design. In this paper, the random error and systematic differences in nine passive and active microwave satellite soil moisture products over Australia (time coverage: 1978-present) are estimated in a same manner for SM components at subseasonal and seasonal-to-interannual timescales separately. The multi-scale error structures are found to be non-trivial and vary between the products, giving cause for conducting multi-scale merging with awareness of these differences. Noticeable similarities between the error structures of the satellite products derived from same retrieval algorithm and same measuring frequency however suggest transferability of error parameters between them. Using partial rank correlation analysis, the error maps are linked to statistics on vegetation index, digital elevation, soil moisture and soil temperature, and land cover fractions and mixing in order to explain the observed variability and the similarities between the products.

AB Brightness temperature (BT), which is remotely sensed by the space-borne microwave radiometer, is widely used in snow cover monitoring for its long time series imaging capabilities in all-weather conditions. Traditional linear fitting and stand-alone methods are usually uncertain with respect to the spatial distribution and temporal variation of derived snow cover, as they rarely consider local conditions and scene characteristics but fit the model with static empirical coefficients. In this paper, a novel method utilizing daily ground in situ observations is proposed and evaluated, with the purpose for accurate estimation of long-term daily snow cover. To solve the challenge that ground snow-free records are insufficient, a one-class classifier, namely the Presence and Background Learning (PBL) algorithm, is employed to identify daily global snow cover. Benefiting from daily ground in situ observations on a global scale, the proposed method is temporally and spatially dynamic such that estimation errors are globally independent during the entire study period. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of global daily snow cover from 1987 to 2010; the results are validated by ground in situ observations and compared with available optical-based and microwave-based snow cover products. Promising accuracy and model stability are achieved in daily, monthly and yearly validations as compared against ground observations (global omission error <0.13, overall accuracy >0.82 in China region, and keep stable in monthly and yearly averages). The comparison against the MODIS daily snow cover product (MOD10C1) shows good agreement under cloud-free conditions (Cohen's kappa = 0.715). The comparison against the NOAA daily Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) dataset suggests promising agreement in the Northern Hemisphere. Another comparison against the AMSR-E daily SWE dataset (AE_DySno) demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method regarding to the overestimation problem in thin snow cover region.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is the first satellite dedicated to providing global surface soil moisture products. SMOS operates at L-band (1.4 GHz) and, at this frequency, the signal not only depends on soil moisture and vegetation optical depth but is also significantly affected by surface effects and, in particular, by the soil roughness. However, when dense vegetation is present, the L-band signal is poorly sensitive to the surface effects. First, by using multiple regressions between soil moisture (SM) and brightness temperature (TB) at different incidence angles and polarizations, the SMOS sensitivity to the surface effects was evaluated. A global-scale map of SMOS sensitivity to the surface effects was computed and showed that, for 87% of the land surface, the SMOS observations were sensitive to these effects, while very low sensitivity to the surface effects was estimated over 13% of the land surfaces. For instance, over broadleaf evergreen forest (mainly the Amazon and Congo forests), SMOS was sensitive to the surface effects over only half of the pixels considered. In a second step, in L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere), the forward emission model of the SMOS algorithm, the vegetation and roughness effects were combined in a single parameter, referred to as TR in this study. By inverting L-MEB, SM and TR were retrieved at global scale from the SMOS Level 3 (13) TB observations during 2011. Assuming a linear relationship between TR and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) obtained from MODIS data, the effects of roughness (H-r) and vegetation were decoupled and a global map of soil roughness effects was estimated. It was found that the spatial pattern of the H-r values could be related to the main vegetation types. Higher values of roughness (H-r = 0.32-0.39) were obtained for forests (broadleaf evergreen, deciduous and mixed coniferous) while lower values (H-r = 0.14-0.16) were obtained for deserts, shrubs and bare soils. Intermediate values (H-r = 0.20-0.23) were obtained over grasslands, tundra and cultivated land. Over vegetation biomes composed of forests and wooded grasslands, the H-r values were mainly correlated to the vegetation density (r similar to 0.55). For deserts, shrubs and bare soils, the H-r values were mainly correlated to the topography slopes (r similar to 0.53). The global maps presented in this study could lead to improved retrievals of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth for present and future microwave remote sensing missions such as SMOS and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP).

AB The influence of wind speed (WS) on sea surface emission at L-band is revisited using the updated version v6.2 of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperatures (TB) and an incoherent two-layer foam emissivity model. The influence of the roughness effect due to surface waves is consistent with the one found with an older version of SMOS TB. The two-layer incoherent model of foam emissivity accounts for weak volume scatterings and multiple reflections within a medium with an exponential vertical permittivity profile. The foam emissivity simulated using this model at L band varies from 0.35 to close to 1 with thickness varying from 0.01 cm to 2 cm. The wind induced brightness temperature components deduced from the multi-angular SMOS TB is used to optimize the foam void fraction (defined as the fraction of a unit volume of seawater that is occupied by air) at the air-sea interface, an effective thickness of foam layer and the dependency of foam coverage with wind speed. A new set of parameters for the foam emissivity model and the foam coverage model that can be used for WS up to 22 m s(-1) for the SMOS sea surface salinity retrieval is proposed. Our foam coverage model derived from SMOS data is now in much better agreement with other estimates derived from other sensors, although it predicts slightly lower coverage at all winds speeds, likely due to the longer wavelength of SMOS measurements.

AB Continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics is of crucial importance to the understanding of relative contributions of various potential driving factors behind the long-term coastline change. While a large number of efforts have been made to extract coastline and detect coastline change with remotely sensed data, the temporal frequency and spatial resolution of coastline datasets obtained are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed process of coastline retreat and/or advance, particularly in coastlines with subtle variability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method to continuously monitor the dynamics of a muddy coastline with subtle variability in western Florida at annual and subpixel scales using time-series Landsat data (1984-2013). First, robust indicators were used to indicate the annual "average" location of the dynamic coastline. Due to the complexity of muddy-coast morphology, the annual average location is represented not by the coast "line", but by the fractional inundated "area" of coastline pixels (pixels where the coastline is located), namely annually inundated area. Second, the annually inundated area of coastline pixels was estimated with a model proposed in this study, and the uncertainty was estimated with the Monte Carlo method. The retrievals were validated at 10 sites with aerial imagery, and the overall RMSE (root mean square error) is 11.48%. Third, the long-term trend for the time series of annually inundated area was derived with a statistical model. The results indicate that the muddy coast in western Florida continues to shrink with an average rate of 0.42 +/- 0.05 km(2)/year during the three decades. This study demonstrates the feasibility of time-series Landsat data in continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the temporal patterns of leaf traits is critical in determining the seasonality and magnitude of terrestrial carbon, water, and energy fluxes. However, we lack robust and efficient ways to monitor the temporal dynamics of leaf traits. Here we assessed the potential of leaf spectroscopy to predict and monitor leaf traits across their entire life cycle at different forest sites and light environments (sunlit vs. shaded) using a weekly sampled dataset across the entire growing season at two temperate deciduous forests. The dataset includes field measured leaf-level directional-hemispherical reflectance/transmittance together with seven important leaf traits [total chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and b), carotenoids, mass-based nitrogen concentration (N-mass), mass-based carbon mass, concentration (C-mass), and leaf mass per area (LMA)]. All leaf traits varied significantly throughout the growing season, and displayed trait-specific temporal patterns. We used a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) modeling approach to estimate leaf traits from spectra, and found that PLSR was able to capture the variability across time, sites, and light environments of all leaf traits investigated (R-2 = 0.6-0.8 for temporal variability; R-2 = 0.3-0.7 for cross-site variability; R-2 = 0.4-0.8 for variability from light environments). We also tested alternative field sampling designs and found that for most leaf traits, biweekly leaf sampling throughout the growing season enabled accurate characterization of the seasonal patterns. Compared with the estimation of foliar pigments, the performance of N-mass, C-mass and LMA PLSR models improved more significantly with sampling frequency. Our results demonstrate that leaf spectra-trait relationships vary with time, and thus tracking the seasonality of leaf traits requires statistical models calibrated with data sampled throughout the growing season. Our results have broad implications for future research that use vegetation spectra to infer leaf traits at different growing stages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long time series of accurate Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are needed to resolve subtle signals that may be indicative of a changing climate. Motivated by the stringent requirements on SST accuracy required for Climate Data Records (CDR) we quantify sampling errors in satellite SSTs. Infrared sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have sampling errors caused by incomplete coverage primarily due to clouds and inter-swath gaps (gaps between successive swaths/orbits). Unlike retrieval errors, the sampling errors are introduced when calculating mean values and in generating gap-free SST fields. We generate MODIS-sampled SST fields by superimposing MODIS cloud masks on top of the Multi-scale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) SST field for the same day. Based on the MODIS-sampled fields, we calculate sampling errors at different temporal and spatial resolutions to examine the impacts at different scales. Our results indicate that sampling errors are significant, more so in the high latitudes, especially the Arctic. The 30 degrees N-30 degrees S zonal band is found to have the smallest errors; a notable exception is the persistent negative errors found in the Tropical Instability Wave area, where the mesoscale ocean-atmosphere interaction leads to a more frequently satellite sampling above the cold sections of the wave area. The global mean sampling error is generally positive and increases approximately exponentially with missing data fraction at a fixed averaging interval, while error variability is mainly controlled by SST variability. Areas with persistent cloud cover have large sampling errors in temporally averaged SSTs. We conclude that the sampling error can be an important or even dominant component of the error budget of mean and gap-free SST fields. Climate data generation and interpretation of satellite-derived SST CDRs and their application must be conducted with due regard to the sampling error. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.

AB Spatially explicit predictions of fuel moisture content are crucial for quantifying fire danger indices and as inputs to fire behaviour models. Remotely sensed predictions of fuel moisture have typically focused on live fuels; but regional estimates of dead fuel moisture have been less common. Here we develop and test the spatial application of a recently developed dead fuel moisture model, which is based on the exponential decline of fine fuel moisture with increasing vapour pressure deficit (D). We first compare the performance of two existing approaches to predict D from satellite observations. We then use remotely sensed D, as well as D estimated from gridded daily weather observations, to predict dead fuel moisture. We calibrate and test the model at a woodland site in South East Australia, and then test the model at a range of sites in South East Australia and Southern California that vary in vegetation type, mean annual precipitation (129-1404 mm year(-1)) and leaf area index (0.1-5.7). We found that D modelled from remotely sensed land surface temperature performed slightly better than a model which also included total precipitable water (MAE < 1.16 kPa and 1.62 kPa respectively). D calculated with observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite was under-predicted in areas with low leaf area index. Both D from remotely sensed data and gridded weather station data were good predictors of the moisture content of dead suspended fuels at validation sites, with mean absolute errors less than 3.9% and 6.0% respectively. The occurrence of data gaps in remotely sensed time series presents an obstacle to this approach, and assimilated or extrapolated meteorological observations may offer better continuity.

ID ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; MAPS
AB For purposes of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) accounting, estimation of deforestation area in tropical countries often relies on satellite remote sensing in the absence of National Forest Inventories (NFI). Gabon has recently launched a National Climate Action Plan with the intent of establishing a National Forest Monitoring System that meets the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. The assessment of areas of forest cover and forest cover change is essential to estimate activity data, defined as areas of various categories of land use change by the IPCC guidelines.
   An appropriately designed probability sample can be used to estimate forest cover and net change and their associated uncertainties and express them in the form of confidence intervals at selected probability thresholds as required in the IPCC 2006 guidelines and for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, wall-to-wall mapping is often required to provide a comprehensive assessment of forest resources and as input to land use plans for management purposes, but wall-to-wall approaches are more expensive than a sample based approach based on visual interpretation and require specialized equipment and staff. The recent release of the University of Maryland (UMD) Global Forest Change (GFC) map products could be an alternative for tropical countries wishing to develop their own wall-to-wall forest map products but without the resources to do so. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of replacing national wall-to-wall forest maps with forest maps obtained from the UMD GFC initiative.
   A model assisted regression (MAR) estimator was applied using the combination of reference data obtained from a probability sample and forest cover and forest cover change maps either (i) produced nationally or (ii) obtained from the UMD GFC data. The resulting activity data are potentially more accurate than the SRS estimate and provide an assessment of the precision of the estimate which is not available from map accuracy indices alone. Results obtained for 2000 and 2010 for both the national and UMD GFC datasets confirm the high level of forest cover in Gabon, more than 235 million ha representing approximately 88.5% of the country.
   Although the UMD GFC dataset provides a reliable means of producing area statistics at national level combined with appropriate sample reference data, thus offering an alternative to nationally produced datasets (i) the classification errors associated with the Global dataset have non-negligible effects on both the estimate and the precision which supports the more general statement that map data should not be used alone to produce area estimates, and (ii) the maps obtained from the UMD GFC dataset require specific calibration of the tree cover percentage representing a non -negligible effort requiring specialized staff and equipment. Guidelines on how to use and further improve UMD GFC maps for national reporting are suggested. However, this additional effort would still most likely be less than the production of national based maps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Interannual changes of vegetation are crucial in understanding ecosystem dynamics under global change. However, there is no automated tool to extract these interannual changes from remote sensing time series. To fill this gap, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) framework was refined and implemented to decompose time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reconstruct their interannual components. The performance of EEMD-based interannual NDVI detection was assessed using simulated time series, and its sensitivity to model and data parameters was determined to provide a basis for remote sensing applications. The sensitivity analysis highlighted application limitations for time series with low interannual to annual amplitude ratios and high irregularity in timing of growing seasons, as these factors have the strongest effects on the overall performance. However, within these limitations, the detected interannual components correspond well to simulated input components with respect to timing of episodes and composition of time scales. The applicability on real world NDVI time series was demonstrated by mapping the coupling between precipitation variability, interannual vegetation changes, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole phenomena for ecoregions in East and Central Africa. In most areas where precipitation was found sensitive to oceanic forcing, the EEMD detected vegetation changes matched the predicted response, except in dense forest ecosystems.

AB This study explores an application of satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to climate studies by focusing on a connection with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we focus on SSTs from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and report a 99% significant correlation between the changes of in situ measured AMOC transport and the variation of 1-month leading SST anomalies in the subpolar North Atlantic region (45 degrees N-70 degrees N) based on analyses of an 85-month period. The leading mode of the singular value decomposition analysis of SST and Sea Level Pressure (SLP) for 31 years (1981/12-2012/12) shows an apparent North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forcing on the SST fields. Specifically, the 551 and SLP one-month phase lag covariance is notable at temporal scales of 4 to 11 months. After removing the first order component of the NAO, the residual SST (RESST) provides better estimates of the AMOC on a shorter time scale than the SST. This is because that RESST is less likely to be affected by the local SLP on these time scales. The high correlation is primarily between the RESST and variations of the geostrophic Upper Mid-Ocean transport component of the AMOC. The 31-year RESST time series in the North Atlantic subpolar region is also significantly correlated with the Gulf Stream path SST anomalies with a one-month lead, implying a fast signal transport from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Gulf Stream. A similar fast adjustment signal is also found in 500-year control simulations of the GFDL model CM2.1. These results indicate a prospective capability of satellite-derived SSTs to predict AMOC variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil salinization is widely recognized to be a major threat to worldwide agriculture. Despite decades of research in soil mapping, no reliable and up-to-date salinity maps are available for large geographical regions, especially for the salinity ranges that are most relevant to agricultural productivity (i.e., salinities less than 20 dS m(-1), when measured as the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract). This paper explores the potentials and limitations of assessing and mapping soil salinity via linear modeling of remote sensing vegetation indices. A case study is presented for western San Joaquin Valley, California, USA using multi-year Landsat 7 ETM + canopy reflectance and the Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI). Highly detailed salinity maps for 22 fields comprising 542 ha were used for ground-truthing. Re-gridded to 30 x 30 m, the ground-truth data totaled over 5000 pixels with salinity values in the range 0 to 352 dS m(-1). Multi-year maximum values of CRSI were used to model soil salinity. Soil type, meteorological data, and crop type were evaluated as covariates. All considered models were evaluated for their fit to the whole data set as well as their performance in a leave-one-field-out spatial cross-validation. The best performing model was a function of CRSI, crop type (i.e., cropped or fallow), rainfall, and average minimum temperature, with R-2 = 0.728 when evaluated against all data and R-2 = 0.611 for the cross-validation predictions. Broken out by salinity classes, the mean absolute errors (MAE) for the cross-validation predictions were (all units dS m(-1)): 2.94 for the 0-2 interval (non-saline), 2.12 for 2-4 (slightly saline), 2.35 for 4-8 (moderately saline), 3.23 for 8-16 (strongly saline), and 5.64 for >16 (extremely saline). On a per-field basis, the validation predictions had good agreement with the field average (R-2 = 0.79, MAE = 2.46 dS m(-1)), minimum (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 225 dS m(-1)), and maximum (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 3.09 dS m(-1)) observed salinity. Overall, reasonably accurate and precise high resolution, regional-scale remote sensing of soil salinity is possible, even over the critical range of 0 to 20 dS m(-1), where researchers and policy makers must focus to prevent loss of agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.

AB MODIS has been providing daily imagery for retrieving land surface properties with a spatial resolution 250 m since the year 2000. In many places, this pixel size is closer to that of individual landscape elements, such as managed forest stands or crop fields, than those of time series more typically used in vegetation analyses (with pixel sizes ranging from about 1 km to 8 km). With such spatial resolution, combined with its increasingly long archive, MODIS data offers great potential for vegetation monitoring applications in general, and crop growth monitoring in particular. However, due to its whiskbroom design, the observation geometry of the MODIS instrument, combined with the spatial uncertainty in the registration of the images, can result in different (albeit neighbouring) physical areas being mapped onto the same pixel depending on the view zenith angle (which varies from day to the next). Rather than considering this as an inconvenience, a method is here proposed to exploit this peculiarity to identify pixels corresponding to a homogeneous plant cover, in order to retrieve surface specific time series of satellite products. This method is based on quantifying the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, hereafter) of the daily MODIS NDVI time series, defined as the variance of smoothed temporal signal over the variance of the residues. If consecutive observations of the same pixel (which have thus sampled the spatial vicinity of that pixel) provide similar NDVI values, the resulting temporal signal is relatively stable and the SNR is high. Such stability can indicate that the signal comes from a spatially homogeneous surface, such as a single large field covered by the same crop with similar agro-management practices. On the contrary, a noisy time series indicates instead a transition zone between different land uses or between fields with different management practices. SNR maps therefore serve as a proxy for sub-pixel homogeneity from which time series originating from a specific land cover or land use can be retrieved. This approach is demonstrated over 12 contrasting agricultural landscapes across the globe from which clearly distinctive crop specific signals are extracted. Exploiting the full MODIS archive to derive surface specific information in this way should open new avenues for regional to global agricultural monitoring applications. Expanding this method to derive satellite products for specific land cover classes could also be useful for many other applications linked to dynamics of land cover and land use change.

AB Mapping the spatio-temporal characteristics of wetland inundation has an important significance to the study of wetland environment and associated flora and fauna. High temporal remote sensing imagery is widely used for this purpose with the limitations of relatively low spatial resolutions. In this study, a novel method based on integration of back-propagation neural network (BP) and genetic algorithm (GA), so-called IBPGA, is proposed for super-resolution mapping of wetland inundation (SMWI) from multispectral remote sensing imagery. The IBPGA-SMWI algorithm is developed, including the fitness function and integration search strategy. IBPGA-SMWI was evaluated using Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery from the Poyanghu wetland in China and the Macquarie Marshes in Australia. Compared with traditional SMWI methods, IBPGA-SMWI consistently achieved more accurate super-resolution mapping results in terms of visual and quantitative evaluations. In comparison with GA-SMWI, IBPGA-SMWI not only improved the accuracy of SMWI, but also accelerated the convergence speed of the algorithm. The sensitivity analysis of IBPGA-SMWI in relation to standard crossover rate, BP crossover rate and mutation rate was also carried out to discuss the algorithm performance. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of median-low resolution remote sensing imagery in wetland inundation mapping and monitoring, and ultimately support the studies of wetland environment.

AB Daily gap-free Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields at high resolution are required by several operational users working on monitoring and forecasting the status of the marine environment Existing instruments cannot provide such fields, and careful interpolation of available data is required to provide gap-free SST estimates. In the framework of the MyOcean projects (now turning into the European Copernicus Marine Service), several satellite (and/or satellite and in situ) interpolated products are distributed in real time, and continuous research and development activities are carried out to improve their quality. In this paper, we describe the work done to improve the High Resolution (1/16 degrees) interpolated product covering the Mediterranean Sea, that is obtained by combining all available satellite infrared images. Three Optimal Interpolation schemes based on different space-time covariance models and background fields are derived, compared and validated versus in situ drifting buoy measurements (leading to a minimum standard deviation error (SIDE) of 0.46 degrees K and mean bias error (MBE) of -0.15 degrees K), as well as by adopting a holdout validation approach with artificial clouds (with STDE ranging between 0.22 degrees K and 0.55 degrees K, and MBE always between 0.03 degrees K and 0.05 degrees K, depending on the cloud configuration considered). Almost negligible differences are found between the three products, revealing only a slight improvement when using spatially varying covariance parameters and a daily climatology as background, which is less risky in case of prolonged cloudy conditions, though attaining the same performance with small/rapid clouds. This scheme has thus been implemented in the Mediterranean SST operational chain since April 2014. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Technological advances in satellite remote sensing have offered a variety of techniques for estimating surface soil water content as a key variable in numerous environmental studies. Optical methods are particularly valuable for remote sensing of soil moisture since reflected solar radiation is the strongest passive signal available to satellites and thus observations at optical wavelengths are capable of providing high spatial resolution data. Since remote sensors do not measure soil water content directly, mathematical algorithms that describe the connection between the measured signal and surface water content must be derived. Here, we present a physically-based soil moisture retrieval model in the solar domain (350-2500 nm) that is based on the Kubelka-Munk two-flux radiative transfer theory. The model is designed to describe diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The theory suggests a linear relationship between a transformed reflectance and soil water content in the short wave infrared bands (e.g. band 7 of Landsat and MODIS satellites) providing an easy-to-use algorithm in these bands. Accuracy of this model was tested and preliminarily verified using laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of different soils. Further studies on potentials and challenges of this model for large-scale application using optical satellites data remain a topic of ongoing research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The established procedure to access the quality of atmospheric correction processors and their underlying algorithms is the comparison of satellite data products with related in-situ measurements. Although this approach addresses the accuracy of derived geophysical properties in a straight forward fashion, it is also limited in its ability to catch systematic sensor and processor dependent behaviour of satellite products along the scan-line, which might impair the usefulness of the data in spatial analyses.
   The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) aims to create an ocean colour dataset on a global scale to meet the demands of the ecosystem modelling community. The need for products with increasing spatial and temporal resolution that also show as little systematic and random errors as possible, increases. Due to cloud cover, even temporal means can be influenced by along-scanline artefacts if the observations are not balanced and effects cannot be cancelled out mutually.
   These effects can arise from a multitude of results which are not easily separated, if at all. Among the sources of artefacts, there are some sensor-specific calibration issues which should lead to similar responses in all processors, as well as processor-specific features which correspond with the individual choices in the algorithms. A set of methods is proposed and applied to MERIS data over two regions of interest in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific Gyre. The normalised water leaving reflectance products of four atmospheric correction processors, which have also been evaluated in match-up analysis, is analysed in order to find and interpret systematic effects across track. These results are summed up with a semi-objective ranking and are used as a complement to the match-up analysis in the decision for the best Atmospheric Correction (AC) processor.
   Although the need for discussion remains concerning the absolutes by which to judge an AC processor, this example demonstrates clearly, that relying on the match-up analysis alone can lead to misjudgement (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Tropical forests are huge reservoirs of terrestrial carbon and are experiencing rapid degradation and deforestation. Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26' N, 83 degrees 59' W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value = 0.31, r(2) = 0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value = 0.004, r(2) = 0.51) and tree density (p-value = 0.002, r(2) = 0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value = 0.003, r(2) = 0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.

AB Water temperature governs the distribution and behaviour of fish. Riverine salmonids use discrete cold water patches, termed thermal refuges, when stream temperature exceeds their thermal tolerances. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms driving the spatial distribution of thermal refuges, particularly at large scales. Given the threat posed by climate warming to salmon populations in Europe and North America, thermal refuges are increasingly important for salmonids during summer. In this study, we used airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterise the spatial distribution of thermal refuges from similar to 700 km of rivers in an eastern Canada salmon watershed. Thermal refuges were classified into a range of categories, and those identified as being driven by groundwater processes were observed to be both the most abundant and most spatially variable. Spatial analysis was used to assemble a range of landscape metrics that were tested for associations with the spatial distribution of groundwater-driven refuges. Associations between landscape metrics and the individual occurrence of thermal refuges were assessed using Jacobs' selectivity index. Results showed that the occurrence of groundwater thermal refuges was significantly associated with high values of channel curvature and close proximity of incoming tributary valleys (X-2 p < 0.05, df = 9). Regression was used to assess correlations between landscape metrics and the density of thermal refuges (number per river km). Channel confinement was found to correlate strongly with the density of groundwater thermal refuges using a quadratic model (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.05). Our study is the first to quantify the relationship between the spatial distribution of groundwater thermal refuges and landscape hydromorphology throughout a riverscape. This information can be used to aid conservation efforts and manage critical thermal habitats in rivers and streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale estimates of the area of terrestrial surface waters have greatly improved over time, in particular through the development of multi-satellite methodologies, but the generally coarse spatial resolution (tens of kms) of global observations is still inadequate for many ecological applications. The goal of this study is to introduce a new, globally applicable downscaling method and to demonstrate its applicability to derive fine resolution results from coarse global inundation estimates. The downscaling procedure predicts the location of surface water cover with an inundation probability map that was generated by bagged derision trees using globally available topographic and hydrographic information from the SRTM-derived HydroSHEDS database and trained on the wetland extent of the GLC2000 global land cover map. We applied the downscaling technique to the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) dataset to produce a new high-resolution inundation map at a pixel size of 15 arc-seconds, termed GIEMS-D15. GIEMS-D15 represents three states of land surface inundation extents: mean annual minimum (total area, 6.5 x 10(6) km(2)), mean annual maximum (12.1 x 10(6) km(2)), and long-term maximum (173 x 10(6) km(2)); the latter depicts the largest surface water area of any global map to date. While the accuracy of GIEMS-D15 reflects distribution errors introduced by the downscaling process as well as errors from the original satellite estimates, overall accuracy is good yet spatially variable. A comparison against regional wetland cover maps generated by independent observations shows that the results adequately represent large floodplains and wetlands. GIEMS-D15 offers a higher resolution delineation of inundated areas than previously available for the assessment of global freshwater resources and the study of large floodplain and wetland ecosystems. The technique of applying inundation probabilities also allows for coupling with coarse-scale hydro-climatological model simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigated the potential of L-band ALOS PALSAR full polarimetric radar data for forestry applications. In order to characterize the polarization response as a function of growing stock volume (GSV), weather conditions and different tree species in Siberian forests, the polarization phase difference between HH and VV polarizations and the magnitude of the polarimetric HHVV-coherence have been analyzed. Moreover, the retrieval accuracy of forest growing stock volume (GSV) has been evaluated. The investigations were conducted on forest stand level and maximum GSV was 350 m(3)/ha. Using multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR polarimetric coherence data and extensive sets of the forest inventory data at a stand level, we observed a clear decrease of polarimetric coherence with an increase in GSV, with Pearson's correlation coefficient between -0.74 and -0.79. The correlation improved to -0.87 for the forest stands with high relative stocking >70% (i.e. more homogeneous forest stand structure) and the sensitivity of the polarimetric coherence to GSV increased to similar to 250 m(3)/ha GSV. The polarization phase difference (PPD) also allowed forest to be discriminated from non-forest areas. Comparison of PPD during thawing and unfrozen weather conditions at the time of image acquisition revealed a higher contribution of a volume scattering at the latter conditions. In addition, differences in polarimetric coherence and phase difference were observed as a function of tree species. In particular, stands of larch typically exhibited a +0.1 polarimetric coherence under unfrozen conditions compared to aspen, birch and pine. There was also less variability in the PPD compared to other tree species, both under thawing and unfrozen conditions. An exponential model was used to characterize the polarimetric coherence behavior as a function of GSV. The retrieval of GSV was better under unfrozen conditions, with an RAISE of 33 m(3)/ha and R-2 of 0.73. The retrieval error was slightly higher (RMSE = 51 m(3)/ha and R-2 = 0.61) under thawing conditions. In the case of the forest stands with the area larger than 30 ha and the relative stocking of at least 70%, the GSV retrieval error decreased to RMSE of 16 m(3)/ha and to RMSE = 19 m(3)/ha respectively.

AB Droughts and floods alternately occur over a large karst plateau (Yun-Gui Plateau) in Southwest China. Here we show that both the frequency and severity of droughts and floods over the plateau are intensified during the recent decade from three-decade total water storage anomalies (TWSA) generated by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The developed ANN models performed well in hindcasting TWSA for the plateau and its three sub-regions (i.e., the upper Mekong River, Pearl River, and Wujiang River basins), showing coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.57, respectively. The intensified climate extremes are indicative of large changes in the hydrological cycle and brought great challenges in water resource management there. The TWSA of the plateau remained fairly stable during the 1980s, and featured an increasing trend at a rate of 5.9 +/- 0.5 mm/a in the 1990s interspersed extreme flooding in 1991 and during the second half of the 1990s. Since 2000, the TWSA fluctuated drastically, featuring severe spring droughts from 2003 to 2006, the most extreme spring drought on record in 2010, and severe flooding in 2008. The TWSA of the upper Mekong has decreased by similar to 100 mm (similar to 15 km(3)) compared with that at the end of the 1990s. In addition to hindcasting TWSA, the developed approach could be effective in generating future TWSA and potentially bridge the gap between the current GRACE satellites and the GRACE Follow-On Mission expected to launch in 2017.

AB Estimates of forest biomass are needed for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. As local measurements are costly, there is a great interest in obtaining reliable estimates over large areas from remote sensing data. Currently, such estimates are obtained with a variety of data sources, statistical methods and prediction standards, and there is no agreement on what are best practices for this task.
   To improve our understanding of how these different methods affect prediction quality, we first conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the most common sensor types and prediction methods. Based on the review, we identified sample size of the reference points on the ground, prediction method (step-wise linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, Gaussian processes and k-nearest neighbor), and sensor type as the main differences that could potentially affect predictive quality. We then compared those factors in two case study areas in Germany and Chile, for which airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne discrete return LiDAR and spaceborne hyperspectral data were available. For each factor combination, we calculated Pearson's coefficient of correlation between observations and predictions (r(2)) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for bootstrapped estimates using k-fold cross-validation with a varying number of folds. Finally, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the influence of the factors on the predictive error of the biomass models.
   Our results confirm previous findings that predictor data (sensor) type is the most important factor for the accuracy of biomass estimates, with LiDAR being preferable to hyperspectral data. In contrast to some previous studies, complementing LiDAR with hyperspectral data did not improve predictive accuracy. Also the prediction method had a substantial effect on accuracy and was generally more important than the sample size. In most cases, random forest performed best and stepwise linear models worst, judging from r(2) and RMSE under cross-validation. Additional results suggested that r(2) may deliver unrealistically large values when the hold-out sample during the cross-validation is too small.
   In conclusion, our literature review revealed that different methods for biomass estimation are currently used, with no general agreement on best practices. In our case studies, we found substantial accuracy differences between those methods, with LiDAR data, in combination with a random forest algorithm and a large number of reference sample units on the ground yielding the lowest error for biomass predictions. The comparatively high importance of the statistical prediction method seems particularly relevant, as they suggest that choosing the appropriate statistical method may be more effective than obtaining additional field data for obtaining good biomass estimates. Considering the costs of improving accuracy of global and regional biomass estimates by ground measurements, it seems sensible to invest in further comparative studies, preferably with a wider range of sites and including also RADAR sensors, to establish robust best-practice recommendations for obtaining regional and global biomass estimates from remote-sensing data.

AB Cities have evolved under manifold geographical, economical, historical, and cultural criteria, resulting in various sizes and shapes. Each city exhibits individual features and unique characteristics, despite that structural similarities appear. The separation into individual patterns, commonly named urban structure types (USTs), supports the characterization of physical, functional, and energetic factors of settlement structures, enabling associated environmental and socio-economic investigations as well as the comparison between the patterns of different cities. This study presents an automated approach for the classification of USTs based on remote sensing data in order to analyze the links between settlement structures and environmental issues, such as air pollution or urban heat islands, in a later stage of the project. Initially, an object-based classification routine is implemented to identify the land cover for the city of Berlin, utilizing spatially very high resolution aerial images and object height information. UST classes are defined based on the occurrence within the study area and are delimited by block boundaries. Afterwards, indicators for the derivation of USTs are generated based on the previously derived land cover information and the most valuable features are selected with the help of Random Forests. Finally, structural units are classified, involving common and new land cover based parameters. The focus is on the generation of an automated and transferable routine for a comprehensive UST classification covering the entire city. Comparing the results with reference data, good classification accuracies for both land cover and USTs indicate the suitability of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Yangtze River Basin downstream of China's Three Gorges Dam (TGD) (thereafter referred to as "downstream" basin) hosts the largest cluster of freshwater lakes in East Asia. These lakes are crucial water stocks to local biophysical environments and socioeconomic development. Existing studies document that individual lakes in this region have recently experienced dramatic changes under the context of enduring meteorological drought, continuous population growth, and extensive water regulation since TGD's initial impoundment (i.e., June, 2003). However, spatial and temporal patterns of lake dynamics across the complete downstream Yangtze basin remain poorly characterized. Using daily MODIS imagery and an advanced thematic mapping scheme, this study presents a comprehensive monitoring of area dynamics in the downstream lake system at a 10-day temporal resolution during 2000-2011. The studied lakes constitute similar to 76% (similar to 11,400 km(2)) of the total downstream lake area, including the entire + 70 major lakes larger than 20 km2. The results reveal a decadal net decline in lake inundation area across the downstream Yangtze Basin, with a cumulative decrease of 849 km(2) or 7.4% from 2000 to 2011. Despite an excessive precipitation anomaly in the year 2010, the decreasing trend was tested significant in all seasons. The most substantial decrease in the post-TGD period appears in fall (1.1% yr(-1)), which intriguingly coincides with the TGD water storage season. Regional lake dynamics exhibit contrasting spatial patterns, manifested as evident decrease and increase of aggregated lake areas respectively within and beyond the Yangtze Plain. This contrast suggests a marked vulnerability of lakes in the Yangtze Plain, to not only local meteorological variability but also intensified human water regulations from both the upstream Yangtze main stem (e.g., the TGD) and tributaries (e.g., lakes/reservoirs beyond the Yangtze Plain). The produced lake mapping result and derived lake area dynamics across the downstream Yangtze Basin provides a crucial monitoring basis for continuous investigations of changing mechanisms in the Yangtze lake system.

AB The coseismic deformation field related to the 2010 Mw6.9 Yushu earthquake (Qinghai, China) has been investigated by previous studies using the satellite differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) method. However, one of the limiting factors in the conventional DInSAR is that it can measure only one-dimensional (1D) ground motion along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction, thus resulting in anamorphic coseismic displacements and biased source parameters. In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) deformation maps for this earthquake were reconstructed over an area of about 100 x 70 km(2) for the first time by a combined use of the DInSAR method for detecting LOS motion and the multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) method for detecting along-track (AT) motion. The fault slip map for this earthquake was generated using the 3D deformation maps. Based on the fault traces on the fault slip map, we constructed a fault model with five segments and preformed a two-step inversion using the 3D deformation data as the constraint. Our results show that the maximum coseismic displacements in up-down, north-south and east-west directions are -40.4, 113.8, and -65.7 cm, respectively, and the peak-to-peak slip offset between the southern and northern fault wall is 1.82 m. Our model reveals a shallow dislocation on a NW-SE trending fault extending about 74 km, along which the four fault segments are nearly vertical (84 degrees-88 degrees) and the one fault segment dips 66.2 to the southwest. The estimated seismic moment is 2.43 x 10(19) Nm (Mw6.92), which is close to the solution provided by the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) Project. The slip distribution derived for each fault patch shows that the slip occurrence extends down to 12 km beneath the ground surface, and a peak slip of 2.23 m appears at the depth of about 5 km right near the epicenter. Comparison with the results derived from the seismic waves, field investigation, GPS and conventional DInSAR observations indicates that the source parameters of the Yushu earthquake can be improved due to the combined use of DInSAR and MAI measurements.

AB The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been studied from the leaf to patch (100 m(2)) scales. However, landscape scale (>100 km(2)) seagrass population dynamics are unresolved in seagrass ecology. Previous remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal or spatial resolution, or ecologically appropriate mapping, to fully address this issue. This paper presents a robust, semi-automated object-based image analysis approach for mapping dominant seagrass species, percentage cover and above ground biomass using a time series of field data and coincident high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The study area was a 142 km(2) shallow, clear water seagrass habitat (the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Australia). Nine data sets acquired between 2004 and 2013 were used to create seagrass species and percentage cover maps through the integration of seagrass photo transect field data, and atmospherically and geometrically corrected high spatial resolution satellite image data (World View-2, IKONOS and Quickbird-2) using an object based image analysis approach. Biomass maps were derived using empirical models trained with in-situ above ground biomass data per seagrass species. Maps and summary plots identified inter- and intra-annual variation of seagrass species composition, percentage cover level and above ground biomass. The methods provide a rigorous approach for field and image data collection and pre-processing, a semi-automated approach to extract seagrass species and cover maps and assess accuracy, and the subsequent empirical modelling of seagrass biomass. The resultant maps provide a fundamental data set for understanding landscape scale seagrass dynamics in a shallow water environment. Our findings provide proof of concept for the use of time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products for use in seagrass ecology and management (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extended Principal Component Analysis (EPCA) aims to examine the patterns of variability shared among multiple datasets. In image time series analysis, this is conventionally done by virtually extending the spatial dimension of the time series by spatially concatenating the different time series and then performing S-mode PCA. In S-mode analysis, samples in space are the statistical variables and samples in time are the statistical observations. This paper introduces the concept of temporal concatenation of multiple image time series to perform EPCA. EPCA can also be done with a T-mode orientation in which samples in time are the statistical variables and samples in space are the statistical observations. This leads to a total of four orientations in which EPCA can be carried out. This research explores these four orientations and their implications in investigating spatio-temporal relationships among multiple time series. This research demonstrates that EPCA carried out with temporal concatenation of the multiple time series with T-mode (tT) is able to identify similar spatial patterns among multiple time series. The conventional S-mode EPCA with spatial concatenation (sS) identifies similar temporal patterns among multiple time series. The other two modes, namely T-mode with spatial concatenation (sT) and S-mode with temporal concatenation (tS), are able to identify patterns which shate consistent temporal phase relationships and consistent spatial phase relationships with each other, respectively. In a case study using three sets of precipitation time series data from GPCP, CMAP and NCEP-DOE, the results show that examination of all four modes provides an effective basis for comparison of the series.

AB This article presents a novel statistical method for mapping water column properties from hyperspectral remote-sensing data. Usual inversion methods are based on a pixel-by-pixel approach. Therefore, they do not consider the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels, even though such pixels are often affected by the same water column if the spatial resolution is high enough.
   The proposed method uses such redundant information performing local maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of depth and water quality in large zones. It provides multi-resolution maps, in which resolution depends on local depth. In shallow water, the signal-to-noise ratio is high so an accurate mapping can be performed. Therefore, we propose to model local depth variations with a linear model while water quality is still supposed to be locally homogeneous. In deep water, the signal-to-noise ratio is lower so estimating only the local mean depth with standard ML estimation is more robust and reliable. The entire image is divided into appropriate meshes. In every mesh, water column properties are estimated using both linear and constant depth models. Final maps are obtained combining these estimates. The deeper the water, the higher the influence of standard ML estimation maps. Using local information provided by neighboring pixels makes this method robust to noise. Moreover, the hyperspectral image and estimated bathymetry have the same resolution in shallow water since depth is modeled for every pixel.
   The efficiency of our method was assessed with simulated and real hyperspectral images. Results proved that depth modeling improves depth and water quality estimations, especially in shallow water. In deep water, assuming that the bottom is locally flat is reasonable since depth variations are small relatively to depth mean value. With the considered water quality, the estimated bathymetry was accurate for depths up to 14 m. Estimated concentration maps were consistent for the whole range Of depths. The spatial resolution of estimated bathymetry was 50 cm in shallow water (for depths up to 10 m), and ranged from 2.5 m to 5 m in deep water (for depths between 10 m and 14 m).
   The influence of bio-optical modeling is also demonstrated. We show that reliable models are absolutely necessary to obtain good estimation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We analyzed the sensitivity of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance and surface reflectance of a soil-vegetation system to input biophysical and biochemical parameters using the coupled Soil-Leaf-Canopy radiative transfer model SLC and MODTRAN. We applied variance-based global sensitivity analysis for different atmospheric conditions and observation configurations. Among 23 input parameters, crown coverage, leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution function and soil moisture were found to be the most influential parameters driving the output variance of the radiance between 400 and 2500 nm with a few exceptions. Hapke's soil parameters and the canopy layer dissociation factor were recognized to have marginal influence on the output radiance. It is also found that a large portion of uncertainty in the output radiance is driven by the interaction effects among input parameters in the visible (similar to 550 nm), whereas the red-near infrared (similar to 670 nm), seems to have fewer interaction effects. The effect of solar/view direction is found to be significant on TOA radiance sensitivity to the input parameters. The results also confirmed that the sensitivities of surface reflectance are comparable to the TOA radiance sensitivities when the atmosphere is clear and visibility is high. Since coupled surface-atmosphere RT models can be computationally intensive, this work also introduces an improvement to the design and sampling of screening methods for efficient sensitivity analysis of computationally expensive models. The improvement is based on three elements: a) generating sample points by Sobol's sequence generator; b) variational analysis in the parameter space using the winding stairs method; c) use of mean and variance sensitivity measures. The results with 1200 model runs demonstrated high correlation (92%) with variance-based global sensitivity analysis using 49,152 model runs, in determining the most influential and non-influential parameters.

AB Continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) has recently been applied to leaf-level spectroscopic data for quantifying foliar chemistry, but it is unclear how well or whether CWA can be applied to imaging spectroscopy data under the conditions of higher noise level and more complicating factors. This study evaluates the application of CWA to airborne imaging spectroscopy data for predicting diurnal and seasonal variation in canopy water content (CWC) for nut tree orchards. We collected CWC measurements and concurrent imagery from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument twice a day (morning and afternoon) in spring and fall of 2011 in California, USA. Several robust wavelet features were determined and compared to four watersensitive spectral indices, three existing in the literature and one optimized in this study, for the assessment of predictive performance. Results showed that the best prediction using CWA (R-2 = 0.84 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.027 kg/m(2)) was produced by a combination of three wavelet features and it was considerably better than those by the existing water indices. While the best wavelet feature (1100 nm, scale 6) characterized the water absorption in the near-infrared region, the optimized index NID850,720 used a red edge band at 720 nm instead of a direct water absorption band. A bootstrap sampling of the validation data set indicated that ND850,720 predicted CWC significantly worse (p < 0.0001) and exhibited greater sensitivity to seasonality. Both CWA and ND850,720 revealed statistically significant diurnal declines of CWC in two different seasons in the context of a substantial seasonal decline, but the former detected greater declines in diurnal CWC Our results demonstrated the feasibility of applying CWA to airborne imaging spectroscopy data for CWC mapping and its superiority to spectral indices for improved prediction of CWC and understanding of spectral-chemical relations.

AB Satellite radar data has been employed extensively to monitor flood extents, where cloud cover often prohibits the use of satellite sensors operating at other wavelengths. Where total inundation occurs, a low backscatter return is expected due to the specular reflection of the radar signal on the water surface. However, wind-induced waves can cause a roughening of the water surface which results in a high return signal. Additionally, in arid regions, very dry sand absorbs microwave energy, resulting in low backscatter returns. Where such conditions occur adjacent to open water, this can make the separation of water and land problematic using radar. In the past, we have shown how this latter problem can be mitigated, by making use of the difference in the relationship between the incidence angle of the radar signal, and backscatter, over land and water. The mitigation of wind-induced effects, however, remains elusive. In this paper, we examine how the variability in radar backscatter with incidence angle may be used to differentiate water from land overcoming, to a large extent, both of the above problems.
   We carry out regression over multiple sets of time series data, determined by a moving window encompassing consecutively-acquired Envisat ASAR Global Monitoring Mode data, to derive three surfaces for each data set: the slope beta of a linear model fitting backscatter against local incidence angle; the backscatter normalised to 30 degrees using the linear model coefficients (sigma(0)(30)), and the ratio of the standard deviations of backscatter and local incidence angle over the window sample (SDR). The results are new time series data sets which are characterised by the moving window sample size.
   A comparison of the three metrics shows SDR to provide the most robust means to segregate land from water by thresholding. From this resultant data set, using a single step water-land classification employing a simple (and consistent) threshold applied to SDR values, we produced monthly maps of total inundation of the variable south-western basin of the Aral Sea through 2011, with an average pixel accuracy of 94% (kappa = 0.75) when checked against MODIS-derived reference maps.

AB Incorporation of a priori defined plant associations into remote sensing products is a major challenge that has only recently been confronted by the remote sensing community. We present an approach to map the spatial distribution of such associations by using plant indicator values (IVs) for salinity, moisture and nutrients as an intermediate between spectral reflectance and association occurrences. For a 12 km(2) study site in the Netherlands, the relations between observed IVs at local vegetation plots and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) airborne reflectance data were modelled using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) (R-2 0.73, 0.64 and 0.76 for salinity, moisture and nutrients, respectively). These relations were applied to map IVs for the complete study site. Association occurrence probabilities were modelled as function of IVs using a large database of vegetation plots with known association and IVs. Using the mapped IVs, we calculated occurrence probabilities of 19 associations for each pixel, resulting in both a crisp association map with the most likely occurring association per pixel, as well as occurrence probability maps per association. Association occurrence predictions were assessed by a local vegetation expert, which revealed that the occurrences of associations situated at frequently predicted indicator value combinations were over predicted. This seems primarily due to biases in the GPR predicted IVs, resulting in associations with envelopes located in extreme ends of IVs being scarcely predicted. Although the results of this particular study were not fully satisfactory, the method potentially offers several advantages compared to current vegetation classification techniques, like site-independent calibration of association probabilities, site-independent selection of associations and the provision of IV maps and occurrence probabilities per association. If the prediction of IVs can be improved, this method may thus provide a viable roadmap to bring a priori defined plant associations into the domain of remote sensing.

AB Woody vegetation structure affects wildlife habitat selection and species diversity for a wide range of taxa, and at a variety of scales. Indicators of woody structure can indicate the spatio-temporal variability of biodiversity, species occurrence and assemblages. Woody cover is the simplest and most widely used structural metric. Combined with the vegetation height, it provides a volumetric indicator, which is more informative, and is simple to calculate. We therefore assessed the utility of multitemporal polarimetric RADARSAT-2 C-band imagery to map measures of woody volumetric indices in Lowveld savannahs, in the vicinity of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. RADARSAT-2 Quad-Pol fine beam images were acquired at three key phenological stages of the seasonal savannah cycle: i) wet (summer), ii) dry (winter), and iii) end of wet (autumn). Multi-polarized band intensities (C-HH, C-HV, and C-VV, with V = vertical and H = horizontal) and polarimetric decomposition variables (Freeman-Durden, Cloude-Pottier, and Van Zyl) were derived from the SAR images and used to predict structural metrics (woody canopy cover, cylindrical woody volume, and woody canopy volume, see definition in Section 3.3) derived from 1.1 m LiDAR strips acquired across the study area, and coinciding with 12% of the SAR dataset. The best single relationship (R-2 = 0.66) was obtained between the cross-polarized HV intensity band and the total canopy volume (TCV). In terms of the seasonality, the best results were obtained using the SAR imagery from the dry season when most woody plants have lost their leaves and the grass-soil layer was dry. Validation outputs of best predictive models for TCV, at the individual season level, yielded an R-2 of 0.67, a Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) of 39%, and consisted of the SAR parameters: C-HH, C-HV, C-VV, and Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters. At the multi-seasonal level, the best predictive models for TCV yielded an R-2 of 0.75, a SEP of 35%, and comprised of the same variables but for all three seasons. The C-band SAR data thus,provided encouraging results in open, semi-arid savannahs and hint at larger area structural assessments than is possible with LiDAR sensors alone. The combined use of C-band and L-band (ALOS-Palsar 2) should also be investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Four aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithms over the Sahara Desert during June 2011 from the IASI, MISR,. MODIS, and SEVIRI satellite instruments are compared against each other in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each retrieval approach. Particular attention is paid to the effects of meteorological conditions, land surface properties, and the magnitude of the dust loading. The period of study corresponds to the time of the first Fennec intensive measurement campaign, which provides new ground-based and aircraft measurements of the dust characteristics and loading. Validation using ground-based AERONET sunphotometer data indicates that of the satellite products, the SEVIRI retrieval is most able to retrieve dust during optically thick dust events, whereas IASI and MODIS perform better at low dust loadings. This may significantly affect observations of dust emission and the mean dust climatology. MISR and MODIS are least sensitive to variations in meteorological conditions, while SEVIRI tends to overestimate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) under moist conditions (with a bias against AERONET of 0.31), especially at low dust loadings where the AOD < 1. Further comparisons are made with airborne LIDAR measurements taken during the Fennec campaign, which provide further evidence for the inferences made from the AERONET comparisons. The effect of surface properties on the retrievals is also investigated. Over elevated surfaces IASI retrieves AODs which are most consistent with AERONET observations, while the AODs retrieved by MODIS tend to be biased low. In contrast, over the least emissive surfaces IASI significantly underestimates the AOD (with a bias of -0.41), while MISR and SEVIRI show closest agreement. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) with the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI) provides an effective and accurate method for calibrating multiple-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud distributions to map effective leaf area index (LAIe) and foliage profile within a 1-km diameter test site of mature eucalyptus forest at the Tumbarumba research site, New South Wales, Australia. Plot-based TLS foliage profiles are used as training datasets for the derivation of a scaling function applied to calibrate effective leaf area index (LAIe) from a coincident ALS point cloud. The results of this study show that: a) the mean proportion of the total number of returns within 11.3 m radius of the TLS scan station was 64%. Increasing the radius decreased the level of detail due to occlusion; b) the relationship between TLS LAIe profile and ALS foliage percentile distribution (PD) using all, primary and secondary returns are not linearly related; and c) regressions between TLS LAIe profile and ALS PD, demonstrate better correspondence using a 5th order polynomial applied to all returns (r(2) = 0.95; SE = 0.09 m(2) m(-2)) than aquasi-physically-based Weibull scaling function. The calibration routine was applied to ALS data within a GIS environment to create a 500 m radius 3D map of LAIe. This localised 3D calibration of LAIe was then used as the basis to calculate the overhead canopy extinction coefficient parameter (k), and thereby facilitate upscaling of spatial LAIe estimates to larger domains using a Beer Lambert Law assumption.

AB Underwater light characteristics (quality and quantity) are important drivers of many ecological processes in aquatic systems. However, the mechanisms driving the underwater light climate in large rivers are poorly understood due to the complex interactions among color-producing agents (CPAs), which can vary in space and time. A compelling example of such a complex interaction among CPAs concerns the St. Lawrence River, where chromophoric dissolved organic matter and suspended inorganic particulate matter interact to structure the underwater spectral environment. Because such interactions can be complex, the combined net effect of CPAs on water color is not intuitive and remains to be evaluated. To resolve the spatial and temporal dynamics of the spectral profile in the St. Lawrence River, we analyzed a series of 44 Landsat 5 and 7 images, distributed between 1984 and 2009, which cover the main freshwater section of the river. Rather than following linear trends along the longitudinal axis, the spectral profiles on spectral bands (blue, green and red) presented three distinctive spatial patterns. We argue that matter injected by tributaries and discontinuous zones of the river strongly impacts water color by modulating the balance among CPAs. We also clearly demonstrate a marked trend between 1984 and 2009 toward decreasing reflectance values on bands 1, 2 and 3, presumably in response to changes in land use in the surrounding watershed.

AB Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of forest stands, constructed from scans of the Echidna full-waveform terrestrial lidar, provide a new pathway to estimate forest structural parameters such as tree diameter at breast height, tree height, crown diameter, and stem count density (trees per hectare). We provide such reconstructions using data from the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI), which emits laser pulses at 1064 nm wavelength and digitizes the full return waveform. We reconstructed four stands from the Sierra National Forest and two stands from Harvard Experimental Forest of 50 m by 50 m size, with varying tree density and species, using data acquired in 2008 and 2009. Our procedure processes each lidar pulse return to identify one or multiple "hits" and their associated peak return power; converts peak power to apparent reflectance; locates hits in Cartesian coordinate space and stores them as points in a point cloud with associated attributes; registers and merges five (Sierra) or nine (Harvard) overlapping scans into a single point cloud; identifies the ground plane and classifies ground hits; produces a local digital elevation model; classifies non-ground hits as trunk/branch or foliage hits using the relative width of the return pulse; and uses commercial software tools to display, manipulate, and interact with the point cloud to make direct measurements of trees in the virtual space of the reconstruction. Results show good to very good agreement between virtual and manual measurements of tree diameter, height, and crown size, with R-2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.99. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB We inverted the PROSPECT and GEOSAIL Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data to retrieve Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) in woodlands located in the peninsular territory of Spain. Ecological rules were used to parameterize the RTM. This approach reduces the probability of an ill-posed problem in the inversion of the selected RTMs, by rejecting unrealistic combinations of input parameters. Three species representatives of each region were used to derive the ecological rules: Quercus hex L, Quercus faginea L, and Pinus halepensis Mill. for the Mediterranean region, and Fagus sylvatica L, Quercus robur L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill for the Eurosiberian region. Equivalent Water Thickness, Dry Matter and Chlorophyll content were taken from several data sources to separately parameterize both the Mediterranean (water-limited) and Eurosiberian (energy-limited) ecoregions of Spain. GEOSAIL was parameterized using a restricted range of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and specific canopy cover values, keeping other parameters fixed. The inversion was based on the Look Up Table technique using the minimum spectral angle as merit function. Several models were tested by using different inputs from standard MODIS products, as well as the fractional cover product developed by Guerschman et al. (2009). The model based on the reflectance bands and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index computed from the Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4) provided the most accurate results, with a LFMC's Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 27.7% (RMSE = 27.3% for the Mediterranean and 28.7% for the Eurosiberian woodland). The estimation of LFMC was performed within the framework of a fire risk assessment system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite radar altimetry has been extensively used to estimate ice-sheet elevation change rates over Antarctica and Greenland from repeated measurements of surface elevation changes through either crossover or collinear (repeat-track) analysis. However, there has been no attempt to use satellite radar altimetry over mountain glaciers because the instrument often loses lock or does not provide usable measurements over the rough terrains and steep slopes due to its large footprint size. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of satellite radar altimetry to estimate elevation change rates over the Bering Glacier System in Alaska for the period of 1992-2010 from TOPEX/Poseidon and Envisat radar altimeter measurements. We are able to observe the 1993-1995, and 2008-2011 surge events from the T/P and Envisat time series, respectively. We also observe the accelerated elevation decreases in 2002-2007, after slightly negative or near nil elevation changes, in 1996-2001, which are related to the temperature and snow depth variations. Our method can be applied to other wide (>7 km) glaciers worldwide, and provide new insights into the behavior of glaciers responding to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Encroachment of invasive shrubs into grassland areas on rangelands in the southwestern United States threatens the viability of livestock production and can severely alter hydrology and biodiversity. Novel remote sensing technologies may provide useful information for monitoring and remediating this threat. The objectives were to investigate multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) as an approach to map rangeland vegetation using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and to test the sensitivity of MESMA to alternative image spatial resolutions and spectral waveband combinations. Data from two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) overflights at the Jornada Experimental Range in southwestern New Mexico were used in the analysis. Endmember spectra were selected from a library of ground-based spectral observations collected with a field spectroradiometer. A 4-endmember MESMA was conducted for both AVIRIS images at their native spatial resolutions using 113 10-nm wavebands from 422 to 2339 nm. Additional MESMAs were conducted at 10 multiples of the images' native spatial resolution and for 6 alternative combinations of spectral waveband subregions. Maps of endmember fractional cover for green shrub vegetation, nonphotosynthetic grass vegetation, and bare soil were comparable to an earlier vegetation classification map of Jornada. MESMA fractional cover estimates for the green vegetation endmember were positively correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.58. Correlation coefficients between the sum of the green and nonphotosynthetic vegetation endmembers and the cellulose absorption index (CAI) were greater than 0.59. Correlation coefficients between MESMA fractional green vegetation cover and NDVI from independent multispectral images were greater than 0.57. Despite losses in spatial detail at coarser image spatial resolutions, MESMA results for images with spatial resolution degraded by a factor of 10 (similar to 150 m) were similar to aggregated results for MESMA at the native spatial resolution (similar to 15 m). Additionally, MESMA results were shown to be substantially more sensitive to the spectral wavebands used in the analysis as compared to the spatial resolution of the images. Considered together, the MESMA results at Jornada indicated that fine spectral resolution with hyperspectral remote sensing was substantially more important than incremental changes in image spatial scale from 15 m to 150 m.

AB We present a method able to fill large data gaps in satellite chlorophyll (CHL) images, based on the principle of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) classification methods. The method makes use of complementary oceanic remote sensing observations: sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH). It relies on the assumption that a state of the ocean can be locally defined by its values of SST, SSH and CHL, and that a codebook of possible (SST, SSH, CHL) situations, if large enough, allows the reconstruction of incomplete situations of CHL. To account for the spatio-temporal context, each situation is characterized by the values of the three variables CHL, SST and SSH over a 3 x 3 spatial window surrounding the pixel, and at three successive times. In a first step, the feasibility and robustness of the method was assessed on a synthetic data set derived from a high-resolution coupled bio-physical ocean model. The SOM reconstruction method was particularly powerful in the case of intense cloud cover and to reconstruct CHL at scales larger than similar to 10 km. Subsequently, the method was adapted to real satellite data, which required introducing iterative learning and dealing with multi-modal determination of the referent vectors. The proposed improvements of the method proved satisfactory in retrieving CHL missing values under heavy cloud coverage and in improving the quality of weekly CHL products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Atmospheric correction in the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) spectral range of remotely sensed data is significantly simplified if we assume a Lambertian target. However, natural surfaces are anisotropic. Therefore, this assumption will introduce an error in surface directional reflectance estimates and consequently in the estimation of vegetation indexes such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the surface albedo retrieval. In this paper we evaluate the influence of directional effects on the atmospheric correction and its impact in the NDVI and albedo estimation. First, we derived the NDVI and surface albedo from data corrected assuming a Lambertian surface, then by using the BRDF model parameters used in the albedo retrieval, we account for the coupling effect and retrieved an improved NDVI and albedo. The study used Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) MODIS data, which has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. We focused our analysis on four Aeronet sites located in the United States of America: KONZA EDC (a prairie region in the Flint Hills, Kansas), Howland (a forest area in Maine), Walker Branch (a forest area in Tennessee) and GSFC (at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center). The results indicate that the relative errors due to the Lambertian assumption on the surface reflectance are 3-12% in the visible and 0.7-5.0% in the near-infrared, around 1% on the NDVI and less than 1% on the albedo.

AB Continuous ground-based total ozone measurements were carried out at Ny-Alesund (78.9 degrees N, 11.9 degrees E. Svalbard islands, Norway), by using a Brewer spectrophotometer, for almost three years (2007-2009). Given the scarcity of high-quality ground-based measurements performed at high latitudes, this dataset provides a rare opportunity to check the quality of satellite-based data recorded in Arctic. Considering the unprecedented Artic ozone loss recently derived from satellite observations, assessing the reliability of satellite readings at such high latitudes is a timely effort This study focuses on the comparisons between ground-based Brewer total ozone measurements and satellite ozone readings retrieved from EOS Aura Ozone Measurement Instrument (OM) (by using OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS algorithms), retrieved from ERS-2 Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) (by using TOGOMI algorithm) and from Envisat SCanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric CartographY (SCIAMACHY) (by using TOSOMI algorithm).
   Despite the extreme conditions that affect both ground- and satellite-based measurements, a good agreement was found (r = 0.99 for OMI-TOMS, r = 0.97 for both OMI-DOAS and GOME datasets and r = 0.96 for SCIAMACHY). Nevertheless, space-based total ozone readings were found to underestimate ground-based data, in agreement with prior results. OMI-TOMS data showed the highest negative mean bias (MB = -2.03%) whereas DOAS-based datasets showed a better agreement (MB = -0.47, -0.69 and -0.01% for OMI-DOAS, GOME and SCIAMACHY, respectively) but a greater data scatter. On the other hand, DOAS-based datasets present an important seasonal dependence; an overestimation of the Brewer total ozone up to about 3% is found in April and September with respect to OMI-DOAS and SCIAMACHY while in September with respect to GOME In contrast, differences between OMI-TOMS and Brewer total ozone do not present significant dependence on the season or on geometrical parameters (i.e., satellite solar and viewing zenith angles). Differences in total ozone values between ground-based and satellite measurements are further discussed attending to the algorithm differences in dealing with cloud cover under high surface albedo (i.e., snow) conditions.
   Extending the study to Sodankyla station (67.3 degrees N, 26.6 degrees E, Finland), similarities and differences between the two stations have been highlighted. The agreement between satellite and Brewer data slightly improved when Sodankyla station is considered. On the continent, the seasonal dependence and data scatter for DOAS-based datasets and the MB for OMI-TOMS are smaller with respect to Ny-Alesund. Moreover, the roughly constant ozone summer offset (about 1%) between OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS, well evident for Ny-Alesund, is not present for Sodankyla. Finally, some patterns in the geographic distributions of the satellite-Brewer total ozone differences are evident only for Ny-Alesund, partly because of the peculiar characteristics of the surface albedo (higher than in Sodankyla, with a strong water/land contrast).

In this study we aimed to develop and test a new method for mapping fire scars from MODIS imagery, to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of wildfires in Israel in the 2000s and to examine the factors controlling Israel's wildfire regime. To map the fires we used two 'off-the-shelf' MODIS fire products as our basis-the 1 km MODIS Collection 5 fire hotspots, the 500 m MCD45A1 burnt areas-and we created a new set of fire scar maps from the 250 m MOD13Q1 product We carried out a cross comparison of the three MODIS based wildfire scar maps and evaluated them independently against the wild fire scars mapped from 30 m Landsat TM imagery. To examine the factors controlling wildfires we used GIS layers of rainfall, land use, and a Landsat-based national vegetation map. Wildfires occurred in areas where annual rainfall was above 250 mm, mostly in areas with herbaceous vegetation. Wildfire frequency was especially high in the Golan Heights and in the foothills of the Judean mountains, and a high correspondence was found between military training zones and the spatial distribution of fire scars. The use of MODIS satellite images enabled us to map wildfires at a national scale due to the high temporal resolution of the sensor. Our MOD13Q1 based mapping of fire scars adequately mapped large (> 1 km(2)) fires with accuracies above 80%. Such large fires account for a large proportion of all fires, and pose the greatest threats. This database can aid managers in determining wildfire risks in space and in time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The availability of high frequency remote sensing time series allows the assessment of crop evolution at different scales. The Spectral Shape Indexes (551) represent the shape of a multispectral (MODIS in this case) reflectance profile in a set of three consecutive bands.
   The aims of this research were: (1) to assess AS1 and AS2 behavior over a cotton crop growing period, (2) to test whether function fitting procedures can be used to model MODIS AS1 and AS2 and NDVI time series and (3) to derive objective AS1 and AS2 phenological metrics that can be used to monitor cotton phenological stages.
   Phenological stages of a cotton crop in the San Joaquin Valley (CA) were identified by linking local climatic data and producer recorded management practices. An asymmetric Gaussian function was fitted to the time series of each index using TIMESAT software. Then, specific dates in the fitted functions have been related to phenological stages and dates of agricultural practices.
   Results show that AS1 and AS2 exhibit a consistent pattern clearly different from the temporal evolution of NDVI. The AS2 index shows high values during periods when vegetation is dominant, either photosynthetically active or dry, and low values when soil dominates the pixel. The AS1 index time series showed two minima during the cotton growth period. Minima and inflection points derived from the fitted functions are coincident in time with significant crop management dates during the growing period. These results show that function fitting procedures applied to AS1 and AS2 can be used to derive phenological metrics, illustrating the potential for using Spectral Shape Indexes for crop monitoring.

AB The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model uses remotely sensed maps of land-surface temperature (LST) along with local air temperature estimates at a nominal blending height to model heat and water fluxes across a landscape, partitioned between dual sources of canopy and soil. For operational implementation of TSEB, however, it is often difficult to obtain representative air temperature data that are compatible with the LST retrievals, which may themselves have residual errors due to atmospheric and emissivity corrections. To address this issue, two different strategies in applying the TSEB model without requiring local air temperature data were tested over a typical Mediterranean agricultural area using a set of high-resolution multispectral airborne remote sensing images. Alleviating the need for accurate local air temperature data as input, these two approaches estimate the surface-to-air temperature gradient that drives the sensible heat flux by directly exploiting the information available in the image. The two approaches indude: 1) a scene-based internal calibration (TSEB-IC) procedure that estimates air temperature over a well-watered and fully vegetated pixel in the LST image, and 2) a disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) that uses air temperature estimates from a time-differential coupled TSEB-atmospheric boundary layer model of atmosphere-land exchange (ALEXI). A comparison of the air temperatures modeled by TSEB-IC and DisALEXI with in situ weather station observations shows good agreement, with average differences on the order of 1 K. comparable with the uncertainties in the remotely sensed surface temperature maps. Surface fluxes estimated by each method agree well with micro-meteorological measurements acquired over an olive orchard within the aircraft imaging domain. In comparison with fluxes generated with TSEB using local measurements of air temperature, instantaneous fluxes from these alternative methods show good spatial agreement, with differences of less than low m(-2) across the domain. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the three models, performed by introducing artificial errors into the model inputs, demonstrates that the DisALEXI and TSEB-IC approaches are relatively insensitive to errors in absolute surface temperature calibration, while turbulent fluxes from TSEB applications using local air temperature measurements show sensitivity of approximately 30 W m(-2) per degree temperature perturbation. This highlights the value of both internal calibration and timedifferential estimation of the surface-to-air temperature gradient within a surface energy balance framework (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Spatial information on biotopes would be an asset for boreal peatland inventories. It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65 degrees 57'N, 24 degrees 29'E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon), electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p<0.01), and pH (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with sparse point densities are increasingly used for forest growing stock estimations. The area-level point distributions derived by ALS are not considered informative on tree species, however, and the required information is typically produced using an additional data source, such as spectral images. We developed new volumetric and structural features (so called alpha shape metrics), hypothesizing that these could produce additional information on the species-size variation as compared to the previously used ALS and image features. These metrics were tested in the prediction of species-specific, plot-level volume using the Most Similar Neighbor imputation method and a data set consisting of altogether 426 training and 142 validation field plots. The considered forest area was dominated by Scots pine, while Norway spruce and deciduous trees formed the other two species groups to be distinguished. The developed metrics improved the species-specific estimates by 13-30 or 2-4 percentage points compared to features based on ALS data alone or a combination of the ALS and image features, respectively. The metrics had a higher importance when the reference data insufficiently covered the species-size variation within the area. Although the estimates produced using a combination of the ALS and image data had a superior accuracy compared to those produced by the ALS data alone, the results indicate that species-specific estimates may be further improved by developing computational features based on ALS data.

AB We have studied the seasonal variability of four turbid river plumes along the central Chilean coast using daily, high-resolution images of surface turbidity from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) in combination with measurements of wind, river flow, and hydrographic data. Atmospherically corrected MODIS data reveal strong seasonal variability in the areal extent of plume water, as well as in turbidity levels, which are significantly correlated with seasonality in river discharge. A seasonal climatology of turbid plume patterns shows individual plumes merging into an extensive body of turbid waters attached to the coast during fall (April-June)-winter (July-September) (occurs about 10% of days in fall-winter). During spring (October-December) and summer (January-March), the individual plumes remain distinct and occupy a smaller area close to the coast, when observed (evident on less than 30% of days in spring-summer). In spring-summer most plumes are detected for the northern rivers (Mataquito and Maule). When the plumes merge into a coastal band in fall-winter, a turbid area of more than 1000 km(2) is observed in the study area between 34.85 degrees S and 37.15 degrees S. This occurs following peaks in river discharge combined with the effect of strong southward (downwelling-favorable) winds. An analysis of key non-dimensional numbers shows that buoyancy dominates plume dynamics during summer, whereas inertial forcing associated with river outflow is more important in winter near the coast. Farther offshore (>10 km), the effects of rotation and wind tend to dominate the plume dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In coastal and estuarine environments, near-surface salinity varies significantly in space and time. As absolute salinity and salinity gradients are central to many physical and ecological processes in these environments, reliable and consistent salinity estimates are a priority for marine research and application communities. Satellite remote sensing has a great potential to meet this need, yet sensors and algorithms designed to monitor open ocean salinity are typically ill-suited for high resolution applications to coastlines and estuaries. Here we present results of multiple statistical models that predict daily. gridded surface salinity at 1 km resolution across Chesapeake Bay as a function of level 2 surface reflectance estimates from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard the Aqua platform. Eight statistical methods were tested and it was found that sea surface salinity can be accurately predicted via remote sensed products with an accuracy that is more than sufficient for many physical and ecological applications. For the best-performing statistical model, mean absolute error was 1.82 relative to mean Chesapeake Bay salinity of 16.5. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate habitat mapping in salt marshes is critical for both management and conservation goals. Information on marsh elevation is important to coastal managers, particularly for flood inundation mapping, coastal hazard assessments and modeling sea level rise. Elevation is also an important determinant of the frequency and duration of tidal flooding, which in turn affects species patterns in marshes: elevation differences of less than 10 cm can affect plant distributions and productivity. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) can provide synoptic elevation information in many environments, but its accuracy in salt marshes is limited by a combination of sensor resolution (scan angle and frequency, pulse width, footprint size), instrument errors (GPS and inertial measurement unit errors), and poor laser penetration in dense vegetation. This means that uncorrected digital elevation models (DEM) are generally not accurate enough to distinguish elevation changes in salt marsh environments at the resolution that is used to determine tidal flooding or vegetation patterns. In this study, we used a LIDAR-derived DEM for the salt marshes surrounding Sapelo Island, GA obtained with a state-of-the-art Optech Gemini ALTM LIDAR system with a high laser pulse rate frequency of 125 kHz and advanced IMU/GPS technology, and evaluated its accuracy with elevations collected using real time kinematic (RTK) GPS. We found that DEM mean vertical errors for different cover classes ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 m in comparison to the RTK ground truth data, with the larger offsets for taller vegetation. We developed species-specific correction factors for ten cover classes and used these correction factors to modify the LIDAR-derived DEM in four areas of the study domain where vegetation boundaries were mapped directly in the field. Application of the derived correction factors greatly improved the accuracy of the LIDAR-derived DEM within these areas, reducing the overall mean DEM error from 0.10 +/- 0.12 (SD) to -0.01 +/- 0.09 m (SD), and the Root Mean Square Error from 0.16 m to 0.10 m. In the corrected DEM, the ground elevations of all vegetation classes were no longer significantly different than the true RTK ground elevations. Our results suggest that these types of corrections can greatly improve the accuracy of LIDAR-derived DEMs in salt marshes and further emphasize the importance of accuracy assessments before DEM data are used, especially in environments such as salt marshes where small differences in elevation can have significant effects on inundation patterns and plant distributions.

AB The wide swath (WS) and global monitoring (GM) modes of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) provide for monitoring purposes a good compromise between the spatial coverage, spatial resolution and revisit time. Similar imaging modes will be a part of the Sentinel-1 SAR sensing system. A consequence of operating at the wider swath is, however, the rather large view angle range (about 16-43 degrees), which needs to be corrected for if biophysical variables are to be retrieved from these data sets.
   A soil moisture retrieval algorithm based on the Integral Equation Method (IEM) scattering model is presented that explicitly simulates the backscatter as a function of the incidence angle instead of normalizing. This algorithm is applied to 150 ASAR WS scenes collected from April 2005 to September 2007 over the central part of the Tibetan Plateau. We selected three of these images covering the study area at different view angles during the winter season for the IEM roughness derivation. Subsequently, soil moisture is retrieved from the entire sigma(degrees) data sets via inversion of the IEM model with the obtained roughness parameters as input. The retrievals are validated against soil moisture measured from July 2006 to September 2007 at four sites representative for a 10 x 10 km(2) area. Further, the uncertainties following from assumptions made for the development of the algorithm are also quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Three Along Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) form a series of space-borne instruments specifically optimised to provide accurate remotely sensed measurements of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), which is a key geophysical parameter required to inform the debate on climate change and global warming. These sensors' well-calibrated, high quality data have wide applicability and are being used in a much wider range of earth observation studies and applications, in addition to the planned SST mission. Each successive instrument has been an incremental improvement over its predecessor. Since early 1991 the ATSR sensors have provided global observations from the European Space Agency's Earth Observation satellites; namely ATSR-1 on ERS-1 (European Remote-sensing Satellite), then ATSR-2 on ERS-2 and then AATSR (Advanced ATSR) on ENVISAT. The missions have been operated with good overlaps between successive sensors; AATSR is currently the operational instrument. The fundamental requirement for each ATSR instrument is a design that is capable of delivering absolutely calibrated infrared data; therefore this paper concentrates on how the sensors provide the calibrated radiometric observations required for the SST retrieval algorithms to work. It does not discuss the validation of the algorithms to produce SST derived from these basic observations. Described are the rigorous pre-launch measurements over a range of simulated flight environments which verify that this aim has been achieved, a calibration which exercises the same brightness temperature algorithm that is then used when calibrating in-flight measurements. Crucially, the ATSRs measure calibration source radiances in-flight without interrupting Earth-viewing which permits continuous gain and offset monitoring and calibration. For clarity where it is thought necessary for a data user's better understanding of the calibration for flight data, some detail is provided concerning the differences between the three different ATSRs.

AB Global soil moisture products retrieved from various remote sensing sensors are becoming readily available with a nearly daily temporal resolution. Active and passive microwave sensors are generally considered as the best technologies for retrieving soil moisture from space. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) on-board the Aqua satellite and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the MetOp (Meteorological Operational) satellite are among the sensors most widely used for soil moisture retrieval in the last years. However, due to differences in the spatial resolution, observation depths and measurement uncertainties, validation of satellite data with in situ observations and/or modelled data is not straightforward. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of soil moisture estimations from the ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors is carried out by using observed and modelled soil moisture data over 17 sites located in 4 countries across Europe (Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg). As regards satellite data, products generated by implementing three different algorithms with AMSR-E data are considered: (i) the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, LPRM, (ii) the standard NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) algorithm, and (iii) the Polarization Ratio Index, PRI. For ASCAT the Vienna University of Technology, TUWIEN, change detection algorithm is employed. An exponential filter is applied to approach root-zone soil moisture. Moreover, two different scaling strategies, based respectively on linear regression correction and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) matching, are employed to remove systematic differences between satellite and site-specific soil moisture data. Results are shown in terms of both relative soil moisture values (i.e., between 0 and 1) and anomalies from the climatological expectation.
   Among the three soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E sensor data, for most sites the highest correlation with observed and modelled data is found using the LPRM algorithm. Considering relative soil moisture values for an similar to 5 cm soil layer, the TUWIEN ASCAT product outperforms AMSR-E over all sites in France and central Italy while similar results are obtained in all other regions. Specifically, the average correlation coefficient with observed (modelled) data equals to 0.71 (0.74) and 0.62 (0.72) for ASCAT and AMSR-E-LPRM, respectively. Correlation values increase up to 0.81 (0.81) and 0.69 (0.77) for the two satellite products when exponential filtering and CDF matching approaches are applied. On the other hand, considering the anomalies, correlation values decrease but, more significantly, in this case ASCAT outperforms all the other products for all sites except the Spanish ones. Overall, the reliability of all the satellite soil moisture products was found to decrease with increasing vegetation density and to be in good accordance with previous studies. The results provide an overview of the ASCAT and AMSR-E reliability and robustness over different regions in Europe, thereby highlighting advantages and shortcomings for the effective use of these data sets for operational applications such as flood forecasting and numerical weather prediction.

AB Information on land cover at global and continental scales is critical for addressing a range of ecological, socioeconomic and policy questions. Global land cover maps have evolved rapidly in the last decade, but efforts to evaluate map uncertainties have been limited, especially in remote areas like Northern Eurasia. Northern Eurasia comprises a particularly diverse region covering a wide range of climate zones and ecosystems: from arctic deserts, tundra, boreal forest, and wetlands, to semi-arid steppes and the deserts of Central Asia. In this study, we assessed four of the most recent global land cover datasets: GLC-2000, GLOBCOVER, and the MODIS Collection 4 and Collection 5 Land Cover Product using cross-comparison analyses and Landsat-based reference maps distributed throughout the region. A consistent comparison of these maps was challenging because of disparities in class definitions, thematic detail, and spatial resolution. We found that the choice of sampling unit significantly influenced accuracy estimates, which indicates that comparisons of reported global map accuracies might be misleading. To minimize classification ambiguities, we devised a generalized legend based on dominant life form types (LFT) (tree, shrub, and herbaceous vegetation, barren land and water). LFT served as a necessary common denominator in the analyzed map legends, but significantly decreased the thematic detail. We found significant differences in the spatial representation of LFT's between global maps with high spatial agreement (above 0.8) concentrated in the forest belt of Northern Eurasia and low agreement (below 0.5) concentrated in the northern taiga-tundra zone, and the southern dry lands. Total pixel-level agreement between global maps and six test sites was moderate to fair (overall agreement: 0.67-0.74, Kappa: 0.41-0.52) and increased by 0.09-0.45 when only homogenous land cover types were analyzed. Low map accuracies at our tundra test site confirmed regional disagreements and difficulties of current global maps in accurately mapping shrub and herbaceous vegetation types at the biome borders of Northern Eurasia. In comparison, tree dominated vegetation classes in the forest belt of the region were accurately mapped, but were slightly overestimated (10%-20%), in all maps. Low agreement of global maps in the northern and southern vegetation transition zones of Northern Eurasia is likely to have important implications for global change research, as those areas are vulnerable to both climate and socio-economic changes.

AB Information on vegetation status can be retrieved from satellite observations by modelling and inverting canopy radiative transfer. Agricultural monitoring and yield forecasting could greatly benefit from such techniques by coupling crop growth models with crop specific information through data assimilation. An indicator which would be particularly interesting to obtain from remote sensing is the total surface of photosynthetically active plant tissue, or green area index (GAI). Currently, the major limitation is that the imagery that can be used operationally and economically over large areas with high temporal frequency has a coarse spatial resolution. This paper demonstrates how it is possible to characterise the regional crop specific GAI range along with its temporal dynamic using MODIS imagery by controlling the degree at which the observation footprints of the coarse pixels fall within the crop-specific mask delineating the target. This control is done by modelling the instrument's point spread function and by filtering out less reliable GAI estimations in both the spatial and temporal dimensions using thresholds on 3 variables: pixel purity, observation coverage and view zenith angle. The difference in performance between MODIS and fine spatial resolution to estimate the median GAI of a given crop over a 40 x 40 km study region can be reduced to a RMSE of 0.053 m(2)/m(2). The consistency between fine and coarse spatial resolution GAI estimations suggests a possible instrument synergy whereby the high temporal resolution of MODIS provides the general GAI trajectory and while high spatial resolution can be used to estimate the local GAI spatial heterogeneity.

AB This paper describes a study aimed at quantifying uncertainty in field measurements of vegetation canopy hemispherical conical reflectance factors (HCRF). The use of field spectroradiometers is common for this purpose, but the reliability of such measurements is still in question. In this paper we demonstrate the impact of various measurement uncertainties on vegetation canopy HCRF, using a combined laboratory and field experiment employing three spectroradiometers of the same broad specification (GER 1500). The results show that all three instruments performed similarly in the laboratory when a stable radiance source was measured (NE Delta L<1 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) in the range of 400-1000 nm). In contrast, field-derived standard uncertainties (u=SD of 10 consecutive measurements of the same surface measured in ideal atmospheric conditions) significantly differed from the lab-based uncertainty characterisation for two targets: a control (75% Spectralon panel) and a cropped grassland surface. Results indicated that field measurements made by a single instrument of the vegetation surface were reproducible to within +/- 0.015 HCRF and of the control surface to within +/- 0.006 HCRF (400-1000 nm (+/- 1 sigma)). Field measurements made by all instruments of the vegetation surface were reproducible to within +/- 0.019 HCRF and of the control surface to within +/- 0.008 HCRF (400-1000 nm (+/- 1 sigma)). Statistical analysis revealed that even though the field conditions were carefully controlled and the absolute values of u were small, different instruments yielded significantly different reflectance values for the same target. The results also show that laboratory-derived uncertainty quantities do not present a useful means of quantifying all uncertainties in the field. The paper demonstrates a simple method for u characterisation, using internationally accepted terms, in field scenarios. This provides an experiment-specific measure of u that helps to put measurements in context and forms the basis for comparison with other studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Riverine deltas are hydrologically one of the most active terrestrial bodies supporting an intricate network of rivers, a highly unsteady flow regime, high agricultural productivity and large population centers. Understanding the complex hydrology of riverine deltas is challenging due to the paucity of conventional ground-based measurements on river water levels and flows that result in large spatial and temporal sampling gaps. One way to bridge this sampling issue is to employ hydrodynamic models in combination with remotely-sensed water level elevation data from satellite altimetry in a data assimilation framework. However, a good understanding of the performance of models and altimetry is required beforehand. Using Bangladesh as an example of a complex delta, an inter-comparison study was therefore performed for water level estimates derived from the two methods: 1) satellite altimetry and 2) hydrodynamic-hydrologic modeling framework. The Envisat mission was selected for satellite altimetry-based water level data. For the modeling framework, a calibrated 1-D hydrodynamic model, HEC-RAS, was set up for the major rivers of Bangladesh using in-situ river bathymetry, gaged stream flow and water level data. Envisat water level estimates were generally found to be exceeded by the model-based values by 0.20 m and 1.90 m for Monsoon and dry seasons, respectively. In general, the average RMSE between Envisat and modeled estimates is more than 2.0 m. The closest agreement with altimetry was observed during the high flow Monsoon season over the Brahmaputra river. Envisat estimates are found to disagree most with model-based estimates for small to medium-sized river basins that are mountainous and flashy. This inter-comparison study provides preliminary guidance on the relative weights to assign for each type of estimate when designing a data assimilation scheme for optimal water level prediction in ungaged basins.

AB Maps of burned area have been obtained from an automatic algorithm applied to a multitemporal series of Landsat TM/ETM+ images in two Mediterranean sites. The proposed algorithm is based on two phases: the first one intends to detect the more severely burned areas and minimize commission errors. The second phase improves burned patches delimitation using a hybrid contextual algorithm based on logistic regression analysis, and tries to minimize omission errors. The algorithm was calibrated using six study sites and it was validated for the whole territory of Portugal (89,000 km(2)) and for Southern California (70,000 km(2)). In the validation exercise, 65 TM/ETM+ scenes for Portugal and 35 for California were used, all from the 2003 fire season. A good agreement with the official burned area perimeters was shown, with kappa values close to 0.85 and low omission and commission errors (< 16.5%). The proposed algorithm could be operationally used for historical mapping of burned areas from Landsat images, as well as from future medium resolution sensors, providing they acquire images in two bands of the Short Wave Infrared (1.5-2.2 mu m).

AB Because of the importance of rice for the global food security and because of the role of inundated paddy fields in greenhouse gases emissions, monitoring the rice production world-wide has become a challenging issue for the coming years. Local rice mapping methods have been developed previously in many studies by using the temporal change of the backscatter from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) co-polarized data. The studies indicated in particular the need of a high observation frequency. In the past, the operational use of these methods has been limited by the small coverage and the poor acquisition frequency of the available data (ERS-1/2, Radarsat-1). In this paper, the method is adapted for the first time to map rice at large scale, by using wide-swath images of the Advanced SAR (ASAR) instrument onboard ENVISAT. To increase the observation frequency, data from different satellite tracks are combined. The detection of rice fields is achieved by exploiting the high backscatter increase at the beginning of the growing cycle, which allows the production of rice maps early in the season (in the first 50 days). The method is tested in the Mekong delta in Vietnam. The mapping results are compared to existing rice maps in the An Giang province, with a good agreement (higher than 81%). The rice planted areas are retrieved from the maps and successfully validated with the official statistics available at each province (R(2)=0.92). These results show that the method is useful for large scale early mapping of rice areas, using current and future C band wide-swath SAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we analyze the differences obtained in the atmospheric correction of optical imagery covering bands located in the Visible and Near Infra-Red (VNIR), Short-Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) and Themal-lnfrared (TIR) spectral regions when atmospheric profiles extracted from different sources are used. In particular, three sensors were used, Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat5 Thematic Mapper (TM), whereas four atmospheric profiles sources were considered: i) local soundings launched near the sensor overpass time, ii) Moderate Resolution Radiometer (MODIS) atmospheric profiles product (MOD07), iii) Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) generated by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and iv) Modified Atmospheric Profiles from Reanalysis Information (MAPRI), which includes data from NCEP and National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis project but interpolated to 34 atmospheric levels and resampled to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. MODIS aerosol product (MOD04) was also used to extract Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) values at 550 nm. Analysis was performed for three test dates (12th July 2003, 18th July 2004 and 13th July 2005) over an agricultural area in Spain. Results showed that air temperature vertical profiles were similar for the four sources, whereas dew point temperature profiles showed significant differences at some particular levels. Atmospheric profiles were used as input to MODTRAN4 radiative transfer code in order to compute atmospheric parameters involved in atmospheric correction, with the aim of retrieving surface reflectances in the case of VNIR and SWIR regions, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the case of the TIR region. For the VNIR and SWIR region, significant differences depending on the atmospheric profile used were not found, particularly in the Visible region in which the AOT content is the main parameter involved in the atmospheric correction. In the case of TIR, differences depending on the atmospheric profile used were appreciable, since in this case the main parameter involved in the atmospheric correction is the water vapor content, which depends on the vertical profile. In terms of LST retrieval from ASTER data (2004 test case), all profiles provided satisfactory results compared to the ones obtained when using a local sounding, with errors of 0.3 K for ACPC and MAPRI cases and 0.7 K for MOD07. When retrieving LST from TM data (2005 test case), errors for MOD07 and MAPRI were 0.6 and 0.9 K respectively, whereas ACPC provided an error of 2 K. The results presented in this paper show that the different atmospheric profile sources are useful for accurate atmospheric correction when local soundings are not available. In particular, MODO7 product provides atmospheric information at the highest spatial resolution, 5 km, although its use is limited from 2000 to present, whereas MAPRI provides historical information from 1970 to present, but at lower spatial resolution.

AB Aircraft eddy covariance technique is a modern and powerful means to directly measure net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over relatively large land areas. The NEE measurements taken by a specifically developed aircraft platform (Sky Arrow ERA) over a transect in Central Italy during an 18-month period are used to validate a recently proposed modeling strategy. The strategy is based on the integration of the outputs from a NDVI-driven parametric model, C-Fix, and a model of ecosystem processes, BIOME-BGC, and can simulate both gross and net land carbon fluxes over different spatial and temporal scales. The application of this strategy to 1-km resolution ground and remotely sensed data descriptive of the study area enables the production of NEE estimates comparable to the aircraft measurements. The agreement between the two data series is high, especially when averaging the modeling outputs over areas consistent with the Sky Arrow footprint (i.e. 1-2 pixels apart from the flight line). Fractional forest cover and NDVI are the two model driving variables which explain most spatial variability of the aircraft NEE measurements. The modeling strategy yields the best performances for spring-summer seasons, when vegetation photosynthetic and respiratory processes are higher and easier to simulate. These performances are finally commented with specific emphasis on the contribution brought by remote sensing information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land cover change can be assessed from ground measurements or remotely sensed data. As regards remotely sensed data, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) parameter, the presence of atmospherically contaminated data in the time series introduces some noise that may blur the change analysis. Several methods have already been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series, although most methods have been dedicated to reconstruction of acquired time series, while publicly available databases are usually composited over time. This paper presents the IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction) method, a new method designed to approximate the upper envelope of the NDVI time series while conserving as much as possible of the original data. This method is compared quantitatively to two previously applied methods to NDVI time series over different land cover classes. The IDR method provides the best profile reconstruction in most cases. Nevertheless, the IDR method tends to overestimate low NDVI values when high rates of change are present, although this effect can be lowered with shorter compositing periods. This method could also be applied to data before compositing, as well as to reconstruct time series for other biophysical parameters such as land surface temperature. as long as atmospheric contamination affects these parameters negatively.

AB An important bio-indicator of actual plant health status, the foliar content of chlorophyll a and b (Cab), can be estimated using imaging spectroscopy. For forest canopies, however, the relationship between the spectral response and leaf chemistry is confounded by factors such as background (e.g. understory), canopy structure, and the presence of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV, e.g. woody elements)-particularly the appreciable amounts of standing and fallen dead wood found in older forests. We present a sensitivity analysis for the estimation of chlorophyll content in woody coniferous canopies using radiative transfer modeling, and use the modeled top-of-canopy reflectance data to analyze the contribution of woody elements, leaf area index (LAI), and crown cover (CC) to the retrieval of foliar Cab content. The radiative transfer model used comprises two linked submodels: one at leaf level (PROSPECT) and one at canopy level (FLIGHT). This generated bidirectional reflectance data according to the band settings of the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) from which chlorophyll indices were calculated. Most of the chlorophyll indices outperformed single wavelengths in predicting Cab content at canopy level, with best results obtained by the Maccioni index ([R-780 - R-710]/[R-780 - R-680]). We demonstrate the performance of this index with respect to structural information on three distinct coniferous forest types (young, early mature and old-growth stands). The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to variation in canopy chlorophyll content is best captured for stands with medium dense canopies. However, the strength of the up-scaled Cab signal weakens with increasing crown NPV scattering elements, especially when crown cover exceeds 30%. LAI exerts the least perturbations. We conclude that the spectral influence of woody elements is an important variable that should be considered in radiative transfer approaches when retrieving foliar pigment estimates in heterogeneous stands, particularly if the stands are partly defoliated or long-lived.

AB Areas of similar ecology are often delineated based on homogenous topography, temperature, and land cover. Once delineated, these zones become the basis for a wide variety of scientific research and management activities. For instance, in Canada, ecozones are commonly utilized ecological management units delineated using geographic, topographic, and climatic information aided by spring and summer vegetation conditions. Snow cover has an influence on local and regional hydrological conditions and climate, as well as on animal habitats. As such, we posit that inclusion of winter conditions, incorporating spatial- and temporal-variation in snow cover is an additional element for consideration when delineating areas with homogenous conditions. In our analysis we use satellite passive microwave brightness temperatures from 19 years of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) measurements to produce a daily time-series on snow cover, and demonstrate how these data can be used to delineate areas of similar winter conditions. We use splines and curve fitting to generalize the dense time-series (of over 6900 days) to a set of metrics, and select three for use in cluster-based generalization of snow cover regimes: annual maximum difference between 37 and 19 GHz SSM/I measurements (with differences in magnitudes indicative of snow accumulation), variation of 37-19 GHz brightness temperatures (indicative of snow cover variability), and variation in the rate of brightness temperature change during the snow melt season (indicative of seasonal change). Our results indicate that these metrics produce spatial units that are unique, and not captured by conventional ecological management units, while also producing spatial units that cohere to those generated from summer conditions. Spatial units that are found to have spatial cohesion between summer and winter data sources are located in regions where the amount of snow tends to be low, and snow cover variability minimal. We propose that snow cover regimes may be used to augment typical vegetation-based ecological zonations or to provide insights on hydrology and animal habitat conditions. Inclusion of winter conditions is especially important when areal delineations are used to monitor impacts of climate change, and as a baseline for monitoring changes in snow cover amount, extent, and/or distribution.

AB We developed an algorithm to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from dense vegetation covered area from the first principle of surface energy balance model by using satellite retrieved Microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI). This algorithm can be used under both clear sky and cloudy sky conditions. Long term seasonal trend of EDVI is linked to variance of canopy resistance due to the interrelationship among leaf development, environmental condition and microwave radiation. Short term changes of EDVI caused by synoptic scale weather variations is used to parameterize the responds of vegetation resistance to the quick changes of environmental factors including water vapor deficit, water potential and others. The performance of this algorithm was test at the Harvard forest site by using satellite measurements from the SSM/I F13 and F14 sensors. Validation at the site with 169 samples shows that the correlation coefficient (R-2) between estimated and observed ETs is 0.83 with a mean bias of 3.31 Wm(-2) and a standard deviation of 79.63 Wm(-2). The overall uncertainty of our ET retrieval is similar to 30%, which is within the uncertainty of current ground based ET measurements. Furthermore, the estimated Er in different local times (up to 4 times per day) successfully captured the diurnal cycle of ET It is the first time that the diurnal variations of vegetation-atmosphere interactions were directly monitored from space. This study demonstrates that the technique reported here extends the current satellite capability of vegetation property and ET flux remote sensing from daytime, clearsky conditions to day and night times and from intermediate leaf area index (LAI) to all range of vegetation states.

AB This paper reviews developments in the science of field spectroscopy, focusing on the last twenty years in particular. During this period field spectroscopy has become established as an important technique for characterising the reflectance of natural surfaces in situ, for supporting the vicarious calibration of airborne and satellite sensors, and for providing a means of scaling-up measurements from small areas (e.g. leaves, rocks) to composite scenes (e.g. vegetation canopies), and ultimately to pixels. This paper describes the physical basis of the subject and evaluates the different methods and instruments which have been employed across a range of studies. ne development and use of field goniometers is described, and related to methods for estimating the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from directional reflectance measurements in the field. The paper also considers the practical aspects of field spectroscopy, and identifies a number of factors affecting the useability of field spectroradiometers, including the weight and cost of the instruments, limitations of some commonly used methodologies and practical issues such as the legibility of displays and limited battery life. The prospects for the future of field spectroscopy are considered in relation to the increasingly important contribution that field spectral data will make to EO-based global measurement and monitoring systems, specifically through their assimilation into numerical models. However, for this to be achieved it is essential that the data are of high quality, with stated levels of accuracy and uncertainty, and that common protocols are developed and maintained to ensure the long-term value of field spectroscopic data. The importance of employing a precise terminology for describing the geometric configuration of measurements is highlighted in relation to issues of repeatability and reproducibility. Through such refinements in methodology, field spectroscopy will establish its credentials as a reliable method of environmental measurement, underpinning quantitative Earth observation and its applications in the environmental and Earth sciences.

AB Tree species identification is important for a variety of natural resource management and monitoring activities including riparian buffer characterization, wildfire risk assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and wildlife habitat assessment. Intensity data recorded for each laser point in a LIDAR system is related to the spectral reflectance of the target material and thus may be useful for differentiating materials and ultimately tree species. The aim of this study is to test if LIDAR intensity data can be used to differentiate tree species. Leaf-off and leaf-on LIDAR data were obtained in the Washington Park Arboretum, Seattle, Washington, USA. Field work was conducted to measure tree locations, tree species and heights, crown base heights, and crown diameters of individual trees for eight broadleaved species and seven coniferous species. LIDAR points from individual trees were identified using the field-measured tree location. Points from adjacent trees within a crown were excluded using a procedure to separate crown overlap. Mean intensity values of laser returns within individual tree crowns were compared between species. We found that the intensity values for different species were related not only to reflective properties of the vegetation, but also to a presence or absence of foliage and the arrangement of foliage and branches within individual tree crowns. The classification results for broadleaved and coniferous species using linear discriminant function with a cross validation suggests that the classification rate was higher using leaf-off data (83.4%) than using leaf-on data (73.1%), with highest (90.6%) when combining these two LIDAR data sets. The result also indicates that different ranges of intensity values between two LIDAR datasets didn't affect the result of discriminant functions. Overall results indicate that some species and species groups can be differentiated using LIDAR intensity data and implies the potential of combining two LIDAR datasets for one study.

AB Canada's national parks system includes 43 terrestrial parks covering 3% (276,275 km(2)) of the country's landmass and representing its full range of natural regions. Considering the vast and often remote areas under protection, Parks Canada Agency envisions Earth Observation technology to be the basis for a Park Ecological Integrity Observing System (Park-EIOS), and integral component of a larger national parks ecological integrity (EI) monitoring program. Park-EIOS is planned for operational use beginning in 2008 and includes coarse filter El indicators corresponding to landscape pattern, succession and retrogression, net primary productivity, and focal species distributions within parks and their surrounding greater park ecosystems. A primary input to produce all four indicators is a time series of land cover information derived from medium (similar to 30 m) resolution, Landsat-class sensors. This paper describes a generic, end-to-end change detection framework developed for Park-EIOS, labelled Automated Multi-temporal Updating through Signature Extension (AMUSE). AMUSE involves radiometric normalization steps, production of a baseline land cover, change vector analysis to identify changed pixels, and a new constrained signature extension approach to update the land cover of changed areas. We present the method and results applied to six pilot parks using time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery from 1985-2005. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since the establishment of the first national park (Yellowstone National Park in 1872) and the first wildlife refuge (Pelican Island in 1903), dramatic changes have occurred in both ecological and cultural landscapes across the U.S. The ability of these protected areas to maintain current levels of biodiversity depend, at least in part, on the integrity of the surrounding landscape. Our objective was to quantify and compare the extent and pattern of natural land cover, risk of conversion, and relationships with demographic and economic variables in counties near National Park Service units and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges with those counties distant from either type of protected area in the coterminous United States. Our results indicate that landscapes in counties within 10 km of both parks and refuges and those within 10 km of just parks were more natural, more intact, and more protected than those in counties within 10 km of just refuges and counties greater than 10 km from either protected area system. However, they also had greater human population density and change in population, indicating potential conversion risk since the percent of landscape protected averaged <5% in both groups and human population dynamics are primary drivers of change in many landscapes. Conversion outweighed protection by at least two times (Conservation Risk Index >2) in 76% of counties near both parks and refuges, 81% of counties near just parks, 91% of counties near just refuges, and 93% of distant counties. Thirteen percent of counties in the coterminous U.S. had moderate to high amounts of natural land cover (>60%), low protection (<20%), and the greatest change in population (>20%). Although these areas are not the most critically endangered, they represent the greatest conservation opportunity, need, and urgency. Our approach is based on national level metrics that are simple, general, informative, and can be understood by broad audiences and by policy makers and managers to assess the health of lands surrounding parks and refuges. Regular monitoring of these metrics with satellite data products in counties surrounding protected areas provides a consistent, national level assessment of management opportunities and potentially adverse changes on adjacent lands.

AB Bryophytes are the dominant ground cover vegetation layer in many boreal forests and in some of these forests the net primary production of bryophytes exceeds the overstory. Therefore it is necessary to quantify their spatial coverage and species composition in boreal forests to improve boreal forest carbon budget estimates. We present results from a small exploratory test using airborne lidar and multispectral remote sensing data to estimate the percentage of ground cover for mosses in a boreal black spruce forest in Manitoba, Canada. Multiple linear regression was used to fit models that combined spectral reflectance data from CASI and indices computed from the SLICER canopy height profile. Three models explained 63-79% of the measured variation of feathermoss cover while three models explained 69-92% of the measured variation of sphagnum cover. Root mean square errors ranged from 3-15% when predicting feathermoss, sphagnum, and total moss ground cover. The results from this case study warrant further testing for a wider range of boreal forest types and geographic regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The recent release of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001, which represents the nation's land cover status based on a nominal date of 2001, is widely used as a baseline for national land cover conditions. To enable the updating of this land cover information in a consistent and continuous manner, a prototype method was developed to update land cover by an individual Landsat path and row. This method updates NLCD 2001 to a nominal date of 2006 by using both Landsat imagery and data from NLCD 2001 as the baseline. Pairs of Landsat scenes in the same season in 2001 and 2006 were acquired according to satellite paths and rows and normalized to allow calculation of change vectors between the two dates. Conservative thresholds based on Anderson Level I land cover classes were used to segregate the change vectors and determine areas of change and no-change. Once change areas had been identified, land cover classifications at the full NLCD resolution for 2006 areas of change were completed by sampling from NLCD 2001 in unchanged areas. Methods were developed and tested across five Landsat path/row study sites that contain several metropolitan areas including Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Jackson, Mississippi: and Manchester, New Hampshire. Results from the five study areas show that the vast majority of land cover change was captured and updated with overall land cover classification accuracies of 78.32%, 87.5%, 88.57%. 78.36%, and 83.33% for these areas. The method optimizes mapping efficiency and has the potential to provide users a flexible method to generate updated land cover at national and regional scales by using NLCD 2001 as the baseline.

AB This paper describes the development and testing of a procedure which combines remotely sensed and ancillary data to monitor forest productivity in Italy. The procedure is based on a straightforward parametric model (C-Fix) that uses the relationship between the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies (fAPAR) and relevant gross primary productivity (GPP). Estimates of forest fAPAR are derived from Spot-VGT NDVI images and are combined with spatially consistent data layers obtained by the elaboration of ground meteorological measurements. The original version of C-Fix is first applied to estimate monthly GPP of Italian forests during eight years (1999-2006). Next, a modification of the model is proposed in order to simulate the short-term effect of summer water stress more efficiently. The accuracy of the original and modified C-Fix versions is evaluated by comparison with GPP data taken at eight Italian eddy covariance flux tower sites. The experimental results confirm the capacity of C-Fix to monitor national forest GPP patterns and indicate the utility of considering the short-term effect of water stress during Mediterranean dry months.

AB The AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of instruments has frequently been used for vegetation studies. The 25+ year record has enabled important time-series studies. Many applications use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), or derivatives of it, as their operational variable. However, most AVHRR datasets have incomplete atmospheric correction, because of which there is considerable, but largely unknown, uncertainty in the significance of differences in NDVI and other short wave observations from AVHRR instruments.
   The purpose of this study was to gain better understanding of the impact of incomplete or lack of atmospheric correction in widely-used, publicly available processed AVHRR-NDVI long-term datasets. This was accomplished by comparison with atmospherically corrected AVHRR data at AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sunphotometer sites in 1999. The datasets included in this study are: TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) that is with no atmospheric correction; PAL (Pathfinder AVHRR Land); and an early version of the new LTDR (Long Term Data Record) NOW The other publicly available clatasets like GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping studies) and GVI (Global Vegetation Index) have atmospheric error budget similar to that of TOA, because no atmospheric correction is used in either processing stream. Of the three clatasets, LTDR was found to have least errors (accuracy = 0.0064 to -0.024, precision = 0.02 to 0.037 for clear and average atmospheric conditions) followed by PAL (accuracy = -0.145 to -0.035, precision = 0.0606 to 0.0418), and TOA (accuracy = -0.0791 to -0.112, precision = 0.0613 to 0.0684). It was also observed that temporal maximum value compositing technique does not cause significant improvement of precision in regions experiencing persistently high AOT (Aerosol Optical Thickness).

AB This work extends the previous study of Trishchenko et al. [Trishchenko, A. R, Cihlar, J., & Li, Z. (2002). Effects of spectral response function on Surface reflectance and NDVI measured with moderate resolution satellite sensors, Remote Sensing of Environment 81 (1),1-18] that analyzed the spectral response function (SRF) effect for the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the NOAA satellites NOAA-6 to NOAA-16 as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the VEGETATION sensor (VGT) and the Global Imager (GLI). The developed approach is now applied to cover three new AVHRR sensors launched in recent years on NOAA-17,18, and METOP-A platforms. As in the previous study, the results are provided relative to the reference sensor AVHRR NOAA-9. The differences in reflectance among these three radiometers relative to the AVHRR NOAA-9 are similar to each other and range from -0.015 to 0.015 (-20% to +2% relative) for visible (red) channel, and from -0.03 to 0.02 (-5% to 5%) for the near infrared (NIR) channel. The absolute change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) ranged from -0.03 to +0.06. Due to systematic biases of the visible channels toward smaller values and the NIR channels toward slightly larger values, the overall systematic biases for NDVI are positive. The polynomial approximations are provided for the bulk spectral correction with respect to the AVHRR NOAA-9 for consistency with previous study. Analysis was also conducted for the SRF effect only among the AVHRR-3 type of radiometer on NOAA-15,16,17,18 and METOP-A using AVHRR NOAA-18 as a reference. The results show more consistency between sensors with typical correction being under 5% (or 0.01 in absolute values). The AVHRR METOP-A reveals the most different behavior among the AVHRR-3 group with generally positive bias for visible channel (up to +5%, relative), slightly negative bias for the NIR channel (1%-2% relative), and negative NOVI bias (-0.02 to +0.005). Polynomial corrections are also suggested for normalization of AVHRR on NOAA-15, 16, 17 and METOP-A to AVHRR NOAA-18. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological models are central to understanding the global hydrological and carbon cycles, and need data from Earth Observation to function effectively at regional to global scales. Here, we develop and apply an end-to-end analysis that relates the requirements of ecological models to the capabilities of satellite-sensors, starting with radiometric noise at the instrument, which collects the information, running through to the error on the estimated NPP output from the ecological model. In the process, the input requirements of current ecological models are reviewed. Our aim is to establish a better informed framework for the design and development of future satellite-sensor missions, which meet the needs of ecological modellers. Three mathematical models (PROSPECT, FLIGHT and 6S) are coupled and inverted using a technique based on LUT. The LUT are used to estimate biophysical variables of vegetation canopies from remotely-sensed data observed at the TOA in a number of viewing directions and in several wavebands within the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The five variables considered here are LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), fAPAR, cover fraction and AOT. Different sensor configurations are investigated, in terms of directional and spectral sampling. The retrieval uncertainty is linked with the instrument radiometric accuracy by analysing the impact of different levels of radiometric noise. The parameters retrieved via the inversion are used to drive two LSP models, namely Biome-BGC and JULES. The effects of different sensor configurations and levels of radiometric noise on the NPP estimated are analysed. The system is used to evaluate the sensor characteristics best suited to drive models of boreal forest productivity. The results show that multiangular information improves dramatically the accuracy with which forest canopy properties are estimated. Due to problems of equifinality, the results show a persistence of error even in the presence of zero noise from the sensor, although decreasing the level of radiometric noise from 0.02 to 0.001 reduces error in the estimated NPP by 10% to 25%.

AB The retrieval of photometric properties of desert surfaces is an important first step in the parameterization of land surface components of regional dust emission and global radiation models and in Earth system modeling. In this study, the values of Hapke's photometric parameters (omega, h, b, c, B0, and (theta) over bar) were retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument at locations in China's deserts. Four pixels represented the typical surface characteristics of the Taklimakan Desert, sand dunes of Kumtag Desert, relatively smooth areas of the Kumtag Desert and the aeolian sandy soil of Loulan. In contrast to earlier studies, we found that the retrieved parameter values were largely affected by the initial value. To combat this problem we used a Monte Carlo method with physical constraints and a conformity indicator to ensure physically meaningful inversion.
   The results showed that the angular domain of MISR observations was sufficiently large to determine confidently the values of Hapke's photometric parameters with the exception of the opposition effect width (h). Retrieved values for the single scattering albedo (omega) and macroscopic roughness ((theta) over bar) were consistent with qualitative observations about the structure and composition of the surface material and the nature of the dune forms, respectively. At Loulan, where the surface was smoother than other sites, retrieved values exhibited the strongest backward scattering. These results indicated that at the sensor scale, a rough surface (e.g., dunes) does not necessarily mean more backward scattering than a smooth surface. This finding has significant implications for empirical methods (e.g., using the normalized index of backward-scattered radiance minus forward-scattered radiance as an indicator to indicate surface roughness) which should be used carefully for analyzing surface roughness from remote sensing data. Future research is needed to 1) understand how surface roughness at the sub-pixel scale modifies the angular characteristics of reflectance and to 2) find practical methods for rapid whole image processing for mapping the photometric parameters.

AB Oceanic turbulent flows develop complicated patterns, with eddies, filaments and shear currents. Although usually referred as chaotic, their inner organization is strongly hierarchical: turbulent flows develop cascades, which transfer properties such as energy or scalar density from larger to smaller scales. In this work, we present a novel algorithm based on the cascade and able to fill data gaps in satellite images (particularly, chlorophyll concentration maps). The first step is to show that cascade processes for chlorophyll-a concentration images take a simple, explicit form when an appropriate wavelet (here Battle-Lemarie of order 3) representation is used. A reconstruction algorithm exploiting the cascade structure is then given with a detailed description. We discuss the validity and quality of this algorithm when applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color images. An application to merging data from multiple satellite missions is presented together with a demonstration of the benefit of this algorithm over two other merging methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although the impacts of wetland loss are often felt at regional scales, effective planning and management require a comparative assessment of local needs, costs, and benefits. Satellite remote sensing can provide spatially explicit, synoptic land cover change information to support such an assessment. However, a common challenge in conventional remote sensing change detection is the difficulty of obtaining phenologically and radiometrically comparable data from the start and end of the time period of interest. An alternative approach is to use a prior land cover classification as a surrogate for historic satellite data and to examine the self-consistency of class spectral reflectances in recent imagery. We produced a 30-meter resolution wetland change probability map for the U.S. mid-Atlantic region by applying an outlier detection technique to a base classification provided by the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Outlier-resistant measures - the median and median absolute deviation - were used to represent spectral reflectance characteristics of wetland class populations, and formed the basis for the calculation of a pixel change likelihood index. The individual scene index values were merged into a consistent region-wide map and converted to pixel change probability using a logistic regression calibrated through interpretation of historic and recent aerial photography. The accuracy of a regional change/no-change map produced from the change probabilities was estimated at 89.6%, with a Kappa of 0.779. The change probabilities identify areas for closer inspection of change cause, impact, and mitigation potential. With additional work to resolve confusion resulting from natural spatial heterogeneity and variations in land use, automated updating of NWI maps and estimates of areal rates of wetland change may be possible. We also discuss extensions of the technique to address specific applications such as monitoring marsh degradation due to sea level rise and mapping of invasive species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a key forest structural characteristic that serves as a primary control for exchanges of mass and energy within a vegetated ecosystem. Most previous attempts to estimate LAI from remotely sensed data have relied on empirical relationships between field-measured observations and various spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) derived from optical imagery or the inversion of canopy radiative transfer models. However, as biomass within an ecosystem increases, accurate LAI estimates are difficult to quantify. Here we use lidar data in conjunction with SPOT5-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) to examine the extent to which integration of both lidar and spectral datasets can estimate specific LAI quantities over a broad range of conifer forest stands in the northern Rocky Mountains. Our results show that SPOT5-derived SVIs performed poorly across our study areas, explaining less than 50% of variation in observed LAI, while lidar-only models account for a significant amount of variation across the two study areas located in northern Idaho; the St. Joe Woodlands (R-2=0.86; RMSE=0.76) and the Nez Perce Reservation (R-2=0.69; RMSE=0.61). Further, we found that LAI models derived from lidar metrics were only incrementally improved with the inclusion of SPOT 5-derived SVIs; increases in R-2 ranged from 0.02-0.04, though model RMSE values decreased for most models (0-11.76% decrease). Significant lidar-only models tended to utilize a common set of predictor variables such as canopy percentile heights and percentile height differences, percent canopy cover metrics, and covariates that described lidar height distributional parameters. All integrated lidar-SPOT 5 models included textural measures of the visible wavelengths (e.g. green and red reflectance). Due to the limited amount of LAI model improvement when adding SPOT 5 metrics to lidar data, we conclude that lidar data alone can provide superior estimates of LAI for our study areas.

AB New concepts for river management in northwestern Europe are being developed which aim at both flood protection and nature conservation. As a result, methods are required that assess the effect of management activities on the biodiversity of floodplain ecosystems. In this paper, we show that dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) in combination with regional scale derived remote sensing products can be adopted to assess both current and future ecosystem development and biodiversity status of a complex floodplain ecosystem in the Netherlands. The dynamic vegetation model SMART2-SUMO2 in combination with the nature valuation model NTM3 predicting potential floristic diversity was applied to simulate the biodiversity status of the Millingerwaard floodplain along the river Rhine in the Netherlands. Estimates of net primary production (NPP) derived from airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data were used for validation of the simulated NPP by the DVM at the time of data acquisition in 2004. Imaging spectrometer derived NPP was in good agreement with the SMART2-SUMO2 modeled results. The NTM3 derived nature valuation in 2004 expressed as plant diversity for the floodplain was high and well in agreement with field observations. In a next step, the DVM was re-initialized using imaging spectrometer derived NPP in 2004 and a forecast of plant diversity and biomass development in 2050 was made. A comparison was performed for three pre-defined floodplain management scenarios using a data-assimilation based approach as well as one without. Significant differences in biomass development can be observed between the scenarios. Predicted plant diversity for individual ecosystems in 2050 shows increased variability for forest ecosystems compared to grass ecosystems. This shows that floodplain management should take advantage of spatiotemporal dynamics of the floodplain as a basis for fostering the development of increased biodiversity. The results of this study demonstrate that imaging spectrometer derived products can be used for validation and initialization of DVMs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the accuracy of the operational Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 land product which corresponds to the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The FAPAR value is estimated from daily MERIS spectral measurements acquired at the top-of-atmosphere, using a physically based approach. The products are operationally available at the reduced spatial resolution, i.e. 1.2 km, and can be computed at the full spatial resolution, i.e. at 300 m, from the top-of-atmosphere MERIS data by using the same algorithm. The quality assessment of the MERIS FAPAR products capitalizes on the availability of five years of data acquired globally. The actual validation exercise is performed in two steps including, first, an analysis of the accuracy of the FAPAR algorithm itself with respect to the spectral measurements uncertainties and, second, with a direct comparison of the FAPAR time series against ground-based estimations as well as similar FAPAR products derived from other optical sensor data. The results indicate that the impact of top-of-atmosphere radiance uncertainties on the operational MERIS FAPAR products accuracy is expected to be at about 5-10% and the agreement with the ground-based estimates over different canopy types is achieved within +/- 0.1.

AB An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate canopy reflectance data into an ecosystem model. We demonstrate the use of an augmented state vector approach to enable a canopy reflectance model to be used as a non-linear observation operator. A key feature of data assimilation (DA) schemes, such as the EnKF, is that they incorporate information on uncertainty in both the model and the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state of a system. In addition, estimates of uncertainty in the model outputs (given the observed data) are calculated, which is crucial in assessing the utility of model predictions.
   Results are compared against eddy-covariance observations of CO2 fluxes collected over three years at a pine forest site. The assimilation of 500 in spatial resolution MODIS reflectance data significantly improves estimates of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) from the model, with clear reduction in the resulting uncertainty of estimated fluxes. However, foliar biomass tends to be overestimated compared with measurements. Issues regarding this over-estimate, as well as the various assumptions underlying the assimilation of reflectance data are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An unresolved issue in global soil moisture retrieval using passive microwave sensors is the spatial integration of heterogeneous landscape features to the nominal 50 km footprint observed by most low frequency satellite systems. One of the objectives of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2004 (SMEX04) was to address some aspects of this problem, specifically variability introduced by vegetation, topography and convective precipitation. Other goals included supporting the development of soil moisture data sets that would contribute to understanding the role of the land surface in the concurrent North American Monsoon System. SMEX04 was conducted over two regions: Arizona - semi-arid climate with sparse vegetation and moderate topography, and Sonora (Mexico) - moderate vegetation with strong topographic gradients. The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR/CX) was flown on a Naval Research Lab P-3B aircraft as part of SMEX04 (10 dates of coverage over Arizona and 11 over Sonora). Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) was observed in both PSR and satellite-based (AMSR-E) observations at 6.92 GHz over Arizona, but no detectable RFI was observed over the Sonora domain. The PSR estimated soil moisture was in agreement with the ground-based estimates of soil moisture over both domains. The estimated error over the Sonora domain (SEE=0.021 cm(3)/cm(3)) was higher than over the Arizona domain (SEE=0.014 cm(3)/cm(3)). These results show the possibility of estimating soil moisture in areas of moderate and heterogeneous vegetation and high topographic variability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation fires remain as one of the most important processes governing land use and land cover change in tropical areas. The large area extent of fire prone areas associated with human activities makes satellite remote sensing of active fires a valuable tool to help monitor biomass burning in those regions. However, identification of active fire fronts under optically thick clouds is not possible through passive remote sensing, often resulting in omission errors. Previous analyses of fire activity either ignored the cloud obscuration problem or applied corrections based on the assumption that fire occurrence is not impacted by the presence of clouds. In this study we addressed the cloud obscuration problem in the Brazilian Amazon region using a pixel based probabilistic approach, using information on previous fire occurrence, precipitation and land use. We implemented the methodology using data from the geostationary GOES imager, covering the entire diurnal cycle of fire activity and cloud occurrence. Our assessment of the method indicated that the cloud adjustment reproduced the number of potential fires missed within 1.5% and 5% of the true fire counts on annual and monthly bases respectively. Spatially explicit comparison with high resolution burn scar maps in Acre state showed a reduction of omission error (from 58.3% to 43.7%) and only slight increase of commission error (from 6.4% to 8.8%) compared to uncorrected fire counts. A basin-wide analysis of corrected GOES fire counts during 2005 showed a mean cloud adjustment factor of approximately 11%, ranging from negligible adjustment in the central and western part of the Brazilian Amazon to as high as 50% in parts of Roraima, Para and Mato Grosso.

AB Remote sensing leaf water indices depend on two variables: the relative water content (RWC) of leaf cells, which may serve as an indicator for water deficit stress in plants, and leaf thickness. The measurement of leaf water thickness (LWT) appears to be an experimental method that can be well correlated with leaf water indices. We studied how leaf water indices relate to the LWT in cowpea, bean, and sugarbeet. In all three species, the LWT increased linearly with increasing leaf thickness. The T-1300/T-1450 leaf water index, based on light transmitted through leaves, showed a strong exponential correlation with the LWT as expected from theoretical analysis. However, the R-1300/R-1450 leaf water index, based on light reflected from leaves, exhibited a characteristic logarithmic correlation with the LWT. For both leaf water indices we found only minor differences between the three species examined. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use multi-frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to detect and map buried relic glacier ice and sediments in permafrost. Old aerial photographs 1936-1990 are used to show the origin of a sediment covered ice body, and illustrate how it has been buried. Together with a newly exposed ice/sediment cliff, this serves as excellent ground truthing for the GPR data. Empirical GPR frequency dependent relations are established to quantify the loss of the signal power through the layer of sediment. The loss through ice is in comparison negligible. These relations indicate that the maximum ice pocket detection depth (for this sediment type), with the different GPR systems used, are 90, 150 and 200 ns for the 800, 500 and 200 MHz systems respectively. The electromagnetic (EM) wave velocities calculated from diffractions yield velocities ranging between 0.115-0.135 m/ns for the sediment and 0.15-0.17 m/ns for the ice. With the derived EM wave velocities, these Two-Way-Travel (TWT) times correspond to a depth of similar to 6, 9 and 13 m respectively. This loss cannot be tested for the 200 and 500 MHz systems due to lack of such a deep sediment layer on top of the ice, but is consistent with the 800 MHz data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB An ecotone is a zone of vegetation transition between two communities, often resulting from a natural or anthropogenic environmental gradient. In remotely sensed imagery, an ecotone may appear as an edge, a boundary of mixed pixels or a zone of continuous variation, depending on the spatial scale of the vegetation communities and their transition zone in relation to the spatial resolution of the imagery. Often in image classification, an ecotone is either ignored if it falls within a width of one or two pixels, or part of it may be mapped as a separate vegetation community if it covers an area of several pixel widths. A soft classification method, such as probability mapping, is inherently appealing for mapping vegetation transition. Ideally, the probability of membership each pixel has to each vegetation class corresponds with the proportional composition of vegetation classes per pixel. In this paper we investigate the use of class probability mapping to produce a softened classification of an alpine treeline ecotone in Austria using a SPOT 5 HRG image. Here the transition with altitude is from dense subalpine forest to treeless alpine meadow and herbaceous vegetation. The posterior probabilities from a Maximum Likelihood algorithm are shown to reflect the land-cover composition of mixed pixels in the ecotone. The relationships between the posterior probability of class membership for the two end-member classes of 'scrub and forest' and 'non-forest vegetation' and the percentage ground cover of these vegetation classes (enumerated in 15 quadrats from 1:1500 aerial photographs) were highly significant: r(2)=0.83 and r(2)=0.85 respectively (p<0.001, n=15). We identify thresholds (alpha-cuts) in the posterior probabilities of class membership of 'scrub and forest' and 'non-forest vegetation' to map the alpine treeline ecotone as a transition zone of five intermediate vegetation classes between the end-member communities. In addition, we investigate the representation of the ecotone as a ratio between the posterior probabilities of 'scrub and forest' and 'non-forest vegetation'. This displays the vegetation transition without imposing subjective boundaries, and has greater emphasis on the ecotone transition rather than on the end-member communities. We comment on the fitness for purpose of the different ways investigated for representing the alpine treeline ecotone. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The boreal tree line is expected to advance upwards into the mountains and northwards into the tundra due to global warming. The major objective of this study was to find out if it is possible to use high-resolution airborne laser scanner data to detect very small trees - the pioneers that are pushing the tree line up into the mountains and out onto the tundra. The study was conducted in a sub-alpine/alpine environment in southeast Norway. A total of 342 small trees of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and downy birch with tree heights ranging from 0.11 to 5.20 in were precisely georeferenced and measured in field. Laser data were collected with a pulse density of 7.7 m(-2). Three different terrain models were used to process the airborne laser point cloud in order to assess the effects of different pre-processing parameters on small tree detection. Greater than 91 % of all trees > 1 in tall registered positive laser height values regardless of terrain model. For smaller trees (< 1 m), positive height values were found in 5-73% of the cases, depending on the terrain model considered. For this group of trees, the highest rate of trees with positive height values was found for spruce. The more smoothed the terrain model was, the larger the portion of the trees that had positive laser height values. The accuracy of tree height derived from the laser data indicated a systematic underestimation of true tree height by 0.40 to 1.01 m. The standard deviation for the differences between laser-derived and field-measured tree heights was 0.11-0.73 m Commission errors, i.e., the detection of terrain objects - rocks, hummocks - as trees, increased significantly as terrain smoothing increased. Thus, if no classification of objects into classes like small trees and terrain objects is possible, many non-tree objects with a positive height value cannot be separated from those actually being trees. In a monitoring context, i.e., repeated measurements over time, we argue that most other objects like terrain structures, rocks, and hummocks will remain stable over time while the trees will change as they grow and new trees are established. Thus, this study indicates that, given a high laser pulse density and a certain density of newly established trees, it would be possible to detect a sufficient portion of newly established trees over a 10 years period to claim that tree migration is taking place.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key process in land surface-atmosphere studies. It mainly depends on water availability and incoming solar radiation and then reflects the interactions between surface water processes and climate. In this paper, a methodology for retrieving ET from low spatial resolution remote sensing data is presented. It is based on the evaporative fraction concept, and it has been applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AHVRR) data acquired over the Iberian Peninsula. The methodology does not require other data than the data provided by the satellite and may be applied to areas with almost spatially constant atmospheric conditions and which include wet and dry sub-areas. The comparison with high resolution ET estimation shows a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.4 mm d(-1) which is in agreement with the sensitivity analysis of the method. Finally, the methodology has been applied to temporal NOAA-AVHRR images acquired from 1997 to 2002 in order to analyze the seasonal evolution of the daily ET. The temporal study of the ET values realized in this paper shows that the highest ET values are associated with the higher development crops, while the lowest values are related with lower development or null crop. As a conclusion, it is shown that the ET values obtained with the proposed model evolve according to the variations presented in parameters such as surface temperature or vegetation index.

AB The structure of a forest canopy often reflects its disturbance history. Such signatures of past disturbances or legacies can influence bow the ecosystem functions across broad spatio-temporal scales. The 1938 hurricane and ensuing salvage operations which swept through New England represent the most recent large, infrequent disturbance (LID) in this region. Though devastating (downing similar to 70% of the timber at Harvard Forest), the disturbance was not indiscriminate-, it left behind a heterogeneous landscape comprised of different levels of canopy damage. We analyzed large-footprint LiDAR, from the Prospect Hill tract at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, to assess whether damage to the forest structure from the hurricane and subsequent timber extraction could be discerned after - 65 years. Differences in LiDAR-derived measures of canopy height and vertical diversity were a function of the degree of damage from the 1938 hurricane and the predominant tree species which is, in part, a function of land use history. Higher levels of damage corresponded to slightly shorter canopies with a less even vertical distribution of return from the ground to the top. In addition, differences in canopy topography as revealed by spatial autocorrelation of canopy top heights were found among the damage classes. Less disturbed stands were characterized by lower levels of local autocorrelation for canopy height and higher levels of vertical diversity of LiDAR returns. These differences in canopy structure reveal that the forest tract has not completely recovered from the 1938 LID and salvage regime, which may have implications on arboreal and understory habitat and other ecosystem functions.

AB The Sahel region of Africa has experienced a decrease in rainfall from the early 1960s to mid 1990s. Recent studies have detected an increased in NDVI amplitude and growing season integrated NDVI for the region since 1982. However, these studies have not examined how plant phenology has changed. Phenology examines life cycle events such as bud burst and leaf senescence. Using the software TIMESAT to estimate phenological parameters from the GlMMS AVHRR NDVI dataset, we have found significant positive trends for the length of the growing and end of the growing season for the Soudan and Guinean regions, but significant trends in the Sahel could not be detected. The geographical extent of these trends contrasts with the more northern extent of positive trends of NDVI amplitude and growing season integrated NDVI. Results suggest two types of "greening" trends associated with rainfall change since the drought in the early 1980s. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) data, collected at nine view angles, four bands and six dates by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), were used to characterize the seasonality and viewing geometry effects on the discrimination of five selected physiognomies of a specific Brazilian savanna environment. Spectral-angular profiles for each physiognomy (Seasonal, Dry and Pluvial Forests; Arboreous and Park Savanna) were obtained from nadir-normalized BRY data at each MISR band and date of image acquisition. The maximum likelihood classification technique was applied at each camera and date using a common set of pixels as training samples. A reference map was used as ground truth to obtain the classification accuracy for each physiognomy, view angle and date. Results showed that the surface anisotropy signatures of the savanna physiognomies were not unique and varied with Sun-view geometry and seasonality. Directional effects increased from data collected in the orthogonal plane to those acquired close to the solar principal plane, and with increasing Sun zenith angles. Such effects were also affected by seasonality due to differences in the dynamics of the vegetation response to precipitation, as indicated by the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) values. Dry Forest presented a faster rate of "green-up" in the beginning of the rainy season and more abrupt changes in LAI values earlier in the dry season than the other physiognomies. In relation to the nadir response, the strongest anisotropy was observed in the backward scattering direction and in the red band at large Sun zenith angles. Directional effects were also observed after the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) determination. Classification accuracy of vegetation improved from the rainy to the dry season. The exception was Park Savanna, which was also well discriminated from the other physiognomies in the beginning of the rainy season due to the spectral effects of non-photosynthetic vegetation (dry grass understore) that produced an increase in the red reflectance. In general, classification accuracy of the physiognomies improved also from the forward to the backward scattering direction. The best view angles for classification purposes ranged from 0 degrees (nadir) to -45.6 degrees, and were associated with viewing directions of maximum backscattering at the different dates. In comparison with single view direction results, the use of Anisotropy Index (ANIX) images produced a general decrease in classification accuracy values. Results indicated that off-nadir viewing can improve discrimination and mapping of major physiognomies in the Brazilian savanna environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The response of photosynthetic activity to interannual rainfall variation,, in Africa South of the Sahara is examined using 20 years (1981-2000) of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) AVHRR data. Linear correlations and regressions were computed between annual NDVI and annual rainfall at a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude resolution, based on two gridded precipitation datasets (Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation [CMAP] and Climatic Research Unit [CRU]). The spatial patterns were then examined to detect how they relate to the mean annual rainfall amounts, land-cover types as from the Global Land Cover 2000 data set, soil properties and soil types. Yearly means were computed starting from the beginning of the vegetative year (first month after the minimum of the NDVI mean regime), with a one-month lead for rainfall.
   One third of tropical Africa displays significant (95% c.l.) correlations between interannual NDVI variations and those of rainfall. At continental scale, soil types and soil properties are only minor factors in the overall distribution of the correlations. Mean annual rainfall amounts and land-cover types are much more discriminating. The largest correlations, mostly over 0.60, are distinctly found in semi-arid (200-600 mm annual rainfall) open grassland and cropland areas. The presence of one of these two determinants (semi-aridity, and favourable land-cover type, i.e. open grassland and cropland) in the absence of the other does not systematically result in a significant correlation between rainfall and NDVI. By contrast, NDVI variations are independent from those of rainfall in markedly and environments and in most forest and woodland areas. This results from a low signal-to-noise ratio in the former, and the fact that precipitation is generally not a limiting factor in the latter.
   The marginal response of NDVI to a given increase/decrease in rainfall, as described by the slope of the regression, displays a similar pattern to that of the correlation, with maximum slopes in seim-arid regions, except that a weaker response is noted in more densely populated areas, suggesting an incidence of particular land-use and agricultural practises.
   One-year lag relationships between annual rainfall and NDVI in the next year were also considered. Ten percent of the grid-points show significant correlations, but the spatial patterns remain difficult to interpret. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MULTISOURCE FOREST INVENTORY
AB The k-nearest neighbour estimation method is one of the main tools used in multi-source forest inventories. It is a powerful non-parametric method for which estimates are easy to compute and relatively accurate. One downside of this method is that it lacks an uncertainty measure for predicted values and for areas of an arbitrary size. We present a method to estimate the prediction uncertainty based on the variogram model which derives the necessary formula for the k-nn method. A data application is illustrated for multi-source forest inventory data, and the results are compared at pixel level to the conventional RMSE method. We find that the variogram model-based method which is analytic, is competitive with the RMSE method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE coral reefs; remote sensing; lidar; videography
AB In this study we examined the ability of the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) to discriminate cluster zones of massive stony coral colonies on northern Florida reef tract (NFRT) patch reefs based on their topographic complexity (rugosity). Spatially dense EAARL laser submarine topographic soundings acquired in August 2002 were used to create a 1-m resolution digital rugosity map for adjacent NFRT study areas characterized by patch reefs (Region A) and diverse substratums (Region B). In both regions, sites with lidar-sensed rugosities above 1.2 were imaged by an along-track underwater videography system that incorporated the acquisition of instantaneous GPS positions. Subsequent manual interpretation of videotape segments was performed to identify substratum types that caused elevated lidar-sensed rugosity. Our study determined that massive coral colony formation, modified by subsequent physical and biological processes that breakdown patch reef framework, was the primary source of topographic complexity sensed by the EAARL in the NFRT. Sites recognized by lidar scanning to be topographically complex preferentially occurred around the margins of patch reefs, constituted a minor fraction of the reef system, and usually reflected the presence of massive coral colonies in cluster zones, or their derivatives created by mortality, bioerosion, and physical breakdown.

AB The remote sensing community puts major efforts into calibration and validation of sensors, measurements, and derived products to quantify and reduce uncertainties. Given recent advances in instrument design, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, algorithm development, product development, validation, and delivery, the lack of standardization of reflectance terminology and products becomes a considerable source of error. This article provides full access to the basic concept and definitions of reflectance quantities, as given by Nicodemus et al. [Nicodemus, F.E., Richmond, J.C., Hsia, J.J., Ginsberg, I.W., and Limperis, T. (1977). Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance. In: National Bureau of Standards, US Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. URL: http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div844/facilities/specphoto/pdf/geoConsid.pdf.] and Martonchik et al. [Martonchik, J.V, Bruegge, C.J., and Strahler, A. (2000). A review of reflectance nomenclature used in remote sensing. Remote Sensing Reviews, 19, 9-20.]. Reflectance terms such as BRDF, HDRF, BRF, BHR, DHR, black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and blue-sky albedo are defined, explained, and exemplified, while separating conceptual from measurable quantities. We use selected examples from the peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate that very often the current use of reflectance terminology does not fulfill physical standards and can lead to systematic errors. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of a proper usage of definitions through quantitative comparison of different reflectance products with special emphasis on wavelength dependent effects. Reflectance quantities acquired under hemispherical illumination conditions (i.e., all outdoor measurements) depend not only on the scattering properties of the observed surface, but as well on atmospheric conditions, the object's surroundings, and the topography, with distinct expression of these effects in different wavelengths. We exemplify differences between the hemispherical and directional illumination quantities, based on observations (i.e., MISR), and on reflectance simulations of natural surfaces (i.e., vegetation canopy and snow cover). In order to improve the current situation of frequent ambiguous usage of reflectance terms and quantities, we suggest standardizing the terminology in reflectance product descriptions and that the community carefully utilizes the proposed reflectance terminology in scientific publications.

AB The current operational algorithm used to retrieve aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent over ocean from the solar reflectance bands of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown onboard NOAA polar orbiting satellites was adapted to the corresponding channels of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) flown onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary platform. By examining two specific dust events from 3-5 March and 12-13 October 2004 we show how a detailed description of the dust loading through the diurnal cycle can be obtained. Snapshot comparisons with spatially resolved retrievals from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instruments flown on the Terra and Aqua polar platforms show qualitative agreement with SEVIRI retrievals. In addition to the generic aerosol model used in the NOAA/NESDIS algorithm, which was tuned to optimize retrievals over global ocean, three microphysical models, specifically proposed in the aerosol literature for desert dust, have also been tested. However, comparison of the diurnal variation seen in these SEVIRI retrievals with available ground based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations from two coastal stations suggests that the phase functions associated with two of these dust representations, obtained under the assumption of particle sphericity, result in unrealistic time dependent behaviour. This tendency is removed when either the generic aerosol representation used in the NOAA/NESDIS algorithm is employed, or a more physically based non-spherical dust representation is used.

AB Remote sensing techniques have been seen as valuable and low-cost tools for frequent forest inventory purposes. However, estimation errors of relevant forest structure variables remain too high for operational use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat TM/ETM and SPOT HRV, in temperate forests. Very high spatial resolution images that have been acquired by new commercial satellites, such as IKONOS-2 or QuickBird, are expected to reduce estimation errors to a level that is acceptable by foresters. This study assessed the capability of 1-m resolution IKONOS-2 imagery to estimate the five main forest variables-age, top height, circumference, stand density and basal area-in even-aged common spruce stands. They were estimated on the basis of texture features that were derived from the grey-level 1m-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The coefficients of determination, R-2, of the best models ranged from 0.76 to 0.82 for top height, circumference, stand density and age variables. Basal area was found to be weakly correlated to texture variables (R-2 =0.35). Relative prediction errors of four out of the five studied forest variables were comparable to the usual sampling inventory errors (top height: 10%; circumference: 15%; basal area: 16%; age: 18%), but the stand density estimation error (29%) remained too high for use in forest planning. The sensitivity analysis to the GLCM parameters showed that the most important parameters were the texture feature, the displacement and the window size. The orientation parameter had minimal effects on the R-2 values, even if it influenced the values of the texture features. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Historical surveys and recent satellite imagery are used to map and assess glacier recession in the eastern Pamir over the last three decades. For this study we used topographic maps of 1 : 100000 scales published in 1943 and 1970; air photos from 1978 and 1990; space images: from Russian satellites in 1972, 1978, 1980, and 1990 and ASTER data for 2001. Climatic records from the "Fedtchenko" glacier station (4156 m a.s.l., 38.83 degrees N, 72.22 degrees E) and "Murgab" meteorological station (3576 m a.s.l., 38.17 degrees N, 73.97 degrees E) are used for analysis of the climate conditions in the region.
   Changes in the area of 5 glaciers and terminus positions of 44 glaciers in the eastern Pamir reveal an accelerating trend since the end of the 1970s through 2001, as a continuation of glacier wastage and retreat since, at least, the end of the Little Ice Age. The glacier area decreased 7.8% during 1978-1990, and 11.6% in 1990-2001. This corresponds with documented changes in other mountain and subpolar regions in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically in Central Asia. Glacier changes in the eastern Pamir are a response to increasing summer temperatures. We find decreases in glacier area and retreat of glacier fronts, increased debris-covered area and the appearance of new lakes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Impervious surface has been recognized as a key indicator in assessing urban environments. However, accurate impervious surface extraction is still a challenge. Effectiveness of impervious surface in urban land-use classification has not been well addressed. This paper explored extraction of impervious surface information from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data based on the integration of fraction images from linear spectral mixture analysis and land surface temperature. A new approach for urban land-use classification, based on the combined use of impervious surface and population density, was developed. Five urban land-use classes (i.e., low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-intensity residential areas, and commercial/industrial/transportation uses) were developed in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Results showed that the integration of fraction images and surface temperature provided substantially improved impervious surface image. Accuracy assessment indicated that the rootmean-square error and system error yielded 9.22% and 5.68%, respectively, for the impervious surface image. The overall classification accuracy of 83.78% for five urban land-use classes was obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents first results on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) covering the African continent. With a temporal resolution of 15 min MSG offers complementary information for NDVI monitoring compared to vegetation monitoring based on polar orbiting satellites. The improved temporal resolution has potential implications for accurate NDVI assessment of the African continent; e.g. the increased amount of available scenes are expected to help overcome problems related to cloud cover which makes the MSG data particularly well suited for early warning systems. Time series of 2004 MSG NDVI was compared to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Aqua NDVI for the Dahra site in the Senegalese Sahel, West Africa. It was found that NDVI was available for 82 days with multiple cloud free acquisitions per day during the growing season as compared to 47 days with information from either MODIS Terra or Aqua for that particular site. Differences in MSG SEVIRI and MODIS BRDF on a seasonal scale were found to influence the time series of NDVI for the test site; MSG NDVI being higher than MODIS in July-August and lower in October-November. Preliminary composite analysis suggests that the period of compositing to produce continent scale cloud free products can be reduced to similar to 5 days using MSG NDVI as compared to polar orbiting data. With the availability of diurnal reflectance information the significance of differences between the red and near-infrared wavelengths due to anisotropy become evident, causing diurnal variations in observed NDVI. Diurnal MSG NDVI was compared to in situ measured MSG NDVI at the test site in Senegal and the same "bowl-shaped" diurnal curve was found for a medium dense cover of annual grasses. The range in observed NDVI and time of diurnal minimum was different due to different viewing geometry. Daily minimum of in situ measured NDVI was around solar noon whereas minimum MSG NDVI occurs one hour prior to noon due to the test site location 12 degrees west of the satellite sensor. Diurnal variation in observed NDVI was studied for a number of pixels characterized by different sensor view zenith angles and vegetation types. This analysis illustrated the diurnal NDVI dependency of illumination conditions, view angle and vegetation intensity and pinpoints the importance of proper BRDF modeling to produce daily values of MSG NDVI normalized for acquisition time, which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

AB The analysis of airborne hyperspectral data is often affected by brightness gradients that are caused by directional surface reflectance. For line scanners these gradients Occur in across-track direction and depend on the sensor's view-angle. They are greatest whenever the flight path is perpendicular to the sun-target-observer plane. A common way to correct these gradients is to normalize the reflectance factors to nadir view. This is especially complicated for data from spatially and spectrally heterogeneous urban areas and requires surface type specific models. This paper presents a class-wise empirical approach that is adapted to meet the needs of such images.
   Within this class-wise approach, empirical models are fit to the brightness gradients of spectrally pure pixels from classes after a spectral angle mapping (SAM). Compensation factors resulting from these models are then assigned to all pixels of the image, both in a discrete manner according the SAM and in a weighted manner based on information from the SAM rule images. The latter scheme is designed in consideration of the great number of mixed pixels.
   The method is tested oil data from the Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) that was acquired over Berlin, Germany. It proves superior to a common global approach based on a thorough assessment using a second HyMap image as reference. The weighted assignment of compensation factors is adequate for the correction of areas that are characterized by mixed pixels.
   A remainder of the original brightness gradient cannot be found in the corrected image, which can then be used for any subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses. Thus, the proposed method enables the comparison and composition of airborne data sets with similar recording conditions and does not require additional field or laboratory measurements.

AB The relationship between AVHRR-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values and those of future sensors is critical to continued long-term monitoring of land surface properties. The follow-on operational sensor to the AVHRR, the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), will be very similar to the NASA Earth Observing System's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. NDVI data derived from visible and near-infrared data acquired by the MODIS (Terra and Aqua platforms) and AVHRR (NOAA-16 and NOAA-17) sensors were compared over the same time periods and a variety of land cover classes within the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the 16-day composite NDVI values are quite similar over the composite intervals of 2002 and 2003, and linear relationships exist between the NDVI values from the various sensors. The composite AVHRR NDVI data included water and cloud masks and adjustments for water vapor as did the MODIS NDVI data. When analyzed over a variety of land cover types and composite intervals, the AVHRR derived NDVI data were associated with 89% or more of the variation in the MODIS NDVI values. The results suggest that it may be possible to successfully reprocess historical AVHRR data sets to provide continuity of NDVI products through future sensor systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data collected over 51 georeferenced field sample plots with a size of 232.9 m(2) and 27 large test plots with an average size of 3435 m(2). Laser data were acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off canopy conditions. The plots covered stand conditions from young forest to mature forest. The plots were divided into two categories, i.e., coniferous forest dominated by spruce and pine, and mixed forest with an average proportion of deciduous species of 31-42%. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. In the mixed forest, corresponding metrics derived from the two laser data acquisitions were compared. In general, canopy metrics derived from the last returns were more affected by canopy conditions than the first return data. Furthermore, canopy height measures of the lower and intermediate parts of the canopy were more affected than maximum canopy height, and the variability of the height distribution tended to increase from leaf-on to leaf-off conditions. The coniferous plots were used to demonstrate to what extent canopy properties derived from airborne lasers may be affected by sensor-specific characteristics. The same laser system was used during the two acquisitions, but the repetition frequency was upgraded from 10 to 33 kHz in between the two missions. Comparison of the two acquisitions showed that the first return measurements of canopy height tended to be unaffected or shifted somewhat upwards by system upgrade and ground penetration was reduced, whereas the last return data indicated unaffected or downwards shifted canopy heights and increased penetration.

AB The knowledge of the absorption and scattering characteristics of the ocean supports diverse applications for studying biological and physical processes of marine ecosystems. The determination of the related inherent optical properties from remote sensing is addressed for a site located in the northern Adriatic Sea using coincident SeaWiFS images and field measurements. The proposed methodology first combines regional algorithms to determine the spectra of irradiance reflectance and diffuse attenuation coefficient from the normalized water leaving radiance by accounting for the bidirectional structure of the light field. These spectra are then used as inputs to an inverse model that yields the absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients of seawater (considered without the contribution of pure water). The uncertainties associated with the different steps in the sequence of calculations are quantified and discussed. Specifically, the analysis of 48 match-ups comparing in situ irradiance reflectance with that derived from remote sensing water leaving radiance shows mean absolute differences below 20% between 490 and 555 nm and approximately 30% at 443 and 670 nm. Lower discrepancies are obtained if more stringent criteria for the selection of match-ups are implemented (12-15% and 20-22%, respectively). The results obtained with 42 matchups show a reasonable agreement for the absorption coefficient from 412 to 490 nm (approximately 35%), the scattering coefficient from 443 to 555 nm (approximately 30%), and the attenuation coefficient in the spectral range 412-555 nm (approximately 30%). Based on 17 matchups, the comparison for the backscattering coefficient gives mean absolute differences in the range of 31-53%. The comparison between field and derived scattering properties suggests that the particulate scattering phase function inherent to the inverse model is not appropriate for the site considered. Finally, in the framework of the selected inversion scheme, uncertainties associated with the satellite derived irradiance reflectance in the blue and the determination of K-d at 490 tun through an empirical band ratio algorithm appear as the elements where improvements would be particularly needed to derive high quality spectra of inherent optical properties.

AB Understanding spatial and temporal variation in net primary production (NPP), the amount of carbon fixed into biomass by vegetation, is a central goal of ecosystem ecologists. Optical remote sensing techniques can help address this need by providing accurate, consistent, and reliable approximations of photosynthetic activity at large scales. However, converting photosynthetic activity into NPP requires estimates of light-use efficiency, which has been shown to vary among vegetation types. In this study. we compare remotely sensed estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation with ground-based NPP estimates to determine appropriate light-use efficiency values for grasslands and croplands. We contrast the performance of models with and without information about vegetation type and light-use efficiency downregulation due to unfavorable environmental conditions. Our results suggest that: 1) current models may include overestimates of grassland light-use efficiency; 2) including vegetation information in light-use efficiency calculations causes a dramatically better fit between ground-based and remotely sensed estimates of primary production, and 3) incorporating environmental downregulation to light-use efficiency yields only minor improvements, which may be a result specific to annual estimates in grassland and cropland systems. In addition, this study presents a regional dataset of ground-based primary production estimates that may prove useful for future studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p<0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p<0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p<0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p<0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.

AB Instantaneous PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation), computed from atmospheric parameters from individual images from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms, is combined to derive daily integrated PAR and mapped to a local coordinate system. Compared to field observations, the daily integrated PAR values were shown to have average errors in the order of 5-8%, with individual estimation errors as high as 21%, but monthly averages showed much better correspondence with observations yielding averaged absolute errors of around 5%. The error appears to be mostly related to uncertainties in the MODIS aerosol retrieval accuracy. This accuracy and the medium spatial resolution of the PAR map compare very favourably to other sources of PAR data and make this a useful product in the improved assessment of vegetation dynamics.

AB Studies of caribou herds in northern regions are important to better understand population dynamics and define wildlife management strategies. Lichen is a primary food source for caribou and is a good indicator of caribou herd activity because of its sensitivity to overgrazing and overtrampling, its widespread distribution over northern areas, and its influence on herd demography. In this paper, we used Landsat TM imagery for mapping lichen in the summer range of the George River caribou herd in northern Quebec, Canada. Results from the enhancement-classification method (ECM) and from spectral mixture analysis (SMA) were evaluated for their suitability to characterize lichen land cover and for their potential to be applied over large territories. ECM and SMA are assessed individually and also for potential synergistic use. ECM is based on guided unsupervised classification of enhanced satellite images. Validation based on 3536 pixels from a relatively smaller number of field sites (20) showed an overall accuracy of 74.5% (kappa=0.70) for 10 classes and good discrimination between lichen and nonlichen classes, although we interpret these results with caution due to spatial autocorrelation and nonrandom sampling within field sites. However, discrimination amongst different lichen classes using ECM was more problematic. SMA derives the proportion of individual scene components at subpixel scales. This method provided good results in characterizing variations in lichen abundance validated against field observations and provided additional and new information not provided by ECM which is important since the abundance of lichen as a primary food source is a key indicator of migration and demographic patterns essential for effective wildlife management. We concluded that the ECM and SMA methods are appropriate for different aspects of lichen mapping. ECM provided good discrimination between lichen and nonlichen classes, whereas SMA provided additional lichen information not available by classification yet critical to the environmental application, which is also appropriate for application over much larger areas and in spatiotemporal studies. A synergistic use of SMA and ECM is therefore recommended for future research. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE wildfire; kernel density interpolation; ignition point
ID HOME-RANGE
AB When assessing fire danger, interpolation of the dependent variable-historic fire occurrence-is required in order to statistically compare and analyze it with human factors, environmental parameters and census statistics. To confirm the compatibility between the distinct data types, occasionally, for this kind of spatial analysis, historical observations of the primary wildland fire (given as x and y coordinates) must be transformed either to continuous surfaces or to area data. The simple overlay approach converts single point observations to area data. However, this procedure assumes lack of spatial uncertainties that would otherwise result in serious errors caused by the positional inaccuracies of the original point observations.
   Here, we used kernel density interpolation to convert the original data on wildland fire ignition into an expression of areal units, defined by a raster grid and, subsequently, by the administrative borders of the municipalities in two study areas in Spain. By overlaying a normal bivariate probability density function (kernel) over each point observation, each ignition point was considered an uncertain point location rather than an exact one.

AB Surface-based measurements of aerosol optical depth at a rural site in southern New Hampshire (43.11 degreesN, 70.95 degreesW) are compared to retrievals of the same parameter by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) during April-August, 2001. Hourly averages of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were derived using a multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) at the time of NASA's Terra satellite overpass. The MODIS Level 2 aerosol product at a wavelength of 550 nm was directly compared to the MFRSR interpolated AOD at 550 nm. We were able to compare the two AOD measurement platforms on 46 days (out of a possible 128 days) and observed a good agreement between the two methods (R = 0.81; slope 0.95 +/- 0.10). However, there were I I days during this study period when MODIS measured AOD at the site, but the MFRSR did not due to excessive cloud cover. There were also 7 days when clear skies prevailed at the site during the time of MODIS overpass, but there was no AOD retrieved by MODIS. Surface measurements of fine particle (PM2.5) mass, chemical composition, and optical properties were also performed during summer 2001. A good correlation (R = 0.87) between fine particle mass and AOD measured by the MFRSR was observed. A comparison between fine particle light extinction at the surface and MFRSR AOD (at the same wavelength) also showed good agreement (R = 0.80). Aerosol chemical analysis revealed that ammonium sulfate was the main aerosol component during times of very high turbidity, while organic carbon dominated during times of below-average turbidity.

ID LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION
AB Classification tree analysis (CTA) provides an effective suite of algorithms for classifying remotely sensed data, but it has the limitations of (I) not searching for optimal tree structures and (2) being adversely affected by Outliers, inaccurate training data, and unbalanced data sets. Stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) is a refinement of standard CTA that attempts to minimize these limitations by (1) using classification errors to iteratively refine the trees using a random sample of the training data and (2) combining the multiple trees iteratively developed to classify the data. We compared traditional CTA results to SGB for three remote sensing based data sets, an IKONOS image front the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, a Probe-1 hyperspectral image from the Virginia City mining district of Montana, and a series of Landsat ETM+ images from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). SGB improved the overall accuracy of the IKONOS classification from 84% to 95% and the Probe-1 classification from 83% to 93%. The worst performing classes using CTA exhibited the largest increases in class accuracy using SGB. A slight decrease in overall classification accuracy resulted from the SGB analysis of the Landsat data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture is important information in semiarid rangelands where vegetation growth is heavily dependent on the water availability. Although many studies have been conducted to estimate moisture in bare soil fields with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, little success has been achieved in vegetated areas. The purpose of this study is to extract soil moisture in sparsely to moderately vegetated rangeland surfaces with ERS-2/TM synergy. We developed an approach to first reduce the surface roughness effect by using the temporal differential backscatter coefficient (Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0)). Then an optical/microwave synergistic model was built to simulate the relationship among soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0). With NDVI calculated from TM imagery in wet seasons and Deltasigma(wet-dry)(0) from ERS-2 imagery in wet and dry seasons, we derived the soil moisture maps over desert grass and shrub areas in wet seasons. The results showed that in the semiarid rangeland, radar backscatter was positively correlated to NDVI when soil was dry (m(v) < 10%), and negatively correlated to NDVI when soil moisture was higher (m(v)>10%). The approach developed in this study is valid for sparse to moderate vegetated areas. When the vegetation density is higher (NDVI>0.45), the SAR backscatter is mainly from vegetation layer and therefore the soil moisture estimation is not possible in this study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

ID LANDSAT-TM; CLASSIFICATION; INVENTORY; ALPS; CANADA
AB Automated glacier mapping from satellite multispectral image data is hampered by debris cover on glacier surfaces. Supraglacial debris exhibits the same spectral properties as lateral and terminal moraines, fluvioglacial deposits, and bedrock outside the glacier margin, and is thus not detectable by means of multispectral classification alone. Based on the observation of low slope angles for debris-covered glacier tongues, we developed a multisource method for mapping supraglacial debris. The method combines the advantages of automated multispectral classification for clean glacier ice and vegetation with slope information derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Neighbourhood analysis and change detection is applied for further improvement of the resulting glacier/debris map. A significant percentage of the processing can be done automatically. In order to test the sensitivity of our method against different DEM qualities, it was also applied to a DEM obtained from ASTER stereo data. Additionally, we compared our multisource approach to an artificial neural network (ANN) classification of debris, using only multispectral data. While the cornbination with an ASTER-derived DEM revealed promising results, the ANN classification without DEM data does not. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LAND-COVER; CLASSIFICATION
AB High-resolution imagery from the IKONOS satellite may be useful for many resource management applications. We assessed the utility of IKONOS imagery for applications in the mid-Atlantic region, including mapping of tree cover, impervious surface areas, and riparian buffer zone variables in relation to stream health ratings. We focused on a 1313-km(2) area in central Maryland using precision-georeferenced IKONOS products. We found the IKONOS imagery to be a valuable resource for these applications, and were able to achieve map accuracies comparable to manual aerial photo interpretation. We were also able to use derived data sets for consistent assessments over areas that would be difficult to accomplish with traditional photographic mapping methods. For example, we found that a stream health rating of excellent required no more than 6% impervious cover in the watershed, and at least 65% tree cover in the riparian zone. A rating of good required less than 10% impervious and 60% tree cover. A number of issues associated with application of the IKONOS data arose, however, including logistics of image acquisition related to phenological and atmospheric conditions, shadowing within canopies and between scene elements, and limited spectral discrimination of cover types. Cost per unit area was also a nontrivial consideration for the image data products we used, but allowed us to provide valuable derived products to agencies in support of their planning and regulatory decision-making processes. We report on both the capabilities and limitations of IKONOS imagery for these varied applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The potential of high-resolution IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery for mapping and analysis of land and water resources at local scales in Minnesota is assessed in a series of three applications. The applications and accuracies evaluated include: (1) classification of lake water clarity (r(2)=0.89), (2) mapping of urban impervious surface area (r(2) = 0.98), and (3) aquatic vegetation surveys of emergent and submergent plant groups (80% accuracy). There were several notable findings from these applications. For example, modeling and estimation approaches developed for Landsat TM data for continuous variables such as take water clarity and impervious surface area can be applied to high-resolution satellite data. The rapid delivery of spatial data can be coupled with current GPS and field computer technologies to bring the imagery into the field for cover type validation. We also found several limitations in working with this data type. For example, shadows can influence feature classification and their effects need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, high-resolution satellite data has excellent potential to extend satellite remote sensing beyond what has been possible with aerial photography and Landsat data, and should be of interest to resource managers as a way to create timely and reliable assessments of land and water resources at a local scale.

AB Wetland extent was mapped for the central Amazon region, using mosaicked L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired by the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-L For the wetland portion of the 18 x 8degrees study area, dual-season radar mosaics were used to map inundation extent and vegetation under both low-water and high-water conditions at 100-m resolution, producing the first high-resolution wetlands map for the region. Thematic accuracy of the mapping was assessed using high-resolution digital videography acquired during two aerial surveys of the Brazilian Amazon. A polygon-based segmentation and clustering was used to delineate wetland extent with an accuracy of 95%. A pixel-based classifier was used to map wetland vegetation and flooding state based on backscattering coefficients of two-season class combinations. Producer's accuracy for flooded and nonflooded forest classes ranged from 78% to 91%, with lower accuracy (63-65%) for flooded herbaceous vegetation. Seventeen percent of the study quadrat was occupied by wetlands, which were 96% inundated at high water and 26% inundated at low water. Flooded forest constituted nearly 70% of the entire wetland area at high water, but there are large regional variations in the proportions of wetland habitats. The SAR-based mapping provides a basis for improved estimates of the contribution of wetlands to biogeochemical and hydrological processes in the Amazon basin, a key question in the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia.

AB Numerical analyses of remotely sensed data may valuably contribute to an understanding of the vegetation/land surface interface by pointing out at which scales a given variable displays a high level of spatial variability. Thus, there is a need of methods aimed at classifying many one-dimensional signals, such as airborne laser profiles, on the basis of their spatial structure. The present paper proposes a theoretical framework ensuring a consistent combination of a multi-scale pattern characterization, based on the Haar wavelet variance (also called in ecology Two Terms Local Variance, TTLV), with two multivariate techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. We illustrate our approach by comparing and classifying 257 laser profiles, with a length of 64 measurements (448 m), that were collected by the BRGM in French Guiana over three main landscape units with distinct geomorphological and ecological characteristics. We calculate for each profile a scalogram that summarized the multi-scale pattern and analyze the structural variability of profiles via a typology and a classification of one-dimensional patterns. More than 80% of the variability between spatial patterns of laser profiles has been summarized by two PCA axes, while four classes of spatial patterns were identified by cluster analysis. Each landscape unit was associated with one or two dominant classes of spatial patterns. These results confirmed the ability of the method to extract landscape scaling properties from complex and large sets of remotely sensed data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two neural network algorithms trained by a physical vegetation model are used to retrieve soil moisture and vegetation variables of wheat canopies during the whole crop cycle. The first algorithm retrieves soil moisture using L band, two polarizations and multiangular radiometric data, for each single date of radionietric acquisition. The algorithm includes roughness and vegetation effects, but does not require a priori knowledge of roughness and vegetation parameters for the specific field. The second algorithm retrieves vegetation variables using dual band, V polarization and multiangular radiometric data. This algorithm operates over the whole multitemporal data set. Previously retrieved soil moisture values are also used as a priori information. The algorithms have been tested considering measurements carried out in 1993 and 1996 over wheat fields at the INRA Avignon test site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Medium to low resolution (1 - 50 km) active microwave sensors such as spaceborne scatterometers and wide-swath mode synthetic aperture radars have great potential as tools for long term monitoring over land and ice. To optimise the use of this kind of data, the heterogeneity of the target and its effects on the radar measurements need to be investigated and modelled, particularly in the view of retrieving geophysical parameters. In this paper, wind scatterometer measurements over three different test sites, the NOPEX region in Sweden, the HAPEX-Sahel site in Niger and the Niger delta area in Nigeria, are analysed. For these regions, a forward model is developed by considering the backscatter contributions of the bare surface, the seasonal and evergreen vegetation and the open water areas. Colocated high spatial resolution SAR data and ground information are used to characterise the target scene. The model is then inverted to retrieve monthly soil roughness, dielectric properties and vegetation parameters. It is shown that the measurements contain enough information to characterise these three different regions and to monitor their temporal evolution. The retrieved values obtained for the bare surface and the vegetation parameters are consistent with ground measurements collected in these areas. Further improvements are achieved by incorporating the time scale variability of the variables investigated into the retrieval scheme. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Downscaling of remotely sensed soil moisture with a modified fractal
   interpolation method using contraction mapping and ancillary data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRAIN
AB Previous work showed that remotely sensed soil moisture fields exhibit multiscaling and multifractal behavior varying with the scales of observations and hydrometeorological forcing (Remote Sens. Environ. 81 (2002) 1). Specifically, it was determined that this multiscaling behavior is consistent with the scaling of soil hydraulic properties and vegetation cover, while the multifractal behavior is associated with the temporal evolution of soil moisture fields. Here, we apply these findings by directly incorporating information on the spatial structure of soil texture and vegetation water content to the spatial interpolation of remotely sensed soil moisture data.
   A downscaling model is presented which consists of a modified fractal interpolation method based on contraction mapping. This methodology is different from other fractal interpolation schemes because it generates unique fractal surfaces. It is different from other contraction mapping models because it includes spatially and temporally varying scaling functions as opposed to single-valued scaling factors. The scaling functions are linear combinations of the spatial distributions of ancillary data. The model is demonstrated by downscaling soil moisture fields from 10 to 1 km resolution using remote-sensing data from the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP'97) field experiment.

AB This study focuses on albedo mapping over agricultural surfaces using multidirectional and multispectral remote sensing data. These data were acquired using the airborne PolDER sensor during the Remote Sensing Data Assimilation (ReSeDA) experiment, The data set allowed to perform a validation over the growth cycles of several crops. Problems induced by mixed pixels were reduced since the ground spatial resolution was 20 m. First, linear kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models were used to retrieve the BRDF and then to compute the hemispherical reflectance in the PolDER channels. We tested the four most classical models: Li-Ross, MRPV, Roujean. and Walthall. They presented similar interpolation performances, whereas the quality of the hemispherical reflectance estimates was also driven by the extrapolation performances. Second, the albedo was computed as a linear combination of the waveband hemispherical reflectances. We used several sets of coefficients proposed in the literature for different sensors. The validation of the albedo maps against field measurements showed that it was possible to achieve a relative accuracy about 9% when using an appropriate coefficient set.

AB Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) from Airborne Visible/infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) was used to understand regeneration patterns after fire in two semiarid shrub communities of the Santa Monica Mountains, California: northern mixed chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Two fires were analyzed: the Malibu Topanga fire (3 November 1993) and the Calabasas fire (21 October 1996). SMA was compared to the results of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess vegetation recovery. An unburned control plot (within the past 20 years), having similar environmental features, was used to generate two relative fire regeneration indices, Regeneration Index (RI) and Normalized Regeneration Index (NRI). Indices were calculated using the Green Vegetation (GV) endmember and the NDVI. These indices were determined to be largely independent of AVIRIS radiometric calibration uncertainty, minor errors in the atmospheric correction, topographic distortions. and differences in the phenological state of the vegetation because of interannual or seasonal differences. The temporal evolution of the two fires were combined to produce a longer observation period and used to fit a logarithmic regression model for each Mediterranean shrub community. The NRI developed from the GV endmember (NRIGV) produced the closest estimate for the time of recovery in both communities based on recovery times in the literature. The use of NDVI worked very well for recovery in the northern mixed chaparral, but was less successful in the coastal sage scrub, mainly because of extensive herbaceous cover during the first years of the regeneration process. Endmembers, generated from hyperspectral images were more accurate because they are tuned to capture the greenness of the shrub type of vegetation. Use of matching plots having similar environmental features, but which were burned in different years were demonstrated to improve estimates of the recovery within each community.

AB One of the major issues of cloud parameter retrieval is how to optimize the improved observational capability of new radiometers to retrieve additional information about cloud characteristics. To investigate this problem, we developed a neural network approach for simultaneous retrieval of cloud parameters of inhomogeneous clouds with fractional cloud cover. We defined a simple inverse inhomogeneous cloud model with four parameters: mean optical depth, effective radius, relative cloud inhomogeneity and fractional cloud cover. The retrieval algorithm, based on the use of a mapping neural network (MNN) with two hidden layers, was implemented and tested with synthetic multispectral reflectance data prepared for 2D clouds generated with a modified bounded cascade cloud model. We found that these cloud parameters could be retrieved from the moderate-resolution multispectral reflectance data with reasonable accuracy: for example with our data base, optical depth has a root mean square error of 1.7 for an ensemble of 1000 samples with optical depth up to 30, However. this accuracy depends on measurements errors and noises. A comparison with plan-parallel hypothesis shows the expected improvement of such an inhomogeneous cloud model. We show that the relevance of these cloud parameters is a function of the horizontal scale of averaging due to the net horizontal photon transport to and from adjacent cloud pixels. We tested the inclusion of ancillary data (reflectance of the neighbouring pixels) into the retrieval algorithm, and showed that the use of these ancillary data could partially correct the modeling error and significantly improve the performance of cloud parameter retrieval.

AB A multiseasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data set consisting of live image dates from a single year was used to characterize agricultural and related land cover in the Willamette River Basin (WRB) of western Oregon. Image registration was accomplished using an automated ground control point selection program. Radiometric normalization was performed using a semiautomated approach based on the identification of no-change pixels in forest, urban, and water classes. Reference data were developed using existing data sets, including low-level 35-mm color slide photographs, I:24,000 color airphotos, and ancillary geographic information system (GIS) coverages. Preliminary examination of the data structure included plotting of training set temporal trajectories in spectral space with reference to existing crop calendars. A subsequent stratified, unsupervised classification algorithm, in combination with a geoclimatic rule set and regression analysis, was used to label mapped cells. A map of 20 land cover classes was developed. Classes included agricultural crops and orchards, forest and natural cover types, and urban building densities. An accuracy assessment indicated a final map error of only 26%. The map is now being used to model present and future landscapes for the basin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science inc. All rights reserved.

AB A reflectance-based vicarious calibration (RBVC) method has been used to correct the radiometric coefficients for hyperspectral data obtained with the Probe 1 sensor over the Raglan region of northem Quebec, and to perform a radiance renormalisation for compact airborne spectrographic imager (casi) data obtained over Goose Bay, Labrador. It relies on the simultaneous acquisition of ground-based reflectance spectra for at least one calibration site within the hyperspectral flight line. The RBVC method yields a new set of radiometric coefficients that convert the hyperspectral data from digital numbers (DNs) to radiances, and that are applicable to flight lines taken under different conditions. For both the Raglan and the Goose Bay projects, the calibration site was a gravel airstrip, and ground-based reflectance measurements were made with a GER3700 field spectrometer using a Spectralon panel for reference. This represents a novel use of the RBVC method for validation and correction of the sensor's radiometric calibration at the time of data acquisition, applied in an operational setting that lacks a large, bright and homogeneous calibration tal get and well-characterized atmospheric conditions. Analysis of the errors involved in correcting the radiometric coefficients yielded a total relative error (averaged over wavelength) of 3.9-5.6% on the final reflectance spectra.

TI A semianalytical approach to the calibration of AVIRIS data to
   reflectance over water application in a temperate estuary
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID DERIVATION
AB Calibration of at-sensor radiance to reflectance is a critical step for the use of remotely sensed hyperspectral data of water to determine the concentrations of optically active components. Because water has such a low reflectance, sources of radiance other than the water-leaving radiance contribute significantly to the at-sensor radiance and vary with wavelength and spatially. While radiative transfer models have improved significantly, there are still large uncertainties in prescribing the spatial and spectral properties of aerosol scattering. In addition, errors in the sensor calibration of radiance can lead to additional uncertainty. An atmospheric correction method based entirely on scene information, but not in situ data, is described. This approach accounts for nonuniform aerosol scattering, glint from the water surface, and reflected skylight. Normalization by an estimate of the direct solar irradiance reaching the surface, also derived from scene information, then provides an estimate of reflectance. This method is applied to AVIRIS data acquired over a temperate estuary. The resultant reflectance estimates are shown to be consistent with field observations. While the method is empirical, it is based on physical principles that allow it to be applied under a wide range of conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Soil moisture estimation models using SIR-C SAR data: a case study in
   New Hampshire, USA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The technology of using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for soil moisture estimation has been refined over the last few years. The potential of microwave sensors to estimate soil moisture is well known, and its continuous monitoring on temporal and spatial bases has been realized recently. Several techniques have been developed for retrieving the surface parameters and soil moisture from the radar backscatter. In order to reduce the confounding effects of surface roughness on soil moisture inversion, the application of multifrequency SAR systems have shown promise. The shuttle imaging radar mission C (SIR-C) had an on board SAR system operating at L-, C-, and X-bands for high-resolution imaging of the Earth's surface. Data from SIR-C SAR have been investigated for soil moisture estimation and comparison with in situ data. The models used for soil moisture inversion, viz., (1) the linear regression, (2) the linear statistical inversion, and (3) the neural network models, are presented, and the results of soil moisture estimation using these models are compared. The resulting estimation of soil moisture using the above models is more accurate for the surface soil moisture than subsurface soil moisture estimation, as expected. In general, these models estimate soil moisture within a root mean squared (RMS) error of 3 - 5%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relationships between Airborne Visible. Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) surface reflectance values and constituents (total iron, organic matter, TiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2) of samples representative of three important soil types from central Brazil [Terra Roxa Estruturada (S-TE), Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro (S-LE), and Areia Quartzosa (S-AQ)] were analyzed. End member spectra for green vegetation (GVd), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), water (W), and the three soil types were selected by inspecting scatter plots derived from the principal components analysis (PCA) of 140 AVIRIS bands. They were then used to compose a six end member unmixing model to characterize the spectral reflectance variations associated with the different scene components, the spatial distribution of the soil types, and the effects of spectral mixing on the spectral-chemical composition relationships. Finally, regression equations fitted to soil constituents and their highly correlated spectral bands were used to produce maps showing the chemical variability in the scene for areas dominated by the presence of exposed soils, as indicated by the results from the unmixing model. The results showed a very good agreement between the spatial variability of the soil types and of the soil constituents. The largest squared correlation results were obtained for Fe2O3, TiO2, and Al2O3, but the relationships were affected in the transition from the red to the near-infrared interval by the presence of nonsoil residues (e.g., senescent vegetation or litter) over the soil surfaces. In comparison with the light and loamy sand S-AQ, the dark-red clay S-TE and S-LE presented higher contents of Fe2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2, and consequently lower overall reflectance in the scene, because of the presence of greater amounts of opaque minerals. The prediction of these constituents from remote sensing data and their close association with the spatial distribution of the different soil types demonstrate the importance of the present investigation for soil mapping and soil erosion studies.

TI Spectral signatures of coral reefs: Features from space
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; REFLECTANCE; WATERS
AB The special signatures of coral reefs and related scenes, as they would be measured above the Earth's atmosphere, are calculated using a coupled atmosphere-ocean discrete ordinates radiative transfer model. Actual measured reflectance spectra from field work are used as input data. Four coral species are considered, to survey the natural range of coral reflectance: Montastrea cavernosa, Acropora palmata, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Siderastrea siderea. Four noncoral objects associated with reefs are also considered: sand, coralline algae, green macroalgae, and algal turf. The reflectance spectra as would be measured at the top of the atmosphere are substantially different from the in situ spectra, due to differential attenuation by the water column and, most importantly, by atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. The result is that many of the spectral features that can be used to distinguish coral species from their surroundings or from one another, which have been used successfully with surface or aircraft data, would be obscured in spectral measurements from a spacecraft. However, above the atmosphere, the radiance contrasts between most coral species and most brighter noncoral objects remain noticeable for water column depths up to 20 m. Over many spectral intervals, the reflectance from dark coral under shallow water is smaller than that of deep water. The maximum top-of-atmosphere radiances, and maximum contrasts between scene types, occur between 400 nm and 600 nm. This study supports the conclusions of recent satellite reef mapping exercises, suggesting that coral reef identification should be feasible using satellite remote sensing, but that detailed reef mapping (e.g., species identification) may be more difficult.

AB Relationships found between Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral canopy reflectance measurements at laboratory and field levels with PAM-2000 chlorophyll fluorescence data are presented. This is a continuation of the paper where relationships at the leaf level between leaf reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence were found and demonstrated to the consistent with theory using the Fluorescence-Reflectance-Transmittance (FRT) model. Experiments using the hyperspectral CASI sensor in the laboratory to observe a canopy of maple seedlings are performed as an intermediate step to demonstrate the link between the results at leaf-level and the CASI field canopy levels. Scene observations of the seedling utilizing a long-pass blocking filter showed that apparent canopy reflectance in the laboratory is affected by changes in fluorescence emissions. A laboratory experiment on seedlings on seedlings subjected to diurnally induced change shows the strong link between CASI canopy reflectance optical indices in the 680-690-nm region and Fv/Vm dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence. Stressed and healthy maple seedlings are used to demonstrate the use of optical indices calculated from the 680-690-nm spectral region to track changes in steady-state fluorescence: the curvature index R6832/(R675-691) and the R685/R655 ratio calculated from the canopy reflectance are related to leaf-measured Ft, Fm' and DeltaF/Fm' steady-state features, and are in agreement with theoretical simulations using the leaf Fluorescence-Reflectance-Transmittance model. To test these findings in a field setting, airborne field hyperspectral CASI data of 2-m spatial resolution, 7.5-nm spectral resolution, and 72 channels was used, collected in deployments over 12 sites of Acer saccharum M. in the Algoma Region, Ontario (Canada) in 1997 and 1998. A field sampling campaign was carried out for biochemical contents of leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids, chlorophyll fluorescence, and leaf reflectance and transmittance. Leaf-level relationships obtained between optical indices and physiological indicators were scaled up to canopy level through canopy reflectance models using input model parameters related to the canopy structure and viewing geometry at the time of data acquisition. Results show that scaled-up optical indices in the 680-690-nm region are related to Fv/Fm chlorophyll fluorescence measured in the 20x20-m study sites. Consistency between leaf, laboratory, and field canopy hyperspectral data is shown in this and the previous paper, demonstrating the effect of fluorescence on observations of apparent vegetation reflectance.

AB This study is to investigate the retrievals of the canopy leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure using a canopy model. The data used were obtained by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) with a spatial resolution of 2 m over the flux tower sites in the BOREAS study area in the winter of 1994 and in the summer of 1996. The FLIM (Forest-Light Interaction Model) was adapted to describe the reflectance properties of the boreal forest canopies investigated by considering the effect of the ellipticity of the conifer crowns on shadows and crown transmittance. The LAI and canopy closure images were produced for the flux tower sites investigated from the CASI winter images using the modified FLIM. Visual evaluation shows that the spatial patterns shown in the canopy LAI and canopy closure images are consistent with those exhibited by the color composite CASI images for the same sites. The canopy LAI images were further validated by field-measured LAI along specific transects. The R-2 between the retrieved canopy LAI and the field-measured LAI ranges from 0.51 to 0.86 for the sites investigated. Furthermore, the CASI summer image over the Old Black Spruce site in the BOREAS souther study area (SOBS) was used to investigate the effect of the understory reflectance on the retrieval of the canopy LAI. The R-2 between the field-measured LAI and the retrieved LAI is 0.27, under the assumption that the reflectance is uniform for each understory vegetation in the SOBS site. the R-2 increases to 0.78 when the understory reflectance is allowed to vary within the range of variability as determined by field measurements. This result conforms to the sensitivity analysis result in which the at-canopy reflectance is expressed as a function of the understory reflectance at the CASI viewing geometry. The results imply that it is questionable to assume a uniform understory reflectance in canopy model inversions in the boreal forest summer scenes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Dunes (such as linear dunes oriented in a constant direction), their size, and interdune spacing are very regular in the deserts. Therefore, they manifest a periodic pattern in terms of spatial distribution. There are several modulation transfer functions between SAR images and the actual periodic surface parameters, and the image brightness is sensitive to the local incidence angle. According to previous studies, a linear mapping process can describe these modulation processes. This study proposes an algorithm for estimating the linear dune features including linear dune direction (the prevailing wind direction), interdune spacing, and rms slope and dune height from SAR images. To estimate rms slope, two algorithms were developed, a local incidence angle method and a modulation transfer function method. The linear dune height was then calculated based on the rms slope of the surface. Finally, the obtained results were compared with the truth data from field investigations. The estimated physical quantities did not completely agree with the truth data, and possible error sources are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This study focuses on the development of a consistent methodology for soil-moisture inversion from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with the use of the integral equation model (IEM), developed by A. K. Fung and colleagues, without the need to prescribe time-varying land-surface attributes as constraining parameters. Specifically, the dependence of backscatter coefficients obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the soil dielectric constant, surface-roughness height, and correlation length was investigated. The IEM was used in conjunction with an inversion model to retrieve soil moisture by using multifrequency and multipolarization data (L-, C-, and X-bands) simultaneously. The results were cross validated with gravimetric observations obtained during the Washita '94 field experiment in the Little Washita Watershed, Oklahoma. The average error in the estimated soil moisture was of the order of 3.4%, which is comparable to that expected due to noise in the SAR data. The retrieval algorithm performed very well for low incidence angles and over bare soil fields, and it deteriorated slightly for vegetated areas and overall for very dry soil conditions. Although the original IEM model was developed for bare soil conditions only, one important result of this study was the fact that the retrieval algorithm performed well for vegetated conditions, as demonstrated by the fact that the convergence ratio varied between 92% (dry conditions) and 98% (wet conditions) of all pixels for all days of the experiment. The sensitivity of soil-moisture estimates to spatial aggregation of remote-sensing data before and after the retrieval also was investigated. The results suggest that there is potential to improve the operational utility of high-resolution SAR data for soil-moisture monitoring by compressing the SAR data (pre-aggregation) to a spatial resolution at least one order of magnitude above that of measurement.

AB This article deals with the inversion of reflectance spectra measured in the Rhone River mouth area during a flood event in terms of parameters characterizing the turbid renter components. The optically active constituents considered are the total suspended matter, mainly composed of sediment, of known concentration ranging from 3.7 mg L-1 to 234 mg L-1, and yellow substance. A simple reflectance model is presented. Scattering is treated by Mie theory applied to a collection of particles of real refractive index m(p) and obeying a Jungle size distribution law. A sensitivity study performed on the model shows that both concentration ann refractive index and both cutoff particle diameters of the Junge size distribution law cannot be accurately determined from a given reflectance spectrum. Two model parameters, among a total of six, are estimated from model inversion: m(p) and a parameter characterizing the yellow substance absorption spectrum, a(y0)=a(y) (440 nm). The derived values are realistic as compared to the values that can be found in literature. Other combinations of parameters could be determined by inversion but measurement of m(p) and a(y0) from reflectance spectra already has interesting applications in a satellite remote sensing perspective. Increasing the number of parameters of the model is feasible, but much work is needed to envisage the inverse problem. (C) Elsevier Science Inc.. 1999.

AB This work presents an investigation of the forest information content of spectral vegetation indices including the SR, NDVI, PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI. The re suits were derived from two separate reflectance model including a geometric-optical and a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, assuming nadir viewing. The effects of the atmosphere on the indices were also examined, using the 6S atmospheric code, and a short section is devoted to an analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Overall, the indices were not linear with respect to forest cover and, in many situations, an index did not have a unique value for a given cover The general form of the indices' responses to changes in cover could be explained by shadowing effects, linked to the heterogeneous nature of forest. The indices were also significantly affected by perturbations including solar zenith angle, background reflectance, stand structure, and leaf-area index. The relative importance of these perturbations depended on both the cover and on the particular spectral index tested. Existing indices should be selected according to the characteristics of the site under investigation, since no single index performed well over all covers. At low covers, GEMI performed best, where a decrease in the value of GEMI corresponded to an increase in crown cover. There was some evidence that the soil-adjusted indices (PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI) partially reduced background reflectance effects in the data, although the reductions were not always associated with increased sensitivity to crown;. cover. At high covers, SAVI and TSAVI were found to perform best, since these indices had large dynamic ranges and small susceptibility to atmospheric perturbations. Fur ther work is required to develop spectral indices specifically for conifer forests. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID SELECTION
AB A band selection procedure is applied to 45 AVIRIS hyperspectral images with wavelength range 0.4-2.5 mu m, in order to establish the physical significance of individual spectral bands. Five bands (0.46-0.54 mu m, 0.61-0.69 mu m, 0.99-1.09 mu m, 1.52-1.61 mu m and 2.08-2.17 mu m), which describe 98% of the mean square spectral signal, can discriminate water, snow, fire, vegetation, and a residual class which is principally soil. For the five classes, 20 bands represent all spectra with a mean square residual of 0.1%, which approaches the noise level of the data. Atmospheric water vapor is a major source of variability for soil and vegetation spectra. Spectral bands of 0.99-1.09 mu m, 1.12-1.16 mu m, and 1.20-1.31 mu m are processed in conjunction with field and laboratory spectra and the Lowtran radiative transfer code in order to quantify this effect. Further study is required to characterize properties associated with additional bands. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID REFLECTANCE; MODEL
AB OSAVI is a soil-adjusted vegetation index optimized for agricultural monitoring. The SAIL-SOILSPECT-PROSPECT-KUUSK model was applied to test the sensitivity of OSAVI to a number of observational and environmental parameters, with the constraint that the parameter ranges were chosen to be representative of conditions encountered during operational monitoring by SPOT and Landsat of the U.K. sugar beet crop in the summer months. Within these defined limits, variations in solar and viewing angles introduced no more than 4% systematic (and rectifiable)error in estimation of crop canopy cover while errors associated with atmospheric correction were of a similar magnitude. Although sugar beet has large leaves close to the ground and was expected to generate a large hot spot effect, the effect of ;uncertainty in leaf size appears to be negligible. Leaf angle distribution is effectively accounted for by the use of crop cover as an index of productivity, except when the crop is wilting, but this is unlikely to occur in sugar beet at the time of satellite overpass. Subject to the uncertainties of modeling, the estimation of crop canopy cover within an absolute error of 5% appears to be achievable. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID FIFE; VARIABILITY
AB Images remotely sensed aboard aircraft during FIFE, namely, PBMR (microwave) soil moisture and NS001 thermal infrared surface temperature, were mapped on the same coordinate system covering the 20 km x 20 km experimental site. For both kinds of image data, the frequency distributions were close to symmetric, and the area averages compared reasonably well with the ground based measurements. For any image on any given day, the correlation between the remotely sensed values and collocated ground based measurements over the area was usually high in the case of NS001 surface temperature but low in the case of PBMR soil moisture. On the other hand, fit ally given flux station the correlation between the PBMR and gravimetric soil moisture over all available clays was usually high. The correlation pixel by pixel between images of PBMR on different days was generally high. The preservation of the spatial patterns of soil moisture was also evaluated by considering the correlation station by station between ground-based soil moisture measurements on different days; no persistence of spatial pattern was apparent curing wet periods, but a definite pattern gradually established itself toward the end of each drying episode. The spatial patterns of surface temperature revealed by NS001 were not preserved even within a single day. The cross-correlations among the two kinds of images and the vegetation index NDVI were normally poor. This suggests that different time scales were involved in the different processes of vegetation growth, and of the near-surface soil water and energy budgets. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Different studies have shown that the estimation of the surface temperature from split-window algorithms can be greatly improved by a rough knowledge of the total atmospheric coater vapor. In this article, we have tested the split-window covariance-variance ratio technique to estimate the total columnar water vapor content. This method has been applied over sea surfaces and over land on two databases. The first dataset contains AVHRR/NOAA9 and ATSR-IR/ERS1 data coincident with radio soundings over Europe (land areas). The second one includes ATSR-IR images and water vapor content estimations derived from the microwave radiometer ATSR-MW on board ERS1 over the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The results show the necessity of using two different algorithms: one for land and another for sea pixels because of the effects of surface emissivity. Then, two algorithms have been calibrated and validated The conclusion is that the columnar water vapor content may be estimated from thermal infrared split-window channels with an accuracy better than 0.5 g/cm(2), which is, in most cases, enough to improve surface temperature retrievals with infrared radiometers.

AB Using ESTAR (Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer) passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture data from the Washita'92 experiment, we examine the appropriateness of several probability density functions as a candidate for soil moisture distribution. Although the normal distribution is found to approximate the data well, it is shown that such a distribution cannot capture the inherent spatial structure of soil moisture. We confirm the recent finding that the variance of soil moisture images follows a power law decay and show that such a scaling is valid over a wider range of scabs than previously reported, We also relate the scaling exponent of the variance to highly correlated cluster structure in soil moisture images. Our analysis of scaling for higher-order moments suggests that soil moisture images may not be simple scaling. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB A new segmentation approach that allows forest stands identification on high spatial resolution (less than or equal to 1 m) optical imagery is presented. Texture information rc;as first derived by measuring the range of the semivariogram of monochrome image values in three different directions using a moving window. The semivariogram ranges were then used to predict, on a per-pixel basis, three stand structure parameters through regression equations developed for crown diameter stand density, and crown closure. A region grouping algorithm was applied to these three regression estimate images to identify the limits of the forest stands. Calibration of the prediction equations was made using artificial images created by a geometrical-optical process. It cas found that forest stands boundaries can be adequately identified on artificial images and that average forest structure estimates within each delineated stand are close to the actual values. Preliminary application of the proposed method to real images acquired with the MEIS-II airborne sensor yielded good segmentation and per stand structure estimates. Some errors were generated due to the fact that the moving window sometimes overlapped two different forest stands because of the presence of areas covered by nonforest vegetation or human made structures. The issue of the moving window size and means to increase the precision of the method are discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The objective of this study is to analyze the potential interest of microwave radiometry to monitor coniferous forests. Microwave data were acquired by the airborne multifrequency radiometer PORTOS (5 GHz, 10.6 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 90 GHz) over a test site in Les Landes Forest (France). The test site consists of large homogeneous stands of maritime pines (Pinus pinaster). The stands are monospecies and even-aged and cover a large range of age and biomass conditions (the above-ground dry biomass ranges from 0 to about 180 tons/ha). The stands were flown over twice in May and August 1994. The microwave response to the coniferous stand characteristics is analyzed. A statistical study is carried out to investigate the potential interest of the PORTOS data to discriminate between the different stand categories. The sensitivity of the stand emissivity to view angle, frequency, measurement date, and stand characteristics is analyzed. If is found that the range of forest stand microwave emissivity is relatively narrow for a vegetation coverage exceeding 95%. Although different stand categories can be distinguished from the PORTOS data, the level of discrimination is not sufficient to allow the development of accurate rules of classification. No relationship could be found between low frequency measurements and the stand biovolume. On the other hand, a linear negative relationship is found between emissivity at 10.6 GHz and average tree variables of the stands (age, height, trunk diameter) for well-developed pine stands. Also, potential interest of PORTOS to estimate forest stand characteristics seems to be significant at 90 GHz. For this frequency channel, good correlation is found between emissivity and tree basal area B-A. The results presented in this work contribute to better assess the potential applications of the future ESA/MIMR instrument over coniferous areas. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The surface roughness of alluvial fans in Death Valley, California, changes as the fans age. Because radar backscatter is sensitive to surface roughness, it is possible to map relative surface age using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We have examined surface roughness estimates in Death Valley from Shuttle Imaging Radar-C SAR data with the use of a technique that we call fore ground/background analysis (FBA), with the goal of establishing a robust inversion method that is extendible to a range of surfaces and conditions. In this method, a foreground entity (in this case roughness) is distinguished from complicating background factors (including the distribution of intermediate-scale slopes, vegetation, and dielectric constant). The inversion for roughness is non-unique even when constrained by the use of field measurements. When the range of possible selections is examined it is observed that they fall into a small number of domains, each with distinct characteristics that are probably associated with physical factors such as the scale of roughness. Solutions were compared with those determined from the semiempirical (SEM) and integral equation (IEM) models, and all selections were evaluated with respect to field knowledge. The SEM and IEM solutions, and those obtained using FBA together with the field measurements, fall into a common domain of solutions that are susceptible to contamination by background effects and hence may not be extendible to other geographic locations. A domain of stable solutions that are more extendible does exist; however, this extendibility is achieved at the expense of reduced resolution of roughness levels. For Death Valley, we estimate that it is possible to resolve only four levels of roughness, which is far fewer than can be theoretically resolved with existing inversion algorithms.

AB A four-layer hydrologic model, coupled to a vegetation growth model, has been used to investigate the differences between aerodynamic surface temperature and radiative surface temperature over sparsely vegetated surface. The rationale for the coupling of the two models was to assess the dependency of these differences on changing surface conditions (i.e., growing vegetation). A simulation was carried out for a 3-month period corresponding to a typical growth seasonal cycle of an herbaceous canopy in the Sahel region of West Africa (Goutorbe et al., 1993). The results showed that the ratio of radiative-aerodynamic temperature difference to radiative-air temperature difference was constant for a given day. However, the seasonal trend of this ratio was changing with respect to the leaf area index (LAI). A parameterization involving radiative surface temperature, air temperature, and LAI was then developed to estimate aerodynamic-air temperature gradient, and thus sensible heat flux. This parameterization was validated using data collected over herbaceous site during the Hapex-Sahel experiment. This approach was further advanced by using a radiative transfer model in conjunction with the above models to simulate the temporal behavior of surface reflectances in the visible and the near-infrared spectral bands. The result showed that sensible heat flux can be fairly accurately estimated by combining remotely sensed surface temperature, air temperature, and spectral vegetation index. The result of this study may represent a great opportunity of using remotely sensed data to estimate spatiotemporal variabilities of surface fluxes in arid and semiarid regions.

AB A method for classifying remote sensing data with high spectral dimensionality that combines the techniques of chemistry spectroscopy and pattern recognition is described in this paper. The technique uses an atmospheric adjustment to allow a human operator to identify and label training pixels by visually comparing the remotely sensed spectra to laboratory reflectance spectra. Training pixels for materials without easily identifiable spectra are labeled by traditional means. Linear combinations of the original radiance data are computed that maximize the separability of the classes and classified by a maximum likelihood classifier. No adjustment for the atmosphere or other scene variables is made to the data before classification. This technique is applied to Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data taken over Cuprite, Nevada in 1992, and the results are compared to an, existing geologic map. This technique performed well even for classes with similar spectral features and for classes without absorption features.

AB Goes data are known to be contaminated with stripes whose presence affects the usefulness of the data in quantitative studies.  This article:  1) reviews the causes of the striping; 2) develops frequency domain and spatial domain finite impulse response (FIR) filters for minimizing the stripes in the data while simultaneously introducing minimum distortion into the filtered data; and 3) quantitatively compares the results obtained with these new filtering methods with those produced by traditional destriping methods (e.g., simple smoothing, moment matching, histogram matching).  Results from 81 GOES scenes show that a finite impulse response filter (i.e. target filter), implemented in either the spatial or Fourier domain, is superior to all other methods evaluated.  The importance of proper destriping of GOES data for both accurate cloud detection and radiative flux computations also is demonstrated.  The sensitivity of histogram matching to the choice of reference state is evaluated, and a way to minimize the sensitivity is presented.

AB Accurate cloud detection in satellite data over land is a difficult task complicated by spatially and temporally varying land surface reflectivities and emissivities.  The GOES split-and-merge clustering (GSMC) algorithm for cloud detection in GOES scenes over land provides a computationally efficient, scene specific way to circumvent these difficulties.  The algorithm consists of three steps:  1) a split-and-merge clustering of the input data which segments the scene into its natural grouping; 2) a cluster labeling procedure which uses scene specific adaptive thresholds (as opposed to constant static thresholds) to label the clusters as either cloud or cloud-free land; and 3) a post-processing step which imposes a degree of spatial uniformity on the labeled land and cloud pixels.  An ''a priori'' mask feature also enhances cloud detection in traditionally difficult scenes (e.g., clouds over bright desert).  Results show that the GSMC algorithm is neither regionally nor temporally specific and can be used over a large range of solar altitudes.

AB The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is the intrinsic measure of the directional properties of the Earth's surface. However, it cannot be measured directly by remote sensing. A procedure using the optimum technique is applied to retrieve surface BRDF parameters from multiangle remotely sensed data in which a statistical BRDF model and an analytical model of atmospheric radiative transfer are coupled. The atmospheric model decomposes radiant intensity received by a detector into four parts: scattered only by the (non-Lambertian) surface; singly scattered by the atmosphere; multiply scattered to the surface but unscattered to the detector; and multiply scattered before and after surface scattering. Analytical solutions are derived for the first two. The third is derived from a two-stream model, but incorporates the surface BRDF explicitly. The fourth uses a two-stream model under conditions of azimuthal independence. The six-parameter surface BRDF is modeled as the sum of a modified limacon function, which describes the basic bowl-shape of the BRDF, and a negative exponential, which describes the hotspot. Multiangle observations from the ASAS and PARABOLA instruments are analyzed using the coupled models. Experiments show that the simple statistical BRDF can summarize typical directional observations with errors in the range of 3-10 %.

AB Analysis of change vectors in the multitemporal space, applied to multitemporal local area coverage imagery obtained by the Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer on NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 orbiting platforms, clearly reveals the nature and magnitude of land-cover change in a region of West Africa. The change vector compares the difference in the time-trajectory of a biophysical indicator, such as the normalized difference vegetation index, for two successive time periods, such as hydrological years. In establishing the time-trajectory, the indicator is composited for each pixel in a registered multidate image sequence. The change vector is simply the vector difference between successive time-trajectories, each represented as a vector in a multidimensional measurement space. The length of the change vector indicates the magnitude of the interannual change, while its direction indicates the nature of the change. A principal components analysis of change vectors for a Sudanian-Sahelian region in West Africa shows four major classes of change magnitude and four general contrasting types of change. Scene-specific changes, such as reservoir water level storage changes, are also identified. The technique is easily extended to other biophysical parameters, such as surface temperature, and can incorporate noneuclidean distance measures. Change vector analysis is being developed for application to the land-cover change product to be produced using NASA's Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument, scheduled for flight in 1998 and 2000 on EOS-AM and -PM platforms.

AB We followed diurnal and seasonal changes in physiology and spectral reflectance of leaves throughout the canopies of sunflower plants grown in control, nitrogen (N)-limited, and water-stressed plots. Leaves from control sunflower plants had significantly higher levels of nitrogen, chlorophyll (chl), ribulose bis phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase) activity and photosynthetic rates and lower starch content and leaf thickness than N-limited plants. Water-stressed plants had the highest N and chl contents (on an area basis). They also had the lowest water potential and photosynthetic rates, in spite of maintaining high RuBPCase activities. Leaves from stressed plants (especially N-limited) had significantly higher reflectances in the visible wavelengths and lower in the near IR than leaves from control plants. The only clear trend across canopy levels was the higher reflectance at all wavelengths but especially in the visible of the lower (oldest) leaves. NDVI-like parameters were useful in distinguishing stress and control leaves over the growing season. However, several narrow-band indices provided better physiological information than NDVI. The physiological reflectance index (PRI) (R550 - R530/R550 + R530) followed diurnal changes in xanthophyll pigments and photosynthetic rates Of control and N-limited leaves. The maximum of the first derivative of reflectance in the green (dG) was correlated with diurnal photosynthetic rate, and with seasonal chl and N changes. The normalized pigment chlorophyll ratio Index (NPCI) (R680 - R430/R680 + R430) varied with total pigments/chl. The water band index (WBI) (R970/R902) followed water status. The normalized ratio between the maxima of the first derivatives of reflectances at the red edge and green regions (EGFN) was correlated with chl and N content. Principal components analysis yielded several indicators of physiological status. The first principal component was higher in control leaves, the second was higher in N-limited leaves, and the third was higher in water-limited leaves. Discriminant analysis based on the combination of several narrow-band spectral indices clearly separated leaves into the three treatment groups. These results illustrate the promise of narrow-band spectroradiometry for assessing the physiological state of vegetation.

AB In the mineralized contact aureole of Los Santos, Spain, contact metamorphic grade of rocks and the mineralogical composition of overlying soils correlate systematically. From the exocontact towards the granite intrusion the proportions of kaolinite, illite and free iron in soils increase, while the proportions of chlorite and smectite decrease. Laboratory reflectance spectra of soil samples demonstrate that with the increase of the proportion of kaolinite, illite, and free iron and the decrease of chlorite, ratios of Band 2 / Band 3, Band 2 / Band 5, and Band 2 / Band 7 decrease while ratios of Band 3/Band 4, Band 4 / Band 7, and Band 5 / Band 7 increase. Soil reflectance is significantly affected if more than 1. 5 % organic carbon is present. A procedure is presented that enables mapping of soils overlying contact metamorphic rocks in Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, using these variations. In the TM image, pixels that correspond with kaolinitic soils are identified by elimination of other pixels during a process of stepwise masking various band ratio images. The first step was to eliminate the effect of vegetation and organic material, by masking high values of the ratio of [(TM5 / TM7) / (TM3 / TM4)]. The second step was to eliminate chloritic soils by masking the ratio of TM2 / TM7. The third step was to isolate the most kaolinitic and limonitic soils using the ratio of TM3 / TM4. Finally, a maximum likelihood classification was performed on original band ratio images, using the result of the masking as training set, in order to optimize the classification results.

TI EMISSIVITY OF TERRESTRIAL MATERIALS IN THE 3-5-MU-M ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE
AB Accurate satellite remote sensing of surface temperature has become more and more important in the context of calculating the radiation balance input to climate models for assessment of global change. Surface temperatures can be determined from radiance measurements in both the 3-5 mum and 8-14 mum atmospheric windows, given some estimate of surface emissivity. The 3-5 mum region offers a potential advantage in the accuracy of temperature determination, because temperature estimates are more than two times less sensitive to emissivity errors in this region. However, very little is known about the emissivities of land surface materials in the 3-5 mum region, If emissivities were more variable in the 3-5 mum region than in the 8-14 mum region, this might cancel the advantage of lower sensitivity to emissivity error in the shorter wavelength region. This article documents the directional hemispherical spectral reflectance, from which emissivity can be calculated, of a wide variety of earth surface materials in the 3-5 mum region, and compares their average reflectances in AVHRR Band 3 (3.55-3.93 mum) to that in Bands 4 (10.3-11.3 mum) and 5 (11.5-12.5 mum). It appears from these data that, based on natural variations in emissivity of different surface materials, AVHRR Band 5 is best used for temperature remote sensing of rocks, soils, and senescent vegetation, while Band 3 is best for green vegetation and water. Band 4 is preferred for thermal remote sensing of ice, especially rough ice. Emissivity and reflectivity in the 3-5 mum region affect other significant remote sensing measurements of global change besides those of surface temperature alone. The accuracy of atmospheric sounding of CO near 4.7 mum, for example, depends in part on knowledge of such surface properties to account for surface upwelling radiation. Because of the multiple uses to which our data can be put, digital records of all spectra used in the figures are available from 2.01 mum to 14 mum upon request.

ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION; RADIATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS
AB To help interpret satellite-derived measures of spectral vegetation indices across western Oregon, we collected samples of important landscape constituents and determined their spectral reflectance properties using a Spectron Engineering field spectrometer. To make measurements reproducible, we created stacks of branches and other materials in well-illuminated areas and continually referenced measurements against a standard reference panel. The measurements indicated that variations in remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices observed in western Oregon originate from variations in both canopy spectral optical properties and background spectral reflectance rather than simple variations in leaf area index or percentage canopy closure. This suggests that satellite-derived changes in spectral vegetation indices may not be easily interpretable in terms of vegetation physiognomic properties at regional and global scales. Further studies of regional landscape component spectral reflectance properties are recommended to refine interpretation of remotely sensed vegetation indices.

ID RADAR IMAGES; CALIBRATION; ECOSYSTEM; MODELS
AB Characterizing a forest ecosystem dynamics for global change studies requires updated knowledge in terms of species composition, carbon storage, and biophysical functioning. Often, significant areas of forest are obscured by clouds or are under reduced solar illumination conditions, which limit acquisition of optical satellite data. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, however, can be acquired under these conditions. Several SAR image data sets were acquired over the Northern Experimental Forest near Howland, Maine as part of the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics-Multisensor Aircraft Campaign. A SAR data processing and analysis sequence, from calibration through classification, is described. The usefulness of multifrequency temporal polarimetric SAR image data for identifying ecosystem classes is discussed. Our results show that with principal component analysis of temporal data sets (winter and late summer) SAR images can be classified into general forest categories such as softwood, hardwood, regeneration, and clearing with better than 80% accuracy. Other nonforest classes such as bogs, wetlands, grass, and water were also accurately classified. Classifications from single date images suffered in accuracy. The winter image had significant confusion of softwoods and hardwoods with a strong tendency to overestimate hardwoods. Modeling results suggest that increased double-bounce scattering of the radar beam from conifer stands because of lowered dielectric constant of frozen needles and branches was the contributing factor for the misclassifications.

AB This article presents instruments and techniques, used in several vegetation monitoring experiments. Simultaneous monitoring was performed with different approaches, including fluorescence lidar and passive remote sensing, leaf level reflectance, and laser fluorimetry, and compared with physiological measurements. Most of the instrumentation described was designed and built for this application. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory and in the field, to investigate the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence spectra and plant ecophysiology. Remote sensing, spectroscopy, and ecophysiology data were then collected by an intensive research team, joining different experiences and working in national and international projects.

   SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; WHEAT; TRANSPIRATION; ABSORPTANCE
AB Multispectral vegetation indices are often used to estimate the proportion of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 0.4-0.7 mum) that is absorbed by plants for potential use in photosynthesis. Field experiments were conducted near Phoenix, Arizona to establish such predictive capabilities for alfalfa and also to determine the effect Of varying solar zenith angles (theta(s)) on the relationships. The fraction of absorbed PAR (fA(PAR)) was measured using a 1-m long line quantum sensor. Canopy reflectance measurements (red, 0.61-0.68 mum; near-infrared, 0.79-0.89 mum) were obtained with a hand-held radiometer. Data were collected for theta(s) from 27-degrees to 72-degrees. Statistically significant relationships were observed between fA(PAR) and red reflectance factors (r2 = 0.97) and several commonly used vegetation indices (ratio, r2 = 0.96, normalized difference, r = 0.96; and soil adjusted, r2 = 0.93). Actual values of these parameters varied with time of day, but the relationships between fA(PAR) and various indices derived from reflectance observations were independent of theta(s), extending the potential usefulness of remote sensing approaches for inferring changes in fA(PAR) at various times of the day and different seasons and latitudes.

TI DETECTION OF SOIL-EROSION WITHIN PINYON-JUNIPER WOODLANDS USING THEMATIC
   MAPPER (TM) DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RANGELAND
AB Multispectral measurements collected by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) were correlated with field measurements, direct soil loss estimates, and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) estimates to determine the sensitivity of TM data to varying degrees of soil erosion in pinyon-juniper woodland in central Utah. TM data were also evaluated as a predictor of the USLE Crop Management C factor for pinyon-juniper woodlands. Correlation analysis showed that TM Band 4 (near infrared) accounted for 78 % of the variability in percent trees (r = -0.88). In multiple regression, percent trees, total soil loss, and percent total nonliving cover together accounted for nearly 70 % of the variability in TM Bands 2, 3, 4, and 5. TM spectral data were consistently better predictors of soil erosion factors than any combination of field factors. TM data were more sensitive to vegetation variations than the USLE C factor. USLE estimates showed low annual rates of erosion which varied little among the study sites. Direct measurements of rate of soil loss using the SEDIMENT (Soil Erosion DIrect measureMENT) technique, indicated high and varying rates of soil loss among the sites since tree establishment. Erosion estimates from the USLE and SEDIMENT methods suggest that erosion rates have been severe in the past, but because significant amounts of soil have already been eroded, and the surface is now armored by rock debris, present erosion rates are lower. Indicators of accelerated erosion were still present on all sites, however, suggesting that the USLE underestimated erosion within the study area. These findings indicate that remotely sensed multispectral data should be considered as input to future models designed to estimate soil loss within pinyon-juniper woodlands and probably other vegetation types distributed over broad geographic regions.

AB The theoretical analyses of Sellers (1985; 1987), which linked canopy spectral reflectance properties to (unstressed) photosynthetic rates and conductances, are critically reviewed and significant shortcomings are identified. These are addressed in this article principally through the incorporation of a more sophisticated and realistic treatment of leaf physiological processes within a new canopy integration scheme. It is assumed, based on ecophysiological observations and arguments, that leaf physiological properties vary throughout the plant canopy in response to the radiation-weighted time-mean profile of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These modifications yield a simpler and more robust theoretical relationship between canopy biophysical rates (photosynthesis, conductance) and spectral vegetation indices (SVI). The results indicate that area-averaged SVI, as obtained from coarse resolution satellite sensors, may give good estimates of the area-integrals of photosynthesis and conductance even for spatially heterogenous (though physiologically uniform) vegetation covers.

AB This paper presents the results of a laboratory experiment performed to chose optimal wavelengths for the estimation of total suspended solids (TSS) from remotely sensed water reflectance.  The experimental method involved the determination of the water reflectance as produced by the simulation of different TSS concentrations.  The results for the oxisoil sediment used in the experiment showed a linear correlation between spectral reflectance and TSS concentration.  This correlation was statistically significant and constant from 450 to 900 nm, but the rate of change in the spectral reflectance with TSS concentration peaked in the red region of the spectrum.

AB Volcanic eruptions can be catastrophic events, particularly when they occur in inhabited coastal environments. They also play important roles in climate and biogeochemical cycles, including through nutrient deposition in the ocean. Volcanic ash studies in the ocean have focused on the phytoplankton response, generally quantifying changes in chlorophyll-a concentration. Many gaps remain in addressing fundamental questions regarding why volcanic ash deposition may enhance or limit both phytoplankton growth and/or drive community composition shifts. Here we outline a wide, multidisciplinary vision for monitoring volcanic eruptions near ocean ecosystems from satellites, including considerations for characteristics of airborne volcanic ash and ash geochemistry in seawater. Ultimately, observations beyond chlorophyll-a are needed to quantify phytoplankton communities (including harmful algal blooms) and possible impacts across higher trophic levels. We synthesize relevant research from volcanic studies as well as atmospheric and ocean sciences to identify the 'known unknowns' in ash-ecosystem studies. Our goal is to move toward an improved understanding of how real-time and near-realtime monitoring of volcanic eruptions can help address societally relevant questions.

AB Accurate quantification of iceberg populations is essential to inform estimates of Southern Ocean freshwater and heat balances as well as shipping hazards. The automated operational monitoring of icebergs remains challenging, largely due to a lack of generality in existing approaches. Previous efforts to map icebergs have often exploited synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data but the majority are designed for open water situations, require significant operator input, and are susceptible to the substantial spatial and temporal variability in backscatter that characterises SAR time-series. We propose an adaptive unsupervised classification procedure based on Sentinel 1 SAR data and a recursive Dirichlet Process implementation of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach is robust to inter-scene variability and can identify icebergs even within complex environments containing mixtures of open water, sea ice and icebergs of various sizes. For the study area in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, close to the calving front of Thwaites Glacier, our classifier achieved a mean pixel-wise F1 score against manual iceberg delineations from the SAR scenes of 0.960 & PLUSMN; 0.018 with a corresponding object-level F1 score of 0.729 & PLUSMN; 0.086. The method provides an excellent basis for estimation of total near-shore iceberg populations and has inherent potential for scalability that other approaches lack.

AB The use of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, between 8 and 14 mu m, is an important method to monitor vegetation water stress status. To comprehend the spectral characteristics of natural leaves, understanding the relationship between TIR reflectance and leaf water content is helpful. In this study, we selected Magnolia cylindrica E.H.Wilson, Canna indica Rosc. and Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis leaves to isolate cuticles with varying thicknesses. Subsequently, we constructed a leaf thermal infrared model (Leaf-TIR model) to examine the impact of cuticle thickness and inside wet epidermal cell wall on the TIR reflectance of natural leaves. Our findings indicate that the cuticle thicknesses of the three selected leaves are 12.2, 5.5, and 1.1 mu m, respectively. Moreover, as cuticle thickness decreases, the similarity between the isolated cuticle and the leaf reflectance behaviors also decreases because a thinner cuticle has lower absorptance and a weaker effect on the reflection characteristics of natural leaves. Moreover, we observed that as the water content in the cell wall decreases, the reflectance of the leaves significantly increases when the cuticle thickness becomes 5.5 or 1.1 mu m. This outcome is due to the increasing difference in the refractive indices of the cuticle and cell wall with declining water content. Our findings suggest that the Leaf-TIR model can quantitatively determine the relationship between TIR reflectance and water content in the cell wall. This information is crucial in interpreting TIR spectral behaviors of natural leaves and provides an important theoretical basis for future research.

AB Soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) are essential variables in the terrestrial ecosystem. The multi-frequency radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 provide >20 years of data records, enabling the development of long-term SM and VOD products. Most of the current retrieval algorithms either only focus on SM or VOD, and generally ignore the polarization or simplify the frequency dependence of vegetation effects for reducing the unknowns and facilitating the retrieval process, limiting the synergic applicability of VOD and SM products in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. In this study, a new global SM and frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD product from 2002 to 2021 was developed using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA), based on the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency passive microwave measurements. The MCCA algorithm comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD while considering the accuracy of the SM retrievals. In the overall comparison with other SM products (AMSR-ANN, CCI-passive v07.1, LPRM-C/X, JAXA) over 25 dense SM networks, MCCA achieved the best scores in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 0.074 m3/m3), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.073 m3/m3) and bias (0.007 m3/m3), and presented slightly lower value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R = 0.709) than LPRM-X (R = 0.735). For the indirect evaluation of VOD with aboveground biomass (AGB) and MODIS NDVI, the MCCA product showed the performance comparable to other products (LPRM-C/X, VODCA-C/X/Ku). MCCA-derived VODs, especially for the H-polarized VODs, exhibited smooth non-linear density distribution with AGB and high temporal correlations with MODIS NDVI over most regions of the globe. In particular, MCCA-derived VODs can physically present reasonable variations across the microwave spectrum (values of VOD increase with microwave frequency), which is superior to the LPRM and VODCA products. It is expected that the MCCA algorithm can be extended to the observations of the ongoing AMSR2 or other similar satellite missions with multi-frequency capability, such as FY-3B/C/D/F/G or the upcoming AMSR3 and CMIR missions.

AB Imperfect land physics introduce significant levels of uncertainty into current land surface models (LSMs) and can cause bias in their representation of land-atmosphere coupling strength (rho). When LSMs are coupled with atmospheric prediction models, such errors will eventually degrade the accuracy of lower atmosphere forecasts. Here, we investigate the potential of two remote sensing (RS)-based rho references for addressing LSM rho bias. To minimize meteorological uncertainty and maximally attribute LSM rho bias to land sources, we focus specifically on off-line LSM calibration forced using high-quality, observation-based meteorological data. Both rho references are based on a newly proposed two-system approach for eliminating the impact of random errors in RS retrievals and quantified using the temporal correlations of soil moisture (SM) versus both evapotranspiration (ET) and the diurnal amplitude of surface temperature (dT). Experiments are conducted to calibrate an off-line LSM individually against each resulting rho reference and using a combination of both dT- and ET-represented rho references. The resulting calibrated LSM is further evaluated using independent ground-based ET observations and RS dT retrievals. Results show that although dT- and ET-represented rho references are physically consistent across space, model calibration results based on them are quite different. Specifically, the calibration experiment targeting ET-represented rho outperforms that targeting dT-represented rho in ET and dT modeling. Diagnostic results indicate that the failure of dT-based calibration experiments is due to the confounding impacts of transpiration/evapotranspiration partitioning error and large dT uncertainties in LSM. However, results also confirm the potential of both dT- and ET-represented rho references for jointly diagnosing and understanding LSM rho bias. As a result, we suggest diagnosing LSM rho bias using both ET- and dT-represented rho references - but calibrating LSM using only ET-represented rho reference data.

AB Longwave radiation components, including downward, upward, and net longwave radiation (DLR, ULR, and NLR, respectively), are essential parameters in heat flux exchange across the ocean-atmosphere interface. However, few long-term, high-resolution, and accurate sea-surface longwave radiation (SSLR) products are available. We generated the first high-resolution (5-km) all-sky daily SSLR product from Advanced Very HighResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) top-of-atmosphere observations, combined with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis V5 near-surface meteorological variables and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sea-surface temperatures from 1981 to 2018. We coupled the densely connected convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network as a retrieval algorithm. The training dataset was generated using integrated SSLR samples from 2002 to 2012 at 437 globally distributed locations. The archived product, SSLR_AVHRR, showed a high accuracy against 81,546 buoy-based observations from eight observation networks, with an R2 of 0.96 (1.00, 0.77), root mean square error of 10.27 (4.51, 9.27) Wm-2, and mean bias error of -1.30 (0.30, -0.72) Wm-2 for DLR (ULR, NLR) retrievals. Based on SSLR_AVHRR, the global DLR (ULR) flux exhibited a significantly (p-value < 0.05) increasing trend of 1.03 (1.08) Wm-2/decade during 1982-2018. The trend was 0.24 (0.34) Wm-2/decade during 1982-2000, which increased to 1.79 (1.45) Wm-2/decade during 2001-2018. This globally increasing trend was dominantly impacted by the significant increases in high latitude, particularly in the Arctic Ocean. Trend variations at low latitudes, which were more frequent than at middle and high latitudes because of the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation, mitigated the increasing rates of global DLR and ULR after strong El Nin similar to o years, whereas the global NLR flux remained relatively stable throughout the study period. This method can be extended and applied to estimate other air-sea fluxes based on a unified estimating framework to help mitigate imbalanced energy and freshwater budgets at the air-sea interface to some degree.

AB Monitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A ma-chine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi-and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (-530 and -730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classi-fication at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.

AB In vegetation-abundant ecosystems, accurate fractional cover estimation of multiple targets, including nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and bare soil (BS) is an important indicator of carbon storage and climate change, and a contributing factor to soil and water conservation, wildfire, and drought. Satellite remote sensing began with sensors limited to the visible and near infrared (VNIR, 380 nm to 1000 nm), and advancing to sensors spanning the whole solar domain (350 nm to 2500 nm) over the last five decades. However, NPV is still difficult to distinguish from BS in satellite images covering large spatial areas, since their spectral reflectances are always mixed and have subtly different spectral features. Many spectral indices have been proposed to identify NPV, however, most include a short-wave infrared band which is lacking on many current and historical spaceborne sensors. To fully utilize current and historical airborne/satellite images with only VNIR bands, a novel spectral index - the VNIR spectral shape index (SSI) - is proposed in this paper. Using spectra of PV, NPV, and BS acquired from world-recognized spectral libraries, the SSI was devised using only blue, green, red, and NIR bands. When applied to Sentinel-2 MSI images, the SSI was effective in estimating/mapping the fractional cover of PV, NPV, and BS using the triangular space method. The resulting fractional cover was evaluated in three 3 km x 2 km study areas including one grassland, one woodland, and one cropland. The spectral reflectance collected by spectroradiometer in field work and digital image collect by digital camera mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) support that the triangular space method is able to estimate the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation simultaneously, and that endmember selection relying solely on satellite images is reasonable. Comparing the abundance of each target in UAV images to corresponding MSI pixels, the SSI index and triangular space method proved effective for fractional cover estimation in varied vegetated ecosystems. For fractional cover evaluation in grassland, woodland, and cropland, the R2 reaching to 0.59, 0.62, and 0.70, respectively. These results demonstrate that the SSI is feasible for multiple sensors, enabling potential large temporal and/or spatial scale applications.

AB The spectral invariants theory predicts that amount of radiation scattered by a canopy in a given wavelength is a simple function of the leaf albedo and a spectrally invariant parameter p. This study provides the first assessment of p parameter obtained from the Earth Reflector Type Index (ERTI) provided in Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) Vegetation Earth System Data Record (VESDR) product. Our results suggest that ERTI parameter can possibly deliver information about photon recollision probability, albeit with a risk of lower accuracy, even for conditions that differ from the original assumptions in the spectral invariants theory (non-reflecting soil, dense canopies). We verified the expected link between ERTI p parameter in the EPIC VESDR product, foliage clumping, and canopy cover with empirical data. Importantly, this was done with study sites in Australia that included types of forests that are still relatively unexplored with spectral invariants theory. Our findings contribute to understanding product uncertainty and spatial representativeness of the in situ measurements from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) SuperSites in Australia.

AB In the context of global climate change, the frequency of strong wind events are increasing. These extreme events have more significantly altered the marine environment than normal events; however, relevant in-situ measurements are usually lacking for such extreme events. In our previous study, we established a method to estimate particulate organic carbon (POC) flux by combining satellite data with a numerical model. Based on this method, this study aimed to quantify the impact of typhoons and strong seasonal winds (with a wind speed of >10.8 m/s) on POC flux and transport outside the Changjiang River estuary (CRE). Wind data in CRE during 2010-2019 revealed that the annual durations of strong winds (849.7 +/- 111.7 h/yr) and typhoons (204.4 +/- 64.5 h/yr) increased by 15.3% and 143.3%, respectively, compared to those during 1980-2009. The seasonal durations of typhoons and strong winds during 2010-2019 increased in autumn and in winter and spring, respectively. Considering northward Typhoon Bolaven as an example, we found that its passage strengthened the southward POC transport and the POC erosion outside CRE. Four scenarios with special wind characteristics were further simulated to analyze the annual effect of strong winds on POC transport. The proportion of northerly winds in strong winds affected the southward POC transport, whereas strong winter winds triggered 23.0% of the southward transport of POC flux. Finally, based on eight groups of numerical simulation experiments, the increasing proportion of northerly winds in strong wind events during 2010-2019 enhanced the southward POC transport and POC erosion by 15.9% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with the transport and erosion during 1980-2009. The increased durations of typhoons in autumn and strong winds in winter are expected to increase the proportion of northerly winds in extreme winds, thus enhancing the southward POC transport in CRE and affecting the southeastern coast of China. The combination of high-spatiotemporal-resolution satellite data and the numerical model provides novel insights into the impact of short-term wind extremes on POC transport in the estuary, with important implications for relevant biogeochemical processes, in particular, carbon cycle, in the coastal ocean.

AB The use of remote sensing in time series analysis enables wall-to-wall monitoring of the land surface and is critical for assessing and understanding land cover and land use change and for understanding the Earth system as a whole. However, variability in remote sensing observation frequency through time and across space presents challenges for producing consistent change detection results throughout the available satellite record using approaches such as the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) change detection methodology. Here we investigate new modifications to this methodology with the goal of improving accuracy and consistency in results and increasing flexibility for operational usage and future development. The modified method (Band-First Probability, or CCD-BFP) change detection procedure works by calculating a test for each band through time before summarizing between bands. We evaluate the CCD-BFP method compared to an existing implementation of CCDC using a variety of approaches, including a validation dataset of human -interpreted locations, comparison with data from fire events, use of simulated remote sensing data, and qualitative inspection of areas of interest. We find CCD-BFP improves consistency across time and space compared to the existing implementation of CCDC, with more similarity in rates of change across Landsat swath boundaries and before and after the launch of Landsat 7. Also, we find that CCD-BFP detects more of the change events in the validation dataset while reducing the overall number of change detections, indicating that it is able to more accurately capture the most notable land surface change events.

AB For sustainable food production in the Mekong Delta, local information on irrigation status is essential for allocating water resources efficiently at the community level. ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band SAR can be used to detect submerged and nonsubmerged soil covered by rice plants at a spatial resolution compatible with field observation but a low temporal resolution. In this study, a new multiscale data assimilation technique is developed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of field water levels at a temporal resolution appropriate to inform decision-making on when to initiate irrigation. The method employs an irrigation model based on parameters representing farmers' irrigation practices. ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data are used to derive the hydrological parameters of the model, including an irrigation parameter representing how deep the field water level dropped until the next round of irrigation was initiated. We developed observation operators for the soil submersion status under vegetation and spatial submersion percentages instead of assimilating soil moisture products. The study uses ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data (25-100 m spatial resolution, approximately every 42 days) over the Mekong Delta and experimental data collected in situ for model initialization and validation. The estimated irrigation parameter controlling the maximum depth of field water level showed spatiotemporal consistency with the ground-observed value (RMSE = 4.24 cm). The values of the parameters also showed spatial consistency with respect to DEM data; he paddies with low irrigation model parameter values were prone to be located in low -elevation zones (< 2 m), whereas high model parameters values tended to be located in paddies in the high -elevation zones (> 3 m).The results show promising applications using L-band SAR observations for monitoring paddy field water level, for irrigation practices and for estimation of the water consumption and of methane emissions.

AB Identifying sea ice types in the early stages of development from L-band SAR imagery remains an active research area during the Arctic freeze-up period. We used ScanSAR C- and L-band imagery from RADARSAT-2, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, to identify ice types in the North Water Polynya (NOW) and Victoria Strait (VS) region of the Canadian Arctic. We investigated the HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)(HH)) and its GLCM texture parameters for six ice classes and open water. We found very low sigma(0)(HH) for nilas at both C- and L-band. Although similar sigma(0)(HH) found for grey ice at both frequencies, sigma(0)(HH) decrease with increasing ice thickness at L-band from grey ice, whereas, at C-band, sigma(0)(HH) increases from grey to grey-white ice and then decreases as the ice grows. GLCM texture parameters show lower values for L-band than C-band; however, separability among classes was found only for a few selected parameters. We used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for ice type classification from SAR scenes using sigma(0)(HH) and GLCM texture statistics. Due to overlapping sigma(0)(HH) signatures at C-band, early-stage ice classes were substantially misclassified. L-band identified early-stage ice classes with higher accuracy compared to C-band but misclassified thicker ice types and open water. L-band alone provided very good classification results (similar to 80% accuracy) and combining L- and C-band (i.e., dual-frequency approach) further increased accuracy to >90%. C-band alone resulted in the lowest accuracy of <60%. We acknowledge that developing a universal ice classification is still a challenge and requires some manual supervision to adopt variable ice conditions into the classification method. However, a dual-frequency approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than conventionally used single-frequency approaches. This research highlights the value of upcoming L-Band SAR missions to improve sea ice classification in regions where a variety of ice types exist, including many thinner types, which are now dominating an increasingly warming Arctic.

AB The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has observed the Earth since 2011 and will continue for several decades. Unfortunately, few high-level land surface products have been produced and publicly released. The numerical inversion of radiative transfer model (RTM) has long been used for the retrieval of land surface and atmospheric variables from satellite data; however, it is computationally intensive. Some methods (e.g., using look-up tables) are efficient but are most suitable for estimating individual variable. Various machine learning (ML) models have been developed, mostly trained by either ground measurements that may not be adequate to represent different conditions, or RTM simulations that may not be realistic due to model uncertainty and unnecessary combinations of illumination-viewing geometries and variable values. In this study, we replaced the numerical inversion scheme by the ML algorithm that is trained using RTM inversion for estimating multiple variables simultaneously. Our training dataset for the ML models was generated by inverting the land and atmospheric variables from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data using a coupled land-surface-atmosphere RT model. Two multi-output ML algorithms were explored: backpropagation neural networks and random forest (RF) regression. The best-performing RF model was then applied to estimate seven land and atmospheric variables globally from VIIRS TOA data: the leaf area index (LAI), incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), incident shortwave radiation (ISR), land surface albedo, land surface reflectance, and TOA albedo. The inversion results were validated using ground measurements at 54 sites and showed comparable accuracy to the numerical inversion scheme that is suitable for only small regions. An experiment was also conducted to test this method on a much larger region for detailed evaluation. Finally, seven global estimates in 2013 were experimentally produced. Inter-comparison with the existing satellite products showed that the VIIRS estimates had high consistency with the LAI and FAPAR products of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products suite. Moreover, the VIIRS officially released the VNP43MA3 albedo and VNP09A1 surface reflectance products, the retrieved estimates also matched them well. It was also shown that simultaneous estimation of all seven variables was more accurate and efficient than estimating individual variable sequentially.

AB Monitoring and understanding urban development requires up-to-date information on multiple urban land-use classes. Manual classification and deep learning approaches based on very-high resolution imagery have been applied successfully, but the required resources limits their capacity to map urban land use at larger scales. Here, we use a combination of open-source satellite imagery, constituting of data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, and socioeconomic data, constituting of points-of-interest and spatial metrics from road networks to classify urban land-use at a national scale, using a deep learning approach. A related challenge for large-scale mapping is the availability of ground truth data. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the transferability of our classification approach, using ground truth labels from a nationwide land-use dataset for the Netherlands. By dividing the country into four regions, we tested whether a combination of satellite data and socioeconomic data increases the transferability of the classification approach, compared to using satellite data only. The results indicate that socioeconomic data increases the overall accuracy of the classification for the Netherlands by 3 percentage points. In a transfer learning approach we find that adding socioeconomic data increases the accuracy between 3 and 5 percentage points when trained on three regions and tested on the independent fourth one. In the case of training and testing on one region and testing on another, the increase in overall accuracy increased up to 9 percentage points. In addition, we find that our deep learning approach consistently outperforms a random forest model, used here as benchmark, in all of the abovementioned experiments. Overall, we find that socioeconomic data increases the accuracy of urban land use classification, but variations between experiments are large.

AB Backscatter measured by scatterometers and Synthetic Aperture Radars is sensitive to the dielectric properties of the soil and normally increases with increasing soil moisture content. However, when the soil is dry, the radar waves penetrate deeper into the soil, potentially sensing subsurface scatterers such as near-surface rocks and stones. In this paper we propose an exponential model to describe the impact of such subsurface scatterers on CBand backscatter measurements acquired by the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on board of the METOP satellites. The model predicts an increase of the subsurface scattering contributions with decreasing soil wetness that may counteract the signal from the soil surface. This may cause anomalous backscatter signals that deteriorate soil moisture retrievals from ASCAT. We test whether this new model is able to explain ASCAT observations better than a bare soil backscatter model without a subsurface scattering term, using k-fold cross validation and the Bayesian Information Criterion for model selection. We find that arid landscapes with Leptosols and Arenosols represent ideal environmental conditions for the occurrence of subsurface scattering. Nonetheless, subsurface scattering may also become important in more humid environments during dry spells. We conclude that subsurface scattering is a widespread phenomenon that (i) needs to be accounted for in active microwave soil moisture retrievals and (ii) has a potential for soil mapping, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.

AB We retrieved and examined the partial-column densities of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the lower (LT, typically 0-4 km) and upper (UT, typically 4-12 km) troposphere (XCO2LT and XCO2UT) collected over six global megacities: Beijing, New Delhi, New York City, Riyadh, Shanghai, and Tokyo. The radiance spectra were collected using the Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Our retrieval method uniquely utilizes reflected sunlight with two orthogonal components of polarization and thermal emissions. We defined megacity concentration enhancement due to surface CO2 emissions as XCO2LT minus XCO2UT, allowing us to overcome some of the challenges in the enhancement analysis using existing column density data. We examined the relationship between the XCO2LT enhancements from the time series of intensive target observations over megacities and the inverse of simulated wind speed, which could be potentially used to estimate surface emissions. Next, we attempted to estimate the average emission intensity for each city from the linear regression slope. We also compared our obtained emission estimates with the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) inventory for evaluation. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of the new partial-column density retrievals for estimating megacity CO2 emissions. More frequent and comprehensive coverage characterizing the spatial distribution of emissions is necessary to reduce random error and bias associated with the obtained estimate.

AB Adaptive management requires rangeland managers to respond to changing forage conditions (e.g., standing herbaceous biomass) within the grazing season at the scale of individual pastures. While within-season biomass can be measured or estimated in the field, it is often impractical to make field measurements in extensive rangeland systems with adequate frequency and spatial representation for responsive decision-making by rangeland managers. We sought to develop a single model to accurately predict daily herbaceous biomass across seasonally and annually varying conditions from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel satellite time series. We also sought to assess how information about plant community composition derived from a high-spatial resolution map would improve model performance. We used herbaceous biomass data from 1764 ground observations collected over 8 years in North American shortgrass steppe for training in a cross-validated model selection approach to evaluate (1) predictive performance of candidate models both spatially and temporally, (2) relative variable importance of individual spectral bands, vegetation indices, and recently developed broadband spectral angle indices, and (3) the degree to which including plant community composition improved model performance. All 11 candidate models identified in the model selection procedure contained a band angle index and an individual spectral band, and 6 contained one of each input feature type, demonstrating the benefit of combining spectral features for predicting herbaceous biomass across varying conditions. The spatial and temporal cross-validation and selection procedures produced the same top model with similar performance (mean absolute error = 151-182 kg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.75-0.79), suggesting that a single model performs well over space and time. Including plant community composition in the model reduced mean absolute error by 11-13%. Bootstrapping revealed that -six to seven years of training data were required to achieve consistent model performance across years with varying environmental conditions (e.g., wet, average, dry). The top model could accurately detect (70-87% accuracy) the week that biomass dropped below management-related thresholds as low as 450 kg ha(-1) in an independent dataset (n = 950) with modest commission error (10-26%). We discuss how maps showing the probability that herbaceous biomass is below a given threshold can support adaptive management in extensive semiarid rangelands across differing scenarios of risk perception and avoidance. In addition to producing maps to support precision rangeland management strategies, this study demonstrates the importance of combining complementary vegetation indices and acquiring long-term training datasets to achieve reliable predictions of herbaceous standing biomass in highly variable systems.

AB While cropland expansion and demand for woodfuel exert increasing pressure on woody vegetation in East Africa, climate change is inducing woody cover gain. It is however unclear if these contrasting patterns have led to net fractional woody cover loss or gain. Here we used non-parametric fractional woody cover (WC) predictions and breakpoint detection algorithms driven by satellite observations (Landsat and MODIS) and airborne laser scanning to unveil the net fractional WC change during 2001-2019 over Ethiopia and Kenya. Our results show that total WC loss was 4-times higher than total gain, leading to net loss. The contribution of abrupt WC loss (59%) was higher than gradual losses (41%). We estimated an annual WC loss rate of up to 5% locally, with cropland expansion contributing to 57% of the total loss in the region. Major hotspots of WC loss and degradation corridors were identified inside as well as surrounding protected areas, in agricultural lands located close to agropastoral and pastoral livelihood zones, and near highly populated areas. As the dominant vegetation type in the region, Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecosystem was the most threatened, accounting 69% of the total WC loss, followed by montane forest (12%). Although highly outweighed by loss, relatively more gain was observed in woody savanna than in other ecosystems. These results reveal the marked impact of human activities on woody vegetation and highlight the importance of protecting endangered ecosystems from increased human activities for mitigating impacts on climate and supporting sustainable ecosystem service provision in East Africa.

AB The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km(2)) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984-2010] and late [2011-2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of-49 +/- 7 km(2) a(-1) [early] and -340 +/- 40 km(2) a(-1) [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 +/- 5.6 fragments a(-1) to 88 +/- 39 fragments a(-1). About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 +/- 1.1 km(2) a(-1) to 49 +/- 4.5 km(2) a(-1). We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) to 4.7 +/- 0.7 m a(-1). Our workflow demonstrates the advantages of annual resolution glacier inventories and contributes towards the implementation of planetary mapping of glaciers and glacier attributes at annual resolution.

AB It is important to understand temporal and spatial variations in the structure and photosynthetic capacity of tropical rainforests in a world of changing climate, increased disturbances and human appropriation. The equatorial rainforests of Central Africa are the second largest and least disturbed of the biodiversly-rich and highly productive rainforests on Earth. Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge about the phenological behavior and long-term changes that these forests are experiencing. Thus, this study reports on leaf area seasonality and its time trend over the past two decades as assessed from multiple remotely sensed datasets. Seasonal variations of leaf area in Congolese forests derived from MODIS data co-vary with the bimodal precipitation pattern in this region, with higher values during the wet season. Independent observational evidence derived from MISR and EPIC sensors in the form of angular reflectance signatures further corroborate this seasonal behavior of leaf area. The bimodal patterns vary latitudinally within this large region. Two sub-seasonal cycles, each consisting of a dry and wet season, could be discerned clearly. These exhibit different sensitivities to changes in precipitation. Contrary to a previous published report, no widespread decline in leaf area was detected across the entire extent of the Congolese rainforests over the past two decades with the latest MODIS Collection 6 dataset. Long-term precipitation decline did occur in some localized areas, but these had minimal impacts on leaf area, as inferred from MODIS and MISR multi-angle observations.

AB Detailed parcel-level crop type mapping for the whole European Union (EU) is necessary for the evaluation of agricultural policies. The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here can underpin the operational delivery of inseason high-resolution based crop mapping.

AB Water-level monitoring is important for climate analysis, water resource planning, and monitoring of disasters, such as floods, droughts, and storm surges. The technology of global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been demonstrated previously and can be used to retrieve data on various water levels, such as sea, lake, river, and reservoir water levels. In this paper, we focus on the branch of GNSS-R that is based on the conventional geodetic receiver. In order to improve precision and promote the actual application, we present a multi-site multi-signal GNSS-R combination method. Furthermore, to address the phenomenon of "double peaks" in spectrograms of GPS L2P/L2W signal, we present a strategy to retrieve water levels from the L2P/L2W signal captured using Z-tracking method. Data of a GNSS network, which included a base station and three monitoring sites, established in a reservoir of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project were analyzed. The multi-site, multi-signal combination method was used to form a 6-h water level retrieval series and the retrievals showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.0 mm. This is the first example of GNSS-R water-level retrieval achieving a millimeter to centimeter scale precision. The ability of the GNSS technology to simultaneously monitor water level and displacement based on the same GNSS network were also discussed and demonstrated. This study showed that GNSS-R could achieve high precision, high sampling, increased service, and lower cost, thereby representing a crucial progress in the practical application of the GNSS-R technology.

AB Accurate projection of CO2 concentration in time and space remains challenging because of complex interplay between anthropogenic emissions, biospheric responses, and climatic variabilities. While the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration is due primarily to fossil fuel burning, natural climate variabilities are known to introduce intermittent changes in the global CO2 growth rates. Thus, understanding the correlation of climate and carbon cycling systems is important in assessing the anthropogenic and natural impacts. Here, we report decadal CO2 variabilities in western Pacific based on data from several ground-based stations in the region and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). In addition to the well-established El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), there exists a decadal changing CO2 trend in the datasets mentioned above. Analysis of ground-based CO2 measurements in northern Taiwan shows a decadal signal at amplitudes of -5 ppm. In contrast, AIRS shows a similar trend but at a reduced amplitude of -1 ppm. We attribute the decadal signal to dynamical factors related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This decadal signal, however, is not reproduced by the state-of-the-art data assimilation system, CarbonTacker, suggesting a gap in our knowledge of the modulation of carbon cycling systems and climate.

TI Estimating nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions for the Los Angeles

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas contributing both to global radiative forcing and ozone depletion. Though N2O emissions are largely derived from agricultural activities, urban sources of N2O also contribute significantly to anthropogenic emissions, but are not well understood and difficult to quantify. This study employs a top-down approach to derive urban N2O emissions for the Los Angeles megacity using a unique dataset from a mountaintop remote sensing instrument, which has been observing greenhouse gas mixing ratios in LA since 2011. CLARS-FTS observations yield a weighted mean of 15.0 ? 0.1 ppb excess XN2O above background in the LA basin from 2013 to 2019. Time series of XN2Oxs show a seasonal cycle with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 5.6 ? 2.5 ppb, where greater XN2Oxs values are observed during the winter/spring and minima occur in late summer/early fall. A tracer-tracer ratio method is applied using XN2Oxs and XCO2,xs observations to estimate top-down N2O emissions for the LA basin during 2013?2018. Estimated monthly emissions range from 6 to 19 Gg N2O per month and exhibit a similar seasonal cycle to that observed in XN2Oxs. Estimated annual emissions fall within the range 124?144 Gg per year for the years 2014?2018. These top-down annual estimates are roughly 3 times the official statewide bottom-up inventory for the same time period, but consistent considering uncertainties with other top-down estimates for the LA basin. The discrepancy between top-down emission estimates and the statewide bottom-up inventory highlights the difficulty in constraining N2O emissions, especially for an urban environment.

AB Controlled, fully-blinded methane releases and ancillary on-site wind measurements were performed during a separate airborne survey of active oil and gas facilities to quantitatively evaluate the capabilities and potential utility of the Bridger Photonics LiDAR-based airborne Gas Mapping LiDARTM (GML) methane measurement technology under realistic field conditions. Importantly, although Bridger Photonics knew there was a ground team working in the area to deploy wind sensors as part of the broader survey of facilities, they had no knowledge whatsoever that controlled releases were taking place and were not informed of this until all data processing was complete. Thus, the presented data allow a true, fully-blinded assessment of the airborne technology?s ability to both detect and locate unknown methane sources within active oil and gas facilities, as well as to quantify their release rates. Results were used to derive a lower-sensitivity limit threshold as a function of wind speed, which matches well with the broader field survey results. Comparison of measurement results with and without the benefit of on-site wind data reveal that uncertainty in the GML source quantification is a direct linear function of the uncertainty in the wind speed. Quantification uncertainties (1?) of ?31?68% can be expected for sources near the sensitivity limit. The derived sensitivity limit function was incorporated into exploratory simulations using the Fugitive Emissions Abatement Simulation Toolkit (FEAST), which suggest that the Bridger GML technology has comparable performance to optical gas imaging (OGI) camera surveys both in terms of fraction of total emissions detected and anticipated net mitigation. The relative performance of the Bridger GML technology would be expected to improve or worsen as the assumed underlying distribution of source magnitudes becomes more or less positively skewed (i.e. more or less dominated by larger sources such as tank vents). Overall, the Bridger GML technology is shown to be capable of detecting, locating, and quantifying individual sources at or below the magnitudes of recent regulated venting limits. The presented detection sensitivity function will be useful for modelling potential alternate leak detection and repair strategies and interpreting future airborne measurement data.

AB Recent advances in remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have improved the capabilities of monitoring large-scale Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). However, SIF observations are subject to directional effects which can lead to considerable uncertainties in various applications. Practical approaches for normalizing directional SIF observations to nadir viewing, to minimize the directional effects, have not been well studied. Here we developed two practical and physically-solid approaches for removing the directional effects of anisotropic SIF observations: one is based on near-infrared or red reflectance of vegetation (NIRv and Red(v)), and the other is based on the kernel-driven model with multi-angular SIF measurements. The first approach uses surface reflectance while the second approach directly leverages multi-angular SIF measurements. The performance of the two approaches was evaluated using a dataset of multi-angular measurements of SIF and reflectance collected with a high-resolution field spectrometer over different plant canopies. Results show that the relative mean absolute errors between the normalized nadir SIF and the observed SIF at nadir decrease by 3-6% (far-red) and 6-8% (red) for the first approach, and by 7-13% and 6-11% for the second approach, compared to the original data, respectively. The effectiveness and simplicity of our proposed approaches provide great potential to generate long-term and consistent SIF data records with minimized directional effects.

AB Planned satellite launches will provide open access and operational L-band radar data streams at space-time resolutions not previously available. To further prepare, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) platform was used to observe cropland sites across the southern United States to support the development of L-band (24 cm) prototype science products. Time series flights flew over four independent areas during the growing season of 2019 while crop ground measurements were collected. Major crops include corn, cotton, pasture, peanut, rice, and soybean. A suite of cropland classification experiments applied a set of machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest, feedforward fully connected neural network, support vector machine), the recently developed Multi-temporal Binary Tree Classification (MBTC), and a phenology (Coefficient of Variation; CoV) approach to synergistically assess performance, scattering mechanisms, and limitations. Specific objectives of this research application included 1.) evaluation of L-band mapping performance across multiple independent agricultural production areas with field scale training data, and 2.) assessment of the CoV approach for the generation of prototype NISAR Level 2 science products. Collectively, SAR terms with sensitivity to volume scattering performed well and consistently across CoV mapping experiments achieving accuracy greater than 80% for cropland vs not cropland. Dynamic phenology classes, such as herbaceous wetlands, had some confusion with CoV agriculture requiring further regionalized training optimization. Volume scattering and cross-pol terms were most useful across the different ML techniques with overall accuracy and Kappa consistently over 90% and 0.85, respectively, for crop type by late growth stages for L-band observations. As expected, time series information was more valuable compared to any single ML technique, site, or crop schema. Ultimately, as more SAR platforms launch, the user community should leverage physical contributions of different wavelengths and polarizations along with growing open access time series for efficient and meaningful agricultural products.

AB Most previous studies of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have focused solely on their controlling factors on a seasonal/annual timescale, while the controls on daily variations are largely unknown. By extracting the daily variations of nighttime SUHI features using the Gaussian model and investigating their correlations with various explanatory factors, we have attempted to determine the controls on SUHIs on a daily-basis over Chinese cities. Specific controls of weather conditions on the intensity, extent, shape, and centroid of the SUHIs were identified. Our results show that: (1) SUHI intensity (SUHII) was considerably more sensitive to weather conditions than the SUHI footprint (i.e., extent, shape, and centroid). (2) Meteorological variables including relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, and aerosol optical depth, had the greatest impact on SUHI intensity; whereas factors related to temperature fluctuations (day-to-day fluctuations of surface and air temperature) were the main factors influencing SUHI extent, shape, and the direction in which SUHI centroid varies. (3) Antecedent precipitation substantially impacted the subsequent SUHIs under clear-skies, changing both the SUHI itself and its sensitivity to other factors. Typically, the clear-sky SUHIs directly following rainfall showed a higher dependence on the relative humidity, soil moisture and aerosol, but were less affected by wind. (4) The meteorological contributions to the daily nighttime SUHIIs varied among Chinese cities with different bioclimatic conditions. In general, they were stronger in temperate zones than in subtropical zones. Our results provide an improved understanding of the controls on SUHIs on a daily timescale, as well as a foundation for predicting daily SUHIs based on the influencing meteorological variables.

TI A novel approach for quantifying high-frequency urban land cover changes
   at the block level with scarce clear-sky Landsat observations

AB High-frequency and complex transitions are two important characteristics of urban land cover changes (ULCCs). However, the change magnitude and duration of ULCCs have rarely been discussed in the context of high-frequency ULCCs. Moreover, previous models for quantifying high-frequency changes commonly required numerous clear-sky observations. Such requirement is difficult to be satisfied in widespread cloud-prone cities. Considering these characteristics of ULCCs and data availability, we developed a novel approach that can comprehensively quantify ULCCs with relatively limited data. The approach successfully integrated two commonly used approaches in change detection, namely temporal segmentation and trajectory classification. In addition, sparse clear-sky observations were used in the time series of fractional land cover (TSFLC). Specifically, we first conducted classifications for each year, and then extracted the TSFLC from each block. Second, we used temporal segmentation to segment the TSFLC based on the local change trend. Third, we classified the segments of time series by trajectory classification, and recorded the change information. The proposed approach can provide comprehensive details for ULCCs including the frequency of changes during the observation time, the transition, the change time, and the change magnitude for each change. The approach quantifies multiple changes with a slightly higher accuracy (93.33%) than that of previous approaches for only one change (91.00%). The categories/ transitions of ULCC were also quantified, with an accuracy of 81.67%. Moreover, the approach effectively monitored ULCCs in a cloud-prone city and successfully captured and analyzed two common transitions, block construction and urban renewal. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing complete and accurate ULCC information with scarce clear-sky observations.

AB Grasslands are valuable carbon sinks in the effort to mitigate climate change. However, they are not well protected and are consequently being replaced by agricultural systems worldwide. Current monitoring efforts using remote sensing and ground-based methods are insufficient, and accordingly the mapping of grassland to cropland conversions must be improved to better document these changes in the Canadian Prairies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate different structural break methods and remote sensing datasets for their temporal accuracy in detecting grassland conversions in two Alberta study areas from 2010 to 2018. Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), BFAST Seasonal and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality and Trend (BEAST) methods were applied to evaluate their sensitivity to rangeland and pasture conversions. The best model was BFAST Seasonal, correctly predicting the year of change for 76% of rangelands and 66% of pastures. This demonstrates that seasonal models are effective in detecting interannual changes in vegetation composition amidst background noise from climate and management induced phenological changes. MODIS data outperformed Landsat, outlining the importance of high temporal resolution remote sensing data to successful change detection, even at the expense of higher spatial resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates that structural break methods are effective in identifying grassland to agriculture transitions and may be useful for the operational monitoring of grassland inventories in the future.

AB Imaging spectroscopy provides the opportunity to monitor nutrient status of vegetation. In crops, prior studies have generally been limited in scope, either to a small wavelength range (e.g., 400-1300 nm), a small number of crop cultivars, a single growth stage or single growing season. Methods that are not time- or site-specific are needed to use imaging spectroscopy for routine monitoring of crop status. Using data from four cultivars of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), three growth stages and two growing seasons, we demonstrate the capacity of full-range (400-2350 nm) imaging spectroscopy to quantify nutrient status (petiole nitrate, whole leaf and vine total nitrogen) and predict tuber yield in potatoes across cultivars, growth stages and growing seasons. We specifically tested the capabilities of: (1) ordinary least-squares regression (OLSR) using traditional hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs); (2) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using full spectrum (400-2350 nm), VNIR-(visible-to-near infrared: 400-1300 nm) or SWIR-only (shortwave infrared: 1400-2350 nm) wavelengths; (3) predictive models developed for one potato type or planting season on withheld data from a different type or season. Our results show that OLSR models produced poor predictions with data from all dates pooled together (validation R-2 < 0.01). Single-date OLSR models performed better (R-2 = 0.20-0.60, relative RMSE = 15-30%). PLSR models performed well and were comparable using different spectral regions (full-spectrum, VNIR-only and SWIR-only), with validation R-2 = 0.68-0.82 and RRMSE = 12-25%. Testing across potato types, models produced reliable predictions (R-2 = 0.45-0.75, RRMSE = 13-30%), but with some bias. Cross-season models had validation R-2 = 0.46-0.75 and RRMSE = 17-100%, with a more significant bias than the cross-potato type models. To achieve models that are generalizable and robust, we recommend: (1) obtaining ground measurements that capture the full range of plant growth conditions and developmental stages, and (2) ensuring that image processing approaches minimize spectral discrepancies among dates.

TI PROSPECT-PRO for estimating content of nitrogen-containing leaf proteins

AB Models of radiative transfer (RT) are important tools for remote sensing of vegetation, allowing for forward simulations of remotely sensed data as well as inverse estimation of biophysical and biochemical traits from vegetation optical properties. Estimation of foliar protein content is the key to monitor the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in particular to assess the photosynthetic capacity of plants and to improve nitrogen management in agriculture. However, until now physically based leaf RT models have not allowed for proper spectral decomposition and estimation of leaf dry matter as nitrogen-based proteins and other carbon-based constituents (CBC) from optical properties of fresh and dry foliage. Such an achievement is the key for subsequent upscaling to canopy level and for development of new Earth observation applications.
   Therefore, we developed a new version of the PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates the nitrogen-based constituents (proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, starch and sugars). PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset, accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an iterative model inversion optimization algorithm and identified the optimal spectral ranges for retrieval of proteins and CBC. When combining leaf reflectance and transmittance within the selected optimal spectral domains, PROSPECT-PRO inversions revealed similarly accurate CBC estimates of fresh and dry leaf samples (respective validation R-2 = 0.96 and 0.95, NRMSE = 9.6% and 13.4%), whereas a better performance was obtained for fresh than for dry leaves when estimating proteins (respective validation R-2 = 0.79 and 0.57, NRMSE = 15.1% and 26.1%). The accurate estimation of leaf constituents for fresh samples is attributed to the optimal spectral feature selection procedure.
   We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that both PROSPECT PRO and PROSPECT-D inversions were able to produce comparable LMA estimates across an independent dataset gathering 1685 leaf samples (validation R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE = 16.5% for PROSPECT-PRO, and R-2 = 0.90 and NRMSE =18.3% for PROSPECT-D). Findings also revealed that PROSPECT-PRO is capable of assessing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio based on the retrieved CBC-to-proteins ratio (R-2 = 0.87 and NRMSE = 15.7% for fresh leaves, and R-2 = 0.65 and NRMSE= 28.1% for dry leaves). The performance assessment of newly designed PROSPECT-PRO demonstrates a promising potential for its involvement in precision agriculture and ecological applications aiming at estimation of leaf carbon and nitrogen contents from observations of current and forthcoming airborne and satellite imaging spectroscopy sensors.

AB Quantitative estimates of the flux, transportation, and burial of riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) in estuaries and shelf areas are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle in marginal seas. The complexity of the hydrodynamic environment and estuarine processes in the Changjiang River estuary (CRE) results in a POC flux with high spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we proposed a new method for time series monitoring of riverine POC flux by combining satellite ocean color and numerical modeling data. We used 500-m resolution geostationary satellite data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to retrieve surface POC concentrations in the CRE and used the numerical Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to simulate three-dimensional (3D) current and sediment distribution. Diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in POC flux through the lower reaches (Datong Hydrological Station), upper estuary (Xuliujing Hydrological Station), and outlets of the CRE, as well as transportation and deposition outside the CRE, were examined from July 2011 to June 2018. The annual mean POC fluxes through the Datong, Xuliujing, and outlet sections were 1.16 +/- 0.16 Tg C/yr, 1.29 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, and 1.17 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, respectively. After passing through the estuary, 35.2% of POC was deposited in the sandbar outside the outlets, 52.9% was transported to the south, and a small amount entered the eastern shelf. Thus, these results indicated that POC flux through the river and estuary sections differed from the effective riverine POC flux into the sea. The proposed method combining high spatiotemporalresolution satellite data and numerical modeling not only makes full use of their advantages, but also reduces the uncertainty of their individual estimates. This approach also supports long-term monitoring of riverine fluxes to the sea and helps clarify the effects of terrestrial inputs on marginal seas under multiple stresses from human activities and climate change.
