AB Geospatial resources, including satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, have been instrumental in providing time-sensitive information about the extent and impact of natural hazard events, such as floods, to support emergency response and hazard management efforts. In effect, finite resources can be better optimized to support the needs of often extensively affected areas. However, the derivation of SAR-based flood information is not without its challenges and inaccurate flood detection can result in poor decision-making and non-trivial, adverse consequences. Reliable uncertainty quantification of flood extent estimates addresses this risk. In this context, our study presents the results of two probabilistic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adapted for SAR-based water segmentation with freely available Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) swath ground range detected (GRD) data. In particular, the performance of a variational inference-based Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) is evaluated against that of a Monte Carlo dropout network (MCDN). In previous studies where uncertainty information has been generated along with segmentation results, MCDN has been more commonly applied as an approximation of Bayesian deep learning. Differences between the two approaches are highlighted with the application of a set of extended performance metrics. Both segmentation and uncertainty outputs are evaluated at data-, model-, tile-and scene-levels. The methods are demonstrated on the binary segmentation of a reference water dataset. We show that while different probabilistic techniques return comparable segmentation accuracies, they are differentiated based on their performance in assigning reliable probabilities. In particular, MCDNs characterized by more restrictive architectures generally lead to over-confident prediction intervals, whereas BCNNs have greater flexibility to learn the mean and the spread of the parameter posterior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that examining the (inaccurate, certain) metric is a better indicator of reliable uncertainty quantification and the BCNN is recommended to quantify uncertainties asso-ciated with SAR-based segmentation outputs. This information is especially valuable where the cost of inaccurate detections (false-positive and false-negative) is high. These preliminary findings highlight how the manner in which probabilities are properly assigned and their inclusion are instrumental and complementary to the pro-duction of flood masks and should be considered as a standard in the natural hazards domain.

AB Net shortwave radiation (NSR) plays an essential role in surface energy budget and has been reported to exhibit low estimation accuracy when ignoring topographic effects. Several algorithms have been developed to estimate clear-sky NSR in mountains, but none have estimated NSR in mountainous terrain under all-sky (i.e., both clear and cloudy) conditions. Moreover, surface heterogeneity is considerable in mountains, and coarse-spatial -resolution satellites may not provide sufficient details for fine-scale applications. In this study, to address these challenges, we developed a method for fine-spatial-resolution (i.e., from 20 m to 30 m resolution) all-sky NSR estimation in mountains directly from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations with mountainous radiative transfer scheme (herein denoted 'TOPO'). For comparison, we also created the model neglecting topography (herein called 'FLAT'). The validation of the TOPO model in complex terrain against Chengde ground-based pyrometers in China was good, with an R2 of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 80.9 W/m2, which was an improvement of 46.1% (reduction of RMSE) against the FLAT model. Meanwhile, the consistency of NSR generated from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 using TOPO model was satisfactory. Time-series comparisons of NSR derived from TOPO and FLAT models showed that topographic effects were substantial both in clear sky (maximum deviation of 643.4 W/m2) and cloudy sky (270.2 W/m2) when NSR estimates from the two models were compared. The evaluation of the FLAT model with a dataset simulated from the mountainous radiative transfer (created for the TOPO model) showed that neglecting topographic effects over mountainous terrain could lead to RMSEs of 541.7 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 159.5%) and 201.4 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 217.1%) for NSR estimation under clear and cloudy skies, respectively. This study provides a straightforward method of deriving fine-spatial-resolution all-sky NSR with topographic consideration, which can be further extended to the global mapping of NSR over mountainous terrain.

AB Recently, large efforts have been made to develop surface soil moisture (SSM) products based on observations from passive microwave L-band satellites at the global scale. Despite vast previous efforts to assess satellite SSM products based on in situ data, the performance of L-band SSM products remains still little known over the tropical areas including the rainforests. To close this knowledge gap, a comprehensive evaluation of five L-band SSM products from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites, including SMOS-IC, SMAP SCA-V, DCA, and MTDCA, as well as the recently developed SMAP INRAEBORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) was conducted in tropical areas from 2015 to 2020. The investigation was implemented by using in situ observations, and expanded by the Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA) and double instrumental variable (IVd) methods. The results revealed that all the five L-band SSM products show a good capacity to estimate SSM in most moderately vegetated areas of the tropical areas while they exhibit some uncertainties in dense vegetation (e.g., rainforests). The SSM climatology of the five L-band products in rainforests agreed generally well with that of in situ measurements especially for SMOS-IC (R = 0.75), followed by SMAP-IB (R = 0.72). Notably, the newly developed SMAP-IB shows satisfactory performance in the tropics with the highest R of 0.73 and the smallest unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.041 m(3)/m(3) from the study based on in situ SM data, and R of >0.81 from the combined TCA/IVd method in most vegetation conditions. SMAP-DCA SSM demonstrates comparable performance to SMAP-SCA-V (R = 0.66) from the in situ based analysis. This study is expected to deepen our understanding on the skill of L-band SSM products in tropical areas and further promote possible upgrades in algorithms and applications in these regions.

AB A sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieval model for coastal regions (0-200 km) is here proposed using a deep neural network (DNN) which demonstrates the capability of the DNN model to retrieve SSS. The rain filters are applied to the Aquarius observation data and SSS data used in this paper when there is heavy rainfall. Then, Aquarius V5 L2 observation data and hybrid coordinate ocean model SSS (HYCOM SSS) data are used to train the model, and the grid search and 10-fold cross-validation method is used to obtain optimal model parameters. After screening, a DNN model with three hidden layers and 30, 40, and 50 neurons in each layer is constructed. The performance of the proposed DNN model is then estimated and analyzed using independent testing data. We compared the SSS retrieval results with different types of salinity data sources. Compared to in-situ SSS, the retrieved SSS root mean squares error (RMSE) is 0.35 and the mean bias (MB) is 0.01. The RMSE and MB of retrieved SSS are reduced by 0.14 and 0.03 than those of the Aquarius Remote Sensing Systems (Aquarius RSS) SSS, and 0.31 and 0.03 than those of the Aquarius Combined Active-Passive (Aquarius CAP) SSS. Results show that our DNN model had better performance than Aquarius official in most coastal regions. Our results provide a dependable reference for SSS retrievals in global coastal regions.

AB The global monthly equivalent water height (EWH) anomaly (dEWH), derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) level-2 data, helps understand the terrestrial water storage variation. Unfortu-nately, the dEWH data consist of stripes or noise. Numerous de-noising approaches have been studied. However, the following issues exist, possible overly smoothed results, two-step (de-striping and Gaussian-based smoothing) procedures introducing additional uncertainty and error propagation, requiring multi-temporal datasets or prior knowledge, and possible computational inefficiency. Thus, after analyzing the spectrum of the dEWH data, a novel low-pass-filtering algorithm is proposed to remove the noise and resolve the issues. Furthermore, without the global in situ measurements, an alternative assessment method is studied based on the additive character-istics of the signal and noise in the GRACE data. The method consists of the residual analysis and root mean square (RMS) value of the de-noised signal. Then, the proposed algorithm was applied to de-noising the dEWH datasets between 2002 and 2015. De-noised results are satisfactory qualitatively and quantitatively. Compared with well-known two-step de-noising methods, data blurring does not occur after the proposed algorithm. The algorithm removes noise the most assessed by the residual analysis and preserves the signal the most evaluated by large RMS values.

AB The discipline of land change science has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. Remote sensing played a major role in one of the essential components of land change science, which includes observation, monitoring, and characterization of land change. In this paper, we proposed a new framework of the multifaceted view of land change through the lens of remote sensing and recommended five facets of land change including change location, time, target, metric, and agent. We also evaluated the impacts of spatial, spectral, temporal, angular, and data-integration domains of the remotely sensed data on observing, monitoring, and characterization of different facets of land change, as well as discussed some of the current land change products. We recommend clarifying the specific land change facet being studied in remote sensing of land change, reporting multiple or all facets of land change in remote sensing products, shifting the focus from land cover change to specific change metric and agent, integrating social science data and multi-sensor datasets for a deeper and fuller understanding of land change, and recognizing limitations and weaknesses of remote sensing in land change studies.

AB Satellites have generated extensive data of remote sensing reflectance spectra (Rrs(lambda)) covering diverse water classes or types across global waters. Spectral classification of satellite Rrs(lambda) data allows for the distinguishing and grouping of waters with characteristic bio-optical/biogeochemical features that may influence the produc-tivity of a given water body. This study reports new satellite water class products (Level-2 and Level-3) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We developed and implemented a hyperspectral scheme that accounts for the Rrs(lambda) spectral shapes and globally resolves oceanic, coastal, and inland waters into 23 water classes. We characterized the light absorption and scattering coefficients, chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient, and suspended particulate matter for individual water classes. It is shown that the water classes are separable by their distinct bio-optical and biogeochemical properties. Furthermore, validation result suggests that the VIIRS water class products are accurate globally. Finally, we examined the spatial and temporal variability of the water classes in case studies for a demonstration of applications. The water class data in open oceans reveal that the subtropical ocean gyres have experienced dramatic expansion over the last decade. In addition, the water class data appear to be a valuable (and qualitative) indicator for water quality in coastal and inland waters with compelling evidence. We stress that this new satellite product is an excellent addition to the aquatic science database, despite the need for continuous improvement toward perfection.

AB ESA's Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS, since 2009) and NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, since 2015) are the only two space-borne L-band radiometer missions currently in orbit, which provide key infor-mation on global surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (via the vegetation optical depth, VOD). However, to date very few studies considered merging SMOS and SMAP for both SM and VOD retrievals simultaneously. This study presents the first global long-term and continuous SM and L-band VOD (L-VOD) dataset retrieved after merging the SMOS and SMAP brightness temperature (TB) observations, called the SMOS-SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX or SMOSMAP-IB product. We first developed a fitted SMOS TB dataset at a fixed incidence angle of 40 degrees, and next applied a monthly linear rescaling of SMAP TB to SMOS TB for each polarization to produce a merged SMOS/SMAP TB (theta = 40 degrees) dataset. The retrievals were then based on a mono-angular retrieval algorithm sharing a similar forward model with the SMOS-IC and the official SMOS retrieval algo-rithms. Results showed that the inter-calibration approach we used here could effectively remove the bias be-tween the SMAP TB and fitted SMOS TB, with bias values reduced to 0.01 K (-0.02 K) compared to 3.45 K (1.65 K) for V (H) polarization before inter-calibration. The SMOSMAP-IB SM and L-VOD retrievals based on this new inter-calibrated SMOS/SMAP TB led to metrics that were equally good or better than those of other products (i.e., ESA CCI, SMOS-IC and the official SMAP products). When considering only long duration products, SMOSMAP-IB SM retrievals exhibited (i) the highest overall median R value of 0.72 with in-situ data from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) during 2013-2018, followed by SMOS-IC (R = 0.68) and CCI (R = 0.67), and (ii) the same smallest ubRMSD values as CCI (ubRMSD = 0.057 m3/m3 vs 0.061 m3/m3 for SMOS-IC). L-VOD retrievals from SMOSMAP-IB were found to have comparable spatial and temporal skills to SMOS-IC. Spatially, they both correlated well with aboveground biomass (R = 0.87), and temporally, they both showed a good representation of the short vegetation NDVI signal and of the forest area loss in the Brazilian Amazon from 2011 to 2019. Developing SMOSMAP-IB is a step forward towards building a time-continuous L-band SM and VOD products in response to the possible failure of one of the SMOS or SMAP sensors in the future.

AB Vegetation phenology is one of the most sensitive indicators to environmental and climate changes. In order to characterize the seasonal variation in relatively pure or homogenous vegetation types, fine spatial resolution satellite data (<= 30 m), such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, or Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), have been increasingly applied to detect land surface phenology (LSP). However, the most critical challenge in LSP detections is the gaps in temporal satellite observations caused by noise and persistent cloud/snow cover. Therefore, this study presented a novel algorithm for generating synthetic gap-free time series at the field scale (30 m) for LSP detections. Specifically, we first developed a framework to establish a large collection of temporal shapes of vegetation growth with as many as 100 grid-based Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) time series in a single PhenoCam site. For a given HLS pixel, the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series was matched and fused with the most comparable temporal GCC shape selected from the collection of PhenoCam GCC time series to generate a synthetic gap-free HLS-PhenoCam EVI2 time series, which was used to detect the 30 m phenometrics. The detected phenometrics were evaluated using manually selected and spatially matched GCC observations as well as phenology detections from HLS alone. The result indicates that the HLS-PhenoCam phenometrics are very close to the observations from PhenoCam network with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82-0.97, a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 2.8-3.5 days, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.5-4.0 days, and a mean systematic bias (MSB) of 0.1-2.2 days. The HLS-PhenoCam detections are significantly improved relative to the HLS phenometrics that have a statistic accuracy of R = 0.57-0.78, MAD = 6.4-9.3 days, RMSE = 8.8-13.9 days, MSB =-5.2-5.9 days. The difference between HLS-PhenoCam and HLS alone LSP detections over a HLS tile could be on average larger than two weeks if high-quality observation (HQO) proportion in the annual HLS time series is <10%, which exponentially reduces with the increase of HQO in HLS observations. The an-alyses in this study suggest that the gap-free HLS-PhenoCam time series is able to be generated for producing high-quality phenology datasets across a local and regional scale, to bridge near-surface PhenoCam observations with satellite observations data at various scales, and to be used as a scalable phenology dataset for the validation of global MODIS and VIIRS LSP products.

AB Mediterranean forests are highly subjected to fire occurrence. Altered fire regimes resulting from changes in land use and climate may jeopardize their resilience to fire and induce changes in forest composition. Disentangling forest cover composition is therefore critical for understanding post-fire forest recovery dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate how fractional time series of different woody-vegetation types support the analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery in relation to the pre-fire situation for two burned areas in Mediterranean pine forests in Spain. We separately estimated tree, shrub and background (combining herbaceous, soil and rock) cover fractions on an annual basis (1990-2020) using Landsat Spectral-Temporal Metrics (STMs) and a regression-based unmixing approach. Our regression models effectively estimated fractions of the three cover types with Mean Absolute Errors ranging from 8.6% to 13.4% when comparing to a reference dataset derived from high-resolution orthophotos across 6 different years. Slightly overestimations of low cover fractions where found in tree and shrub cover fractions across the study sites. Despite these minor errors, time series of cover fractions revealed characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of different woody-vegetation types for burned and unburned areas. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Tree-Shrub Fraction index (NDTSF) to contrast tree cover fraction relative to the shrub cover and map post-fire shifts in composition. Annual maps of NDTSF revealed a high spatial and temporal variability and a general dynamic towards the pre-fire cover composition in 79-80% of burned areas but a shift from tree to shrub dominance in 12.3-15.4% 26 years after fire. Our regression-based unmixing approach advances the analysis of post-fire recovery dynamics, unravelling shifts in forest composition that are of major concern to forest management.

AB Soil moisture content (SMC) information at field scale could have important applications in agricultural and regional water management. This study presents an operationally applicable scheme for SMC retrieval over meadows from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma(0)) observations. We parameterized the vegetation scattering and absorption model developed at the Tor Vergata University of Rome (TV) and the integral equation method (IEM) surface scattering model for grass-covered soil surfaces. Leaf area index (LAI) estimates from a Sentinel-2 product provide field-scale vegetation information, as is demonstrated by validation against in situ measurements. The SMC retrieval scheme is applied with field-averaged Sentinel-1 sigma(0) observations from November 2015 to November 2018 and evaluated on 21 meadows against adjacent in situ station measurements, without (IEM) and with a vegetation correction (TV-IEM). Masking the IEM and TV-IEM SMC retrievals for dense vegetation conditions improves their performance, but this is a trade-off with the number of retrievals. By setting the SMC retrievals that exceed the upper retrieval limit of 0.75 m(3) m(-3) during the wet period to the maximum SMC, the performance metrics improve to mean Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.55 for IEM and 0.64 for TV-IEM, root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 0.14 m(3) m(-3) for IEM and 0.13 m(3) m(-3) for TV-IEM, and RMSDs relative to the range of the SMC references of 24 % for both IEM and TV-IEM. The slightly better SMC retrieval performance with TV-IEM is caused by invalid SMC retrievals under dense vegetation conditions, and the performance metrics for IEM and TV-IEM are practically equal by considering the same retrieval-reference pairs. The IEM and TV-IEM retrieval performances are also similar to the performances of two other Sentinel-1 based products at field scale. They are, on average, outperformed by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9 km and 36 km products evaluated at field scale, but these products are expected to deviate if larger regional differences are present and in field-specific situations.

AB The emission of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) is a pivotal process to infer vegetation health and functioning that can be monitored by remote sensing. However, most of the current remote sensing methods retrieve only F at top-of-canopy level, therefore making the link with physiological processes occurring at photosystem level not trivial. In this study, we develop a novel machine learning Fourier (phasor)-based algo-rithm to retrieve F both at canopy level and after considering the reabsorption (i.e. photosystem level), consistently with relevant biophysical variables, exploiting the canopy apparent reflectance spectra (Rapp). In particular, Rapp is divided in consecutive spectral windows, where the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is computed. Then, the DFT results in each window are exploited to estimate the fluorescence spectra and bio-physical parameters, together with their uncertainties, by means of a supervised machine learning algorithm coupled to a statistical-based retrieval pipeline. The algorithm has been trained through synthetic Rapp spectra, obtained from simulations based on a Radiative Transfer (RT) model. As a proof of concept, the theoretical approach is then applied to experimental data, acquired both from crops and forests, at close and high soil-sensor distance respectively, to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of biophysical and F parameters. In particular, for the first time Rapp is used to extract the temporal evolution of F at canopy and photosystem levels and its quantum efficiency together with different biophysical variables, during the growing season of two agricultural crops. Furthermore, tower-based solar-induced fluorescence measurements in a deciduous forest are exploited to evaluate the performance of our algorithm when the atmospheric reabsorption and scattering are not negligible. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated through a comparison with F spectra extracted from the state of the art SpecFit retrieval algorithm. This work promises a substantial advance toward a new accurate retrieval method for fluorescence signals and biophysical parameters at canopy and photosystem levels.

AB Red snow algal blooms reduce albedo and increase snowmelt, but little is known of their extent, duration, and radiative forcing. We calibrated an established index by comparing snow algal field spectroradiometer measurements with direct counts of algal cell abundance in British Columbia, Canada. We applied the field calibrated index to Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS/Terra images to monitor snow algae on the Vowell and Catamount Glaciers (Purcells, British Columbia) in summer 2020. The maximum extent of snow algal bloom cover was 1.4 and 2.0 km2 respectively, about one third of the total surface area of the two glaciers, making these among the largest contiguous bloom areas yet reported. Blooms were first detected following the onset of above-freezing temperatures in early July and persisted for about two months. Algal abundance increased through July, after which the red snow algal bloom area decreased due to snow cover loss. At their peak in late July the blooms reduced albedo by 0.04 +/- 0.01 on average. Snow algae caused an additional 5.25 & PLUSMN; 1.0 x 10(7) J/m2 of solar energy to be absorbed by the snowpack in July-August, which is enough energy to melt 31.5 cm of snow. This is equivalent to an average snow algal radiative forcing of 8.25 +/- 1.6 W/m2 through July and August. Our results suggest that the extent, duration, and radiative forcing of snow algal blooms are sufficient to enhance glacial melt rates.

AB The southeast Tibetan Plateau has become the region with the fastest rate of mass loss within High Mountain Asia (HMA), and the mass loss from lake-terminating glaciers in the region is the most significant. However, the evolution of the mass change of lake-terminating glaciers is still unclear, and accurate penetration depth estimates of C-band and X-band radar in glacierized areas are unknown, which greatly hinders the monitoring and understanding of the glacier evolution. Hence, in this study, taking the largest lake-terminating glacier in HMA (the Yanong Glacier) as the study object, we first evaluated the X-band penetration depth using Ple ' iades and TanDEM-X data, and further combined the penetration depth difference between the C-band and X-band radar (1.14 +/- 0.14 m) to estimate the C-band penetration depth based on a newly proposed area-weighted strategy, according to surface categories. The results indicate a region-wide average penetration depth of 1.84 +/- 0.59 m and 2.98 +/- 0.61 m for the X-band and C-band radar, respectively, demonstrating either an underestimation of 60% or an overestimation of 202% for the previous C-band penetration corrections. On this basis, we determined the multi-temporal glacier mass balance for the Yanong Glacier, using KH-9, SRTM DEM, SPOT-7, and multi-orbit TanDEM-X data. The results show that the Yanong Glacier has been in a state of serious mass loss (at a rate of -0.73 +/- 0.13 m w.e./a) during 1974-2015, and the rate of mass loss has doubled since 2000 (i.e., -0.48 +/- 0.20 (1974-2000), -0.95 +/- 0.20 (2000-2012), and - 1.02 +/- 0.53 m w.e./a (2012-2015)). Moreover, the interannual mass change has shown a highly volatile and accelerating trend during 2012-2015 (i.e., -0.47 +/- 0.85 (2011-2012), -0.87 +/- 0.66 (2012-2013), -1.26 +/- 0.72 (2013-2014), and - 1.58 +/- 0.44 m w.e./a (2014-2015)). By further analyzing the ERA5 reanalysis data and the changes in the proglacial lake and glacier dynamics, we can conclude that, qualitatively: 1) the long-term acceleration of mass loss at the Yanong Glacier has mainly been controlled by climate change, but has also been affected by the glacier dynamics to a limited extent; and 2) the inter-annual acceleration of mass loss has, to some extent, been affected by subglacial/englacial melting. The findings of this study will not only provide an accurate penetration depth correction for future relevant studies, but will also significantly improve the understanding of the evolution of lake-terminating glaciers in HMA and other high mountain areas of the world.

AB The European Space Agency (ESA) Snow Climate Change Initiative (CCI+) provides long-term, global time series of daily snow cover fraction and snow water equivalent (SWE). The Snow CCI+ SWE Version 1 (CCIv1) product is built on the GlobSnow algorithm, which combines passive microwave (PMW) data with in situ snow depth (SD) measurements to estimate SWE. While CCIv1 remains algorithmically similar to the most recent GlobSnow product (GlobSnow Version 3), Snow CCI+ SWE Version 2 (CCIv2) incorporates two notable differences. CCIv2 uses updated PMW data from the NASA MEaSUREs Calibrated Passive Microwave Daily EASE-Grid 2.0 Earth Science Data Record and is generated in EASE-Grid 2.0 with 12.5 km grid spacing. It also adjusts SWE retrievals in post-processing by incorporating spatially and temporally varying snow density information. Due to the phased product development framework CCI+ employs, proposed changes between CCIv1 and CCIv2 were implemented in a series of step-wise developmental datasets. Using these developmental datasets, we analyze how changes to input PMW and SD data and the snow density parameterization affect the resulting SWE product. Using in situ snow courses as reference data, we demonstrate that the correlation and RMSE of the CCIv2 developmental product improved 18% (0.10) and 12% (5 mm), respectively, relative to CCIv1. The timing of peak snow mass is shifted two weeks later and a temporal discontinuity in the monthly northern hemisphere snow mass time series associated with the shift from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) in 2009 is also removed.

In this study, we explored structure-function relationships across a variety of degradation levels in the southern Brazilian Amazon by 1) investigating how forest structural properties vary as a function of degradation history using airborne lidar data; 2) assessing the effects of degradation on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) seasonality using TROPOMI data; and 3) quantifying the contribution of structural variables to SIF using multiple regression models with stepwise se-lection of lidar metrics. Forest degradation history was obtained through Landsat time-series classification. We found that fire, logging, and time since disturbance were major determinants of forest structure, and that forests affected by fires experienced larger variability in leaf area index (LAI), canopy height and vertical structure relative to logged and intact forests. Moreover, only recently burned forests showed significantly depressed SIF during the dry season compared to intact forests. Canopy height and the vertical distribution of foliage were the best predictors of SIF. Unexpectedly, we found that wet-season SIF was higher in active regenerating forests (~ 4 years after fires or logging) compared with intact forests, despite lower LAI. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in anthropogenically disturbed tropical forests and indicate that they can capture large amounts of carbon while recovering.

AB In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been successfully used in estimating downward shortwave radiation (DSR). To achieve global estimations, traditional ML models need sufficient ground measurements covering various atmospheric and surface conditions globally, which is difficult to accomplish. Training on the simulated data of a radiative transfer model (RTM) is a possible solution, but widely used RTMs ignore some complex cloud conditions which brings bias to simulations. In this study, a neural network applied with the transfer-learning (TL) concept is introduced to utilize both radiative transfer simulations and ground measurement data, achieving global DSR estimation with only top-of-atmosphere and surface albedo at local solar noon as inputs. The proposed method estimates both instantaneous and daily DSR from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at 750-m resolution, and both the estimates are validated by 40 independent stations globally. The root mean-square error and relative root mean square error of instantaneous DSR validation over 25 Baseline Surface Radiation Network, seven Surface Radiation Network, and eight Greenland Climate Network stations in 2013 were 91.2 (16.1%), 106.3 (18.3%), 75.0 (24.2%) W/m2, respectively, and the daily validation achieved 30.8 (15.5%), 33.5 (17.6%), and 31.3 (14.4) W/m2, respectively. The proposed method presents significant high accuracy over polar regions and similar performances over other areas compared with traditional ML models, physics models (e.g., look-up tables and direct estimations), and existing DSR products. The algorithm is also applied to VIIRS swath data to test its global efficacy. Instantaneous mapping captures the spatial pattern of the cloud-mask product, and daily mapping shows spatial patterns similar to the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and clouds product, but with more detail. Further analysis indicates that model performance is less sensitive to the quantity of training data after TL has been incorporated. This study demonstrates the advantages of TL on boosting both the generality and accuracy of DSR estimation, which can potentially be applied to other variable retrievals.

AB Surface albedo is a key parameter in the surface energy balance and has been identified as a primary essential climate variable (ECV). Variations in surface albedo can be used as a diagnostic tool for local climate change. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the impacts of land cover conversion due to increasing anthropogenic demands can be examined using surface albedo changes. Most of the previous studies of albedo in cities have relied on coarse-resolution datasets with short time spans and have disregarded continuous monitoring. In addition, it is still unclear which urbanization processes are involved and what effects they have on surface albedo over long time periods. This study aimed to identify the contribution of increasing urbanization to the regional climate by analyzing spatial and temporal changes in surface albedo. Assigning albedo values to land cover types is useful for determining the level of transformation and their impacts in various Chinese cities that underwent specific evolutions between 1986 and 2018. The Direct Estimation (DE) approach was modified to estimate the daily mean surface albedo at 30 m based on Landsat observations. It resulted root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of less than 0.044 and bias about 0.006 between observations and model estimations. Such accuracy obtained after correcting the orbital drift of the Landsat satellite, was deemed satisfactory for detecting potential changes in albedo. Major findings are: 1) A notable trend was found over the past 33 years of 11 major Chinese cities, i.e. population about 10 million and more, with a general albedo increase from satellite observations. The higher resolution Landsat dataset showed a trend 3 times larger than the Global Land Surface Satellites (GLASS) product, which outlines the need for analyzing high resolution imagery in priority for reliable estimate of albedo over heterogeneous urban landscapes. 2) An increase in albedo infers a negative radiative forcing at an average rate of -2.771 W/m2 per decade, thereby indicating a cooling effect for most Chinese cities. 3) Changes in surface albedo were also closely linked to landscape transformation, clearly observed using the 30 m resolution of the Landsat data. 4) Throughout the study period, surface albedo exhibited a temporal U-shaped curve in built-up areas under development, with albedo peaks in old and newly built districts and a decrease in albedo between the two eras.

AB The freshwater scarcity and sustainability of overexploited aquifers have been recognized as a big threat to global water security for human development. Consequently, much research has focused in the past on negative consequences of groundwater abstraction, but somewhat less has been documented about the impacts of adequate management practices to address water shortages. Here, using an integrated analysis of InSAR displacement data, groundwater, and geophysical modeling we show how combined management provisions and inter-basin water transfer project has affected the aquifer system in Taiyuan basin in North China. Following groundwater recovery, the alleviation of land subsidence was found with rates being reduced by up to similar to 70% in the period 2017-2020 with respect to the period 2007-2010. The increase in pore pressure caused by rising groundwater in Taiyuan city, north of the basin, turned four subsidence centers with rates exceeding 110 mm/yr in the 1980 to uplift centers with rates up to +25 mm/yr between 2017 and 2020. A simple linear elastic model for homogenous subsurface properties can explain InSAR-measured surface displacements well. In the central basin, we found a significant seasonal displacement with annual amplitude up to 43 mm (negative peak in autumn and positive peak in spring) related to the groundwater recharge and discharge due to agricultural pumping irrigation. Using cross-wavelet method, we showed a relatively short time lags (less than one month) between surface deformation and water level changes in the central basin, indicating the low-permeability clayey units have a limited influence in delaying the compaction of aquifer system. Quantifying the effects of adequate groundwater management measures and large-scale engineering approaches like inter-basin water transfer to recharge pumped aquifers provide insight for local governments and decision-makers to properly evaluate the impacts of their policy in recovering the sustainability and efficiency of aquifers in water-deficient basins.

AB Coccolithophores are a key phytoplankton group with a major influence on the carbon cycle in global oceans. Understanding its phenological responses to climate change is vital, particularly in Arctic regions that are experiencing warming faster than the global average. Ocean color remote sensing is a powerful tool that provides the global distribution and spatial extent of coccolithophore blooms. However, remotely observing coccolithophore blooms in Arctic regions is challenged by severe conditions, such as heavy cloud cover. In this work, an ocean color index (CI)-based approach is developed to detect coccolithophore blooms in the Arctic Sea by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The optical properties of clouds and coccolithophore blooms are characterized by employing the band difference of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho R) at 412 and 469 nm (CI412-469) and 555 and 645 nm (CI555-645), respectively. A hybrid threshold is further determined to classify coccolithophore bloom and nonbloom waters. Results show that the algorithm can reduce the negative effects of heavy clouds and persistent fog on detecting coccolithophore blooms and increase the coverage of satellite observation. Compared with the traditional particulate inorganic carbon concentrationbased approach, the algorithm yields more coverage and frequency of coccolithophore blooms. Global evaluation reveals that the CI-based algorithm has great potential applications in global oceans and different ocean color sensors.

Daytime fire radiative power (FRP) detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was nearly evenly split (54% vs. 46%) between inside and outside wildfires from 2003 to 2020. In contrast, 94% of nighttime FRP was detected within wildfires, of which 95% was detected within large wildfires (> 2023 ha). Nighttime proportions (i.e., the proportion of total summed FRP detected by MODIS at night) were lowest (3%) outside wildfires when coincident 1000-hr fuel moistures were highest and vegetation fires were smaller and less intense. As 1000-hr fuel moistures decreased, MODIS active fire pixels shifted out of agricultural and prescribed fires and into wildfires with higher nighttime per-pixel values of FRP such that nighttime proportions peaked at 29% for the largest wildfires. Increases in nighttime proportions within larger wildfires were attributed to increases in nighttime persistence whereby under the driest conditions, daytime fire activity detected by MODIS was more likely to continue burning with sufficient vigour to be detected again at night. From 2003-2020, MODIS detected significant (p < 0.01) increasing trends in nighttime wildfire fire activity, with a +54%, +42% and +21% increase in the annual nighttime sum of FRP, annual nighttime active fire pixel counts and annual mean nighttime per-pixel values of FRP, respectively, detected in the latter half of the study period. Nighttime trends were corroborated using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) as well annual wildfire statistics reported by U.S. federal, state and local agencies. Moreover, MODIS detected a significant positive trend in the nighttime proportion of FRP emitted from wildfires, indicating that in the absence of diurnal differences in detection biases, increases in nighttime fire activity since 2003 have outpaced daytime increases. However an analysis of MODIS omission rates revealed that increasing nighttime proportions were at least partially attributed to a relatively greater improvement in nighttime detection performance compared to the daytime for larger wildfires burning during drier conditions. Nighttime fire activity already poses additional risks to firefighters and communities, and this work suggests that projected increases in the frequency of large wildfires will be accompanied by increases in the extent and intensity of nighttime fire activity.

AB The PROSPECT model, one of the most popular leaf radiative transfer models, has long been used for retrieving leaf biochemical traits from leaf directional-hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) spectra, while remains underexplored for applications to the leaf bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra to retrieve leaf biochemical traits. Existence of leaf surface reflectance and anisotropic property could be the main issues that constrain the applicability of the PROSPECT inversion to assess leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra. This study presents an inversion method by integrating the PROSPECT model with spectral derivatives and similarity metrics (SDM), called PROSDM, to remove the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra and retrieve leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra. Leaf BRF spectra and the corresponding contents of chlorophyll (Cab), carotenoid (Cxc), water (Cw), and dry matter (Cm) were obtained from ten datasets across a wide variety of plant species with varied growth stages, nutrition status, and planting regions. The datasets showed that the significant difference existed between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra, which varied with spectral wavelengths and plant species, and affected the accuracies of retrieving Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm. To eliminate the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra independent on wavelengths, spectral derivatives were applied. When the difference between BRF and DHRF spectra varied with wavelengths, spectral derivatives only removed part of the difference, and implementation of the Manhattan distance compensated the limitation of the spectral derivatives to further reduce the difference. As a result, the PROSDM outperformed the PROSPECT and PROCOSINE inversions as well as PROCWT to retrieve Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm from leaf BRF spectra with the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64 mu g/cm2 , 2.77 mu g/cm2 , 0.0041 g/cm2 , and 0.0024 g/cm2 , respectively. Significant improvements in the retrievals of Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm were obtained with the RMSEs reduced by 20.33%, 29.34%, 25.45%, and 44.19% compared to the PROSPECT inversion, respectively. It was further found that the model inversions were affected by the spectral saturation, PROSPECT versions, spectral subdomains, and the range of model parameters. The retrieval results by different inversion methods may be improved with the suitable spectral subdomains and range of model parameters. Importantly, the proposed PROSDM showed the great potential to alleviate these negative effects on the retrievals of Cab, Cxc, Cw, and Cm. The performance assessment of PROSDM demonstrates a promising potential for its applications in remote sensing aiming at retrievals of leaf biochemical traits from leaf BRF spectra

AB Although remote sensing (RS) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is increasingly used as a valuable source of information about vegetation photosynthetic activity, the RS SIF observations are significantly influenced by canopy-specific structural features (i.e., canopy architecture including leaf area index and presence of woody components), atmospheric conditions during their acquisition (e.g., proportion of direct and diffuse irradiance) and observational geometric configurations (e.g., sun and viewing directions). Radiative transfer (RT) models have the potential to provide a better understanding of the canopy structural effects on the SIF emission and RS signals. Here, we used the DART model to assess the daily influence, from morning to evening, of forest 3D architecture on SIF nadir radiance, emission, escape factor and nadir yield of eight 100 m x 100 m forest study plots established in a temperate deciduous forest of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (Edgewater, MD, USA). The 3D architecture of each plot was derived from airborne LiDAR. DART simulations of these 3D forest plots and their 1D (i.e., vertical profile of sun-adapted and shade-adapted leaves) and 0D (i.e., homogeneous layer of sun-adapted leaves above an homogeneous layer of shade-adapted leaves) abstractions were compared to assess the relative errors (epsilon(1D-3D) and epsilon(0D-3D)) associated with horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity, respectively. Forest 3D structure, especially horizontal heterogeneity, had a great influence on forest nadir SIF radiance, resulting in epsilon(1D-3D) up to 55% at 8:00 and 18:00 (i.e., for oblique sun directions). The key indicators of this impact, in the descending order of importance, were the SIF escape factor (epsilon(1D-3D) up to 40%), the attenuation of incident photosynthetically active radiation (epsilon(1D-3D) less than 5%), and the SIF emission yield (epsilon(1D-3D) less than 2%). The influence of forest architecture on the nadir SIF escape factor and SIF yield (epsilon(1D-3D) up to 40%) varied over time, with differences in forest stand structure, and per spectral domain, being always larger between 640 and 700 nm than between 700 and 850 nm. In addition, woody elements demonstrated a large influence on forest SIF radiance due to their "shading" effect (epsilon up to 17%) and their "blocking" effect (epsilon approximate to 10%), both of them higher for far-red than for red SIF. These results underline the importance of 3D forest canopy architecture, especially 2D heterogeneity, and inclusion of woody elements in RT modeling used for interpretation of the RS SIF signal, and subsequently for the estimation of gross primary production and detection of vegetation stress.

AB This study aimed at estimating total forest above-ground net change (Delta AGB; Gg) over five years (2014-2019) based on model-assisted estimation utilizing freely available satellite imagery. The study was conducted for a boreal forest area (approx. 1.4 Mha) in Norway where bi-temporal national forest inventory (NFI), Sentinel-2, and Landsat data were available. Biomass change was modelled based on a direct approach. The precision of estimates using only the NFI data in a basic expansion estimator was compared to four different alternative model-assisted estimates using 1) Sentinel-2 or Landsat data, and 2) using bi- or uni-temporal remotely sensed data. We found that spaceborne optical data improved the precision of the purely field-based estimates by a factor of up to three. The most precise estimates were found for the model-assisted estimation using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 (standard error; SE = 1.7 Gg). However, the decrease in precision when using Landsat data was small (SE = 1.92 Gg). We also found that Delta AGB could be precisely estimated when remotely sensed data were available only at the end of the monitoring period. We conclude that satellite optical data can considerably improve Delta AGB estimates, when repeated and coincident field data are available. The free availability, global coverage, frequent update, and long-term time horizon make data from programs such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat a valuable data source for consistent and durable monitoring of forest carbon dynamics.

AB Urban areas, where more than 55% of the global population gathers, contribute more than 70% of anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2ff) emissions. Accurate quantification of CO2ff emissions from urban areas is of great importance for formulating global warming mitigation policies to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Satellite-based inversion techniques are unique among "top-down" approaches, potentially allowing us to track CO2ff emission changes over cities globally. However, their accuracy is still limited by incomplete background information, cloud blockages, aerosol contamination, and uncertainties in models and priori emission inventories. To evaluate the current potential of space-based quantification techniques, we present the first attempt to monitor long-term changes in CO(2ff )emissions based on the OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (X-CO2) over a fast-growing Asian metropolitan area: Lahore, Pakistan. We first examined the OCO-2 data availability at global scale. About 17% of OCO-2soundings over the global 70 most populated cities from 2014 to 2019 are marked as high-quality. Cloud blockage and aerosol contamination are the two main causes of data loss. As an attempt to recover additional soundings, we evaluated the effectiveness of OCO-2 quality flags at the city level by comparing three flux quantification methods (WRF-Chem, X-STILT, and the flux cross-sectional integration method). The satellite/bottom-up emissions (OCO-2/ODIAC) ratios of the high-quality tracks with reduced uncertainties in emissions are better agreed across the three methods compared to the all-data tracks. This demonstrates that OCO-2 quality flags are useful filters of low-quality OCO-2 retrievals at local scales. All three methods consistently suggested that the ratio medians are greater than 1, implying that the ODIAC slightly underestimated CO2ff emissions over Lahore. Additionally, our estimation of the a posteriori CO2ff emission trend was about 734 kt C/year (i.e., an annual 6.7% increase). 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Mann-Kendall upward trend test showed that less than 10% prior uncertainty for 8 tracks (or less than 20% prior uncertainty for 25 tracks) is required to achieve a greater-than-50% trend significant possibility at a 95% confidence level. It implies that the trend is driven by the prior and not due to the assimilation of OCO-2 retrievals. The key to improving the role of satellite data in CO2 emission trend detection lies in collecting more frequent high-quality tracks near metropolitan areas to achieve significant constraints from X-CO2 retrievals.

AB In 2015 and 2016, the AfriSAR campaign was carried out as a collaborative effort among international space and National Park agencies (ESA, NASA, ONERA, DLR, ANPN and AGEOS) in support of the upcoming ESA BIOMASS, NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) and NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Initiative (GEDI) missions. The NASA contribution to the campaign was conducted in 2016 with the NASA LVIS (Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor) Lidar, the NASA L-band UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar). A central motivation for the AfriSAR deployment was the common AGBD estimation requirement for the three future spaceborne missions, the lack of sufficient airborne and ground calibration data covering the full range of ABGD in tropical forest systems, and the intercomparison and fusion of the technologies. During the campaign, over 7000 km2 of waveform Lidar data from LVIS and 30,000 km2 of UAVSAR data were collected over 10 key sites and transects. In addition, field measurements of forest structure and biomass were collected in sixteen 1-hectare sized plots. The campaign produced gridded Lidar canopy structure products, gridded aboveground biomass and associated uncertainties, Lidar based vegetation canopy cover profile products, Polarimetric Interferometric SAR and Tomographic SAR products and field measurements.

AB Soil moisture content (SMC) has been widely focused and studied in various fields of research, including atmosphere-land water/energy exchange, drought, and vegetation-related topics. Many indices and models have been proposed to illustrate the reflectance features changing with SMC, and to estimate SMC from the reflectance of narrow bands and broadbands, using lab, field, airborne and satellite data. These methods/indices were mostly developed for all levels of SMCs, from saturated to air-dry; however, we found that a single relationship mapping saturated to air-dry can lead to a false impression of accurate estimation. The inconsistency of a regression relationship between spectral reflectance features and SMCs over the whole drying process results in a low estimation accuracy for relatively low SMCs. In this study, a segmentation method is proposed with the goal of a more accurate SMC estimate. The whole drying process of three soil samples, representing varied soil characteristics, is monitored, and the transition points are determined by evaporation rate change (as stage-1 drying with high SMC and stage-2 drying with low SMC). An index, the shortwave normalized index (SNI), is built for SMC estimation, and the SNI index trend during drying is supported by a radiative transfer-based model. As validated, the SNI index is capable of SMC estimates, and the segmentation method improves estimation accuracy astonishingly compared with current methods.

AB Random error in remotely sensed (RS) and modeled soil moisture (SM) products is typically assumed to be statistically stationary for the purpose of SM merging applications. In reality, such error is often non-stationary, which may undermine applications based on a stationary assumption. Here, we introduce a dual time-space (2D) SM merging approach that considers a class of inferred error that is non-stationary and undetectable in time (or space) but stationary and detectable in space (or time). Such 2D merging is realized in a least-squares framework where spatial and temporal error variances for each product are estimated via a triple collocation (TC) analysis. As a test case, a 2D-merged SM product is obtained by combining three independent SM products - including two RS SM products and one modeled SM product. Results show that the 2D merging method can effectively handle non-stationary errors and, as a result, produces a superior merged SM product than classical 1D merging methods. The spatial and temporal correlations with in-situ observations are 0.62 and 0.63 [-1 on average for 2D merging methods, and 0.58 and 0.59 [-1 on average for classical 1D merging methods. By providing a more effective way to detect and remove non-stationary errors during the process of merging multi-source SM products, this approach will improve future global multi-source merged SM products.

AB This study applied a Spike-Filter (SF) method to identify and remove rapidly moving clouds over the coastal ocean in GOES-16 satellite sea surface temperature fields (SST). These images were then gap-filled to capture upwelling in the Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB), a critical process that impacts ecosystems and atmospheric processes in the region and is important to coastal regions around the world. During the 2019 upwelling season, the default Quality Filter (QF) provided to identify and remove clouds from GOES SST consistently removed upwelling pixels, resulting in similar to 15% MAB coastal SST coverage. The Spike Filter (SF) method increased MAB coastal SST coverage to 30% and maintained overall accuracy. GOES SF DINEOF SST approximately doubled the number of detected upwelling days compared to MUR SST. The longest upwelling event detected in GOES SF DINEOF persisted for over 17 days, which is longer than upwelling events previously observed in the MAB (Glenn et al., 2004).This suggests that the MAB can have persistent, rather than episodic upwelling as previously thought. Clear detection of the timing and duration of upwelling events is important as it provides estimates for ecological and physical responses in the MAB and coastal regions around the world. GOES-16 SST has the potential to improve upwelling detection and should be further studied for application in ocean and atmospheric modeling.

AB This work assesses the vertical accuracy of eight Digital Surface Models (DSMs) currently available for Mexico (LiDAR, ALOS AW3D30 V2 and V3, ASTER GDEM V2 and V3, SRTM, NASADEM and Mexico's Continuous Elevation Model (CEM)). The AW3D30, ASTER GDEM, SRTM and NASADEM DSMs cover nearly the entire globe and can be downloaded at no cost, while the LiDAR and CEM DSMs are distributed by Mexico's Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI). The accuracy of these DSMs is assessed by considering: 1) benchmarks as reference data at the national level, and 2) LiDAR DSM as reference data on six different zones with variability in slope, vegetation cover and elevation. Using geodetic benchmarks as reference elevation on those areas covered by LiDAR (A(LiDAR)=370,200 km(2), n(bench)=24,175), it was found that LiDAR has the best vertical accuracy of all DSMs considered (MAE(LiDAR) = 1.96), which is why it was used as reference elevation to develop seven DEMs of Difference (DoDs) with the remainder DSMs. Using n(cells) = 350 x 10(6) for the aforementioned comparisons, it was found that the vertical accuracy of AW3D30 V2 and V3 is similar (MAE=2.5 m), followed by NASADEM, SRTM, CEM, ASTER GDEM3 and ASTER GDEM 2, with MAE values of 3.1, 3.8, 4.6, 6.0 and 7.2 m respectively. The previously mentioned values vary according to slope and slope orientation (i.e. aspect): for flat areas (slope <= 5 degrees), the NASADEM exhibits the lowest MAE (with MAE values of 1.6 for slope <= 1 degrees and MAE = 2.0 m when 1 degrees<slope <= 5 degrees), whereas MAE(AW3D30V3)=1.9 and 2.2 m for the previously mentioned slopes. With the use of radial boxplots developed on slope groups of 5 degrees, it was found that both MAE and bias are increasingly affected by aspect as slope increases on all the DSMs. In the case of both AW3D30 DSMs, on flat terrain a difference of only 0.1 m in bias (i.e. median of differences with respect to LiDAR) is found between SE and NW slopes; however, this difference increases according to slope: 0.6 m for 5 degrees<slope <= 10 degrees, 1.2 m for 10 degrees<slope <= 15 degrees, and 1.9 m for 15 degrees<slope <= 20 degrees. Through the analyses undertaken, it is shown that slope-and not vegetation cover-is the factor that has the largest impact on the error of DSMs, and that the effect of aspect on error increases as terrain steepens. This work shows that all DSMs present errors and that an adequate accuracy assessment of DSMs needs to consider the spatial distribution of GCPs, Difference of DSMs (DoDs) and derivatives of DSMs (i.e., slope and aspect) as the use of DoDs provide information on DSM errors (i.e. interpolation artefacts) that can not be assessed through the use of geodetic benchmarks and because DSM errors depend on both slope and aspect.

AB The present study summarizes two decades (2000?2019) of climatology and trends in aerosol loading and optical properties using a high spatial resolution data obtained from NASA?s MODIS MAIAC and MISR aerosol products supplemented by moderate resolution aerosol data from OMI sensor over South Asia (SA). MISR AOD showed good agreement against AERONET AOD with 68.68% of the retrievals falling within the expected error and high Pearson?s correlation coefficient (R = 0.83). The 20 years geometric mean of MAIAC and MISR AOD revealed higher loading of aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Eastern coast of India by 30% to 44% compared to the mean AOD over the entire SA. The highest mean AOD under cloud-free conditions was noted during monsoon season, followed by pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter. The high contribution of coarsemode AOD (cAOD) mainly from natural aerosol emission and small-mode AOD (sAOD) from local anthropogenic emissions are the main driver to high AOD in monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. Besides, the presence of high humidity during the monsoon season favors the hygroscopic growth of the particles and leads to higher AOD values over SA. The high spatial resolutions of MODIS/MAIAC and MISR aerosol products enabled the identification of previously unobserved aerosol hotspots over Bihar, West Bengal, and the eastern Indian coastal state of Odisha, which is mainly dominated by small aerosol particles. The contributions of smaller aerosol particles to the total aerosol loading were found to be higher during post-monsoon and winter over most states in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In contrast, the contribution of coarser particles was higher over Pakistan during premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Smaller particles were predominantly retrieved over the Indian states dominated by mining industries, including Jharkhand and Odisha. A typical dominance of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols was also noted over the northwestern region of IGP during post-monsoon, which otherwise was mainly affected by mixed dust aerosols and carbonaceous aerosols in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. A statistically significant positive temporal trend in AOD was observed for the whole study period, over most of the SA region, which was influenced by the increase in small particles over India and Bangladesh. Urban/industrial weakly absorbing aerosols were found to be the main contributor to a similarly positive trend over Central India and East coast Indian states. Overall, recent advancements in high spatial resolution satellite-based aerosol optical properties showed good potential to identify the aerosol hotspots and constrain aerosol types across a highly polluted SA region.

AB Satellite observation of land surface temperature (LST) is an important tool for monitoring urban thermal environments but is prone to significant angular effects over non-isothermal pixels characterized by the substantial three-dimensional (3D) structure of urban areas. However, accurately characterizing the urban thermal anisotropy at the satellite pixel scale is still challenging. In this paper, comparing the simultaneous airborne observations and the temporal-aggregated signal from MODIS LST, we further investigate the seasonal and diurnal patterns of thermal anisotropy in urban areas with various simulation scenarios. The anisotropy was defined as the difference between off-nadir and nadir temperatures. First, a realistic morphological representation of urban surfaces as well as urban component temperatures measured by infrared thermometers (IRTs) were input into the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy for Toulouse, France in summer. Extending this 'IRT-DART' method to other seasons was restricted because the IRTs' radiative source areas are affected by shadows when the sun elevation is low, meaning that measured sunlit temperatures are not reliably available. An energy balance model, TUF3D, and a sensor view model, SUM, for simplified urban geometry were coupled to replace 'IRT-DART' in winter. The cross-comparison shows that 'TUF-SUM' can simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy if urban structure and materials are relatively homogeneous, which provides a basis for assessing anisotropy when IRT sunlit temperatures are unavailable. The MODIS anisotropy is subject to a strong diurnal yet a discernable seasonal variation. For example, for a mid-latitude city, the anisotropy over all MODIS view angles reaches up to 6.6 K for Terra-Day (around 11:00 local time) and 4.9 K for Aqua-Day (around 13:00) in summer, and 6.1 K for Terra-Day and 4.0 K for Aqua-Day in winter. Nocturnal anisotropy is weak with values less than 0.2 K. The modeling methods can be used to quantify anisotropy of satellite LST in a broad range of urban environments and facilitate the use of multi-angular MODIS LST for a better assessment of urban thermal environments in the future.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a profound impact on marine life, but historically and even currently, most ocean color satellites cannot provide radiance measurements in the UV, and thus UV penetration, in the global ocean. We develop a system (termed as UVISRdl) in this study, based on deep learning, to estimate remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at 360, 380, and 400 nm (collectively termed as near-blue UV bands, nbUV) from R-rs in the visible bands that are obtained by ocean color satellites. This system is tested using both synthetic and field-measured data that cover a wide range and large number of values, with the resulted coefficient of determination close to 1.0 and bias close to 0 between UVISRdl estimated and known R-rs(nbUV). These results indicate excellent predictability of R-rs(nbUV) from Rrs(visible) via UVISRdl. The system was further applied to VIIRS (the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data with the estimated R-rs(nbUV) evaluated using matchup field measurements, and obtained a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) at 360 nm of similar to 14% for oceanic waters and similar to 50% for coastal waters. These results are equivalent to those reported in the literature for satellite R-rs(visible) in oceanic and coastal waters. Examples of the global distribution of R-rs(nbUV), and subsequently the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the nbUV bands (K-d(nbUV)), are generated after applying UVISRdl to R-rs(visible) from the VIIRS data. The system lays the groundwork to generate decade-long R-rs(nbUV) and K-d(nbUV) from satellite ocean color data, which will be useful and important for both ocean color remote sensing and biogeochemical studies.

AB Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental environmental variable for characterizing climate, land surface and atmosphere. In recent years, several SM products have been developed based on remote sensing (RS), land surface model (LSM) or land data assimilation system (LDAS). However, little knowledge is available in understanding spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different SM products and potential regional drivers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a complex environment for accurate SM estimation. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the SM uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and a generalized additive model (GAM) in terms of underlying surface characteristics (sand fraction, soil organic matter, vegetation, land surface temperature, and topography) and near-ground meteorology (precipitation and air temperature) in the third pole environment over the 2015-2018 period. Eleven SM products are involved in this work, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Land Surface Parameter Model (LPRM), Climate Change Initiative - Active/Combined (CCI_A/CCI_C), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model product a/b (GLEAM_a/GLEAM_b), and Random Forest Soil Moisture (RFSM). Results show that most of the SM products perform well across QTP, while SMOS-IC is strongly affected by radio-frequency interference in this region, JAXA has a relatively higher noise level over QTP, and LPRM has larger relative uncertainties (RUs) in the southeast of QTP. Nonlinear regression analysis demonstrates that variations of RUs in SMOS-IC and JAXA are driven by topography, while LPRM's are mainly controlled by vegetation. In addition, two groups of opposite (positive/negative) effects from topography and vegetation, topography and precipitation, and precipitation and land surface temperature affect the spatial variations of RUs in CCI_A, RFSM, and ERA-Interim, respectively. Meanwhile, more complex relationships are found between multiple surface factors and RUs of different products. In general, the underlying surface factors explain on average 39.41% and 28.34% of the variations in RS and LSM/LDAS SM RUs, respectively. Comparatively, the near-ground meteorology factors have a slightly larger effect on LSM/LDAS products than that on RS products.

AB River networks are important water carriers that provide a multitude of ecosystem services, including freshwater for agriculture, drinking water for cities, and recreational activities. Accurate mapping of river networks from remote-sensing images is important for the study of these systems. Unfortunately, the delineation of river networks is challenging due to the meandering nature of river channels, the often complex and variable features of the surrounding landscape, and the spatial heterogeneity of the river networks. Here, we present an adaptive, multi-scale region growth method (AMRGM) to delineate river networks from sentinel-2A/B MSI images. The method can handle variable river heterogeneous surroundings, multiple spatial scales, and variable curvatures of the river channels. The method includes four steps: (1) a water index (NDWI) is used to provide initial detection of river water pixels in the image; (2) a bias-corrected fuzzy C-means (BCFCM) method alleviates the effects of the variable surrounding landscape; (3) a scale-enhancement algorithm based on the hessian matrix makes full use of scale and direction information to enhance river morphology characteristics (multiple dimensions and variable curvatures), and (4) a regional growth criterion facilitates handling of various river dimensions. Fast-growing and fine-screening strategies are also included in the AMRGM. The method is applied to eight river networks to evaluate its accuracy and reliability with various river morphologies and hydrological conditions. The AMRGM is more widely applicable than four commonly used river-detection methods (i.e., K-means method, maximum likelihood method, iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm, and support vector machine) and outperform these methods when detecting multi-scale river branches. The mean overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients (KC) of the AMRGM exceed 97% and 0.92 across the eight river networks. The most accurate river extractions are obtained for large rivers such as the Amazon River, Mackenzie River, and Ganges River Delta, which have more discernable scale and direction characteristics. Relatively high omission and commission errors are observed in river networks with complex and heterogeneous zonations, such as the river Welland, UK, and the Zagya Zangbo River in the Tibet plateau.

AB Urban parks can significantly alleviate the urban heat island, an ecological issue caused by urbanization. Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits.

AB Satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented information on near-surface soil moisture at a global scale, enabling a wide range of studies such as drought monitoring and forecasting. Data Assimilation (DA) has been recognized as an effective means to incorporate such observations into hydrologic models to better predict and forecast hydroclimatic variables. In this study, we use a recently developed Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM) approach to assimilate Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to provide more reliable topsoil layer moisture (0 similar to-5 cm) over the entire Continental United States (CONUS). The EPFM outperformed an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in terms of correlations and the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) with in situ mea-surements from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN). Also, we used a multivariate probability distribution based on a Copula function to integrate the posterior soil moisture, precipitation (from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)) and evapotranspiration (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) information to develop a new integrated drought index, i.e. SPESMI. To validate the usefulness of the developed integrated drought index, we compared the drought events detected by this index with those reported by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The results indicated a strong temporal consistency of the drought areas detected by our approach and the USDM over the entire period of study (April 2015 to June 2018). In addition to such promising results, we noticed that our approach could capture the flash drought in 2017 in the U.S. Northern Plains earlier than the USDM, and could identify some severe to extreme drought events that had been underestimated by the USDM. Moreover, the SPESMI has a high correlation with the yield loss of spring and winter wheat in the United States. This novel drought monitoring framework can serve as an independent and potentially complementary drought monitoring system.

AB We provide major updates to the 'top down' Fire Radiative Energy Emissions (FREM) approach to biomass burning emissions calculations, bypassing the estimation of fuel consumption that is a major source of uncertainty in widely used 'bottom up' approaches. The FREM approach links satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM) via spatially varying smoke emissions coefficients (g.MJ(-1)) - each derived from matchups of FRP and smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). In the original FREMv1 approach, FRP data came from the geostationary Meteosat satellite and AOD data from the 10 km spatial resolution MODIS MOD04 aerosol product. However, the latter often performs quite poorly close to biomass burning sources due to its large 10 km pixels, bias at high MODIS view zenith angles, and saturation and/or removal of areas of high AOD limitations introducing bias and uncertainty into the final FREM-derived smoke emissions estimates. We address each of these issues through a series of significant methodological and input data improvements, including exploitation of the 1 km MODIS MAIAC AOD product that performs far better close to fire sources. We use our FREMv2 methodology to generate a new pan-African fire emissions inventory for TPM and the carbonaceous gases CO2, CO and CH4, and our annual mean TPM emissions are within 11% of those of the MODIS-based FEER top-down approach, but significantly higher than those of GFASv1.2 and GFEDv4.1s (by 114% and 69% respectively) agreeing with independent assessments that aerosol emissions of GFASv1.2 require upscaling by a factor of 2 to 3.4 to deliver matching magnitudes between modelled and observed AODs. From our carbonaceous emissions totals we map dry matter consumed (DMC) across Africa, and dividing this by the FireCCISFD11 20 m burned area product we provide one of the first data-driven pan-African maps of fuel consumption per unit area (kg.m(-2)) which in many areas is higher than in GFEDv4.1s. Our estimates represent the highest spatio-temporal resolution biomass burning emissions data yet available over Africa, and significantly advance the aim of a pan-tropical and mid-latitude inventory based on FRP from the global geostationary satellite network (Meteosat, Meteosat IOD, GOES and Himawari).

AB Measurements made by spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) instruments have shown strong reflected power over inland waters that has been attributed to coherent scattering coming from the first Fresnel zone. Previous work in the field has shown the ability of GNSS-R to observe the global surface water distribution by generating dynamic maps of wetlands and other inundated areas. These maps can be generated by leveraging the large difference in received power of the GNSS signals as they reflect from water surfaces compared to land. In this paper, we utilize a full-forward scattering model approach to evaluate the accuracy of these maps. The CYGNSS End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was extended to include the contributions from coherent surface scattering in heterogeneous regions where the area around the specular point contains both water and land in complex geometries. The simulator is then used to analyze the accuracy of a current approach to estimate the surface water content in the first Fresnel zone from a single measurement, called a fractional water in footprint approach. We find that contributions to the total received power by the scattering from outside the first Fresnel zone as well as CYGNSS instrument effects impact the accuracy of this approach. Furthermore, the measured signal from calibration scattering targets is compared to the results of simulation to validate the scattering model. The work shows that the variability of the peak reflected power over inland bodies of water due to the scene heterogeneities should be accounted for in designing retrieval algorithms to map wetland extent.

AB Assessing wildfire risk presents several challenges due to uncertainty in fuel flammability and ignition potential. Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) - the mass of water per unit dry biomass in vegetation - exerts a direct control on fuel ignitability, fuel availability and fire spread, and is thus an important parameter in assessing wildfire risk. Current estimates of LFMC from optical remote sensing or meteorological indices are insufficient to accurately map LFMC at landscape scale. In this study, we present a physics-assisted recurrent neural network model for mapping LFMC every 15 days at 250 m resolution over the western US using microwave backscatter (from Sentinel-1) and optical reflectance (from Landsat-8). The model was physics-assisted by adding handcrafted inputs representing radiative transfer processes and related parameters. Field data from the National Fuel Moisture Database was used to train the deep learning model. The model had a satisfactory overall predictability of R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 25.0% and bias = 1.9% when cross-validated at 125 sites. The model was substantially better at predicting site-means (R-2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 14.3%) as compared to site-anomalies (R-2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 21.3%). Of the 6 land cover types tested, the model was most accurate in predicting LFMC in shrub-lands (R-2 = 0.69), while closed broadleaf deciduous sites had the least accuracy (R-2 = 0.49). Incorporating microwave backscatter as a model input significantly enhanced performance (R-2 increasing from 0.44 to 0.63, and RMSE decreasing from 31.8% to 25.0%). Microwave backscatter therefore presents a complementary source of information to optical remote sensing metrics for LFMC mapping. The high resolution dynamic LFMC maps presented here may assist in improved wildfire risk characterization and also have potential applications in quantifying plant drought stress at large scales.

AB Dense time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are creating exciting new opportunities to monitor, map, and characterize temporal dynamics in land surface properties with unprecedented spatial detail and quality. By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10-30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of similar to 3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests). Conversely, results in evergreen systems are less interpretable and conclusive.

AB Insights into the dynamics of coastlines and tidal flats at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are essential for sustainable development. Previous studies were generally conducted at relatively coarse temporal intervals, which hardly captured detailed coastal dynamics, especially in rapidly developing islands. In this study, we developed a new method to map the monthly changes in coastlines and tidal flats in the Zhoushan Archipelago during 1985-2017 using the full time series of Landsat images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we built the full time series of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Second, we derived temporal segments of MNDWI using a binary segmentation algorithm. Third, we classified the corresponding coastal cover types (i.e., water, tidal flats, and land) for each temporal segment based on the features of MNDWI and regional tidal heights. Finally, we identified the change information including conversion types, and turning years and months. Results indicate that the proposed method can well identify turning years with an overall accuracy of 90% and map coastal cover types with overall accuracies of 89-94% in 1985 and 87-92% in 2017. Significant coastline expansions and declines in tidal flats were found in the study area. The areas of water and tidal flats decreased by 6% and 10% during 1985-2017, respectively, while the land area increased by 18%. The land reclamation was accelerated in the recent decade, and mainly occurred on the medium-large islands, their surrounding small islands, and the islands close to the mainland. The proposed framework based on the GEE platform is transferable to investigate coastal dynamics in other areas. The derived information of changes in coastlines and tidal flats is of great use for sustainable management and ecological studies in coastal areas.

AB This paper presents the forward modelling aspects of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) activities at ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Several parameterizations of the Community Microwave Emission Modelling Platform (CMEM) are used to simulate L-band Brightness Temperatures (TBs) and compared to the SMOS TBs for 2010-2011. We show that simulated TBs are primarily sensitive, by order of importance, to the soil roughness model, the vegetation opacity and the soil dielectric model. In particular, best CMEM results are obtained with the simple Wigneron soil roughness model and the Wigneron model for the vegetation opacity. For the soil dielectric model, performances of the Wang and Schmugge and the Mironov models are shown to be similar and better than the Dobson model. The Wang and Schmugge model is then used in the next steps of this paper combined with the Wigneron roughness and vegetation models. The paper describes a multi-angular multi-polarised bias correction method based on a linear resealing (mean and variance) computed at the monthly scale using SMOS observations and ECMWF-CMEM re-analysed TBs for a four year period (2010-2013). Results show that for 2010-2013 the seasonal multi-angular multi-polarisation bias correction approach reduces global RMSE to 7.91 K, compared to 16.7 K before bias correction, whereas the mean absolute bias is reduced to 1.39 K, compared to 11.04 K before bias correction. The consistency between the seasonality of simulated and the observed TBs is also improved by using a monthly bias correction, leading to correlation values improvement to 0.62 after bias correction compared to 0.56 before. The 2010-2013 bias correction applied to the 2014-2016 period at 40 degrees incidence reduces the global RMSE from 15.56 K to 8.19 K, and the mean absolute bias from 10.16 K to 2.51 K, with no impact on the correlation values that remain at 0.61 in both cases. Long term monitoring of SMOS TB is presented covering a 7-year period (2010-2016) at both polarisations, at 40 incidence angle. Results show that the consistency between SMOS and ECMWF reanalysis based TBs progressively improved between 2010 and 2016, pointing out improvements of level 1 SMOS TB products quality through the SMOS lifetime.

AB The Antarctic Ice Sheet holds 91% of the global ice mass making it the biggest potential contributor to global sea-level-rise. In order to evaluate the ice sheet's present and future response to global climate change, detailed information about spatial and temporal ice mass dynamics is required. While ice sheet surface mass balance can be estimated from regional climate models, ice discharge is often determined from spaceborne measurements of ice thickness and ice motion at selected flux gates. The retrieval of ice motion is not only critical for analysing the rate of ice transport into the ocean but also for investigating the spatial and temporal pattern or the driving forcings of Antarctic ice flow dynamics.
   This study provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art spaceborne ice velocity measurements in Antarctica. Based on 201 scientific papers, published over the last three decades, our analysis revealed a dominant interest in local and regional scale investigations. Yet, the launch of the ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 SAR satellites in the 1990s dramatically increased data coverage over the Antarctic continent and enabled the first circum-antarctic velocity product to be published in the late 2000s. In recent years, the improved imaging capabilities of Landsat 8 led to a shift towards using mainly optical satellite data and enabled great advances in circum-antarctic velocity mapping. Data from the currently operating Sentinel-1/-2 missions was applied in fewer studies but will play a crucial role in future ice motion studies e.g. as part of ESA CCI projects. In addition, we found a growing interest in high temporal resolution velocity change analyses. Based on the reviewed studies, we moreover summarized the highly dynamic and locally variable flow pattern over the Antarctic continent being in accordance with varying local and regional driving mechanisms.
   Despite the great advances in spaceborne ice velocity mapping in Antarctica, we report some major drawbacks and discuss future challenges and requirements. To start with, our study uncovered strong variations regarding the spatial availability of investigations. While we found an aggregation of studies over selected glaciers, we report a major lack of studies in all three Antarctic sectors. Additionally, many velocity datasets were created with strongly heterogeneous output parameters and were provided at coarse temporal resolution or at point-based measurement locations only. Future studies should consequently aim at creating more uniform ice motion products at defined spatial and temporal coverage and resolution standards and at analysing particularly the least studied glaciers.

ID DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; VOIDS; DEMS; QUALITY; MISSION
AB The original data produced by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) tend to have an abundance of voids in mountainous areas where the elevation measurements are missing. In this paper, deep learning models are investigated for restoring SRTM data. To this end, we explore generative adversarial nets, which represent one state-of-the-art family of deep learning models. A conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is introduced as the baseline method for filling voids in incomplete SRTM data. The problem regarding shadow violation that possibly arises from the CGAN restored data is investigated. To address this deficiency, shadow geometric constraints based on shadow maps of satellite images are devised. In addition, a shadow constrained conditional generative adversarial network (SCGAN), which incorporates the shadow geometric constraints into the CGAN, is developed. Training the SCGAN model requires both the remote sensing observations (i.e., the original incomplete SRTM data and satellite images) and the ground truth data (i.e., the complete SRTM data, which are manually refined from the incomplete SRTM data with the reference of in-situ measurements). The integration of the multi-source training data enables the SCGAN model to be characterized by comprehensive information including both mountain shape variation and mountain shadow geometry. Experimental results validate the superiority of the SCGAN over the comparison methods, i.e., the interpolation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the baseline CGAN, in SRTM data restoration.

AB There is growing interest in using Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) for forestry applications. However, the performance of pushbroom DAP relative to frame-based DAP and airborne lidar is not well documented. Interest in DAP stems largely from its low cost relative to lidar. Studies have demonstrated that frame-based DAP generally performs slightly poorer than lidar, but still provides good value due to its reduced cost. In the USA pushbroom imagery can be dramatically less expensive than frame-camera imagery in part because of a nationwide collection program. There is an immediate need then to understand how well pushbroom DAP works as an auxiliary data source in the prediction of key forest attributes including basal area, volume, height, and the number of trees per ha.
   This study compares point clouds generated from 40 cm pushbroom DAP with point clouds from lidar and 7.5 cm, 15 cm, and 30 cm frame-based DAP. Differences in point clouds from these data sources are readily apparent in visual inspections; e.g. DAP tends to measure canopy gaps poorly, omit individual trees in openings, is typically unable to represent the ground beneath canopy, and is susceptible to commission errors manifested as points above the canopy surface. Frame-based DAP provides greater canopy detail than pushbroom DAP, which becomes more apparent with higher image resolution. Our results indicated that DAP height metrics generally have a strong linear relationship with lidar metrics, with R-2 values ranging from 83 - 90% for cover, and 47-80% for height quantiles. Similarly, lidar auxiliary variables explain the greatest variation in forest attributes, e.g., volume (84%), followed closely by 30 cm frame-based DAP (81%), with the poorest results from pushbroom DAP (75%). While DAP resolution had a visible effect on canopy definition, it did not appreciably affect point cloud metrics or model performances. Although pushbroom DAP explained the least variation in forest attributes, it still had sufficient explanatory power to provide good value when frame-based DAP and lidar are not available.

AB The three dimensional distribution of water vapour around mountainous terrain can be highly variable. This variability can in turn affect local meteorological processes and geodetic techniques to measure ground surface motion. We demonstrate this general problem with the specific issues of a small tropical island, Montserrat. Over a period of 17 days in December 2014 we made observations using InSAR and GPS techniques, together with concurrent atmospheric models using the WRF code. Comparative studies of water vapour distribution and its effect on refractivity were made at high spatial resolution (300 m) over short distances (similar to 10 km). Our results show that model simulations of the observed differences in water vapour distribution using WRF is insufficiently accurate. We suggest that better use could be made of the knowledge and observations of local water vapour conditions at different scales, specifically the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the trade wind fields and the mountain flow (similar to 30 m) perhaps using eddy simulation. The annual perturbations of the ITCZ show that the range of humidity is approximately the same expressed as the differential phase of InSAR imaging (similar to 100 mm). Trade wind direction and speed are particularly important at high wind speeds driving vigorous asymmetrical convection over the island's mountains. We also show that the slant angles of radar can follow distinct separate paths through the water vapour field. Our study is novel in demonstrating how synoptic-scale features and climate can advise the modelling of mesoscale systems and sub-seasonal InSAR imaging on tropical islands.

AB A statistical regression-based microwave sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval algorithm has been developed within the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) SST project. The retrieval algorithm was used to generate a climate data record (CDR) of passive microwave (PMW) SST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and its follow-on instrument AMSR2 for the period June 2002-October 2017. Multisensor Matchup Datasets (MMDs), which includes satellite orbital data collocated with in situ and auxiliary data, was used to derive consistent algorithms for AMSR-E and AMSR2. The retrieval algorithms consist of wind speed (WS) retrievals and SST retrievals, with corresponding uncertainty retrievals. The WS retrieval consists of a two-step regression model, where the second step is a localized algorithm, trained to perform well over restricted WS intervals. A two-step multiple linear regression retrieval with localized algorithms is used to retrieve SST. The first-stage algorithm is trained to perform well over restricted latitude intervals for ascending and descending orbit, respectively, whereas the second-stage retrieval uses localized SST and WS algorithms. Furthermore, a new and effective method for detecting and screening for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) was developed.
   Validation of the PMW SSTs against drifter in situ SSTs shows an overall bias of - 0.02 K for quality level (QL) 4 and 5 AMSR-E retrievals with a standard deviation of 0.46 K. Validation results for QL 4 and 5 AMSR2 retrievals against drifter in situ SSTs give a bias of 0.002 K and a standard deviation of 0.45 K. The corresponding mean modelled SST uncertainties, including in situ and sampling uncertainties, are estimated to 0.45 K for QL 4 and 5 AMSR-E retrievals and 0.44 K for QL 4 and 5 AMSR2 retrievals. Validation against near-surface temperature measurements from Argo floats yielded comparable results, confirming the drifting-buoy validation. The validation results demonstrate a consistent PMW SST CDR with accurate SST observations and reliable uncertainty estimates.

AB Investigation of the spatio-temporal patterns of dune migration in a large-scale area with optical remote sensing techniques can help us to better understand aeolian phenomena and mitigate sand-dust disasters. With the rapid growth in data volume, extracting more accurate dune displacement time series and rates from optical observations has become possible; however, the method is not yet fully fledged. To address this issue, we propose an extended algorithm for the mature optical imagery cross-correlation (OICC) technique based on Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) acquisitions. The main innovative points of this algorithm are: 1) the proposed pairing strategy for the OICC processing; 2) the modularized post-processing procedures for noise removal; and 3) the introduction of singular value decomposition (SVD) time-series inversion of the redundant optical observations to quantify the dune migration. To test the effectiveness of this algorithm, it was applied in the study of dune migration near Minqin Oasis in northwestern China, using enriched L8 and S2 images collected between April 2013 and April 2018. Compared with the original OICC results in stable areas, the post-processing and inversion of the proposed algorithm reduce the uncertainty by around 22-35% and 3-5% for L8, 29-48% and 5-12% for S2, respectively. The cross-comparison between the L8- and S2-derived displacement time series shows high consistency, and presents a lower uncertainty than the result of the traditional no-inversion method. Furthermore, the derived displacement rates show spatial patterns that are similar to those of the manually digitized results obtained with historical Google (TM) Earth (GE) images. These comparisons show the advantage of the proposed algorithm in automatically and accurately quantifying dune migration. Taking into account these measurements, the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of dune migration in the study area were analyzed. From the spatial perspective, the sand dunes move along a northwest-southeast axis with four detected transport pathways. Our research also shows that around 1087.7 km(2) of dune fields present an active status. The active sand dunes are currently encroaching on around 155.5 km(2) and 4.4 km(2) of land each year outside and inside the oasis, respectively, representing a problem of rapid desertification. Temporally, the displacement time series along the dominant migration direction appears as seasonal variations that are seemly consistent with the changes in local atmospheric conditions. The proposed algorithm provides a new perspective to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of dune migration with medium-resolution L8 and S2 optical datasets.

AB Burn severity mapping greatly informs fire management and can be used to predict post-fire vegetation recovery. Satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective method for estimating burn severity, providing a comprehensive spatially explicit view of whole landscapes. However, the proportion of tree canopy cover (TCC) affects the reflectance signal, obscuring background char and ash. Consequently, traditional optical satellite remote sensing methods that do not account for variation in TCC misclassify burn severity, especially in areas with extremely low or high TCC. In this study, TCC data served to parameterize and constrain the inversion of the Forest Reflectance and Transmittance (FRT) radiative transfer model (RTM) to alleviate spectral confusion when retrieving burn severity. The methodology was evaluated using field measurements of burn severity for a series of wildfires in the fire-prone tropical savannas of northern Australia and the western United States. Burn severity classes were used for Australia while the Composite Burn Index (CBI) for US. Reflectance data from Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) corresponding to post-fire field survey dates were used to retrieve burn severity using FRT RTM (with and without using TCC information in its parameterization and inversion) and two standard empirical burn indices, dNBR and RdNBR, for comparison. Using FRT RIM without TCC constraint produced an overestimation for low burn severity in regions with low TCC and an underestimation for moderate and high burn severity in regions with high TCC. Burn severity estimation accuracy significantly improved by integrating TCC in the parameterization and inversion of FRT RTM. The overall accuracy in northern Australia increased from 65% to 81%, and the kappa coefficient increased from 0.35 to 0.55. In the western United States, R-2 between estimated and observed CBI, increased from 0.33 to 0.54, root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.53 to 0.43, and in all instances, the method performed better than dNBR and RdNBR. The method used in this study achieved more accurate burn severity mapping, thus assisting land managers to better understand post-fire vegetation resilience and forest management.

AB The present study analyzes the sequence of 4 important earthquakes occurred in Mexico from September 2017 to February 2018, exploiting the large availability of InSAR data and analytical models, with a twofold goal: to privede new solutions for seismogenic sources, completely independent from seismological data, and to discuss methodological aspects related to the non-linear and linear inverse problem. We review and update an earlier study, focused on the concept of resolution, showing the level of detail achievable in the investigation of the slip distribution based on geodetic observations, according to data availability, fault locations and event magnitudes. We further give new insights into the relationship between fault resolution and parameter uncertainty, demonstrating that a realistic assessment is strictly related to a proper fault subdivision. We eventually discourage the use of qualitative approaches, such as the checkerboard test, to evaluate the data resolving power and suggest the adoption of quantitative indicators, like the Dirichlet Spread Function, normalized, easy to calculate and mathematically robust.

AB Surface soil moisture (SSM), as a vital variable for water and heat exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere, is essential for agricultural production and drought monitoring, and serves as an important boundary condition for atmospheric models. The spatial resolution of soil moisture products from microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse (e.g., similar to 40 km x 40 km), whereas SSM of higher spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 1 km x 1 km and daily continuous) is more useful in water resources management. In this study, first, to improve the spatiotemporal completeness of SSM estimates, we downscaled land surface temperature (LST) output from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) using a data fusion approach and MODIS LST acquired on clear-sky days to generate spatially complete and temporally continuous LST maps across the North China Plain. Second, spatially complete and daily continuous 1 km x 1 km SSM was generated based on random forest models combined with quality LST maps, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface albedo, precipitation, soil texture, SSM background fields from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative (CCI, 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and CLDAS land surface model (LSM) SSM output (0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) to be downscaled, and in situ SSM measurements. Third, the importance of different input variables to the downscaled SSM was quantified. Compared with the original CCI and CLDAS SSM, both the accuracy and spatial resolution of the downscaled SSM were largely improved, in terms of a bias (root mean square error) of -0.001 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.041 cm(3)/cm(3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.72. These results are generally comparable and even better than those in published studies, with our SSM maps featuring spatiotemporal completeness and relatively high spatial resolution. The downscaled SSM maps are valuable for monitoring agricultural drought and optimizing irrigation scheduling, bridging the gaps between microwave-based and LSM-based SSM estimates of coarse spatial resolution and thermal infrared-based LST at a 1 km x 1 km resolution.

AB The rapid expansion of SAR data availability and advancements in InSAR processing methods has enabled the formation of ground displacement time series for many parts of the world where such research was previously hindered by decorrelation due to sparse temporal sampling and SAR operating frequency. In particular, free and open data access from the European Sentinel-1 constellation and the future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission is encouraging the global community to move towards automated, cloud-based processing that can accommodate these rapidly growing data volumes and facilitate the use of a suite of corrections to the data. A key challenge is related to path delays introduced when the radar signal propagates through the troposphere. Tropospheric corrections estimated from empirical, phase-based methods and those using independent data from weather models, GPS, and radiometers have been included in open-source packages such as TRAIN, PyAPS and GACOS. Users within the InSAR community have reported varying degrees of success using these methods in a range of areas around the world. However, the various statistical metrics used to evaluate the reliability of tropospheric corrections are not consistently applied and often depend on the area and the spatial scale over which they are evaluated. Examination of a simple metric such as the overall reduction in phase variability within an interferogram does not allow the user to determine whether the improvement was at large or short length scales. We present a review of existing tropospheric correction methods and statistical performance metrics, providing guidelines for global assessment and verification of the efficacy of tropospheric correction methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations for each correction method as well as each statistical performance metric. We examine two regions with different atmospheric characteristics - one Sentinel-1 swath covering the central United States and one swath covering south central Mexico, including part of the Pacific coast. As the SAR community moves towards reliance on global and automated InSAR processing platforms that incorporate tropospheric corrections, approaches such as those examined here can aid researchers in their efforts to evaluate such corrections and include their uncertainties in derived products such as surface displacement time series, coseismic offsets, processes that correlate with topography, and signals with smaller magnitude or larger spatial scales such as those associated with small earthquakes, aseismic creep and slow slip events. We found that the GACOS products (leveraging the operational high resolution ECMWF weather model) outperform the other correction methods explored here on average, but this result is highly dependent on location, acquisition time, and data availability. We found spatial structure functions to be most useful for performance assessment because of their ability to convey information about performance at discrete spatial scales.

AB This paper investigates the potential for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band radiometer to estimate the percentage of frozen soil inside a pixel during fall periods. To evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of the autumn freeze in northeastern Canada boreal forest, a network of compact and self-recording temperature sensors (iButton) along transects averaging 10 km was deployed on the soil surface at two different sites. Results show important spatial variability in soil freezing timing with maximums, for the two sites, spanning from 7.5 to 9.5 weeks to reach a frozen state. It is known that L-band radiometry such as Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) can monitor freeze/thaw (Fro seasonality at low spatial resolution (similar to 40 km). However, the possible strong surface variability within a 40 km x 40 km pixel can lead to spatial delay in fall freezing. Simulations of brightness temperature (TB) weighted by spatially distributed iButton F/T records and using the omega-tau vegetation model show good agreement with SMAP satellite observations during the fall transition period with an average RMSE of 3.5 K. A new intra-pixel frozen soil percentage retrieval algorithm using only SMAP observations and air temperature is proposed. The percentage of frozen soil in falls 2015 and 2016 from the new algorithm and the in situ measurements are in good agreement with a coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging between 0.63 and 0.88.

AB Soil moisture has a critical role in the development, frequency and persistence of climatic and hydrologic extremes such as drought, heat wave and flooding events. In situ soil moisture data are uneven and sparse in time, and space. This highlights the need to utilize other soil moisture sources to fill this spatiotemporal gap. The goal of this study is to validate one satellite-based and two model-based soil moisture datasets with in situ data across the United States. Soil moisture information from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced level 3 (L3) (SMAP L3) and modeled level 4 (L4) (SMAP L4) data at 9-km resolution and Short-term Prediction Research and Transition-Land Information System (SPORT-LIS) modeled at 3-km resolution were selected for evaluation. SPoRT-LIS is a near real-time, high resolution operational land analysis data. Ground-based data were obtained from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) for 362 stations. Seven statistical indicators including anomaly, Spearman, and Pearson correlation coefficients, the systematic error (Bias), root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), and normalized standard deviation (SDV) were used to evaluate the satellite- and model-derived soil moisture data. In addition, the triple collocation (TC) error model was used to measure the error among SMAP L4, SPORT-LIS and ground-based data. This study assesses which satellite or modeled dataset is most appropriate for specific times and locations to use as a surrogate for in situ observations. Temporal and spatial analysis demonstrated that, overall, SMAP L4 performed better than SMAP L3 and SPORT-LIS. Strong agreement was observed between SMAP L4 and in situ observations (p = 0.53, Bias = 0.006) in all seasons and most regions with various land covers, especially in winter and in the central regions of the United States. For croplands, SMAP L4 presented the best agreement with in situ data, analyzing all period (p = 0.60) and non-winter period (p = 0.61) separately.

AB Coastal upwelling is important for marine ecosystems and the economy, because of its elevated primary and secondary productivity and large potential for fish catch. This study developed a scale-independent and semi-automatic image processing technique to map the upwelling areas along the 4500 km south-eastern coast of Australia from 14-year monthly MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The results show that there is significant spatial variability in the mapped upwelling areas, month to month, season to season and year to year. There is also strong temporal (month to month, seasonal and inter-annual) variability of the upwelling characteristics in area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. This study identifies two prominent upwelling systems, the NSW system along the coast of New South Wales and the WVIC/SA system along the coast of western Victoria and adjacent South Australia. The NSW coastal upwelling system occurs more or less continuously from austral spring to autumn. The WVIC/SA coastal upwelling system is a seasonal upwelling system occurring in the austral summer. The NSW coastal upwelling system has a stronger upwelling intensity than the WVIC/SA system, in terms of area of influence, SST anomaly, chlorophyll-a concentrations and upwelling speed. We believe that the NSW coastal upwelling system, especially the northern and central parts, is mainly driven by the East Australian Current (EAC) and its eddies; while, the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling is a typical wind-driven system. In addition, the results indicate that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are likely to have a low-to-moderate impact on both the NSW and the WVIC/SA coastal upwelling systems. The El Nino (La Nina) events tend to strengthen (weaken) upwelling intensity.

AB Inherent optical properties (IOPs) play an important role in underwater light field, and are difficult to estimate accurately using satellite data in optically complex waters. To study water quality in appropriate temporal and spatial scales, it is necessary to develop methods to obtain IOPs form space-based observation with quantified uncertainties. Field-measured IOP data (N = 405) were collected from 17 surveys between 2011 and 2017 in the three major largest freshwater lakes of China (Lake Chaohu, Lake Taihu, and Lake Hongze) in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River (LYHR). Here we provide a case-study on how to use in-situ observation of IOPs to devise an improved algorithm for retrieval of IOPs. We then apply this algorithm to observation with Sentinel-3A OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, corrected with our improved AC scheme), and use in-situ data to show that the algorithm performs better than the standard OLCI IOP product. We use the satellite derived products to study the spatial and seasonal distributions of IOPs and concentrations of optically active constituents in these three lakes, including chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), using all cloud-free OLCI images (115 scenes) over the lakes in the LYHR basin in 2017. Our study provides a strategy for using local and remote observations to obtain important water quality parameters necessary to manage resources such as reservoirs, lakes and coastal waters.

AB As a crucial source of runoff in headwater regions, seasonal snowmelt plays an important role in ensuring water availability downstream, particularly during low flow periods. As the major constituent of China's water towers, the headwater region of the Yangtze River (HRYR) provides water to hundreds of millions of people downstream. Therefore, accurately simulating snowmelt is critical to developing a better understanding of the hydrological processes, which would, in turn, benefit water supply management, irrigation, hydropower generation, and ecological integrity over the HRYR and its lower reaches. However, it is a considerable challenge to conduct hydrological modeling for ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions, owing to a lack of in situ measurements to appropriately constrain the model and evaluate its results. Satellite remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to capture hydrological state variables globally, such as snow cover area (SCA) based on optical remote sensing and snow water equivalent (SWE) based on passive microwave remote sensing. This study simulates snow and glacier meltwater of the HRYR (above the Zhimenda gauging station), and quantifies proportional meltwater contributions to total runoff using multisource remote sensing data and a distributed hydrological model. We, for the first time ever, evaluate the snowmelt simulations based on the hydrological consistency among precipitation, air and land surface temperatures, and remotely sensed SWE/SCA. Results show that the snowmelt simulations using either SWE or SCA as a reference for calibrating parameters of the hydrological model are highly consistent, with snow and glacier meltwater contributing similar to 7% and similar to 5%, respectively, to the total runoff during 2003-2014. This study serves as a basis to simulate snowmelt to understand runoff generation and evolution under climate change across ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions using multisource remote sensing data.

AB Frozen debris lobes (FDLs) are slow-moving landslides along permafrost-affected slopes, and consist of soil, rock, organic debris, and areas of massive infiltration ice. Based on their proximity to the adjacent infrastructure, their size, and their flow dynamics, FDLs represent potential geohazards. Eight FDLs (FDL-A, -B, -C, -D, -4, -5, -7, -11) within the Dalton Highway corridor in the Brooks Range, Alaska, USA are the subject of this paper. We examined temporal and spatial variation of FDL displacement using medium-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and differential SAR Interferometry (dInSAR) techniques. European Remote Sensing satellite 1/2 (ERS 1/2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) acquisitions were used to generate coherent interferograms to study the displacement history of FDLs for 1995-1996 and 2006-2010. We conducted an initial assessment of the capability of satellite InSAR to monitor FDL movement depending on data resolution, season, and vegetation coverage, which also helped us to select useful interferograms. With multi-temporal interferometric displacement maps, we found that seven investigated FDLs (FDL-7 was excluded from this sub experiment due to limited data coverage) demonstrated strong spatial and seasonal variations in their movement patterns, with maximum displacement rates typically occurring in October and minimum displacement rates during February or March, which is consistent with previously published field study results. Overall, through this study we: (1) delineated the active FDLs during the winter period using a wrapped PALSAR interferogram; (2) analyzed the spatial variation of the deformation field within each FDL body; (3) modeled the seasonal changes of FDL deformation rates through the analysis of multi-temporal ERS tandem interferograms; and (4) integrated InSAR-derived deformation rates with those obtained through historical imagery analysis to determine long-term deformation rates. Results from this study fill the gaps left in the historical imagery analysis and provide important seasonal and spatial deformation data, which are essential in the development of a mitigation plan as these features approach infrastructure. We also summarize our research experience studying these moving features using satellite radar interferometry and believe this can be useful for future studies of similar features.

AB Anthropogenic climate change has been linked to the degradation of permafrost across northern ecosystems, with notable implications for regional to global carbon dynamics. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution, temporal trends, and seasonal timing of episodic landscape deformation events triggered by permafrost degradation is hampered by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of high-resolution optical, RADAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral remote sensing products. Here we present an automated approach for detecting permafrost degradation (thermoerosion), using meso-scale high-frequency remote sensing products (i.e., Landsat image archive). This approach was developed, tested, and applied in the ice-rich lowlands of the Noatak National Preserve (NOAT; 12,369 km(2)) in northwestern Alaska. We identified thermoerosion (TE) by capturing the spectral signal associated with episodic sediment plumes in adjacent water bodies following TE. We characterized and extracted this episodic turbidity signal within lakes during the snow-free period (June 15-October 1) for 1986-2016 (continuous data limited to 1999-2016), using the cloud-based geospatial parallel processing platform, Google Earth Engine (TM). Thermoerosional detection accuracy was calculated using seven consecutive years of sub-meter high-resolution imagery (2009-2015) covering 798 (similar to 33%) of the 2456 lakes in the NOAT lowlands. Our automated TE detection algorithm had an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 86% and 0.47 +/- 0.043, indicating that episodic sediment pulses had a "moderate agreement" with landscape deformation associated with permafrost degradation. We estimate that lake shoreline erosion, thaw slumps, catastrophic lake drainage, and gully formation accounted for 62, 23, 13, and 2%, respectively, of active TE across the NOAT lowlands. TE was identified in similar to 5% of all lakes annually in the lowlands between 1999 and 2016, with a wide range of inter-annual variation (ranging from 0.2% in 2001 to 22% in 2004). Inter-annual variability in TE occurrence and spatial patterns of TE probability were correlated with annual snow cover duration and snow persistence, respectively, suggesting that earlier snowmelt accelerates permafrost degradation (e.g. TE) in this region. This work improves our ability to detect and attribute change in permafrost degradation across space and time.

AB This study analyzed, for the first time, the potential of combining the large European-wide land survey LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey) and Landsat-8 data for mapping pan-European land cover and land use. We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014-2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping. Although this study focuses on European land cover, the unique combination of large survey data and machine learning of spectral-temporal metrics, may also serve as a reference case for other regions. The pan-European land cover map for 2015 developed in this study is available under https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.896282.

AB Eucalyptus spp. and Acacia mearnsii are common exotic tree species in eastern Africa that have shown (strong) invasive behavior in some regions. Acacia mearnsii is considered a highly invasive species that is replacing native species and Eucalyptus spp. are known to consume high amounts of groundwater with suspected effects on native flora. Mapping the occurrence of these species in the Taita Hills, Kenya (part of the Eastern Arc Mountains Biodiversity Hotspot) is important as there is lack of knowledge on their occurrence and ecological impact in the area. Mapping methods that require a lot of fieldwork are impractical in areas like the Taita Hills, where the terrain is rugged and the infrastructure is poor. Our aim was hence to map the occurrence of these tree species in a 100 km(2) area using airborne imaging spectroscopy and laser scanning. We used a one class biased support vector machine (BSVM) classifier as it needs labeled training data only for the positive classes (A. mearnsii and Eucalyptus spp.), which potentially reduces the amount of required fieldwork. We also introduce a new approach for parameterizing and setting the threshold level simultaneously for the BSVM classifier. The second aim was to link the occurrence of these species to selected environmental variables. The results showed that the BSVM classifier is suitable for mapping Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus spp., holding the potential to improve the efficiency of field data collection. The introduced parametrization/threshold selection method performed better than other commonly used approaches. The crown level Fl-score was 0.76 for Eucalyptus spp. and 0.78 for A. mearnsii. We show that Eucalyptus spp. and A. mearnsii trees cover 0.8% and 1.6% of the study area, respectively. Both species are particularly located on steeper slopes and higher altitudes. Both species have significant occurrences in areas close to the biggest remaining native forest patch (Ngangao) in the study area. Nonetheless, follow-up studies are needed to evaluate their impact on the native flora and fauna, as well as their impact on the water resources. The maps created in this study in combination with such follow-up studies could serve as base data to generate guidelines that authorities can use to take action in handling the problems these species are causing.

AB The retrieval of vegetation parameters benefits significantly from the data fusion of optical and microwave signals. The integration of accurate forward models in both regions can play an important role in supporting these fusion approaches. Because of the different imaging mechanisms used in optical and microwave wavelength domains, the forward models in the two domains have been generally developed separately based on the different specifications of the scene. The inconsistencies between optical and microwave models, such as confusing input/output parameter definitions, different scattering theories and discrepant model complexity, make the data fusion difficult to conduct and lead to different results in terms of accuracy and computer time. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a unified three-dimensional (3D) model using one scattering theory, identical input and similar complexity. To our knowledge, there are very few 3D models that can accomplish this task. By extending the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model for the optical region, a general radiosity model (RAPID2) was proposed in this paper for the microwave region. This is the first time radiosity theory has been applied in microwave remote sensing, which invents a new way to solve the radar multiple scattering more efficiently. RAPID2 has four new functions: projecting translucent objects, tracking specular scattering, separating polarization components and imaging radar signals. The relationship between the radar cross section (RCS) and the bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) is bridged. The modified Stokes vector and Mueller matrix are integrated into radiosity formulas to unify the scattering process between the optical and microwave regions. RAPID2 can simulate double-bouncing and multiple scattering effects over vegetated 3D scenes containing topography. The simulated radar images can well reflect the distinct radar geometric features, including layover, foreshortening and shadows. Validation over two forest sites shows good agreement with AIRSAR backscattering data (errors < 3.4 dB). The demonstrated results show the importance of the incident azimuth angle (variation up to 2 dB), slope (variation up to 5 dB), and multiple scattering effects (contribution up to 2 dB), which should be considered in forest parameter inversion.

AB Diatoms dominate global silica production and export production in the ocean; they form the base of productive food webs and fisheries. Thus, a remote sensing algorithm to identify diatoms has great potential to describe ecological and biogeochemical trends and fluctuations in the surface ocean. Despite the importance of detecting diatoms from remote sensing and the demand for reliable methods of diatom identification, there has not been a systematic evaluation of algorithms that are being applied to this end. The efficacy of these models remains difficult to constrain in part due to limited datasets for validation. In this study, we test a bio-optical algorithm developed by Sathyendranath et al. (2004) to identify diatom dominance from the relationship between ratios of remote sensing reflectance and chlorophyll concentration. We evaluate and refine the original model with data collected at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO), a near-shore location on the New England shelf. We then validated the refined model with data collected in Harpswell Sound, Maine, a site with greater optical complexity than MVCO. At both sites, despite relatively large changes in diatom fraction (0.8-82% of chlorophyll concentration), the magnitude of variability in optical properties due to the dominance or non-dominance of diatoms is less than the variability induced by other absorbing and scattering constituents of the water. While the original model performance was improved through successive re-parameterizations and re-formulations of the absorption and backscattering coefficients, we show that even a model originally parameterized for the Northwest Atlantic and re-parameterized for sites such as MVCO and Harpswell Sound performs poorly in discriminating diatom-dominance from optical properties.

AB The penetration ability of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) pulses into vegetation cover makes it a valuable tool in forest inventory. Extraction of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using LiDAR data is a challenging topic, especially in steep and complex terrains with forest canopy. This paper presents some approaches for ground filtering and interpolating the point cloud to generate DTM in forested terrains. Interpolating the points in dense forests that have high attitude variation is very difficult and make the popular interpolation methods unsatisfactory. This paper proposed a modified Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) method for finding the optimized coefficients of the polynomial interpolation method. This method had a good performance with 0.210 mm RMSE value in the forested terrains. The interpolated point cloud was used as the input of the proposed ground filtering method for detecting the non-ground pixels. The proposed ground filtering method was structured with two main sections including, iterative geodesic morphology and scan labeling. In the iterative geodesic morphology, some geometric and structural parameters were introduced to investigate the quality of extracted points in each iteration. The scan labeling searched the data pixel by pixel in four directions and labeled the pixels with the high slope value in all directions. The non-ground pixels were obtained by integrating the result of iterative geodesic and scan labeling. Assessment of the ground filtering results using the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) showed 3.92% total error compared to the other reported algorithms. This demonstrated the ability of the proposed approach in recognition of the non-ground pixels. The extracted pixels were removed and the DTM was generated by filling the gaps using the proposed IWO and polynomial interpolation. Some forested regions with various characteristics such as sparse and dense trees on the hills and steep slopes were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the generated DTM. The computed RMSE in the test areas was 0.463 m, on average, which was acceptable for the complex and forested terrains.

AB In Mali's cotton belt, spatial variability in management practices, soil fertility and rainfall strongly impact crop productivity and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. To identify crop growth conditions and hence improve food security, accurate assessment of local crop production is key. However, production estimates in heterogeneous smallholder farming systems often rely on labor-intensive surveys that are not easily scalable, nor exhaustive. Recent advances in high-resolution earth observation (EO) open up new possibilities to work in heterogeneous smallholder systems. This paper develops a method to estimate individual crop production at farm-to-community scales using high-resolution Sentinel-2 time series and ground data in the commune of Koningue, Mali. Our estimation of agricultural production relies on (i) a supervised, pixel-based crop type classification inside an existing cropland mask, (ii) a comparison of yield estimators based on spectral indices and derived leaf area index (LAI), and (iii) a Monte Carlo approach combining the resulting unbiased crop area estimate and the uncertainty on the associated yield estimate. Results show that crop types can be mapped from Sentinel-2 data with 80% overall accuracy (OA), with best performances observed for cotton (Fscore 94%), maize (88%) and millet (83%), while peanut (71%) and sorghum (46%) achieve less. Incorporation of parcel limits extracted from very high-resolution imagery is shown to increase OA to 85%. Obtained through inverse radiative transfer modeling, Sen2-Agri estimates of LAI achieve better prediction of final grain yield than various vegetation indices, reaching R-2 of 0.68, 0.62, 0.8 and 0.48 for cotton, maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The uncertainty of Monte Carlo production estimates does not exceed 0.3% of the total production for each crop type.

AB The temporal dynamics of optimum stomatal conductance (g(smax)), as well differences between C-3 and C-4 crops, have rarely been considered in previous remote sensing (RS)-based Jarvis-type canopy conductance (G(c)) models. To address this issue, a RS-based two-leaf Jarvis-type G(c) model, RST-G(c), was optimized and validated for C-3 and C-4 crops using 19 crop flux sites across Europe, North America, and China. RST-G(c) included restrictive functions for air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water deficit, and it used satellite-retrieved NDVI to formulate the temporal variation of g(smax) defined at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (g(sm, 2000)). Results showed that the parameters of RST-G(c) differed between C-3 and C-4 crops. RST-G(c) successfully simulated variations in Penman-Monteith (PM)-derived daytime G(c) with R-2 = 0.57 for both C-3 and C-4 crops. RST-G(c) was incorporated into a revised evapotranspiration (ET) model and a new gross primary productivity (GPP) model. The two models were validated at 19 crop flux sites. Daily mean inputs were generally incorporated into a PM approach to model daily transpiration. This is inappropriate because available energy and stomatal conductance vary significantly on a diurnal basis, with both non-linearly regulating transpiration rate. The PM approach with daily mean inputs produced unreasonable transpiration rate estimates. Efforts were made in the revised ET model (denoted as RS-WBPM2), which was modified from the water balance based RS-PM (RS-WBPM) model of Bai et al. (2017), to address this issue by calculating transpiration using daytime inputs. The photosynthesis-based stomatal conductance model, developed by Ball et al. (1987a) and improved by Leuning (1995) (BBL model), was inverted to calculate GPP using canopy conductance; the inverted model was denoted as IBBL. Cross validation showed good agreement between flux tower measurements and modeled ET (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE (root mean standard error) = 20.66 W m(-2) for daily ET and R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 15.32 W m(-2) for 16-day ET) and GPP (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 2.49 gC m(-2) d(-1) for daily GPP and R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.96 gC m(-2) d(-1) for 16-day GPP) for the two models. Within-site validations demonstrated the successful performance of the two models at 18 sites (albeit with one outlier). Inter-site variations in ET and GPP were also successfully reproduced by the models. NDVI-derived g(sm, 2000) outperformed the fixed g(sm, 2000) in both ET and GPP estimates. The results imply that the RS-WBPM2 and IBBL models are useful tools for modeling regional and global ET and GPP.

AB Remote sensing data are most useful if they are available with sufficient precision, accuracy, spatiotemporal and spectral sampling, as well as continuity across decades. The Landsat and Sentinel series, as well other satellites are currently covering significant parts of this observational trade space. It can be expected that growing demands and budget constraints will require new capabilities in orbit that can address as many observables as possible with a single instrument. Recent optical performance improvements of imaging spectrometers make them true alternatives to traditional multispectral imagers. However, they are much more adaptable to a wide range of Earth observation needs due to the combination of continuous high spectral sampling with spatial sampling consistent with previous sensors (e.g., Landsat). Unfortunately, there is a knowledge gap in demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy data can substitute for multi-spectral data while sustaining the long-term record. Thus, the objective of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that imaging spectroscopy data compare radiometrically with multi-spectral data to within 5%. Using a coincident Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight with over-passing Operational Land Imager (OLI) data on Landsat 8, we document a procedure for simulating OLI multi-spectral bands from AVIRIS data, evaluate influencing factors on the observed radiance, and assess the difference in top-of-atmosphere radiance as compared to OLI. The procedure for simulating OLI data include spectral convolution, accounting for the minimal atmospheric effects between the two sensors, and spatial resampling. The remaining differences between the simulated and the real OLI data result mainly from differences in sensor calibration, surface bi-directional reflectance, and spatial sampling. The median relative radiometric difference for each band ranges from - 8.3% to 0.6%. After bias-correction to minimize potential calibration discrepancies, we find no more than a 1.2% relative difference. This analysis therefore successfully demonstrates that imaging spectrometer data can contribute to Landsat-type or other multi-spectral data records. It also shows that cross-calibration from a spectrometer to a radiometer can be easily performed as a result of the imaging spectrometer high spectral sampling and its ability to recreate multi-spectral response functions.

AB Tropical forest disturbance (such as selective logging and fire) along with deforestation have significant contributions to the carbon source due to land-use change and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and thus envisioned by United Nation's REDD + programme. In previous work, spaceborne single-pass InSAR phase-center height has been shown to have the capability of accurately monitoring the subtle height change due to forest growth and degradation (with meter or even sub-meter level RMSE about the regression curve fit to time). In this paper, a new approach using spaceborne SAR interferometry has been developed to detect and quantify selective logging events. In particular, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is first defined, namely disturbance index (DI; from 0 "no disturbance" to 1 "deforestation"). A numerical field data-based InSAR simulation is then performed to study the functional relationship between the field-measured DI and InSAR relative phase-center height change from a modeled perspective. A selective logging event (October 2015 through January 2016) over the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil is used for experimental validation. The InSAR-inverted DI estimates derived from DLR's TanDEM-X time-series data were compared with those measured from a field work over 32 quarter hectare stands at Tapajos with relative RMSE of 30% for DI up to 0.3 and the disturbance epoch can be determined with an average accuracy of 13 days (constrained by the satellite repeat interval usually on the order of 2 weeks). As a comparison, the repeat-pass InSAR coherences from the concurrent JAXA's ALOS-2 data are shown to qualitatively correspond to the TanDEM-X results, confirming both the location and the epoch of the disturbance event. This new method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring (for UN's REDD + programme) through using spaceborne single-pass InSAR missions (e.g., DLR's TanDEM-X and in the future, TanDEM-L).

AB As LiDAR datasets increase in availability and spatial extent, demand is growing for analytical frameworks that allow for robust comparison and interpretation among ecosystems. We utilize data-driven classification in a hierarchical design to estimate forest structure classes with parsimony, flexibility, and consistency as priorities. We use an a priori selection of six input features derived from small-footprint (32 cm), high density (17 returns/m(2)) airborne LiDAR: four L-moments to describe the vertical distribution of canopy structure, canopy density as a measure of vegetation coverage, and standard deviation of canopy density to characterize within-cell horizontal variability. We identify 14 statistically-separated meta-classes characterizing six ecoregions over 168,117 ha in Montana, USA. Meta-classes follow four general vertical shapes: tall and continuous, short-single strata, tall-single strata, and broken strata over short strata. Structure classes that dominate locally but are rare overall are also identified. The approach outlined here allows for intuitive comparison and assessment of forest structure from any number of landscapes and forest types without need for field training data.

AB The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) provides limited hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity data for the retrieval of critical land surface and climate parameters in environmental research. However, the AIRS land surface emissivity (LSE) data lack accuracy, resulting in low-quality data retrieval, particularly for the lower boundary layer. In this study, a practical and effective method is proposed to derive high-accuracy AIRS LSE data and continuous emissivity spectra in the TIR range of 8-14.5 mu m. The AIRS LSE is first rescaled to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSE using cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, and then the emissivity spectra are recovered from the rescaled AIRS LSE using principal component analysis (PCA) regression. The results show that resealing the AIRS LSE significantly reduced the bias and root mean square (RMS) error in the study area of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and PCA regression successfully recovered the emissivity spectra in the 8-14.5 mu m range from the resealed AIRS LSE. At two validation sites in the Namib and Kalahari deserts of southern Africa, the biases of the resealed AIRS LSE at three hinge points are 0.62% and 0.61%, respectively, and the biases of the recovered AIRS LSE spectra in the 8-12 mu m TIR range are 0.53% and 0.56%, respectively. Variations in land cover homogeneity and the accuracy of the MODIS LSE are the critical factors impacting the final accuracy of the rescaled AIRS LSE and the recovered emissivity spectra.

TI Deblurring DMSP nighttime lights: A new method using Gaussian filters

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE DMSP nighttime lights; Blurring; Urban boundaries
ID OPERATIONAL LINESCAN SYSTEM; MAP URBAN AREA; CITY LIGHTS
AB A well known difficulty with the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's nighttime lights series (DMSP-NTL 1992-2012) is that the images suffer from pervasive blurring, dubbed 'overglow' or 'blooming'. In this paper we devise a new method that significantly mitigates blurring. We assemble a sample of isolated light sources around the globe and discover that blurring is governed by a symmetric Gaussian point-spread function (PSF), but that the brightness of sources widens the PSF. To make sense of this, we recreate step-by-step the satellite's data collection and storage process, and discover an important fact: any pixel containing a light source will tend to be lit at least as often as its neighbors. This regularity provides a second filter on the data that allows us to calibrate the dimensions of the PSF to each part of the globe, each satellite, and each year. We generate a user-friendly, open-access MATLAB script that deblurs all DMSP-NTL images for all years, and we showcase the enhanced images for a sample of locations around the globe.

AB We present comparisons of cloud droplet size distributions (DSDs) retrieved from the research scanning polarimeter (RSP) data with correlative in situ measurements made during the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). The airborne portion of this field experiment was based out of St. John's airport, Newfoundland, Canada with the focus of this paper being on the deployment in May June 2016. RSP was onboard the NASA C-130 aircraft together with an array of in situ and other remote sensing instrumentation. The RSP is an along-track scanner measuring the polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels. Its uniquely high angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet sizes using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectance over the scattering angle range from 135 to 165. The rainbow is dominated by single scattering of light by cloud droplets, so its structure is characteristic specifically of the droplet sizes at cloud top (within unit optical depth into the cloud, equivalent to approximately 50 m). A parametric fitting algorithm applied to the polarized reflectance provides retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non parametric method, the Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows us to retrieve the droplet size distribution itself. The latter is important in the case of clouds with complex microphysical structure, or multiple layers of cloud, which result in multi-modal DSDs. During NAAMES the aircraft performed a number of flight patterns specifically designed for comparisons between remote sensing retrievals and in situ measurements. These patterns consisted of two flight segments above the same straight ground track. One of these segments was flown above clouds allowing for remote sensing measurements, while the other was near the cloud top where cloud droplets were sampled. We compare the DSDs retrieved from the RSP data with in situ measurements made by the Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The comparisons generally show good agreement (better than 1 pm for effective radius and in most cases better than 0.02 for effective variance) with deviations explainable by the position of the aircraft within the cloud, or by the presence of additional cloud layers between the cloud being sampled by the in situ instrumentation and the altitude of the remote sensing segment. In the latter case, the multi-modal DSDs retrieved from the RSP data were consistent with the multi-layer cloud structures observed in the correlative High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) profiles. The results of these comparisons provide a rare validation of polarimetric droplet size retrieval techniques, demonstrating their accuracy and robustness and the potential of satellite data of this kind on a global scale.

AB Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (PoIInSAR) has shown potential for the retrieval of a forest canopy height model (CHM) and the underlying solid earth digital terrain model (DTM). However, because of non-volume decorrelation and other unavoidable errors, the robustness of retrieval heights is sensitive to the spatial baseline of the selected InSAR pairs, which relates forest parameters to measured coherence. Within the context of the random volume over ground (RVoO) model and the three-stage inversion method, we aimed to quantify the influence of spatial baseline on the inversions at P-band, which are distinct from the inversions at higher frequency due to the non-negligible ground contributions. This information assists in optimal baseline selection and the development of robust inversion schemes. Assumptions about the extinction coefficient and additional DTM or DEM were used to reduce the influence of ground contribution on CHM and DTM inversion, respectively. Inversions from published airborne repeat-pass P-band PoIInSAR data with four different spatial baselines were validated against LiDAR-derived DTM and CHM data. The results show that a longer spatial baseline performed better in DTM inversion. The longest baseline produced the best R-2 of 0.995 and RMSE of 0.555 m, much better than the smallest baseline with an R-2 of 0.794 and RMSE of 174 m. A threshold height could be identified that determines the overestimation and underestimation of CHM inversion due to the non volume decorrelation. Different baselines produced different threshold heights, making CHM inversion only accurate for a limited range of forest height around the threshold. The optimal baseline produced a CHM with R-2 of 0.605 and RMSE of 2.67 m. Additionally, we found that using multiple baselines has the potential to improve CHM inversion, improving the R-2 to 0.827 and RMSE to 0.876 m in our study.

AB In the context of global warming, glacier changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and its surroundings have attracted a great amount of public attention. To date, there have been many studies of glacier mass balance across the QTP. However, given that most of the previous studies have focused on a short observation period (2000-2015), and that long-term mass change measurements are available only for some local regions, we utilized declassified KH-9 images and 1 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEMs) to provide the region-wide mass balance (from the mid-1970s to 2000) for a larger scale (including 11 sample regions) across the QTP and its surroundings. The final results indicate that the glaciers in the northwest of the QTP have shown a less negative or near-zero mass balance, ranging from-0.11 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) to 0.02 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1), compared to those in the southeast part, with a mass balance range of-0.30 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1) to-0.11 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1). The most serious mass loss has emerged in the central eastern Himalaya. Integrating our results with the observations after 2000 suggests that, over the past four decades (mid-1970s to the mid-2010s), the glaciers in the Himalaya, Nyaingentanglha, and Tanggula mountains, as a whole, have exhibited accelerated mass loss, and the most significant acceleration has occurred in the eastern Nyaincientanglha. Moreover, the Hindu Raj glaciers have shown a stable rate of continuous mass loss, while a nearly stable or slight mass gain state in the western Kunlun region can be dated back to at least as far as the mid-1970s.

AB Phytoplankton growth depends on various factors, and primarily on nutrient availability, light and water temperature, whose distributions are largely controlled by hydrodynamics. Our main objective is to analyse the link between spatial and temporal variability of surface water temperature and algal concentration in a large lake by means of remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling. We compare ten years of satellite images showing chlorophyll concentrations and surface water temperature of Lake Geneva. Our observations suggest different correlations depending on the season. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations in spring are correlated with warmer zones. But, in summer, higher chlorophyll concentrations are observed in colder zones. We show with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that the spatial variability of the surface water temperature reflects the upwelling and downwelling zones resulting from wind forcing. In springtime, nearshore downwellings induce locally increased surface temperature and stratification, which are associated with high chlorophyll concentration. In summertime, colder surface temperature area, often interpreted as transient upwellings, represents the thermal surface signature of wind-induced basin-scale internal waves, bringing either nutrients or phytoplankton from deeper layers to the surface. Our study suggests the latter to be the dominant process, with the basin-scale internal wave activity and associated transient summertime upwellings and downwellings having little net effects on the algal concentration. This study finally demonstrates the necessity to connect remote sensing retrievals and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling to properly understand the dynamic of the lake ecosystems.

AB Mertz Glacier (MG) calved in February 2010 and a 70-years' calving cycle of MG was reported recently because of the shallow Mertz Bank. To better investigate the calving process, a high accurate surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with accurate date marker over MG is urgently required for numerical modeling, especially over the ice tongue. However it is quite challenging to generate an accurate DEM over high relief and steep slope regions. To solve this problem, a new method for accurate coastal DEM production by merging ASTER GDEM and ICESat/GLAS data is designed, which can effectively discriminate accurate elevation data from ASTER GDEM. Then, a DEM corresponding to the end of 2002 over MG is generated, which has an accuracy of 0.99 +/- 17.50 m. This DEM is several times better in accuracy than the original ASTER GDEM (accuracy: -8.17 +/- 54.31 m) and two new characteristics of ASTER GDEM have been found through analysis. First, ASTER GDEM has elevation bias (varying from 23 m to 28 m), spatially correlated to ASTER ground tracks, which was most probably caused by uncertainty of attitude measurements of ASTER. Second, ASTER GDEM grids with stacking number >= 4 can be effectively adjusted by ground control points so as to improve elevation accuracy. Additionally, this DEM has the best accuracy by comparing with other DEMs (RAMP DEM: 47.71 +/- 91.61 m, ICESat/GLAS DEM: -1.01 +/- 30.33, Bamber DEM: -1.07 +/- 33.04 m, Bedmap-2 DEM: 9.19 +/- 48.34 m, and Cryosat-2 DEM: -5.42 +/- 32.02 m). The high performance of our DEM in accuracy indicates that our method is effective and has a potential to be widely used to improve existing ASTER GDEM along Antarctic coast.

AB Forest fire smoke is a growing public health concern as more intense and frequent fires are expected under climate change. Remote sensing is a promising tool for exposure assessment, but its utility for health studies is limited because most products measure pollutants in the total column of the atmosphere, and not the surface concentrations most relevant to population health. Information about the vertical distribution of smoke is vital for addressing this limitation. The CALIPSO satellite can provide such information but it cannot cover all smoke events due to its narrow ground track. In this study, we developed a random forests model to predict the minimum height of the smoke layer observed by CALIPSO at high temporal and spatial resolution, using information about fire activity in the vicinity, geographic location, and meteorological conditions. These pieces of information are typically available in near-real-time, ensuring that the resulting model can be easily operationalized. A total of 15,617 CALIPSO data blocks were identified as impacted by smoke within the province of British Columbia, Canada from 2006 to 2015, and 52.1% had smoke within the boundary layer, where the population might be exposed. The final model explained 82.1% of the variance in the observations with a root mean squared error of 560 m. The most important variables in the model were wind patterns, the month of smoke observation, and fire intensity within 500 km. Predictions from this model can be 1) directly applied to smoke detection from the existing remote sensing products to provide another dimension of information; 2) incorporated into statistical smoke models with inputs from remote sensing products; or 3) used to inform estimates of vertical dispersion in deterministic smoke models. These potential applications are expected to improve the assessment of ground-level population exposure to forest fire smoke.

AB Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an important factor in fire risk management in the Mediterranean region. Drawing upon a large network of stations (the Reseau Hydrique) measuring LFMC for operational fire danger assessment in the south-eastern region of France, this study assesses the ability of several long-term passive microwave remote sensing indices to capture the LFMC temporal dynamic of various Mediterranean shrub species. Microwave remote sensing has a high potential for monitoring LFMC independently of several constraints (e.g., atmospheric and cloud contamination effects) associated with optical-infrared and thermal remote sensing observations. The following four microwave-derived indices are considered: (1) the Essential Climate Variable near-surface soil moisture (ECV_SM); (2) the root-zone soil moisture (ECV_RZSM) derived from ECV_SM; (3) the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) computed from five microwave frequencies (C, X, Ku, K and Ka-band corresponding to 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 36.5 GHz respectively); and (4) the vegetation optical depth (VOD) at C- and X-band (from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system, AMSR-E). Firstly, an evaluation of the root-zone soil moisture ECV_RZSM against a network of soil moisture measurements (SMOSMANIA in southern France) gave satisfactory results. For most of the Reseau Hydrique sites, the present study found good agreement between LFMC and individual microwave indices, including root-zone soil moisture, VOD at X-band, and MPDI at X and Ku-bands, all averaged over the 15 days preceding the in-situ LFMC measurements. VOD at X-band showed the best agreement with the in situ LFMC data (median of correlation coefficients over all in situ sites = 0.43). Further comparisons between LFMC data and several optical indices computed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference infrared index 6 (NDII6), normalized difference infrared index 7 (NDII7) and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI) were made. The comparisons showed that VARI and SAVI, as optical greenness indices, outperform the microwave indices and other optical indices with median of correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.65, respectively. Overall, this study shows that passive microwave indices, particularly VOD, are efficient proxies for LFMC of Mediterranean shrub species and could be used along with optical indices to evaluate fire risks in the Mediterranean region.

AB Efficient methodologies for mapping croplands are an essential condition for the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices and for monitoring crops periodically. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05% and 96.19%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.

AB This paper presents measurements of the azimuth and zenith angle-dependence of the targets that are used for supervised vicarious calibration (SVC) methodology of hyperspectral sensors. Surface radiance measure at sensor from airborne instruments, such as the AisaDUAL and HyMap sensors, show an apparent noise and shift that limit the information content and even impair the collected data (after removing the atmospheric attenuation). The drift from actual radiance is contributed by various sources; e.g., atmospheric gases and aerosols, and sensor stability. Yet one of the major contributors to it during nadir scanning is the directional effect of target reflectance at variable illumination geometry, also known as Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The SVC method, which is based on ground dark nets of varying densities, was able to correct for the above factors and recalibrate the sensor's radiance during data acquisition. The main assumption of the SVC method is that the net targets are a Lambertian surface. In this paper, the BRDF measurements of the SVC net targets were carried out using a goniometer and controlled laboratory conditions. These measurements revealed anisotropic properties of the nets targets, which were further introduced to the radiometric calibration process are significant, especially with the high density nets ( > 50% black net cover). The paper presents a look-up-table of the BRDF correction coefficient factors for each net target (identified and separated by its density and mixing level once placed over a bright background) at various zenith (from 10 to 30) and azimuth (from 0 degrees to 360 at intervals of 10) angles. The coefficients were calculated for the near infrared spectral region (at 981 nm), and should be applied to the full-reflected spectral range across visible, near and shortwave-infrared wavelengths (400-2500 nm). The acquired results in this empirical study showed that the SVC calibration nets targets are characterized by incoherent BRDF effect. The darker and denser calibration targets absorb the down welling radiance, and thus, reduce the amount of intermediate multiple scattering, normally accrued in all other (less dense) examined targets. The impact of target density on the BRDF correction coefficient and its dependence with illumination zenith and azimuth angles is studied and presented. The correction coefficient factors obtained in the laboratory were implemented in two real airborne hyperspectral campaigns of two different sensors: AisaDUAL and HyMAP over the same calibration site. The proposed BRDF SVC net corrections enables fine-tuning of the vicarious calibration procedure, while increasing the quality of the radiometric data. Thus, it is recommended to use the BRDF coefficients obtained in this paper for any airborne hyperspectral sensor that uses the SVC method in order to achieve better calibration accuracy.

AB Measuring and monitoring controls on wind erosion can facilitate detection and prediction of soil degradation important for food security. Ground cover is widely recognised as an important factor for controlling soil erosion by wind and water. Consequently, maintaining ground cover (e.g., vegetation, crop canopy, crop residue) is a recommended management practice which is widely adopted by farmers and land owners. Wind erosion is a lateral or horizontal process and the amount of ground cover needed to maintain lateral cover (L-c = nbh/S where n roughness elements occupy ground area S and have b and h mean breadth and height, respectively) is not well established. Soil may be removed from beneath or between crop and natural vegetation canopies depending on the width, height and distribution of cover types relative to wind direction and strength. Monitoring by repeated measurement or estimation of ground cover provides information to develop an understanding of its spatial and temporal variation. Fractional cover (f(c)) retrieved from optical satellite remote sensing (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS) provides a consistent and repeatable measure of ground cover when viewed from above. Therefore, f(c) provides an areal assessment of components of ground cover. Fractional cover is consequently not the most appropriate approximation of the protection of the soil from wind erosion. Extant wind erosion model parameterisations of L-c already benefit from the use of satellite-derived cover data (L-fc). However, the parameterisations are not well developed. Here, we address the need for a dynamic (multi temporal), moderate resolution and global metric for wind erosion assessment and modelling. We demonstrate the benefits of using L-c within the context of monitoring ground cover for the assessment of wind erosion and review the basis for estimating ground cover using L-c. We describe a new method for an albedo-based approximation of aerodynamic sheltering (L-omega). We use ray-casting of rough surfaces from an existing wind tunnel study to establish a relation between measured L, and directional hemispherical reflectance omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda), the so-called 'black-sky albedo' and its inverse to estimate shadow. The relation is confirmed to be dependent on the solar zenith angle (theta) and spectral (lambda) confounding factors (e.g., soil moisture, soil mineralogy). We reduced the A. dependency of omega(dir)(0(center dot), lambda) by normalising with the MODIS (MCD43A1) BRDF parameter A to estimate albedo-based lateral cover (L-omega) globally over space (500 m pixels) and time (every 8 days). We compared L-omega with f(c) and L-fc over time for selected locations in Australia and examined L-omega across Australia and the USA using national biogeographic regions. Consistent with current approaches to estimating L-c our results were not field validated due to the dearth of ground-based measurements. However, our results demonstrate that L-omega will improve wind erosion models particularly over large areas and L-omega, is likely to be a valuable source of decision-support information to guide policy makers and land managers on where, when and how to reduce wind erosion.

AB This study proposes an algorithm to retrieve the outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA OLR) using the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) unit that is a narrowband sensor installed in Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite providing window and water vapor imagery. The outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA OLR) was retrieved by an empirical method where a radiative transfer model (RTM) was used to simulate various atmospheric conditions, such as the surface temperature, water vapor, and cloud characteristics (e.g., cloud optical thickness and cloud height). The results of an algorithm using a single channel (OLR12.4) and two channels (OLR6.2+12.4) were converted into Terra Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) TOA OLR for the daytime (0105-0135 UTC) and nighttime (1325-1355 UTC) cases of a scene analysis (typhoon Goni on August 18, 2015). Long-term analysis (August 2015-July 2016) and statistical analysis (i.e., mean, bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient) were conducted. The analysis results showed that the largest error was produced in the cloudy areas (overcast areas), and the minimum RMSE and a high correlation coefficient were observed over an ocean area. In the scene analysis, however, the daytime and nighttime average RMSE of the CERES TOA OLR and OLR6.2 + 12.4 was 12.21 Wm(-2) and showed the correlation coefficient of 0.971. It was an improved result over the RMSE (12.33 Wm(-2)) and correlation coefficient (0.967) shown in the analysis of OLR12 4. In the long-term analysis, the average RMSE was 11.83 Wm(-2) and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.972 (OLR12.4 showed 12.17 Wm(-2) and 0.969). Furthermore, to minimize the difference in the cloud area that had the largest error, the study analyzed TOA OLR at the significance level of 95% (+/- 2 RMSE). As a result, the scene analysis showed an RMSE of 10.54 Wm(-2) and correlation coefficient of 0.977, and the long-term data showed an RMSE of 10.23 Wm(-2) and correlation coefficient of 0.979.

AB Climate model simulations and observational references of the Earth's climate are the two primary sources of information used for climate related decision-making. While uncertainties in climate models and observational references have been assessed thoroughly, it has remained difficult to integrate these, partly because of the lack of formal concepts on how to consider observational uncertainties in model-observation comparison. One of the difficulties dealing with observational uncertainty is its propagation to the space-time scales represented by the models. This is a challenge due to the correlation of observational errors in space and time. Here we present an approximation which allows to derive propagation factors to different model scales and apply these to uncertainty estimates provided by the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) sea-surface temperature (SST) data set. The propagated uncertainty in SST observations is found to systematically lower seasonal forecast skill and to increase the uncertainty in verification of seasonal forecasts, an aspect that remains currently overlooked. Uncertainty in forecast quality assessment is dominated by the shortness of the satellite record. Expanding the record length of these data sets might hence reduce the verification uncertainties more than the efforts to reduce the observational uncertainties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Retrieving ground motion information for non-urban and semi-vegetated areas using differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) approaches with C-band satellite radar imagery is challenging due to temporal decorrelation. By exploiting six stacks of medium resolution ERS-1/2 SAR images acquired between 1992 and 2000 over four regions of interest in the UK, this paper demonstrates the performance of the recently developed processing method Intermittent SBAS (ISBAS). This approach builds upon the conventional low-resolution SEAS method and, by relaxing the approach to selecting image pixels to process and accounting for the intermittent nature of non-urban targets, is capable to extend the coverage of motion results across the full range of land cover types, even those typically unfavourable for InSAR. On average, the new ISBAS implementation provides 4 to 26 times more coverage than SBAS for the processed regions, with the spatial coverage of ground motion solutions increasing from only 4-12% land pixels with SBAS, to 39-99% with ISBAS. Despite relying only on temporal subsets of the networks of small baseline interferograms, intermittently coherent pixels show velocity standard errors of 0.8-1.4 mm/year on average, hence retain sub-millimetre to millimetre precision. The empirical relationships between intermittent coherence and standard errors in the estimated ground motion velocity are computed for each of the six datasets, and confirm that errors are controlled by the number of independent observations used for each image pixel to extract the ISBAS solution. In particular, velocity standard errors epsilon(vel) for the intermittently coherent pixels are inversely proportional to the square root of the number of best coherence interferograms used, n(i), and can be modelled as epsilon(vel) = 11 / root n(i) mm/year on average for the six datasets. The established empirical relationship also allows informed decisions on the ISBAS threshold for n(i) to be made. This is achieved by setting the maximum acceptable error in the velocity estimate epsilon(MAX), and then computing the corresponding minimum n(i) to accept an intermittently coherent pixel that will guarantee the desired precision. In the present era of 'big SAR data' and their derived 'big InSAR data', we discuss perspectives on the use of huge datasets of thousands or even millions of ground deformation time series - such as those produced using ISBAS, with a particular focus on the veracity of big data and the need for a quality assessment check-point in the 'big InSAR data' cycle.

AB MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo products have been validated over spatially uniform, snow-covered areas of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) using the so-called single 'point-to-pixel' method. This study expands on this methodology by applying a 'multiple-point-to-pixel' method and examination of spatial autocorrelation (here using semivariogram analysis) by using in situ observations, high-resolution World View-2 (WV-2) surface reflectances, and MODIS Collection V006 daily blue-sky albedo over a spatially heterogeneous surfaces in the lower ablation zone in southwest Greenland. Our results using 232 ground based samples within two MODIS pixels, one being more spatial heterogeneous than the other, show little difference in accuracy among narrow and broad band albedos (except for Band 2). Within the more homogenous pixel area, in situ and MODIS albedos were very close (error varied from -4% to +7%) and within the range of ASD standard errors. The semivariogram analysis revealed that the minimum observational footprint needed for a spatially representative sample is 30 m. In contrast, over the more spatially heterogeneous surface pixel, a minimum footprint size was not quantifiable due to spatial autocorrelation, and far exceeds the effective resolution of the MODIS retrievals. Over the high spatial heterogeneity surface pixel, MODIS is lower than ground measurements by 4-7%, partly due to a known in situ undersampling of darker surfaces that often are impassable by foot (e.g., meltwater features and shadowing effects over crevasses). Despite the sampling issue, our analysis errors are very close to the stated general accuracy of the MODIS product of 5%. Thus, our study suggests that the MODIS albedo product performs well in a very heterogeneous, low-albedo, area of the ice sheet ablation zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single 'point-to-pixel' methods alone are insufficient in characterizing and validating the variation of surface albedo displayed in the lower ablation area. This is true because the distribution of in situ data deviations from MODIS albedo show a substantial range, with the average values for the 10th and 90th percentiles being -0.30 and 0.43 across all bands. Thus, if only single point is taken for ground validation, and is randomly selected from either distribution tails, the error would appear to be considerable. Given the need for multiple in-situ points, concurrent albedo measurements derived from existing AWSs, (low-flying vehicles (airborne or unmanned) and high-resolution imagery (WV-2)) are needed to resolve high sub-pixel variability in the ablation zone, and thus, further improve our characterization of Greenland's surface albedo.

AB Land-use is transforming habitats across the globe, thereby threatening wildlife. Large mammals are especially affected because they require large tracts of intact habitat and functioning corridors between core habitat areas. Accurate land-cover data is critical to identify core habitat areas and corridors, and medium resolution sensors such as Landsat 8 provide opportunities to map land cover for conservation planning. Here, we used all available Landsat 8 imagery from launch through December 2014 to identify large mammal corridors and assess their quality across the Caucasus Mountains (>700,000 km(2)). Specifically, we tested the usefulness of seasonal image composites (spring, summer, fall, and winter) and a range of image metrics (e.g., mean and median reflectance across all clear observations) to map nine land-cover classes with a Random Forest classifier. Using image composites from all four seasons yielded markedly higher overall accuracy than using single-season composites (8% increase) and the inclusion of image metrics further improved the classification significantly. Our final land-cover map had an overall accuracy of 85%. Using our land-cover map, we parameterized connectivity models for three generic large mammal groups and identified wildlife corridors and bottlenecks within corridors with cost-distance modeling and circuit theory. Corridors were numerous (in total, 85, 131, and 132 corridors for our three mammal groups, respectively), but often had bottlenecks or high average cost along the least-cost path, indicating limited functioning. Our findings highlight the potential of Landsat 8 composites to support connectivity analyses across large areas, and thus to contribute to conservation planning, and serve as an early warning system for biodiversity loss in areas where on-the-ground monitoring is challenging, such as in the Caucasus.

AB Satellite measurements of surface water offer promise for understanding wetland habitat availability at broad spatial and temporal scales; reliable habitat is crucial for the persistence of migratory shorebirds that depend on wetland networks. We analyzed water extent dynamics within wetland habitats at a globally important shorebird stopover site for a 1983-2015 Landsat time series, and evaluated the effect of climate on water extent. A range of methods can detect open water from imagery, including supervised classification approaches and thresholds for spectral bands and indices. Thresholds provide a time advantage; however, there is no universally superior index, nor single best threshold for all instances. We used random forest to model the presence or absence of water from >6200 reference pixels, and derived an optimal water probability threshold for our study area using receiver operating characteristic curves. An optimized mid-infrared (1.5-1.7 mu m) threshold identified open water in the Sacramento Valley of California at 30-m resolution with an average of 90% producer's accuracy, comparable to approaches that require more intensive user input. SLC-off Landsat 7 imagery was integrated by applying a customized interpolation that mapped water in missing data gaps with 99% user's accuracy. On average we detected open water on-26000 ha (similar to 3% of the study area) in early April at the peak of shorebird migration, while water extent increased five-fold after the migration rush. Over the last three decades, late March water extent declined by similar to 1300 ha per year, primarily due to changes in the extent and timing of agricultural flood-irrigation. Water within shorebird habitats was significantly associated with an index of water availability at the peak of migration. Our approach can be used to optimize thresholds for time series analysis and near-realtime mapping in other regions, and requires only marginally more time than generating a confusion matrix.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Data continuity for the Landsat program relies on accurate cross-calibration among sensors. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has been shown to exhibit superior performance to the sensors on Landsats 4-7 with respect to radiometric calibration, signal to noise, and geolocation. However, improvements to the positioning of the spectral response functions on the OLI have resulted in known biases for commonly used spectral indices because the new band responses integrate absorption features differently from previous Landsat sensors. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impact of these changes on linear spectral mixture models that use imagery collected by different Landsat sensors. The 2013 underflight of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to cross calibrate the spectral mixing spaces of the ETM+ and OLI sensors using near-simultaneous acquisitions of radiance measurements from a wide variety of land cover types worldwide. We use 80,910,343 pairs of OLI and ETM+ spectra to characterize the Landsat 8 OLI spectral mixing space and perform a cross-calibration with Landsat 7 ETM+. This new global collection of Landsat spectra spans a greater spectral diversity than those used in prior studies and the resulting Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD) spectral endmembers (EMs) supplant prior global Landsat EMs. We find only minor (-0.01 <mu < 0.01) differences between SVD fractions for coregistered pairs of spectra unmixed using the new sensor-specific endmembers identified in this analysis. Root mean square (RMS) misfit fractions are also shown to be small (< 98% of pixels with < 5% RMS), in accord with previous studies using standardized global endmembers. Finally, vegetation is used as an example to illustrate the empirical and theoretical relationship between commonly used spectral indices and subpixel fractions. We include the new global ETM+ and OLI EMs as Supplementary Materials. SVD fractions unmixed using global EMs thus provide easily computable, linearly scalable, physically based measures of subpixel land cover area which can be compared accurately across the entire Landsat 4-8 archive without introducing any additional cross-sensor corrections.

AB The 3D distribution of plant material is a key parameter to describe vegetation structure, which influences several processes such as radiation interception and ecosystem functioning. Vegetation covers are often described using Leaf Area Index (LAI) or Plant Area Index (PAI) for monitoring or modeling purposes. Characterizing vegetation 3D structure at fine scale is increasingly required, notably in order to be able to apply radiative transfer simulations at scales consistent with the spatial resolution of recent remote sensing sensors. To assess 3D PAI of a vegetation plot, this paper evaluates the potential of a voxelization method using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data, based on the Beer-Lambert transmittance computation law. The theoretical validation was performed using a simulation framework based on a radiative transfer model (DART). The framework allowed simulating TLS acquisition on a theoretical distribution of leaves and a realistic representation (single tree), for which all characteristics are well known. Hence, a sensitivity analysis was performed to study the influence of instrument parameters (i.e. single- or multi-echo, beam divergence), scanning configuration (scan angle step), vegetation characteristics (leaf size and density, leaf angle distribution), and voxel parameters (cubic versus spherical geometry, at different resolutions, with and without occlusion) on the estimation of PAI. For a theoretical distribution of leaves, results showed good accuracy of the voxelization method (R-2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 20% for a mean case, at voxel level) with a high resolution multi-echo TLS scan, cubic voxels over 0.5-m resolution, low inter-voxel occlusion, small leaves, and up to a surface density of 2 m(2).m(-3). Error increased with a larger scan angle resolution, single echo TLS systems, and vegetation density. Also, without clumping, error increased with smaller voxels or larger leaves. Best results were obtained with multi-echo TLS scans (angular resolution of 0.05), cubic voxels at 1-m resolution when occlusion is low (voxel sampling higher than 50% of maximum sampling at 15 m) and small leaves (e.g. 10 cm(2)), which provided very good agreement (RMSD = 7.6%, R-2 = 0.98, p = 0.99). On a realistic isolated tree, PAI was correctly assessed with cubic voxels at 0.25 m resolution. A method to merge voxelized scans was proposed to deal with inter-voxel occlusion effects.

AB Using MODIS satellite data, this study examines the presence and causes of albedo trends in vegetation in France during the last decade. Special attention is paid to steady woody areas. During the last decade, 0.31% of the land surface of France has been identified as being affected by a sudden albedo shift due to land cover changes (LCC). Excluding these sudden changes in land cover, we show a significant (decreasing) albedo trends over 3.5% of France (p-value < 0.01). In most cases (84%), trends were identified in non-vegetated and non-steady vegetated covers; however, gradual albedo trends were observed in steady woody covers in over 0.1% of the surface area of France. The majority (59.9%) of these woody covers were broadleaved tree covers; the remainder was divided between needle-leaved and mixed tree covers and shrub cover. On average, in the steady woody covers affected by gradual albedo trends, the visible albedo shift was 0.0088 between 2001 and 2013, i.e., a loss of 20.1-29.8% depending on the woody cover type. This decrease in albedo was supported by a significant gradual increase (p-value < 0.05) in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This increase in greenness appears to be linked to the under-use of woody areas in France, leading to denser forests. The impact of these gradual albedo trends on the radiative forcing (RF) was estimated and compared to the impact of LCCs. During the 21st century in France, the impact on the radiative forcing of steady woody covers could reach + 0.2 W.m(-2). This value is 2.5 times larger than IPCC estimates based on past vegetation changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spatio-temporal patterns of the chlorophyll-a concentration, Chia, have been assessed from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) over the whole Vietnamese coastal waters from 2002 to 2012. For that purpose, six bio-optical algorithms already documented and based on different approaches have been tested over a large in situ data set collected at different seasons and locations along the Vietnamese coast. The 005 algorithm (Gohin, Druon, and Lampert, 2002) presents the best performances and has been selected to assess Chla in the studied region. The notion of optimal bio-optical environment associated with the best performance of 005 has been introduced. For suspended particulate matter concentration, SPM, lower than 100 g.m(-3), and colored dissolved organic matter, a(cdom)(443), lower than 0.5 m(-1), Chla is estimated with an uncertainty of 36% and a bias of 5%. A Chla climatology has been generated and the temporal patterns (seasonal variability, long term trend, and irregular component) have been described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations have been used to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of Chla. The seasonal contribution dominates the variance of the signal, in good relationship with the dynamic of the mixed layer depth as well as with the occurrence of a seasonal upwelling induced by the summer monsoon. The irregular variability of Chla which may reach up to 35% of the total variance in the central part of the Vietnamese coast, can be explained through the surface kinetic energy and its standard deviation which is associated with small scales processes. A long term monotonic trend from about 2 to > 5%.yr(-1) (that is 20 to >50% from 2002 to 2012) have been noticed in different coastal areas where aquaculture activities exhibit a concurrence increase, ranging from 31% to 113% (in production weight) over the same time period. In situ measurements, and especially of nutrients, are however necessary to confirm the link between aquaculture activities and phytoplankton biomass long term evolutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

   ACCURACY
AB Existing national forest inventory plots, an airborne lidar scanning (ALS) system, and a space profiling lidar system (ICESat-GLAS) are used to generate circa 2005 estimates of total aboveground dry biomass (AGB) in forest strata, by state, in the continental United States (CONUS) and Mexico. The airborne lidar is used to link ground observations of AGB to space lidar measurements. Two sets of models are generated, the first relating ground estimates of AGB to airborne laser scanning (ALS) measurements and the second set relating ALS estimates of AGB (generated using the first model set) to GLAS measurements. GLAS then, is used as a sampling tool within a hybrid estimation framework to generate stratum-, state-, and national-level AGB estimates. A two-phase variance estimator is employed to quantify GLAS sampling variability and, additively, ALS-GLAS model variability in this current, three-phase (ground-ALS-space lidar) study. The model variance component characterizes the variability of the regression coefficients used to predict ALS-based estimates of biomass as a function of GLAS measurements. Three different types of predictive models are considered in CONUS to determine which produced biomass totals closest to ground-based national forest inventory estimates - (1) linear (LIN), (2) linear-no-intercept (LNI), and (3) log-linear. For CONUS at the national level, the GLAS LNI model estimate (23.95 +/- 0.45 Gt AGB), agreed most closely with the US national forest inventory ground estimate, 24.17 +/- 0.06 Gt, i.e., within 1%. The national biomass total based on linear ground-ALS and ALS-GLAS models (25.87 +/- 0.49 Gt) overestimated the national ground-based estimate by 7.5%. The comparable log -linear model result (63.29 +/- 1.36 Gt) overestimated ground results by 261%. All three national biomass GLAS estimates, LIN, LNI, and log -linear, are based on 241,718 pulses collected on 230 orbits. The US national forest inventory (ground) estimates are based on 119,414 ground plots. At the US state level, the average absolute value of the deviation of LNI GLAS estimates from the comparable ground estimate of total biomass was 18.8% (range: Oregon, -40.8% to North Dakota, 128.6%). Log-linear models produced gross overestimates in the continental US, i.e., >2.6x, and the use of this model to predict regional biomass using GLAS data in temperate, western hemisphere forests is not appropriate. The best model form, LNI, is used to produce biomass estimates in Mexico. The average biomass density in Mexican forests is 53.10 +/- 0.88 t/ha, and the total biomass for the country, given a total forest area of 688,096 km(2), is 3.65 +/- 0.06 Gt. In Mexico, our GLAS biomass total underestimated a 2005 FAO estimate (4.152 Gt) by 12% and overestimated a 2007/8 radar study's figure (3.06 Gt) by 19%. (C) Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Observed estimates of changes in the Himalayan and Karakoram glaciers remain ambiguous because of limited knowledge regarding complex glacier behaviour, low quality of remote sensing data, and sparse ground-based monitoring. Remote sensing has indicated anomalous behaviour of glaciers in the Karakoram during the past two decades, attracting scientists' attention to the region. In this context, this study has made detailed estimates of changes in thickness and area of two glaciers (the Sachen in the western Himalaya and the Burche in the Karakoram) to facilitate understanding of recent glacier changes and their potential impacts on water resources. This study used several datasets, including Landsat, the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and differential Global Positioning System (dGPS) in-situ measurements, from the period 1972 through 2015. The extent of debris cover increased significantly between 1972 and 2014, while the total glacierized area decreased slightly. Further, our study estimated thickness changes after removing recognizable biases and seasonal variations, computed through comparisons of ICESat data with dGPS. A thinning trend occurred between 2000 and 2015, suggesting that the glaciers in the western part of the Karakoram and Himalaya regions have not recently gained mass. This study also found non-uniform variations within different zones of the glaciers. Avalanches have fed most of the Karakoram glaciers, providing spatially heterogeneous thickness changes. The frequency of observations, data quality, acquisition time, and local weather affect our observations of temporal changes. Careful assessment of regularly acquired remote-sensing and ground-based observations should reduce uncertainty regarding estimates of glacier changes for management of water resources and associated hazards.

AB New remote sensing sensors will acquire High spectral, spatial and temporal Resolution Satellite Image Time Series (HR-SITS). These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas.
   This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 % for RF and 77.1 % for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1% OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data - composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and/or temporal features - are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost. Eventually, the classifier accuracy is assessed on a larger area where the landscape variabilities affect the classification performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demand for water security requires improved accuracy in water accounting. Quantification of actual evapotranspiration is an essential part of this accounting and is frequently derived from surface energy balance (SEB) models that combine satellite remote sensing and on-ground measurements of meteorological data. However, many of the world's major water supply catchments are highly heterogeneous with land types, vegetation communities, and topography varying spatially. We compared the performance of seven meteorological interpolation methods and three SEB algorithms (the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), the Hybrid Dual-Source Scheme and Trapezoid Framework-Based Evapotranspiration Model (HTEM), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)), testing their sensitivity to meteorological and remotely sensed inputs in a heterogeneous environment. Under a two dimensional framework, accuracy of interpolation methods varied among SEB meteorological inputs, suggesting that combining methods could improve overall accuracy. SEB algorithms were influenced by the density, type, and variability of meteorological inputs and sensitivity analysis showed that wind speed and air temperature were almost as influential as surface temperature for HTEM and SEBS. SEBS was the most sensitive to meteorological variability caused by choice of interpolation method when analysed globally, while HTEM was the most sensitive to local meteorological variation at flux towers. S-SEBI's simple structure made it the least sensitive to meteorological inputs and interpolation methods. Continued improvement in spatially explicit interpolation methods, combined with increased densities of meteorological stations, will increase accuracy and confidence in remotely sensed SEB fluxes, contributing to improved water accounting in heterogeneous catchments.

AB In order to mitigate areas of high urban air temperature (or 'hotspots'), advice and tools are currently being sought to help inform urban planning and decision making around urban greening. One potential tool receiving growing interest is the use of thermal imagery for identifying hotspots, however this relies on the assumption that patterns in land surface temperature (LST) coincide with patterns in air temperature. This study explores the capacity of very high resolution (VHR), airborne thermal infrared (TIR) remotely sensed data to identify hotspots at a neighbourhood and street scale resolution. As such it assesses whether VHR TIR remote sensing is an appropriate tool for urban planning and urban greening decision making. In partnership with a local municipality in Melbourne, Australia, VHR (0.5 m) daytime and night time TIR images were captured during warm summertime conditions in February 2012. We found that VHR TIR data certainly identified locations of high LST that could be prioritized for urban greening, however at very high resolutions, VHRTIR data could not identify hotspots because patterns in LST did not strongly correlate with patterns of high air temperature. When VHR TIR data was aggregated to a coarser resolution, it could be used at the neighbourhood-scale to identify hotspots due to greater confidence that areas of high LST do represent air temperature hotspots. Increased vegetation proportion was associated with a reduction in LST for both the day and night meaning urban greening can be used to mitigate hotspots and should be prioritized in wide, open streets where building shade is less. While VHR TIR remote sensing may be an attractive option, this study shows it is not a suitable tool to help inform urban planning and urban greening decision making as the capture, post-processing and interpretation requirements and costs of delivering a high quality product are prohibitive for many end users. We suggest that those seeking to use thermal imagery to identify hotspots in the urban landscape, strongly consider more accessible and cheaper satellite remote sensing products (such as Landsat). VHR TIR derived LST may be useful in designing urban spaces for improved human thermal comfort and focusing on a small region of interest, but the numerous complexities and limitations of the data must be recognized.

AB Launched in February 2013, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8 continues to perform exceedingly well and provides high quality science data globally. Several design enhancements have been made in the OLI instrument relative to prior Landsat instruments: pushbroom imaging which provides substantially improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), spectral bandpasses refinement to avoid atmospheric absorption features, 12 bit data resolution to provide a larger dynamic range that limits the saturation level and increases SNR, a set of well-designed onboard calibrators to monitor the stability of the sensor. Some of these changes, such as refinements in spectral bandpasses compared to earlier Landsats and a well-designed on-board calibrator have a direct impact on the improved radiometric calibration performance of the instrument from both the stability of the response and the ability to track the changes. The on-board calibrator lamps and diffusers indicate that the instrument drift is generally <0.1% per year across the bands. The refined bandpasses of the OLI indicate that temporal uncertainty of better than 0.5% is possible when the instrument is trended over vicarious targets such as Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS), a level of precision that was never achieved with the earlier Landsat instruments. With three years of data available, the stability measurements indicated by on-board calibrators and PICS agree to 0.5%, which is much better compared to the earlier Landsats, which is very encouraging and bodes well for the future Landsat missions too.

AB Traditional methods usually estimate individual land surface parameters separately from surface reflectance data, a practice which requires atmospheric correction for top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and may result in physical inconsistency among parameters. This paper proposes a new method for consistent estimation of multiple land surface parameters and aerosol optical depth (ACID) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA reflectance data. Soil, vegetation canopy, and atmospheric radiative transfer models were coupled, and a global sensitivity analysis of the coupled model was performed to identify the influential parameters from satellite observations. The most influential parameters, including leaf area index (LAI) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), were simultaneously retrieved from MODIS TOA reflectance data and then provided as input to the coupled soil-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model to calculate land surface reflectance, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), land surface albedo, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). The retrieved land surface parameters and AOD were compared with the corresponding MODIS, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GEOV1, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) products and validated by ground measurements from seven sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that the new inversion method can effectively produce multiple physically consistent parameters with accuracy comparable to that of existing satellite products over the select sites.

AB Australia experienced one of the worst droughts in history during the early 21st-century (termed the 'big dry'), exerting negative impacts on food production and water supply, with increased forest die-back and bushfires across large areas. Following the 'big dry', one of the largest La Nina events in the past century, in conjunction with an extreme positive excursion of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), resulted in dramatic increased precipitation from 2010 to 2011 (termed the 'big wet'), causing widespread flooding and a recorded sea level drop. Despite these extreme hydroclimatic impacts, the spatial partitioning and temporal evolution of total water storage across Australia remains unknown. In this study we investigated the spatial-temporal impacts of the recent 'big dry' and 'big wet' events on Australia's water storage dynamics using the total water storage anomaly (TWSA) data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.
   Results showed widespread, continental-scale decreases in TWS during the 'big dry', resulting in a net loss of 3.89 +/- 0.47 cm (299 km(3)) total water, while the 'big wet' induced a sharp increase in TWS, equivalent to 11.68 +/- 0.52 cm (898 km(3)) of water, or three times the total water loss during the 'big dry'. We found highly variable continental patterns in water resources, involving differences in the direction, magnitude, and duration of TWS responses to drought and wet periods. These responses clustered into three distinct geographic zones that correlated well with the influences from multiple large-scale climate modes. Specifically, a persistent increasing trend in TWS was recorded over northern and northeastern Australia, where the climate is strongly influenced by El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By contrast, western Australia, a region predominantly controlled by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), exhibited a continuous decline in TWS during the 'big dry' and only a subtle increase during the 'big wet', indicating a weak recovery of water storage. Southeastern Australia, influenced by combined ENSO, IOD and SAM interactions, exhibited a pronounced TWS drying trend during the 'big dry' followed by rapid TWS increases during the 'big wet', with complete water storage recoveries. A spatial intensification of the water cycle was further identified, with a wetting trend over wetter regions (northern and northeastern Australia) and a drying trend over drier regions (western Australia). Our results highlight the value of GRACE derived TWSA as an important indicator of hydrological system performance for improved water impact assessments and management of water resources across space and time.

AB A long-term coherent total column ozone (TCO) record is essential to ozone layer variability assessment, especially the detection of early signs of ozone recovery after years of depletion. Because of differences in satellite platforms and instruments design, calibration, and retrieval algorithms, however, significant cross-mission biases are observed between multiple sensor TCO observations in the common time-space domain. To attain a coherent TCO record, observed cross-mission biases should be accurately addressed prior to the data-merging scheme. In this study, a modified statistical bias correction method was proposed based on the quantile-quantile adjustment to remove apparent cross-mission TCO biases between the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS). To evaluate the effectiveness of this modified algorithm, the overall inconsistency (OI), a unique time-series similarity measure, was proposed to quantify the improvements of consistency (or similarity) between cross-mission TCO time series data before and after bias correction. Common observations during the overlapped time period of 2012-2015 were used to characterize the systematic bias between OMPS and OMI through the modified bias correction method. TCO observations from OMI during 2004-2015 were then projected to the OMPS level by removing associated cross-mission biases. This modified bias correction scheme significantly improved the overall consistency, with an average improvement of 90% during the overlapped time period at the global scale. In addition to the evaluation of consistency improvements before and after bias correction, impacts of cross-mission biases on long-term trend estimations were also investigated. Comparisons of derived trends from the merged TCO time series before and after bias correction across 38 ground-based stations indicate that cross-mission biases not only affect magnitudes of estimated trends, but also result in different phases of trends. Further comparisons of estimated seasonal TCO trends before and after bias correction at the global scale suggest that trends derived from the bias-corrected time series are more accurate than those without bias correction. Overall, the bias correction scheme developed in this study is essential for preparing an accurate long-term TCO record representative of trend analysis to support future assessment of ozone recovery at the global scale.

AB During 2011, Texas experienced a severe drought, which caused substantial tree mortality. Drought-induced tree mortality can have significant ecological impacts and is expected to increase in many locations with climate change. This disturbance is unique because it often is limited to only subtle and diffuse changes in forest cover. Thus we developed new methods to quantify drought-driven canopy loss using remotely sensed imagery, across a Landsat scene in central Texas (>30,000 km(2)). First, fine-scale canopy loss maps were created by classifying 17 1-m orthophotos (each similar to 50 km(2)) from the US National Agriculture Imagery Program. These classifications were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.90) with field estimates of canopy cover loss measured in 21 plots at 4 sites across central Texas. These fine-scale canopy loss maps were then used to calibrate and validate coarser-scale Landsat imagery. In scaling up to create regional canopy loss maps, we assembled a Landsat time-series and separated mortality pixels experiencing persistent canopy loss from pixels with only background noise by applying the Landtrendr algorithm. We then estimated percent tree canopy loss within each of these mortality pixels by comparing two models capable of handling zero-inflated continuous proportions: random forest and a zero-or-one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression model. We found that the ZOIB regression model had the highest accuracy in predicting canopy loss (mean absolute error = 5.16%, root mean square error = 8.01%). The 2011 drought caused a decrease in canopy cover within the study area, equivalent to 1124 km(2) of canopy loss, similar to 10% of the 10,850 km(2) area of live canopy present before the drought. Our methods address the need to detect drought-induced tree mortality as extreme droughts are predicted to increase with climate change. More detailed canopy loss maps could then be used (1) to quantify potential impacts to carbon cycling, biophysics, and species compositions and (2) to understand the factors controlling tree mortality, now and in the future.

AB The European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched on November 2nd, 2009. The purpose of this mission is to retrieve global maps of soil moisture and ocean surface salinity. The single payload on board the SMOS satellite is a two-dimensional L-band interferometer, the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS). This instrument measures the cross-correlations of the signals between many pairs of receivers distributed in a Y-shaped array. After de-normalization and image reconstruction, these cross-correlations yield brightness temperature images whose usable portion extends over a swath nearly 1000 km across. Geophysical retrieval algorithms are applied to these images to yield soil moisture (SM) over land and sea surface salinity (SSS) over the ocean. This paper examines the impact of sun glint on these images, focusing on the open ocean, where sun glint is shown to have a major impact on the images in descending passes from December through January. The consistency between the sun glint present in the data and that predicted by the model developed prior to launch is assessed in terms of both spatial variation across the swath and temporal variation from June 2010 to February 2014.

AB The Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) is an airborne instrument, whose measurements have been extensively used for retrievals of microphysical properties of clouds. In this study we show that for cumulus clouds the information content of the RSP data can be extended by adding the macroscopic parameters of the cloud, such as its geometric shape, dimensions, and height above the ground. This extension is possible by virtue of the high angular resolution and high frequency of the RSP measurements, which allow for geometric constraint of the cloud's 2D cross section between a number of tangent lines of view. The retrieval method is tested on realistic 3D radiative transfer simulations and applied to actual RSP data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a good indicator of the land surface state. The measurement of LST is however prone to directional anisotropy which may severely affect the interpretation of the measurements if it is not corrected.
   This study aims at determining and describing the impact of various factors on anisotropy of continuous crops at mid-latitudes.
   The SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model is used as a data generator of directional anisotropy since it enables exploring a very large range of meteorological, biochemical and geometrical conditions. An original indicator, the standard deviation of anisotropy in principal plane, is used in order to investigate the impact of the tested variables and parameters.
   We found that anisotropy is, at first order, related to seasonal trends, in relation to the amount of incident radiation and the solar zenith angle. Then the geometrical structure of the canopy modifies the anisotropy (LAI, LADF, hot spot parameter) followed by the coupling between the water status of the soil and the stress of canopy. Wind speed which is known for having a significant impact on temperature level has a very limited influence on anisotropy.
   An analysis of the amplitude of anisotropy in the principal and perpendicular planes (from -50 degrees to 50 degrees zenith) showed that anisotropy can reach up to 11 degrees C and similar to 3.5 degrees C respectively.
   The impact of satellite orbit on anisotropy is also discussed and it is found that, given the latitudes and the season, the anisotropy can severely affect measurements. This is particularly true when the satellite measurements are acquired in a configuration close to the solar principal plane, which often occur at low latitude.
   These results are of great help in the context of developing simple methods which could then be integrated into satellite data processing algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Imagery from polar orbiting satellites can be used to mitigate global hazards from wildfires and volcanoes. An incipient constellation of moderate spatial resolution sensors (i.e. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2) will provide an unprecedented combined spatial and temporal resolution of imagery with 20 to 30 m pixels and a revisit period of 2 to 4 days. This data stream could provide an invaluable contribution to existing hot target monitoring systems. We developed hot target detection algorithms for both daytime and nighttime imagery using Landsat 8 data. Performance was compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for daytime detection using a global database of active wildfires. The new approach was able to detect 80% of hot pixels (i.e. compared to 50 to 80% detected by the previous approaches) with a low false alarm rate (i.e. <10%) and fast processing speed (i.e. orders of magnitude faster than one of the previous approaches). The new detection algorithms put forward here could form the basis of the first, moderate spatial resolution, global hot target detection system. This vision is currently being realized through development of the Hotmap software within the Grid Processing on Demand (G-POD) environment of the European Space Agency (ESA). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Seagrass meadows are important environments for the blue carbon budget and are potential early indicators for environmental change. Remote sensing is a viable monitoring tool for spatially extensive meadows but most current approaches are limited by the requirement for in situ calibration data or provide categorical level maps rather than quantitative estimates of direct physiological significance. In this paper we present a method for mapping water depth and the leaf area index (LAI, ratio of leaf area to substrate area) of Thalassia testudinum meadows, based on radiative transfer model inversion using an embedded three-dimensional aquatic canopy model. Variations in reflectance due to leaf length, leaf position, sediment coverage on leaves, water depth and solar zenith angle were included in the model to parameterise uncertainty propagation. The model revealed canopy reflectance as a function of LAI decreases exponentially at all wavelengths up to an LAI around four, beyond which increasing canopy density cannot be determined from reflectance. In addition, sediment coverage on leaves has surprisingly little effect on the reflectance of sparse canopies because shading is also a contributor to darkening. The capability of the method for image based mapping was assessed through sensitivity analyses and by application to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Florida Bay collected by the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), with the uncertainty propagation providing per-pixel confidence intervals on all the estimated parameters. Results were consistent across the sensitivity and image analyses and the agreement with field data was good, given the challenges in validation of submerged pixels at metre scale. Uncertainties were high for LAIs greater than two in water of depth 8 m, but lower for sparse canopies and shallower water. For water depths approaching 10 in the pixel-to-pixel variation arising from processes at the water surface upwards was greater than the uncertainties arising from the canopy or water column.
   The physics-based model inversion approach is readily adaptable to any sensor configuration and to different seagrass species and canopy morphologies. No site-specific in situ data is required and the uncertainty estimates can provide an objective basis for interpreting apparent changes in the distribution of seagrasses over time and space, as revealed by remote sensing techniques.

AB The main objectives of this study were to provide a proxy "validation" of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission's vegetation optical depth product (tau(SMOS)) on a global scale, to give a first indication of the potential of tau(SMOS) to capture large-scale vegetation dynamics, and to contribute towards investigations into the possible use of optical vegetation indices (VI's) for the estimation of tau. The analyses were performed by comparing the spatial and temporal behaviour of tau(SMOS) relative to four MODIS-based VI's, with that of the vegetation optical depth from a similar sensor, AMSR-E (tau(AMSR-E)). 16-day and annual average values of the passive microwave optical depth (tau) for the year 2010 were obtained from SMOS (1.4 GHz) and AMSR-E (6.9 GHz) observations. The VI's chosen for this study were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).
   The highest global-scale, annual correlation was found between tau(SMOS) and tau(AMSR-E) from ascending orbits (Spearman's R = 0.80). On global, annual scales, tau(SMOS) showed higher correlations with tau(AMSR-E) than with the VI's, while tau(AMSR-E) was more highly correlated with VI's than with tau(SMOS). Timeseries of both tau and the VI's were made per landcover class, for the northern hemisphere, tropics and southern hemisphere. Although the large-scale spatial and spatio-temporal behaviour of tau(SMOS) and tau(AMSR-E) is generally similar, the results highlight some notable differences in observing vegetation with optical vs. passive microwave sensors, and certain crucial differences between the two passive microwave sensors themselves. Overall, the results found in this study give a good first confidence in the SMOS L3 tau product and its potential use in vegetation studies. These results provide an essential general reference for future (global-scale) vegetation monitoring with passive microwaves, for the future inclusion of tau(SMOS) in long-term, multi-sensor datasets, and for passive microwave algorithm development.

AB Passive microwave measurements have the potential to estimate vegetation optical depth (VOD), an indicator of aboveground vegetation water content. They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve VOD and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the NASA Aquarius sensor. The global VOD distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved VOD is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The VOD and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band VOD and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study assesses the ability of hyperspectral optical measurements to discriminate changes in the composition of phytoplankton communities in open-ocean non-bloom environments. A large set of in situ near-surface measurements, comprising phytoplankton pigment determinations and hyperspectral optical data of phytoplankton absorption coefficient, aph(X), and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), are used in the analysis. Measurements were collected in different ecological provinces in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with chlorophyll-alpha concentrations ranging from about 0.02 to 1.5 mg m(-3). Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to measured spectra of a(ph)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) and the second-derivative spectra of these optical variables. The resulting optical-based classifications of the examined stations compared favorably (similarity index >= 0.73) with a classification of phytoplankton community composition calculated from pigment measurements. Similarities between pigmentbased and optically-based classifications were better for the optical data of a(ph)(lambda) than R-rs(lambda), with only slight improvements resulting from the use of the second derivative spectra as opposed to the non-differentiated spectra. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was applied to the optical spectra to examine the correlation of dominant modes of variability with several bio-optical and biogeochemical properties. This analysis supports the notion that the performance of the optical approach is strongly associated with the effects of differences in pigment composition, cell size, and intracellular pigment concentration among different phytoplanIcton communities on the optical properties of the ocean.

AB The assessment of uncertainties in satellite-derived global surface albedo products is a critical aspect for studying the climate, ecosystem change, hydrology or the Earth's radiant energy budget. However, it is challenged by the spatial scaling errors between satellite and field measurements. This study aims at evaluating the forthcoming MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V006) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product MCD43D over a Mediterranean agricultural area. Here, we present the results from the accuracy assessment of the MODIS blue-sky albedo. The analysis is based on collocated comparisons with higher spatial resolution estimates from Formosat-2 that were first evaluated against local in situ measurements. The intersensor comparison is achieved by taking into account the effective point spread function (PSF) for MODIS albedo, modeled as Gaussian functions in the North-South and East-West directions.
   The equivalent PSF is estimated by correlation analysis between MODIS albedo and Formosat-2 convolved albedo. Results show that it is 1.2 to 2.0 times larger in the East-West direction as compared to the North-South direction. We characterized the equivalent PSF by a full width at half maximum size of 1920 m in East-West, 1200 m in North-South. This provided a very good correlation between the products, showing absolute (relative) Root Mean Square Errors from 0.004 to 0.013 (2% to 7%), and almost no bias. By inspecting 1-km plots homogeneous in land cover type, we found poorer performances over rice and marshes (i.e., relative Root Mean Square Error of about 11% and 7%, and accuracy of 0.011 and -0.008, respectively), and higher accuracy over dry and irrigated pastures, as well as orchards (i.e., relative uncertainty <3.8% and accuracy <0.003). The study demonstrates that neglecting the MODIS PSF when comparing the Formosat-2 albedo against the MODIS one induces an additional uncertainty up to 0.02 (10%) in albedo. The consistency between fine and coarse spatial resolution albedo estimates indicates the ability of the daily MCD43D product to reproduce reasonably well the dynamics of albedo.

AB A comparison of soil moisture products derived from satellite data, in-situ measurements and land models was performed in the frame of the EUMETSAT H-SAF project. In particular, soil moisture retrievals of ASCAT/H-SAF and SMOS were compared with two other independent data sets, that are the NCEP/NCAR volumetric soil moisture content reanalysis developed by NOAA, and the ERA-Interim/Land soil moisture produced by ECMWF. In situ data available through the International Soil Moisture Network and distributed in regions comprising Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain, were also included in the comparison. The whole H-SAF region of interest, including Europe and North Africa, was considered and the period between January 2010 and December 2012 was analysed.
   The Triple Collocation (TC) approach was adopted to perform the comparison exercise. TC was critically reviewed to compare different solutions proposed in the literature and to discuss the possibility of performing a pointwise TC, or a global TC, which considers each system as a whole, with unique gains and error standard deviations in the whole area. The TC results showed a very good behaviour of the ERA land model, while SMOS satellite slightly outperformed ASCAT or vice vexia, depending on factors like the geographical area or the consideration of the whole dynamic range of soil moisture or only the anomalies with respect to the seasonal variability.

TI A Linear Dirichlet Mixture Model for decomposing scenes: Application to
   analyzing urban functional zonings

AB Urban scenes are fundamental to assessing urban landscapes and analyzing the spatial arrangements of functional zonings. Thus, it is important to obtain the information on urban scenes automatically from high-resolution remote sensing images. Previous studies have focused solely on obtaining qualitative labels of scenes (i.e., scene classification) as opposed to quantitative measurements on scenes (Le., scene decomposition). However, scene classification alone cannot satisfy the demands of practical applications, as most scenes are mixed and composed of many categories. This study aims at 1) developing a decomposition model for quantifying mixed semantics of urban scenes, and 2) applying the proposed model to analyze urban functional zonings. For the first target, a Linear Dirichlet Mixture Model (LDMM) is proposed to quantify the relationships between pure scenes (including one single category) and mixed ones (including multiple categories). Since both mixed and pure scenes are characterized by frequency features (e.g., gray histograms of shapes), the variations in the quantization levels of frequency features could lead to different decomposition results. Accordingly, the stationary Markov process is further introduced to estimate the convergent decomposition results. For the second target, the LDMM was applied to obtain the qualitative categories and their quantitative proportions of urban scenes in Beijing and Zhuhai and to assess their spatial arrangements and temporal changes. Our methods were experimentally verified to be reliable and more effective in performance than the Linear Mixture Model and scene classification techniques. The case studies also suggested that Beijing and Zhuhai significantly differ in urban functional zonings and the functional zonings in Beijing have changed much over time, indicating an important transition in the city's economic structure.

AB Glacier surfaces are not only composed of ice or snow but are heterogeneous mixtures of different materials. The occurrence and dynamics of light-absorbing impurities affect ice surface characteristics and strongly influence glacier melt processes. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution of impurities and their impact on ice surface characteristics and the glacier's energy budget is still limited. We use imaging spectroscopy in combination with in-situ experiments to assess the composition of ice surface materials and their respective impact on surface albedo and glacier melt rates. Spectroscopy data were acquired in August 2013 using the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer and were used to map the abundances of six predominant surface materials on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Swiss Alps. A pixel-based classification revealed that about 10% of the ice surface is covered with snow, water or debris. The remaining 90% of the surface can be divided into three types of glacier ice, namely similar to 7% dirty ice, similar to 43% pure ice and similar to 39% bright ice. Spatially distributed spectral albedo derived from APEX reflectance data in combination with in-situ multi-angular spectroscopic measurements was used to analyse albedo patterns present on the glacier surface. About 85% of all pixels exhibit a low albedo between 0.1 and 0.4 (mean albedo 029 +/- 0.12), indicating that Glacier de la Plaine Morte is covered with a significant amount of light-absorbing impurities, resulting in a strong ice-albedo feedback during the ablation season. Using a pixel-based albedo map instead of a constant albedo for ice (0.34) as input for a mass balance model revealed that the glacier-wide total ablation remained similar (10% difference). However, the large local variations in mass balance can only be reproduced using the pixel-based albedo derived from APEX, emphasizing the need to quantify spatial albedo differences as an important input for glacier mass balance models.

AB Floating mats of vegetation serve to transfer biomass, nutrients and energy across marine habitats and alter the spectral properties of the sea surface. Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630 nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3 days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8 days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5 days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990 nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35 m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60 m pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To understand causes and consequences of landscape change, it is often not enough to simply detect change. Rather, the agent causing the change must also be determined. Here, we describe and test a method of change agent attribution built on four tenets: agents operate on patches rather than pixels; temporal context can provide insight into the agent of change; human interpretation is critical because agent labels are inherently human-defined; and statistical modeling must be flexible and non-parametric. In the Puget Sound, USA, we used LandTrendr Landsat time-series-based algorithms to identify abrupt disturbances, and then applied spatial rules to aggregate these to patches. We then derived a suite of spectral, patch-shape, and landscape position variables for each patch. These were then linked to patch-level training labels determined by interpreters at 1198 training patches, and modeled statistically using the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm. Labeled agents of change included urbanization, forest management, and natural change (largely fire), as well as labels associated with spectral change that was non-informative (false change). The success of the method was evaluated using both out-of-bag (OOB) error and a small, fully-independent validation interpretation dataset. Overall OOB accuracy was above 80%, but most successful in the numerically well-represented forest management class. Validation with the independent data was generally lower than that estimated with the OOB approach, but comparable when either first or second voting scores were used for prediction. Spatial and temporal patterns within the study area followed expectations well, with most urbanization occurring in the lower elevation regions around Seattle Tacoma, most forest management occurring in mid-slope managed forests, and most natural disturbance occurring in protected areas. Temporal patterns of change agent aggregated to the watershed level suggest substantial year-over-year variability that could be used to examine year-over-year variability in fish species populations.

AB Chlorophyll fluorescence is directly linked to the physiology of phytoplankton or plants. Here, we present a new satellite remote sensing approach to retrieve chlorophyll fluorescence at its red peak (similar to 685 nm) by using measurements from the hyperspectral instruments SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). This method, which is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, was used to exploit narrow spectral structures resulting from the filling-in of the Fraunhofer Fe I line, which originates from fluorescence. The reference spectra for chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated by the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. We compared our results on marine chlorophyll fluorescence observations with the MODIS Terra normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH) product for the average of years 2003-2011 and year 2009. Our method also enables the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence above land vegetation scenes. The results for the fluorescence observed above terrestrial vegetation for July and December 2009 were compared to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The comparisons show good spatial agreement between different retrievals providing evidence for the good performance of our algorithm. The method presented is generic and can be applied to other hyperspectral instruments in the future. Having established the retrieval technique, extensive studies of chlorophyll fluorescence will improve global knowledge on physiology and photosynthetic efficiency, in both the marine and terrestrial realms, and its dependence on environmental factors.

AB Post-fire regrowth is an important component of carbon dynamics in Canada's boreal forests, yet observations of structural development following fire are lacking across this remote and expansive region. Here, we used Landsat time-series data (1985-2010) to detect high-severity fires in the Boreal Shield West ecozone of Canada, and assessed post-fire structure for >600 burned patches (>13,000 ha) using airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired in 2010. We stratified burned areas into patches of dense (>50% canopy cover) and open (20-50% canopy cover) forests based on a classification of pre-fire Landsat imagery, and used these patches to establish 25-year chronosequence of structural development for each class. While structural attributes were similar between dense and open patches during the first ten years since fire (YSF), canopy cover (cover above 2 in) and stand height (75th height percentile) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for dense patches by the end of the chronosequence (20-25 YSF), suggesting that differences in site productivity were driving patches towards pre-disturbance structure. Our results suggest that growing space remained in stands at the end of the chronosequence, and therefore stem exclusion was not yet reached, as canopy cover was significantly lower (p < 0.001) for patches at 20-25 YSF (mean = 41.9% for dense, 18.6% for open) compared to patches with no recorded burns (mean = 633% for dense, 38.6% for open). The lasting impact of high-severity fire on structure was further confirmed by estimates of stand height, which were approximately half as tall for patches 20-25 YSF (4.9 m for dense, 4.2 m for open) compared to patches with no recorded burns (9.8 m for dense, 7.7 m for open). Additionally, we assessed the structural complexity of burned stands using measures of canopy roughness (i.e., rumple) and the distribution shape of lidar returns (i.e., skewness and kurtosis), which provided evidence of young, even-aged structure once a new overstory was formed. As forest inventories are not routinely conducted across Canada's northern boreal, the fusion of Landsat time-series and airborne lidar data provides powerful means for assessing changes in forest structure following disturbance over this large forested area.

AB The Bering Sea is characterized by unique bio-optical properties, which cause unsatisfactory performance of global ocean color algorithms for retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). This study evaluates the normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a in the eastern Bering Sea that are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua by comparing them to in situ data. MODIS-Aqua ocean color products were derived using the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. The MODIS-derived nL(w)(lambda) showed good agreement with in situ-measured nL(w)(lambda). The mean ratios between them for wavelengths 412, 443, 488, and 551 nm ranged from 1.097 to 1280, with reasonably accurate blue-green radiance ratios in nL(w)(lambda) that were used as input for deriving Chl-a. However, compared to in situ data, existing global and regional Chl-a algorithms either overestimate or underestimate Chl-a in the eastern Bering Sea. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm for estimating Chl-a using a blended approach that was tested and applied to MODIS-Aqua images. The histogram distributions of MODIS-Aqua-derived and in situ-measured Chl-a data show that Chl-a data derived using the new algorithm agree reasonably well to in situ measurements. Annual, seasonal, and monthly composite nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a images are produced for the period of 2003 to 2013 in order to interpret the long-term spatial and temporal patterns of nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a. The nL(w)(lambda) spectra show strong spectral dependence on seasonal variability with distinct spatial patterns. Although strong seasonal and interannual variability has been observed in Chl-a, there is no apparent trend of either increase or decrease in phytoplankton biomass associated with variability in the physical environment for the 11 years of the study period.

AB In the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGMx), plumes of high chlorophyll shelf waters have been observed to extend across the shelf-break to the central basin. Prior research has shown an association between this cross-shelf flow of water and materials and the adjacent rotation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Satellite remote sensing data were used here to identify such an eddy-driven plume and to detect and characterize both the mechanisms driving the plume and its biogeochemical impacts. Satellite imagery included chlorophyll (CHL), fluorescence line height (FLH) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurements from SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, sea surface temperatures from MODIS-Terra, QuikSCAT wind fields and a merged multi-platform sea surface height product (SSHa). In early June 2007 images, a prominent high-CHL plume (HCP) was seen extending from the continental shelf of the NGMx. A comparison of the CHL and SSHa fields revealed that the HCP was coincident with a cyclone-anticyclone pair, thus linked to an apparent cross-shelf transport. Nearest to the shelf, the CHL values associated with the transport fell within the usual CHL temporal and magnitude range for the summer CHL maximum. Further offshore, the HCP-associated CHL increase was temporally offset, occurring several weeks earlier than expected seasonal CHL peaks. Within the HCP, the relationship of CHL:CDOM:FLH notably diverged from the climatological status, supporting the hypothesis that the HCP composition includes modified shelf waters. Estimates of primary productivity across the study region revealed significant increases in productivity within the HCP's boundaries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Issues like monitoring lake water quality, studying the role of lakes in the global carbon cycle or the response of lakes to global change require data more frequently and/or over much larger areas than the in situ water quality monitoring networks can provide. The aim of our study was to investigate whether it is feasible to estimate different lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO(2)) from space using sensors like OLCI on future Sentinel 3. In situ measurements were carried out in eight measuring stations in two Swedish lakes within 2 days of MERIS overpass. The results suggest that the MERIS CDOM product was not suitable for estimating CDOM in lakes Malaren and Tamnaren and was not a good proxy for mapping lake DOC and TOC from space. However, a simple green to red band ratio and some other MERIS products like the total absorption coefficient, turbidity index, suspended matter and chlorophyll-a were correlated with different carbon fractions and could potentially be used as proxies to map these lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO2) from space.

AB Rigorous monitoring of Earth's terrestrial surface requires mapping estimates of land cover and of their errors in space and time. Estimation of error in land-cover change detection currently relies heavily on external, post hoc validation i.e., comparison of estimated cover to independent values that are assumed to be true. However, reference data are themselves uncertain, and acquiring observations coincident with historical data is often impossible. Complementarily, modeling the transmission, or propagation, of error through the processes of classification and change detection provides an internal means to estimate classification and change-detection error at the scale of pixels. Modeling uncertainty around the estimate of fractional, "continuous-field" cover as a standard Normal distribution in each pixel at each of two times, we derive a method for propagating this uncertainty to categorical land cover-classification and change detection. We demonstrate the approach for mapping forest-cover change and its uncertainty based on bi-temporal estimates of percent-tree cover and their associated root-mean-square errors (RMSE). The method described here propagates only the imprecision component of error and not bias, so neither the resulting categorical estimates of cover nor the detection of change (e.g., forest loss) are affected by the transmission of uncertainty. However, propagating the RMSE of input estimates into probabilities of forest cover and change enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of the imprecision resulting from model-based estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree cover to define "forest". When compared to reference data with a fixed definition of forest (e.g., -30% tree cover) the threshold effect is an importance source of apparent error. in forest-cover and -change estimates. The approach described here provides a useful description of classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of forest based on tree cover an especially important consideration given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible structural characteristics.

AB Vegetation has long been an obstacle in efforts to derive snow depth and mass estimates from passive microwave (PM) measurements of brightness temperature (T-b). Though certain metrics have been derived in an effort to characterize the effects of vegetation, some are restricted to certain vegetation types, while others are difficult to measure over the large scales at which spacebome PM measurements are made. In this study, we examine PM measurements made at multiple observation scales in Colorado and Wyoming, and found that spatial variations of airborne T-b data and temporal variation of spacebome T-b data are both highly correlated with a globally available remotely-sensed vegetation dataset, specifically the Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The effective vegetation transmissivity, a physical variable used in existing simple radiative transfer models, is derived from a conservative assumption based on the variability in the measured T-b. We validate our transmissivity estimates over multiple snow seasons and geographic domains. Lastly, based on the variability in the measured T-b with respect to LAI, we define microwave-retrievable areas for PM-based retrieval methods of snow water equivalent (SWE). Over the spatial domain used in this study, over 96% of the area is microwave retrievable at airborne microwave resolutions, which corresponds to 865% of the total SWE. Alternatively at spacebome PM resolution, 52.8% of the land area and 35.5% of the SWE are microwave retrievable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud cover impedes optical satellite remote sensing instruments from obtaining clear views of the Earth's surface. Meanwhile, agriculture is a highly dynamic process, with significant changes in crop biomass and condition often occurring within roughly a week. The Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative represents international efforts to improve the satellite-based monitoring of agricultural processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Within this context, it is necessary to understand how cloud cover impacts the probability of securing reasonably clear views of croplands using passive optical Earth observations as the agricultural growing season progresses. To this end, we employ 10-13 years of twice daily 0.05 degrees MODIS Terra (AM) and Aqua (PM) surface reflectance quality assessment cloud flags to investigate diurnal, geographical, and seasonal (early, mid, late, and non-agricultural growing season) characteristics of cloud cover presence frequency and pervasiveness (amount) over global agricultural areas. To provide insight into the ability of hypothetical missions with two modeled revisit frequencies (f = 2, 4 days) to return reasonably clear views at a rate sufficient to track changes in crop biomass and condition, we show the percentage of 8 day compositing periods throughout the agricultural growing season for which a given clarity requirement (at least 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% cloud-free) could be met.
   This research shows that the early and mid-agricultural growing season, which are important periods for crop type area identification and crop yield forecasting, are characterized by both frequent and pervasive cloud extent. Many important agricultural areas during this and other portions of the agricultural growing season are so persistently and pervasively occluded by clouds that less than half of their 8 day composites would be even 70% clear, suggesting that in these areas/time periods, optical, polar-orbiting imaging is not likely to be a viable option for operational monitoring and alternatives (e.g. microwave synthetic aperture radar, SAR) ought to be considered. Further, for most agricultural areas of the world, regardless of seasonality, morning acquisitions are more likely to return reasonably clear views, an important consideration in the planning of future optical, polar-orbiting Earth observing missions with agricultural monitoring science objectives. These results are an important contribution toward the articulation of Earth observation data requirements for global agricultural monitoring. (C)2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the shortfall in L-band SAR data availability for the purpose of extracting spatially explicit information on forest cover, and the capacity to fill the gap using shorter wavelength C-band data. Specifically, comparisons are made of forest/non-forest (F/NF) extent derived from independent classification of ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 data acquired over Tasmania. Focussing on a temperate forest landscape, it was demonstrated that C-band SAR data can be used interchangeably with L-band data to produce a comparable estimate of forest/non-forest cover. Only partial interoperability is achieved however, given the limitations of dual polarisation C-band SAR in discerning forests of different growth stage and biomass.
   Ambiguities in F/NF status were more prevalent in the C-band classification, despite inclusion of topographic (surface elevation and slope) and textural features in the training dataset, with the key observations as follows: (i) Reduced dynamic range and greater overlap amongst F/NF classes; (ii) Similarities in volume scattering from harvested/regrowth eucalyptus areas and background native forest; (iii) Confusion between young pine plantation and harvested/regrowth areas due to comparable roughness; (iv) Less variation in backscatter and poorer separation of intact and managed eucalyptus forest; and (v) Reduced capacity for discrimination of forest types. In almost every case, the use of L-band data was preferable. The one exception was the limited separation of young pine plantation and harvested/regrowth areas in both C- and L-band data. A similar level of performance was achieved in the discrimination of mature pine plantation, and between young eucalyptus plantation and harvested/regrowth.
   The findings were restricted to single-date classification of C- and L- band data. The potential to extend a time-series of L-band observations over forest using dense time-series (i.e., intra-annual) C-band observations acquired in dual or quad polarisation mode, warrants further investigation. Where a positive trade-off exists between the benefits and costs of integrating these data, multi-frequency (e.g., C- and L-band) and multi-sensor approaches (e.g., SAR and optical) are a viable way forward for operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting.

AB Airborne gamma-ray data (gamma-ray), measuring gamma radiation naturally emitted from the earth's crust has proved useful for predicting the character and distribution of soil properties in forested landscapes. In addition, digital elevation models (DEMs) provide a reliable source of information regarding the hydrological properties of soils. The growth potential of a forest stand is an important parameter in forest management and planning, so that accurate prediction of growth is needed. The present study looked into applying gamma-ray data in combination with DEM-derived attributes for improving the existing individual-tree growth model. To adapt the national model to local conditions, the data of 1118 sample trees and 9987 tally located within 197 sample plots in Southeastern Finland were used. Trees were distributed subjectively to reflect the stands' composition and structure. The main aim was to test the suitability of airborne gamma-ray in combination with DEM-derived attributes for localizing a general parametric prediction model for the trees' growth (diameter at breast height increment for the period of five years). Linear mixed effect procedures were used to fit models derived from the gamma-ray and DEM. Of the various models constructed for comparison purposes, the best result was obtained with broadleaved trees, followed by Scot pine (Pinus sylvestris L) while Norway spruce (Picea abies L) revealed little improvement. The improvement was found to be more accurate in less fertile site types (Vaccinum type (VT) and Calluna type (CT)) as well as on mineral soils. The result was found to be effective in reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and the bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is altering the species composition, structure, and function of vegetation in natural terrestrial ecosystems. These changes can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent, they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

AB The effective use of satellite image time series for examining vegetation response patterns across regional extents requires a method which accounts for variation at the seasonal scale while simultaneously detecting abrupt changes in any long term trends. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm has been developed to do this. However, its effectiveness in semi-arid regions, where vegetation response is typically aseasonal, has yet to be assessed.
   In this research the BFAST algorithm was assessed for a semi-arid study area in the Paroo catchment of far northwestern New South Wales, Australia. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) EVI time series were decomposed using BFAST for 270 sample pixels to assess the algorithm's ability to detect abrupt changes in vegetation response caused by known fires and floods. The algorithm was also applied across the study area to examine regional patterns in the timing and magnitude of abrupt changes and the direction and magnitude of the long term trends.
   The timing of breaks detected by BFAST corresponded with the timing of known floods in the study region for between 68% and 79% of breaks detected across the sample pixels, depending on the parameters used in the decomposition. BEAST was not, however, able to accurately detect fires in the Paroo region, with agreement between the timing of breaks and fires occurring in only 3% of breaks detected. This most likely reflects the low EVI values present before a fire event, which would be typical of semi-arid zones. Spatial patterns in the timing of abrupt changes and greening and browning trends across the study area were a function of land cover and vegetation type. These results indicate that BEAST is able to detect abrupt changes in vegetation greening caused by known floods in semi-arid regions. The presence of spatial patterns in the results also indicates that the algorithm is sensitive to vegetation cover type. BFAST is therefore able to detect abrupt trend changes in regions where vegetation response is not expected to show strong seasonal patterns and could be used in further applications such as classification or regional vegetation modelling in semi-arid environments.

AB We developed a new algorithm called Tmask (multiTemporal mask) for automated masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow for multitemporal Landsat images. This algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is based on a single-date algorithm called Fmask (Function of mask) that initially screens most of the clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The second step benefits from the extra temporal information from the remaining "clear" pixels and further improves the cloud, cloud shadow, and snow mask. Three Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands (Bands 2, 4, and 5 Landsat-7 band numbering) are used in a Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) method to estimate a time series model for each pixel. By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of "noise" factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change.

AB Multiple remote sensing-based approaches to estimating gross afforestation, gross deforestation, and net deforestation are possible. However, many of these approaches have severe data requirements in the form of long time series of remotely sensed data and/or large numbers of observations of land cover change to train classifiers and assess the accuracy of classifications. In particular, when rates of change are small and equal probability sampling is used, observations of change may be scarce. For these situations, post-classification approaches may be the only viable alternative. The study focused on model-assisted and model-based approaches to inference for post-classification estimation of gross afforestation, gross deforestation, and net deforestation using Landsat imagery as auxiliary data. Emphasis was placed on estimation of variances to support construction of statistical confidence intervals for estimates. Both analytical and bootstrap approaches to variance estimation were used. For a study area in Minnesota, USA, estimates of net deforestation were not statistically significantly different from zero. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Florida Everglades plays a significant role in controlling floods, improving water quality, supporting ecosystems, and maintaining biodiversity in south Florida. Adaptive restoration and management of the Everglades requires the best information possible regarding wetland hydrology. We developed a new and innovative approach to quantify spatial and temporal variations in wetland water levels within the Everglades, Florida. We observed high correlations between water level measured at in situ gages and L-band SAR backscatter coefficients in the freshwater marsh, though C-band SAR backscatter has no close relationship with water level. Here we illustrate the complementarity of SAR backscatter coefficient differencing and interferometry (InSAR) for improved estimation of high spatial resolution water level variations in the Everglades. This technique has a certain limitation in applying to swamp forests with dense vegetation cover, but we conclude that this new method is promising in future applications to wetland hydrology research.

AB Global Level-3 surface soil moisture (SM) maps derived from the passive microwave SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) observations at L-band have recently been released. In this study, a comparative analysis of this Level 3 product (referred to as SMOSL3) along with another Surface SM (SSM) product derived from the observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at C-band is presented (this latter product is referred to as AMSRM). SM-DAS-2, a SSM product produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) was used to monitor both SMOSL3 and AMSRM qualities. The present study was carried out from 03/2010 to 09/2011, a period during which both SMOS and AMSR-E products were available at global scale. Three statistical metrics were used for the evaluation; the correlation coefficient (R), the Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD), and the bias. Results were analysed using maps of biomes and Leaf Area Index (LAI). It is shown that both SMOSL3 and AMSRM captured well the spatio-temporal variability of SM-DAS-2 for most of the biomes. In terms of correlation values, the SMOSL3 product was found to better capture the SSM temporal dynamics in highly vegetated biomes ("tropical humid", "temperate humid", etc.) while best results for AMSRM were obtained over arid and semi-arid biomes ("desert temperate", "desert tropical", etc.). Finally, we showed that the accuracy of the remotely sensed SSM products is strongly related to LAI. Both the SMOSL3 and AMSRM (marginally better) SSM products correlated well with the SM-DAS-2 product over regions with sparse vegetation for values of LAI <= 1 (these regions represent almost 50% of the pixels considered in this global study). In regions where LAI>1, SMOSL3 showed better correlations with SM-DAS-2 than AMSRM: SMOSL3 had a consistent performance up to LAI = 6, whereas the AMSRM performance deteriorated with increasing values of LAI. This study reveals that SMOS and AMSR-E complement one another in monitoring SSM over a wide range in conditions of vegetation density and that there are valuable satellite observed SSM data records over more than 10 years, which can be used to study land atmosphere processes.

AB LiDAR waveform data from airborne LiDAR scanners (ALS) e.g. the Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) have been successfully used for estimation of forest height and biomass at local scales and have become the preferred remote sensing dataset However, regional and global applications are limited by the cost of the airborne LiDAR data acquisition and there are no available spacebome LiDAR systems. Some researchers have demonstrated the potential for mapping forest height using aerial or spaceborne stereo imagery with very high spatial resolutions. For stereo images with global coverage but coarse resolution new analysis methods need to be used. Unlike most research based on digital surface models, this study concentrated on analyzing the features of point cloud data generated from stereo imagery. The synthesizing of point cloud data from multi-view stereo imagery increased the point density of the data. The point cloud data over forested areas were analyzed and compared to small footprint LiDAR data and large-footprint LiDAR waveform data. The results showed that the synthesized point cloud data from ALOS/PRISM triplets produce vertical distributions similar to LiDAR data and detected the vertical structure of sparse and non-closed forests at 30 m resolution. For dense forest canopies, the canopy could be captured but the ground surface could not be seen, so surface elevations from other sources would be needed to calculate the height of the canopy. A canopy height map with 30 m pixels was produced by subtracting national elevation dataset (NED) from the averaged elevation of synthesized point clouds, which exhibited spatial features of roads, forest edges and patches. The linear regression showed that the canopy height map had a good correlation with RHSO of LVIS data with a slope of 1.04 and R-2 of 0.74 indicating that the canopy height derived from PRISM triplets can be used to estimate forest biomass at 30 m resolution.

AB The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), scheduled to launch in July 2014, is a NASA mission designed to measure atmospheric CO2. Its main purpose is to allow inversions of net flux estimates of CO2 on regional to continental scales using the total column CO2 retrieved using high-resolution spectra in the 0.76, 1.6, and 2.0 mu m ranges. Recently, it was shown that solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIP), a proxy for gross primary production (GPP, carbon uptake through photosynthesis), can be accurately retrieved from space using high spectral resolution radiances in the 750 nm range from the Japanese GOSAT and European GOME-2 instruments. Here, we use real OCO-2 thermal vacuum test data as well as a full repeat cycle (16 days) of simulated OCO-2 spectra under realistic conditions to evaluate the potential of OCO-2 for retrievals of chlorophyll fluorescence and also its dependence on clouds and aerosols. We find that the single-measurement precision is 03-0.5 Wm(-2)sr(-1) mu m(-1) (15-25% of typical peak values), better than current measurements from space but still difficult to interpret on a single-sounding basis. The most significant advancement will come from smaller ground-pixel sizes and increased measurement frequency, with a 100-fold increase compared to GOSAT (and about 8 times higher than GOME-2). This will largely decrease the need for coarse spatial and temporal averaging in data analysis and pave the way to accurate local studies. We also find that the lack of full global mapping from the OCO-2 only incurs small representativeness errors on regional averages. Eventually, the combination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) derived from CO2 source/sink inversions and SIF as proxy for GPP from the same satellite will provide a more process-based understanding of the global carbon cycle.

AB The compiled archive of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Advanced SAR (ASAR) onboard the Envisat satellite over the White Sea during the extended summer periods (May-September) between 2007 and 2011, provides the first detailed analysis of 2-D patterns of internal waves (IWs) in the White Sea. Unambiguously, the primary region of IW activity is the southwestern (SW) Gorlo Strait (GS). LW packets emerging from this area are regularly observed to reach crest lengths up to 200 km, and also to propagate a few hundred kilometers from their origin. Model results confirm that large-scale IWs can be generated every tidal cycle and are able to cross the entire sea. As suggested, the source of these packets is governed by the intense dynamics of the frontal zone in the tidal cycle over local complex bottom. As further revealed, these large-scale IWs cascade into intense large-amplitude short LW packets on the shoaling White Sea shelf, significantly impacting vertical turbulent exchange and the overall hydrology.

AB Annual variation of U.S. corn production is an important matter of world concern. To assure immediate response to large-scale harvest failure in crop exporting regions, as was the case during the severe U.S. drought in 2012, and to enhance global food security, a practical crop growth monitoring system based on satellite data is required. This study developed a practical method for near real-time prediction of U.S. corn yields using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) taken 7 days before the corn silking stage. We incorporated two algorithms into the MODIS-based corn yield prediction method; namely, (1) a MODIS-based crop classification algorithm in consideration of differences in emergence dates between corn and soybean, and (2) a simple bias correction algorithm for correcting region-dependent yield prediction errors. The method is able to predict the annual variation of national and state level corn grain yields with high accuracy in early August and detect corn yield reductions and poor-harvest regions due to drought damage, as in 2002 and 2012, on a near real-time basis in advance of those provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The method also predicted a national-level U.S. corn grain yield for 2013, which was 3.8% lower than the NASS-statistical data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors obtain regular and frequent radar images from which ground motion can be precisely detected using a variety of different techniques. The ability to measure slope displacements remotely over large regions can have many uses, although the limitations of the most commonplace technique, differential InSAR (D-InSAR), must be considered prior to interpreting the final results. One such limitation is the assumption that different rates of movement over a given distance cannot exceed a threshold value, dependent upon the pixel spacing of the SAR images and the radar wavelength. Characteristic features of landslides (Le. the sharp boundary between stable/active ground and the range of temporally-variable velocities) can exhibit high spatial displacement gradients, breaking a fundamental assumption for reliable D-InSAR analysis. Areas of low coherence are also known to hinder the exploitation of InSAR data. This study assesses the capability of TerraSAR-X Spotlight TerraSAR-X Stripmap and Envisat Stripmap images for monitoring the slow-moving Shuping landslide in the densely vegetated Three Gorges region, China. In this case study, the episodic nature of movement is shown to exceed the measurable limit for regular D-InSAR analysis even for the highest resolution 11-day TSX Spotlight interferograms. A Sub-Pixel Offset Time-series technique applied to corner reflectors (SPOT-CR) using only the SAR amplitude information is applied as a robust method of resolving time-varying displacements, with verifiable offset measurements presented from TSX Spotlight and TSX Stripmap imagery. Care should be exercised when measuring potentially episodic landslide movements in densely vegetated areas such as the Three Gorges region and corner reflectors are shown to be highly useful for SPOT techniques even when the assumptions for valid D-InSAR analysis are broken. Finally the capability to derive two-dimensional movements from sub-pixel offsets (in range and along-track directions) can be used to derive estimates of the vertical and northwards movements to help infer the landslide failure mechanism.

AB This study presents the results of the comparison between sea surface wind speed (SWS) estimates made by MetOp-A scatterometer ASCAT and GCOM-W1 Advanced Microwave Sounding Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) relating to winds developing in the extratropical cyclones (ECs) over the North Atlantic. One season of winter ECs of 2012-2013 is considered in which 33 most intensive ECs are selected for the study. ASCAT Level 2 operational coastal wind vector product is used for the comparison, whereas AMSR2 SWS values are calculated with newly developed algorithms. Two algorithms for SWS retrieval from AMSR2 are based on numerical simulation of AMSR2 brightness temperatures (T-B) over the oceans and their following inversion with Neural Networks. The first algorithm uses T-B measurements at higher frequency AMSR2 channels (HF algorithm), the second one uses T-B measurements at lower frequency channels (LF algorithm). It is demonstrated that both AMSR2 SWS estimates are highly correlated with ASCAT SWS for the range of low and moderate wind speeds which opens new potential for possible merging of active and passive microwave SWS products. It is shown also that LF AMSR2 algorithm overestimates ASCAT winds greater than 15 m/s. To support the comparison results SWS estimates by AMSR2 are validated against in-situ wind speed measurements from platform weather stations in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, including high wind events.

AB We present results of the quantitative monitoring and assessment of suspended sediment in Yellow River estuary from the imagery of TM and ETM + (TM/ETM +) aboard Landsat satellites. The estuary is one of the world's most turbid areas with high concentration of suspended sediment (SSC). As a result, an atmospheric correction algorithm is required for TM/ETM + when applied to monitor SSC in the estuary. Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at TM/ETM + bands is retrieved using the air molecule and aerosol scattering information provided by MODIS aboard Terra satellite, which has highly improved radiometric calibration, sensitivity, and spectral bands designed for estimating aerosol radiance. Rrs at the red band is used for retrieving SSC by means of the model developed from in-situ data. TM/ETM + measured water color products (Rrs and SSC) are cross validated with MODIS measurements, which are validated by contemporaneous in-situ data. The cross validation shows that, with the proper atmospheric correction algorithm and retrieval model, TM/ETM+ data can be used to quantify the SSC in Yellow River estuary.
   Interannual and seasonal variations, as well as spatial distribution, of SSC in Yellow River estuary are studied and assessed using TM/ETM + measurements from 2000 to 2010. Results show that the SSC is generally increasing from 2000 to the maximum in 2003 and then decreasing and is highly correlated with the annual total sediment discharge from Yellow River. The correlation is not so high for the SSC in Bohai and Laizhou bays. In addition, the SSC in the estuary is generally increasing from June to the maximum in Nov. and then decreasing to the minimum in April. The seasonal variation pattern results from Yellow River sediment discharge, which is higher in JuneNov., corresponding to the flood season than in other months. The SSC in Laizhou and Bohai bays generally follow the same seasonal variation pattern that is higher in Nov.-Apr. than in other months. The higher SSC mainly results from the wind-driven resuspension of bottom sediment (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting non-photosynthetic materials challenges multispectral remote sensing of vegetation. Dead component of grasslands, including litter and standing dead material as the accumulated phytomass of grassland productivity from previous years, is a primary connection in nutrient cycles in grasslands, and also conserves soil moisture and redistributes the grassland surface temperature. However, unlike green vegetation, it is hard to estimate the dead component with remote sensing approaches because the spectral signal of dead materials is similar to that of bare soil or soil crust (moss and lichen), with the only difference in the shortwave infrared region near 2000 nm. In the literature, the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), an index based on hyperspectral imagery, is the most popular index for assessing dead cover or dead biomass. However, hyperspectral imagery is still not available for most grasslands worldwide. Therefore, a method to assess dead component using multispectral band imagery (e.g. Landsat imagery in this study) is needed. Grasslands National Park (GNP) in the southern part of Saskatchewan, Canada, has a large amount of accumulated dead vegetation because of long term conservation actions, which makes it a good study area for this project. This study aims to explore the relation between NDVI and dead cover, to investigate how different amounts of dead material change the relation of total biomass and NDVI, and also to test the potential to estimate dead cover using multispectral images. The results show that NDVI and dead cover have positive relationship when dead cover is less than 20%, no correlation when dead cover is between 20 and 80%, and significant negative relation when dead cover is more than 80%; further, the relation of total biomass and NDVI also changes with the same thresholds. The results also indicate that the dead component can be estimated with multispectral images using Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) or Normalized Difference water index (NDWI), but the relationships are highly influenced by bare soil and soil crust.

AB Spring phenological events are important for the assessment of the carbon budget in forest ecosystems. In large parts of the boreal zone the evergreen conifers are dominant, but most available satellite-based methods for the detection of the start of the growing season have focussed on the greening-up of deciduous species. We investigated the possibility of determining spring phenological events of boreal evergreen coniferous forest from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series based on test sites in Finland. The beginning of the photosynthetically active period, determined from the CO2 fluxes measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method, was used as a primary reference for the onset of the growing season (growing season start date, GSSD). Furthermore, phenological observations of pine trees, such as the beginning of shoot elongation (growth of pine start date, GPSD) were included in the comparison. The corresponding indicators were derived from MODIS data and compared with in situ phenological observations. This was carried out using cloud-filtered daily MODIS time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) from homogenous areas around in situ sites (3 EC sites and 4 phenological sites in Finland). GSSD in coniferous forest showed correspondence with the time during snowmelt when the ground starts to be exposed, which was indicated by a decrease in FSC and the spring-rise in NDVI time-series. GPSD occurred in general after complete snow melt. Satellite-derived GSSD from NDVI (GSSD(NDVI)) and FSC (GSSD(FSC)) showed good correspondence with in situ observations for both NDVI and FSC (R-2>0.8, RMSE <7 days) including observations from two CO2 flux measurement sites in Northern Finland and one in Southern Finland. The highest site-wise correlations were obtained for the satellite indicator GSSD(FSC). Finally, the national-scale mapping of GSSD was demonstrated based on the satellite-derived indicator GSSD(FSC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The dynamic, tropical glaciers of the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca are rapidly changing and these changes are expected to affect water availability, especially during the dry season. In this study, we quantify recent changes to these water reservoirs, providing estimates of glacier area in the Cordillera Blanca and sub-watersheds of the Rio Santa for the following years 1987, 1996, 2004, and 2010. We explore the effects of atmospheric and topographic corrections by comparing debris-free glacier area estimates generated using raw scenes and corrected scenes. Our results suggest that these corrections can have a significant impact on debris-free glacier area estimates when the same threshold is applied. Debris-free glacier area estimates derived from uncorrected scenes are approximately 5% less than debris-free glacier area estimates derived from atmospherically-corrected scenes. We determined that debris-free glacier area estimates are most sensitive to the choice of threshold and topographic effects. To map glacier area change, we used high-resolution satellite imagery to calibrate our selection of a single threshold for the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). This threshold value was applied to all NDSI images, which were derived from four carefully selected and atmospherically-corrected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired at the end of the dry season. In order to calculate total glacier area, we manually mapped debris-covered glaciers, because automated methods were unsuccessful in this region. As of August 2010, the Cordillera Blanca had a total glacier area of 482 km(2), which amounts to a 25% decrease since 1987. Glaciers in the southern portions of the Cordillera Blanca, which have lower median elevations on average, lost a greater percentage of their area from 1987 to 2010, relative to their northern counterparts. Overall, glacier area change in the Cordillera Blanca appears to be accelerating. Between 2004 and 2010, glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca lost area at a rate that was approximately 3.5 times the average rate of area loss from 1970 to 2003. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Natural hazards caused by insect outbreaks, such as those induced by the European bark beetle Ups typographus L), are among the most extensive disturbances affecting forest health in various geographical regions. Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of the spatial distribution of bark beetle-infested trees is critical for forest managers to effectively plan appropriate countermeasures and predict future bark beetle infestation dynamics. In this study, three scenarios for mapping bark beetle-induced tree mortality based on airborne hyperspectral data (HyMap) were examined including combining a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection with a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification. The scenarios differed in how the mortality classes (used to extract the spectral signatures) were defined. Scenario 1 included three mortality classes, while Scenario 2 and 3 each included only one general mortality-related class but with different definitions. The classes, derived from the three scenarios, served as inputs into feature selection facilitated by the GA. The most stable bands, selected by the GA, were then used as input bands for a bootstrapped supervised SVM classification procedure. In two of the three scenarios, the trained classifier was additionally applied to a second independent hyperspectral image to evaluate the stability of the spectral signatures derived from the training samples. The classification procedure was further refined by varying the number of input bands and the input data types, where the bands not only included the original reflectances of the HyMap images but also a first order Savitzlcy-Golay derivation and continuum-removed spectra. The results of the study indicate that an accurate differentiation of three mortality classes was not possible with the applied methodology. The defined pre-visual "green mortality stage" class in particular was found to be heavily overestimated based on the qualitative analysis of the classified maps and validation statistics (error of commission 65% as shown by the user's accuracy).
   However, on the other hand, the mapping of dead trees was possible with notably high overall accuracies (OAs) (84%-96%). These results could also be transferred to the second independent hyperspectral image, in which the separation between the healthy trees and the dead trees was possible with OAs of 94%-97%. Somewhat lower but still reasonable OAs (76%-85%) were found when all defined classes were considered. The main confusion occurred between dead trees and sparsely vegetated soil.
   GA analysis showed that bands that notably contributed to high classification accuracies were frequently located in the visual part of the spectrum, close to the green peak (560 nm), as well as around the chlorophyll absorption feature (680 nm) and the red edge rise (690 nm). In some of the tested cases, additional bands in the SWIR (1532 nm) and one in the NIR (1076 nm) were stably selected by the GA, which indicated the importance of these bands in the classification process.

AB Several studies showed the linkage of the Three Gorges Dam to the downstream coastal ecosystem in the East China Sea, yet its potential influence on the total suspended matters (TSM) in the Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters has not been reported, possibly due to technical difficulties in obtaining statistically meaningful results. Here, a new remote sensing algorithm was established to estimate TSM from MODIS observations over the Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters. The algorithm was based on a piecewise regression between TSM and surface reflectance at 645 and 869 nm, leading to RMS uncertainties of only 20-30% for TSM between 2 mg L-1 and 1762 mg L-1. The algorithm was applied to MODIS data to derive TSM distribution maps from 2000 to 2010 at 250 m resolution, which revealed significant spatial and temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability. Mean TSM in the Yangtze Estuary increased from 44.4 +/- 34.1 mg L-1 in May to 96.0 +/- 58.0 mg L-1 in October, while much higher TSM was found in the nearby Hangzhou Bay (between 1003 +/- 51.6 mg L-1 in August and 290.2 +/- 120.0 mg L-1 in February). Two regions showed significantly out-of-phase seasonality: region A1 in the Yangtze Estuary driven by sediment discharge from the Yangtze River and region A2 in offshore waters and part of Hangzhou Bay driven by winds. The annual mean TSM in region A1 showed significantly decreasing trend in the 11-year period (-2.8 mgL(-1)/yr), which appeared to be caused by the construction of the TGD. The study also has established a TSM environmental data record (EDR) to assess future TSM in the ecologically and economically important Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The quantification of land surface evapotranspiration (ET) at daily or longer time scales is of great significance in modeling the global hydrological cycle, studying climate change, and managing water resources. However, current remote sensing-based ET models can generally only provide snapshots of ET at the time of a satellite overpass and do not satisfy the expectations of hydrologists, irrigation engineers, or water resource managers concerned with practical applications. Four commonly used ET upscaling schemes, namely, the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method, the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (R-p) method, and the constant observed global solar radiation ratio (R-g) method, were evaluated in this study using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived estimates from a two-source energy balance model. Analysis was made of both closed and un-closed surface fluxes and of different assumed satellite overpass times from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. Data for the analysis were collected at the Yucheng comprehensive experimental station in Northern China, spanning the period from late April 2009 to late October 2011. The results show that all four upscaling factors from noon to mid-afternoon had a better agreement with their corresponding daily averages. Overall, the EFr (R-g) method had the best (second best) performance of the four upscaling methods. The EF method was found to significantly underestimate the daily latent heat flux (LE) and performed the worst of the four upscaling methods. With the correction of the energy imbalance of EC measurements, the R-g method's performance was improved and outperformed the EF, method in the morning. The presence of clouds either increased or decreased the BIAS but generally increased the root mean square error (RMSE) for all four upscaling methods. When the upscaling methods were applied to convert the instantaneous MODIS remote sensing estimates of ET to daily values, the accuracy of the extrapolated daily ET was controlled by the accuracy of both the remote sensing ET estimates and the upscaling methods themselves. With the insignificantly biased estimates of the instantaneous LE from the N95 model at 101 MODIS overpass times in this study, using the EF method underestimated the daily ET by 11%, while all the remaining three factors overestimated the daily ET by a range of 5%-18%. This study was conducted to provide a scientific basis for developing an operational and more accurate ET-upscaling method with easy access to data in future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) of savanna woodlands is needed for evaluating the terrestrial carbon cycle at various spatial and temporal scales. The eddy covariance (EC) technique provides continuous measurements of net CO2 exchange (NEE) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Only a few flux tower sites were run in Africa and very limited observational data of savanna woodlands in Africa are available. Although several publications have reported on the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of savanna vegetation through partitioning the measured NEE data, current knowledge about GPP and phenology of savanna ecosystems is still limited. This study focused on two savanna woodland flux tower sites in Botswana and Zambia, representing two dominant savanna woodlands (mopane and miombo) and climate patterns (semi-arid and semi-humid) in Southern Africa. Phenology of these savanna woodlands was delineated from three vegetation indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GPP estimated from eddy covariance measurements at flux tower sites (GPP(EC)). The Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by satellite images and meteorological data, was also evaluated, and the results showed that the VPM-based GPP estimates (GPP(VPM)) were able to track the seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC). The total GPP(VPM) and GPP(EC) within the plant growing season defined by a water-related vegetation index differed within the range of +/- 6%. This study suggejts that the VPM is a valuable tool for estimating GPP of semi-arid and semi-humid savanna woodland ecosystems in Southern Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Integrating multiple satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products is one of the ways to improve the accuracy, spatial resolution and completeness of satellite SST products. In this paper, The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME), a nonlinear geostatistical methodology, is used for blending the satellite SST datasets (SSTs) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) on EOS Aqua satellite. An error model is developed to link the MODIS SST and the AMSR-E SST at different resolutions. The AMSR-E SSTs are processed as probability soft data by this error model to take into account the uncertainty associated with coarser resolution pixels. The MODIS SSTs are taken as hard data. The soft AMSR-E SSTs and hard MODIS SSTs are then merged in the BME paradigm to produce 8-day average and spatially continuous SSTs with 4 km spatial resolution. The Merged SSTs are validated by using the drifting buoy SST records. The local variance is used to evaluate the ability of the BME method in preserving the original fine spatial structure of the 4 km resolution MODIS SSTs in the blended SSTs. The validation results show that the RMSE and Bias for the BME blended SSTs over the whole study area in 2003 are 0.653 degrees C and -0.146 degrees C, respectively. These values are a bit larger than those for AMSR-E SST (the RMSE and Bias are 0.504 degrees C and 0.0392 degrees C, respectively) and MODIS SST (the RMSE and Bias are 0.635 degrees C and -0.102 degrees C, respectively). The estimations of SST pixels where both of MODE and AMSR-E have missing data have a Bias of -0.255 degrees C and an RMSE of 0.826 degrees C. The difference in local variance between the Merged SSTs and MODIS SSTs is less than 0.01 degrees C-2, and the difference between the Merged SSTs and AMSR-E SSTs is about 0.19 degrees C-2. The blended 4-km SST data set is equal to MODIS SST in revealing the fine scale structures of SST spatial variation. In addition, the blended SST dataset has the complete spatial coverage. The results demonstrate the blending potential of BME for multiple scales satellite derived products integration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We developed a two-step algorithm for retrieving and then monitoring the concentration of Saharan dusts and of the sea-surface chlorophyll from satellite ocean-color multi-spectral observations. The first step consisted in classifying the top of the atmosphere (TOA) spectra using a neuronal classifier, which provided the aerosol type and a first-guess value of the aerosol parameters that was used to initialize the variational method. The variational method was the second step, which retrieved accurate measurements of the aerosol and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The algorithm was conditioned to take into account the absorbing aerosols, such as the Saharan dusts. We used this algorithm to analyze 13 years of SeaWiFS images (September 1997-December 2009) over an area of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. Since our method allowed us to take Saharan dusts into account, the number of pixels processed for retrieving the chlorophyll-a concentration was an order of magnitude higher than that processed by the standard SeaWiFS algorithm. The analysis of the SeaWiFS images showed that the Saharan dust concentration was maximal in summer during the rainy season and minimal in autumn, which could be explained by the seasonal variability of dust emission triggered by mesoscale atmospheric processes (low-level jet and convection) and soil characteristics (humidity and vegetation).

AB The characteristics of westward copropagating features in satellite altimetry, sea surface temperature and ocean colour data are investigated throughout the global oceans between 50 degrees north and 50 degrees south for the period 1998-2008. A new 'hybrid' filtering approach allowing features with periods between 37 and 410 days to pass polewards of 20 degrees north and south and features with periods between 37 and 205 days to pass within 20 degrees of the equator is found to isolate features whose speed is consistent with predictions of long planetary wave theory throughout much of the oceans. Features with wavelengths between 300 and 800 km and periods between 205 and 410 days are shown to be a significant source of temperature and chlorophyll variability between 20 degrees and 50 degrees north and south, whilst within 20 degrees of the equator, signals in the 800-1500 km and 37-205 days range are predominant. Between 15 degrees and 50 degrees north and south, observed propagation speeds are found to closely match those predicted for first-mode baroclinic Rossby waves by theory. In the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, features with wavelengths (800-2000 km), periods (15-40 days) and phase speeds (20-50 cm s(-1)) characteristic of tropical instability waves are preferentially observed. The amplitude and phase relationship between copropagating signals in ocean colour and altimetry and sea surface temperature and altimetry is interpreted in terms of the horizontal (meridional) advection of mean temperature and chlorophyll gradients by Rossby waves, similar to what has recently been observed for non-linear eddies at shorter length scales. The observed phase relationships are in good agreement with the range of phases expected for horizontal advection throughout much of the oceans and consistent with the sign of the mean meridional gradients of temperature and chlorophyll. These results support the view that horizontal advection (be it from waves and/or eddies) is the dominant mode of covariation of temperature and chlorophyll with sea surface height throughout most of the oceans, although the agreement between predicted and observed amplitude and phase relationships is insufficient to completely rule out vertical mechanisms in a few regions. We believe that a 'one size fits all' approach for global Rossby wave studies can no longer be considered valid, and although we have modified our technique to take this into account, we advocate future work to develop a fully latitudinally dependent filtering methodology.

AB The satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) erythemal daily dose (EDD) product is validated through an inter-comparison with ground-based measurements at 14 ground-based stations distributed worldwide between 43 degrees N and 64 degrees S in 5 different countries of both hemispheres: Argentina, Australia, Italy, Israel, and Spain. The results show that OMI data overestimate ground-based EDD measurements except in stations with high surface albedo (e.g., covered by snow), in agreement with the results reported by previous studies. The average differences between satellite and ground-based data reached a maximum of similar to 25% for all-sky cases. When cloudless conditions are selected, removing intra-daily changes in cloudiness, the agreement improves; although average differences between 10 and 20% still appear for seven low-albedo stations. The influences of ozone and aerosol on the observed differences show opposite trends: viz., high ozone column values result in a decrease whereas high turbidity conditions produce an increase in the differences. A correction factor based on the aerosol absorbing optical thickness was applied to correct for this effect, which is not considered in the OMI algorithm. After applying this correction, the agreement between OMI and ground-based EDD measurements improves and the difference between them falls below 20% for more than 90% of the cases at 8 stations. A dependence on station altitude is also noted for both all-sky and clear-sky cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The rapid increase of aerosols over the Indian Subcontinent over the last decade has the potential for severe health implications. However, the lack of a dense network to measure PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter<2.5 mu m) hinders health risk assessments at regional scale. Here, we utilize Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)-retrieved columnar aerosol optical depths to estimate surface PM2.5 based on recently published conversion factors that account for the composition and vertical distribution of aerosols. We examine the space-time variability of bias-corrected (utilizing coincident in-situ observations) PM2.5 over the Indian Subcontinent for the period Mar 2000-Feb 2010. We show that 51% of the subcontinent's 1.4 billion people are exposed to pollution that exceed the World Health Organization's highest annual air quality threshold of 35 mu g m(-3), while another 13% and 18% are exposed in the ranges 25-35 and 15-25 mu g m(-3) respectively. Of the remaining population who breathe clean air, only 25% live in urban areas. In many regions, the high-levels of pollution are persistent rather than episodic. PM2.5 concentrations in the rural areas of the Indo-Gangetic Basin are higher than many urban centers in peninsular India. Five hotspots (where PM2.5 increases by > 15 mu g m(-3) over the ten-year period) are identified, which cover parts of the eleven Indian states and Bangladesh affecting similar to 23% of the population. Our results highlight the urgent need to carry out local cohort studies at these hotspots to better understand the health impacts under local conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the long history of vegetation mapping with remote sensing, challenges remain in effectively linking remote sensing observations with plant traits and environmental disturbance across species and functional types. This study proposes a classification of aquatic and wetland vegetation plant functional types (PFTs) using time series remotely sensed data applicable to wetland ecosystems with large annual water level changes like Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland of China. We first developed the aquatic and wetland PFT classification scheme which included perennial C-4 grasses, perennial C-3 reed, C-3 (sedges and taller forbs), short C-3 forbs, floating aquatic macrophytes, and submerged aquatic macrophytes. Using this scheme, time series normalized difference vegetation index (time series NDVI) images and time series vegetation-water index (time series VWI) images extracted from 32-m spatial resolution Beijing-1 microsatellite data were applied to perform two PFT classifications with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We found that the time series NDVI-based SVM classification method mapped aquatic and wetland PFT distribution with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. However, when the information on water level fluctuation was combined with time series NDVI into a new time series index (referred to as time series VWI), the overall accuracy increased to 90.4%. Results suggest that time series VWI has a stronger capability in distinguishing wetland PFTs with different submersion times and flood tolerances than time series NDVI, and thus may be considered as a key input dataset for future PFt classifications in seasonally dynamic wetlands.

AB Uncertainty information for global leaf area index (LAI) products is important for global modeling studies but usually difficult to systematically obtain at a global scale. Here, we present a new method that cross-validates existing global LAI products and produces consistent uncertainty information. The method is based on a triple collocation error model (TCEM) that assumes errors among LAI products are not correlated. Global monthly absolute and relative uncertainties, in 0.05 degrees spatial resolutions, were generated for MODIS, CYCLOPES, and GLOBCARBON LAI products, with reasonable agreement in terms of spatial patterns and biome types. CYCLOPES shows the lowest absolute and relative uncertainties, followed by GLOBCARBON and MODIS. Grasses, crops, shrubs, and savannas usually have lower uncertainties than forests in association with the relatively larger forest LAI. With their densely vegetated canopies, tropical regions exhibit the highest absolute uncertainties but the lowest relative uncertainties, the latter of which tend to increase with higher latitudes. The estimated uncertainties of CYCLOPES generally meet the quality requirements (+/- 0.5) proposed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), whereas for MODIS and GLOBCARBON only non-forest biome types have met the requirement. Nevertheless, none of the products seems to be within a relative uncertainty requirements of 20%. Further independent validation and comparative studies are expected to provide a fair assessment of uncertainties derived from TCEM. Overall, the proposed TCEM is straightforward and could be automated for the systematic processing of real time remote sensing observations to provide theoretical uncertainty information for a wider range of land products.

TI A new geostatistical approach for filling gaps in Landsat ETM plus

AB Since the failure of scan-line corrector (SLC) of the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, a number of methods have been developed to fill the un-scanned gaps in ETM+ images. Unfortunately, the quality of the images filled by most of these existing methods is still not satisfactory, particularly in heterogeneous regions. Recently, a Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI) was developed that can accurately fill gaps in SLC-off images even in heterogeneous regions. However, the NSPI method is a type of deterministic interpolation approach that sets its weight parameters empirically and cannot provide statistical uncertainty of prediction. This study proposes a new gap-filling method called Geostatistical Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (GNSPI) by improving the NSPI method using geostatistical theory. The simulation study shows that: compared with previous geostatistical methods, the image filled by GNSPI has fewer striping effects: compared with NSPI, GNSPI is less empirical in its weight parameters and can provide uncertainty of prediction. More importantly, it can generate more accurate results than NSPI, especially when there is a long time interval between the input auxiliary image and the target SLC-off image. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, is well known for its ecological and economic importance as well as its rapid changes in lake inundation areas. However, due to technical difficulties, to date long-term records of its dynamic inundation areas are lacking, not to mention how they are affected by climate change and/or human activities. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) medium-resolution (250-m) data collected between 2000 and 2010 and an objective water/land delineation method, we documented and studied the short- and long-term characteristics of lake inundation. Significant seasonality and inter-annual variability were found in the monthly and annual mean inundation areas. The inundation area ranged between 714.1 km(2) in October 2009 and 3162.9 km(2) in August 2010, and the inundation area during any particular year could change by a factor of 2.3-3.2. During the 11-year period, the maximum possible inundation area was 14 times the minimum possible inundation area, indicating extreme variability. Both the annual mean and minimum inundation areas showed statistically significant declining trends from 2000 to 2010 (-30.2 km(2) yr(-1) and-23.9 km(2) yr(-1), p<0.05). The changes of the inundation area were primarily driven by local precipitation during non-summer months, while during summer months of July to September when the outflow into the Yangtze River was impeded the effect of precipitation became less significant. These results provide long-term baseline data to monitor future changes in Poyang Lake's inundation area in a timely fashion, for example quantifying the extreme drought conditions during spring 2011.

AB Seasonal snow cover is a valuable indicator of climatic variations due to its sensitivity to temperature and precipitation. Complementary to ground-based station data, satellite time series provide large-scale spatial capabilities. The primary disadvantage of this technique, however, is the relative brevity of records. Only AVHRR offers the opportunity to analyze more than 25 years of medium-resolution satellite imagery on a daily basis. AVHRR thereby holds a great potential to detect, map and quantify long-term environmental changes. However, to serve this purpose though, adequate algorithms and careful validation are or major significance.
   Here, we describe and extensively validate snow cover retrieval from historical 1-km AVHRR data using a stable snow detection algorithm, which allows consistent snow sampling across all AVHRR sensors. As a new asset, a pixel-wise probability map based on logistic regression is provided for each snow mask. The spatial and seasonal validation includes a comparison to MOD10A1 and webcam imagery. In addition, the influence of acquisition geometry and the sensor-to-sensor consistency have been investigated using LANDSAT TM data and a snow climatology based on long-term station data.
   We conclude that the snow detection algorithm tested allows for a 1-km snow extent climatology to be generated from the 25-year full-resolution AVHRR data archived at the University of Bern with favorable accuracy and stability. Given the importance of mountainous regions for climate change studies, this satellite-based data set could become an important tool for assessing environmental changes in the European Alps.

AB Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is the most ambitious operational Earth Observation programme to date and will provide global, timely and easily accessible information in application domains such as land, marine, atmosphere, emergency response, climate change and security.
   To accomplish this, the European Union (EU)-led GMES programme comprises three components namely the space component, the in-situ component and the service component. The space component, led by ESA, is in its pre-operational stage, serving users with satellite data acquired by the so called "GMES Contributing Missions" already available today or planned at European, national and international level. It will become operational once the dedicated space infrastructure, comprised by the "Sentinel" missions and their corresponding ground segments are operational. The first of these satellite series will be launched in 2013. The Sentinel missions will provide a unique set of observations utilising different techniques spanning C-band SAR, mid to medium resolution optical and thermal observations with increased spectral resolution, altimeter and dedicated spectrometers for atmospheric chemistry.
   This data, combined with in-situ data, some assimilated into models, will then be turned into services for monitoring the environment, the climate and for security related issues.
   The GMES Space Component (GSC) is organised in two overlapping phases: the development phase and the operational phase, the latter planned to start in 2014. The main challenge is now to ensure the programme's long-term sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The high data throughput of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments introduces stringent requirements on the end-to-end system, from the on-board storage capacity and data downlink to processing power and archiving capacity in the ground segment. An efficient raw data compression scheme on-board the satellite is therefore required to maximise the return on investment for SAR missions. The next generation of European SAR satellites, the Sentinel-1 mission, will employ the Flexible Dynamic Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ) compression scheme. In order to validate the implementation of the FDBAQ, expected radar reflectivity levels for the global land surface were needed.
   The paper presents the development of the Global Backscatter Model (GBM) which has been used to simulate realistic radar reflectivity acquisitions in support of performance validation of the Sentinel-1 FDBAQ implementation. The GBM consists of a parameter database and SAR image simulation software. The model parameter database characterises C-band radar reflectivity as a function of local incidence angle with a resolution of 1 km for 85% of the global land surface. The parameter database was derived from a global multi-temporal coverage of ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data. The SAR image simulation software uses the parameter database together with orbit propagation and swath determination algorithms in order to account for the instrument acquisition geometry and the location specific backscattering characteristics. The model has the potential to simulate acquisitions for other SAR instruments. Furthermore, the parameter database could be a valuable source of information for global land cover studies.

AB The demand for renewable energy has raised a need for efficient mapping of forest fuel resources in Denmark. Airborne laser scanning may provide a means for assessing local forest biomass resources. In this study, national forest inventory (NFI) data was used as reference data for modeling forest basal area, volume, above-ground biomass, and total biomass from laser scanning data obtained in a countrywide scanning survey. Data covered a wide range of forest ecotypes, stand treatments, tree species, and tree species mixtures. The four forest characteristics were modeled using nonlinear regression and generalized method-of-moments estimation to avoid biased and inefficient estimates. The coefficient of determination was 68% for the basal area model and 77-78% for the volume and biomass models. Despite the wide range of forest types model accuracy was comparable to similar studies. Model predictions were unbiased across the range of predicted values and crown cover percentages but positively biased for deciduous forest and negatively biased for coniferous forest. Species type specific (coniferous, deciduous, or mixed forest) models reduced root mean squared error by 3-12% and removed the bias. In application, model predictions will be improved by stratification into deciduous and coniferous forest using e.g. infrared orthophotos or satellite images. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Tillage practices, which have direct impacts on soil and water quality, have changed dramatically during the past several decades. Tillage information is one of the important inputs for environmental modeling, but the availability of this information is still limited spatially and temporally. Previous studies have encountered difficulties in defining reliable correlations between crop residue cover (CRC) and Landsat-based tillage indices because they neglected the significance of the timing of tillage implementation. This study explores relationships between temporal changes of agricultural surfaces and the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) in Central Indiana. We found that minimum NDTI (minNDTI) values extracted from multi-temporal NDTI profiles reliably indicate the surface status when tillage or planting occurred. Simple linear regression reveals a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 between CRC and minNDTI for calibration. In addition, a percentage change (PC) method was tested for classifying CRC into three categories (CRC<30%; 30%<CRC<70%; CRC> 70%). Both the minNDTI and PC methods resulted in overall classification accuracies of >90%, producer's accuracies of 83-100%, and user's accuracies of 75-100%. Our results indicated that both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery are capable of mapping CRC, however, multi-temporal Landsat imagery is required. To establish a capability for crop residue mapping, designers of future remote sensing platforms should consider increasing temporal resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal infrared images are being acquired by satellites for more than two decades enabling studies of the human-induced Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. As a result, the requirement of the scientific community for fast and efficient methods for extracting and analyzing the thermal patterns from a vast volume of acquired data has emerged. The present paper proposes an innovative object-based image analysis procedure to extract thermal patterns for the quantitative analysis of satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. The spatial and thermal attributes associated with these objects are then calculated and used for the analyses of the intensity, the position and the spatial extent of UHIs. A case study was conducted in the Greater Athens Area, Greece. More than 3000 LST images of the area acquired by MODIS sensor over a decade were analyzed. Three daytime hot-spots were identified and studied (Megara, Elefsina-Aspropyrgos and Mesogeia). They were all found to exhibit similar behavior, gradually increasing their maximum temperature during the summer season and reaching their maxima in mid-July. The hot-spots' thermal intensities compared to a suburban area were of 9-10 degrees C and were found to be highly correlated to their areal extent. During the night-time, Athens center developed a typical UHI spatially coinciding with the dense urban fabric. The nighttime maximum LST peaked (on average) at the end of July, two weeks later than the daytime surface patterns. The mean spatial extent of UHI in Athens was 55.2 km(2), whilst its mean intensity was 5.6 degrees C. The proposed automatic extraction process can be customized for other cities and potentially used for comparison of LST patterns and UHI behavior between different cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A popular method of satellite-based monitoring of the photosynthetic potential of vegetation is to calculate the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from measurements of the red (RED) and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Enormous amounts of vegetation information have been obtained over continental to global areas based on NDVI derived from NOAA-AVHRR, Terra/Aqua-MODIS, and SPOT-VEGETATION satellite observations. In eastern Siberia, where sparse boreal forests are dominant, the lack of landscape-scale canopy-reflectance observations impedes interpretation of how NDVI seasonality is controlled by the forest canopy and floor status. We discuss the NDVI of the canopy and floor separately based on airborne spectral reflectance measurements and simultaneous airborne land surface images acquired around Yakutsk, Siberia, using a hedgehopping aircraft from spring to summer 2000. The aerial land surface images (4402 scenes) were visually classified into four types according to the forest condition: no-green canopy and snow floor (Type 1), green canopy and snow floor (Type 2), no-green canopy and no-snow floor (Type 3), and green canopy and no-snow floor (Type 4). The spectral reflectance from 350 to 1200 nm was then calculated for these four types. Type 1 had almost no difference in reflectance between the RED and NIR bands, and the resultant NDVI was slightly negative (-0.03). Although Type 2 showed a significant difference between the two bands because of canopy greenness, the resultant NDVI was rather low (0.17) because of high reflection from the snow cover on the floor. In Type 3, the significant difference between the two bands was mainly caused by the greenness of the floor, and the NDVI was relatively high (0.45). The NDVI for Type 4 was the highest (0.75) among the four types. The contributions of reflectance from the forest canopy and floor to the total reflectance were tested with a forest radiative transfer model. The reflectance difference between NIR and RED bands (NIR RED) of Type 4 (15.6%) was approximately double the differences of Type 2 (7.0%) and of Type 3 (7.9%), suggesting half-and-half contributions of forest canopy greenness and floor greenness to the total greenness. The result also suggested that the satellite-derived NDVI in the larch forest around Yakutsk reaches 85% of the maximum NDVI owing to the forest floor greenness, and only the other 15% of the increase in NDVI should be attributed to the canopy foliation. These results quantitatively reveal that the NDVI depends considerably on forest floor greenness and snow cover in addition to canopy greenness in the case of relatively sparse forest in Siberia.

AB This paper compares three remote sensing-based models for estimating evapotranspiration (ET), namely the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, and the surface temperature-vegetation index Triangle (TVT). The models used as input MODIS/TERRA products and ground measurements collected during the wheat and corn growth period in a subhumid climate at a measurement station in Yucheng, China. MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI) products, corrected using ground-truth observations, were used in the three models. The TSEB model output of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes were in good agreement with Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS)-measured H and LE derived by residual (RMSD<45 W/m(2)). Reasonable agreement was also obtained with the SEBS model output yielding RMSD for H of -40 W/m(2) and LE -55 W/m(2). However, the TVT model output resulted in poor agreement with the LAS-estimated H and LE with RMSD-values >110 W/m(2). Using the uncorrected MODIS LST and LAI products resulted in a deterioration of the agreement in H and LE with LAS-estimated values for both the TSEB and SEBS models, whereas TVT performance improved marginally. These results indicate that the TSEB model yielded the closest agreement with the LAS-estimated fluxes using either the corrected or uncorrected MODIS inputs (LST and LAI). The SEBS model also computed reasonable H and LE values but was significantly more sensitive to errors in MODIS LST and LAI inputs than the TSEB model. In the TVT model, output of H and LE was unacceptable in either scenario of MODIS input which was attributable to errors in selection of the dry edge. With the TVT method, accurate determination of the dry edge end member is critical in regional ET estimation, but for humid and subhumid regions this end member may often be quite difficult to identify or encompass within a satellite scene.

AB A Pol-InSAR dataset acquired at P-band over a maritime pine forest (Nezer forest of Landes. France) has been investigated and compared with tree structural ground measurements in order to identify scatterers associated with elementary scattering mechanisms in the canopy layer. Since this managed forest is constituted by different height stands, it allows to investigate mechanism change in the vertical direction during the forest growth. It has been observed that VV channel was the most elevated, which can be accounted for a maximum attenuation in the vertical direction and partially for the presence of sub-vertical branches in the top canopy layer, and that this channel was the most sensitive to the tree density in reason of an important ground reflectivity. The most pure double-bounce scattering mechanism component is received in HH-VV channel where the corresponding phase center reaches the ground level for large Diameter at Breast Height. It is also supposed that HH channel, which receives double bounce bacicscatter, was affected by the sub-horizontal primary branch development, which induces an elevation of the phase center over oldest trees while tree density diminution enhances backscatter from the ground level. Finally, the crosspolar channel appeared the less perturbed by the tree density than VV channel since it receives predominantly the canopy contribution.

AB We present a new, detailed three dimensional (3D) approach to modelling the pre- and post-fire reflectance of a two-layer savanna system modelled as heterogeneous overstory (tree) and understory (grass) layers. The models were developed from detailed field measurements of structural and radiometric properties made at experimental burn plots with varying canopy cover in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The models were used to simulate 400-2500 rim spectral reflectance at 10-500 m spatial scale for various viewing and solar geometry configurations. The model simulations closely matched pre-fire and post-fire ground-based, helicopter and satellite remote sensing observations (all r(2) values>0.95 except one post-fire case). The largest discrepancies between modelled and observed reflectances occurred typically at wavelengths greater than 1200 nm for the post-fire simulations. The modelling results indicate that representation of overstory and understory structure and scattering properties are required to represent the burn signal in a typical savanna system. The described 3D modelling approach enables separation of the scattering contributions of the different scene components and is suited to testing and validating fire impact assessment algorithms at locations where the difficulty of obtaining both pre- and post-fire observations is a severe constraint.

AB Reedbeds are important habitats for supporting biodiversity and delivering a range of ecosystem services, yet reedbeds in the UK are under threat from intensified agriculture, changing land use and pollution. To develop appropriate conservation strategies, information on the distribution of reedbeds is required. Field surveys of these wetland environments are difficult, time consuming and expensive to execute for large areas. Remote sensing has the potential to replace or complement such field surveys, yet the specific application to reedbed habitats has not been fully investigated. In the present study, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery were acquired for two sites in Cumbria, UK. The research aimed to determine the most effective means of analysing hyperspectral data covering the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions for mapping reedbeds and to investigate the effects of incorporating image textural information and LiDAR-derived measures of canopy structure on the accuracy of reedbed delineation. Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, three image compression algorithms were evaluated: principal component analysis (PCA), spectrally segmented PCA (SSPCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). The LiDAR-derived measures tested were the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the DSM-derived slope map. The SSPCA-compressed data produced the highest reedbed accuracy and processing efficiency. The optimal SSPCA dataset incorporated 12 PCs comprised of the first 3 PCs derived from each of the spectral segments: visible (392700 nm), NIR (701972 nm), SWIR-1 (9731366 nm) and SWIR-2 (15302240 nm). Incorporating image textural measures produced a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when using MNF-compressed data, but had no impact when using the SSPCA-compressed imagery. A significant improvement (+ 11%) in the accuracy of reedbed delineation was achieved when a mask generated by applying a 3 m threshold to the LiDAR-derived CHM was used to filter the reedbed map derived from the optimal SSPCA dataset. This paper demonstrates the value in combining appropriately compressed hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for the effective mapping of reedbed habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper evaluates the spatial structure of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) error and its associations with globally available topographic and land cover variables across a wide range of landscapes. Two continental-scale SRTM elevation data samples were extracted, along with collocated National Elevation Dataset (NED) elevations, MODIS composite forest cover percentage, and global ecoregion major habitat type codes. The larger punctual sample contained nearly 247,000 sites on a regular grid across the conterminous United States, while the smaller areal sample consisted of 37,500 45 '' x 45 '' rectangular regions on a regular grid. Sub-pixel positional mismatch was accounted for by finding and using the best local fit between the 1 arc sec horizontal resolution NED product and the 3 arc sec (3 '') horizontal resolution SRTM product. Slope and aspect were calculated for all samples. Using the larger point sample, we identified associations between SRTM error, defined as NED-SRTM 3 '' differences, with these land cover and terrain derivative variables. Using the areal sample, we developed semivariograms of elevation error for tens of thousands of small regions across the United States, as well as for sets of these regions with common slope and landcover properties. This facilitated a more comprehensive evaluation of the spatial structure of SRTM error than has previously been done. The punctual sample RMSE was 8.6 m, conforming to previous estimates of SRTM error, but many errors in excess of 50 m were identified. Nearly 90% of these large errors were positive and correlated with high forest cover percentage. Overall, SRTM elevations consistently overestimated the surface. Forest cover and slope were positively correlated with positive bias. A strong association of aspect with SRTM error was noted, with positive error magnitudes peaking for aspects oriented to the northwest and negative error magnitudes peaking for slopes facing southeast. Error bias, standard deviation, and semivariograms differed substantially across ecoregion types. These variables were incorporated in a regression model to predict SRTM error: this model explained nearly 60% of the total error variation and has the potential to substantially improve the SRTM data product worldwide using globally available datasets.

AB Reliable assessment of forest resource stock, productivity and harvesting is a commonly agreed objective of environmental monitoring programs. Distinctively, the assessment of wood harvesting has become even more relevant to evaluate the sustainability of forest management and to quantify forest carbon budget. This paper presents the development and testing of procedures for assessing forest harvesting in coppice forests by very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The study area is located in central Italy over approximately 34,000 km(2). A set of SPOT5 HRG multispectral images was acquired for the study years (2002-2007). Official administrative statistics of coppice clearcuts were also acquired. More than 9500 clearcuts were mapped and dated by on-screen interpretation of the SPOT5 images. In a subset of the study area various methods for semi-automatic clearcut mapping were tested by pixel- and object-oriented approaches. The following results are presented: (i) clearcut map developed by visual interpretation of the SPOTS images resulted in high thematic (overall accuracy of 0.99) and geometric (root mean square error of clearcut boundary delineation of 5.3 m) reliability; (ii) object-oriented approach achieved significantly better accuracy than pixel-based methods for semi-automatic classification of the coppice clearcuts; (iii) comparison between mapped clearcut area and official forest harvesting statistics proved a significant underestimation by the latter (65% of the total mapped clearcut area). A sample-based procedure exploiting VHR satellite imagery is finally proposed to correct the official statistics of coppice clearcuts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the spatial-temporal structure of total ozone column (TOC) over Portugal. This relevant region of southwestern Europe has not been evaluated yet in detail due to the lack of continuous and well-covered ground-based TOC measurements. The data used in this study are derived from the NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) for the period 1978-2005. The TOC spatial behavior shows no significant longitudinal variability (smaller than 3%). In contrast, the variation in latitude changes between 3.5% and 6% depending on the calendar month. The TOC in the northern Portugal is, on average, higher than that recorded in the South. The temporal variability was analyzed for three scales: long-term, seasonal and short-term. The long-term TOC changes are analyzed between 1978 and 1999 by means of linear least squares fits. The results show an annual TOC trend of (2.65 +/- 0.70)%/decade which is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This TOC decrease is smaller than the trends obtained in other midlatitudes regions which could be partially explained by the compensation due to the observed increase in the tropospheric ozone over the Iberian Peninsula. A trend analysis performed for each individual month shows a statistically significant TOC decline between March and October, with a maximum linear trend value of (-7.30 +/- 45)%/decade in May. The amplitude of the seasonal TOC cycle over Portugal shows a slight dependence in latitude, varying from 28.6 DU (37.5 degrees N) to 33.6 DU (41.5 degrees N). Finally, the short-term variability showed a notable seasonal behavior, with maximum day-to-day TOC changes in winter (similar to 6%) and minimum in summer (similar to 3%). In addition, the persistence (characterized by the autocorrelation coefficients) strongly decreases after a few days (except in summer months). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global surface water variations are still difficult to monitor with current satellite measurements. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is designed to address this issue. Its main payload will be a wide swath altimeter which will provide maps of water surface elevations between 78 degrees S and 78 degrees N over a 120 km swath. This study aims to combine coupled hydrologic/hydraulic modeling of an Arctic river with virtual SWOT observations using a local ensemble Kalman smoother to characterize river water depth variations. We assumed that modeling errors are only due to uncertainties in atmospheric forcing fields (precipitation and air temperature) and different SWOT orbits were tested. First, we tested orbits that all have a three day repeat period but differ in terms of their spatial coverage of the study reach: these orbits correspond to the first three months of the mission, which will be dedicated to calibration and validation experiments. For these orbits, the mean spatial Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in modeled channel water depth decreased by between 29% and 79% compared to the modeled RMSE with no assimilation, depending on the spatial coverage. The corresponding mean temporal RMSE decrease was between 54% and 91%. We then tested the nominal orbit with a twenty two day repeat period which will be used during the remaining lifetime of the mission. Unlike the three day repeat orbits, this orbit will observe all continental surfaces (except Antartica and the northern part of Greenland) during one repeat period. The assimilation of SWOT observations computed with this nominal orbit into the hydraulic model leads to a decrease of 59% and 66% in the mean spatial and temporal RMSE in modeled channel water depth, respectively. These results show the huge potential of the future SWOT mission for land surface hydrology, especially at high latitudes which will be very well sampled during one orbit repeat period. Still, further work is needed to reduce current modeling uncertainties and to better characterize SWOT measurement errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Phenology is a key component of monitoring terrestrial ecosystem variations in response to global climate change. Satellite-measured land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used to assess large scale phenological patterns and processes. However, the accuracy of LSP is rarely validated with spatially compatible field data due to the significant spatiotemporal scale mismatch. In this study, we employ intensive field observations specifically designed to address this deficiency. High density/frequency spring phenological observations were collected in a mixed seasonal forest during 2008 and 2009. A landscape up-scaling approach was used to derive landscape phenology (LP) indices from plot-level observations in order to validate Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based LSP. Results show that the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived start of spring season (SOS) measure was able to predict LP full bud burst date with absolute errors less than two days. In addition, LSP derived SOS captured inter-annual variations and spatial differences that agreed with ground observations. Comparison of complete time series of LP and LSP revealed that fundamental differences exist between the two observation means, e.g., LP development had increased influence on LSP during the course of spring onset. Therefore, inferring continuous LP processes directly from LSP measures could be problematic. However, using LSP derived from techniques such as logistic curve modeling for extracting seasonal markers appears more promising. This study contributes to a more explicit understanding of the linkages between remotely sensed phenology and traditionally observed (ground-based) phenology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The temporal dimension of differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) fire/burn severity studies was studied for the case of the large 2007 Peloponnese wildfires in Greece. Fire severity is defined as the degree of environmental change as measured immediately post-fire, whereas burn severity combines the direct fire impact and ecosystems responses. Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI), two pre-/post-fire differenced Thematic Mapper (TM) dNBR assessments and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dNBR time series were used to analyze the temporal dimension. MODIS dNBR time series were calculated based on the difference between the NBR of the burned and control pixels, which were retrieved using time series similarity of a pre-fire year. The analysis incorporated the optimality statistic, which evaluates index performance based on displacements in the mid-infrared-near infrared bi-spectral space. Results showed a higher correlation between field and TM data early post-fire (R-2=0.72) than one-year post-fire (R-2=0.56). Additionally, mean dNBR (0.56 vs. 0.29), the dNBR standard deviation (0.29 vs. 0.19) and mean optimality (0.65 vs. 0.47) were clearly higher for the initial assessment than for the extended assessment. This is due to regenerative processes that obscured first-order fire effects impacting the suitability of the dNBR to assess burn severity in this case study. This demonstrates the importance of the lag timing, i.e. time since fire, of an assessment, especially in a quickly recovering Mediterranean ecosystem. The MODIS time series was used to study intra-annual changes in index performance. The seasonal timing of an assessment highly impacts what is actually measured. This seasonality affected both the greenness of herbaceous resprouters and the productivity of the control pixels, which is land cover specific. Appropriate seasonal timing of an assessment is therefore of paramount importance to anticipate false trends (e.g. caused by senescence). Although these findings are case study specific, it can be expected that similar temporal constraints affect assessments in other ecoregions. Therefore, within the limitations of available Landsat imagery, caution is recommended for the temporal dimension when assessing post-fire effects. This is crucial, especially for studies that aim to evaluate trends in fire/burn severity across space and time. Also, clarification in associated terminology is suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study sets out to analyze the stages of water bodies in the Amazon basin derived from the processing of ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12 cm in the best cases and 40 cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MODIS derived aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 550 nm are compared with sunphotometer CE318 measurements at 7 sites located at Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China from July to October, 2007. The evaluation result indicates that MODIS AODs (Collection 5, C005) are in good agreement with those from CE318 in dense vegetation regions, but show more differences in those regions with complex underlying surface (such as at lake water and urban surface sites). Reasons for these differences are discussed after removing cases with significant errors caused by validation scheme. The final validation result shows that MODIS AODs are in good agreement with CE318 with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and RMS of 0.15. 90% of MODIS cases fall in the range of Delta tau = +/-0.05+/-0.20 tau, indicating MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm, aerosol models and surface reflectance estimate are generally suitably reasonable for aerosol retrieval in YRD. However, MODIS AODs show a systemic errors with fitted line of y=0.75x+0.13, indicating underestimation of AOD when aerosol loadings are high. Aerosol models and surface reflectance estimations are dominant sources of MODIS aerosol retrieval errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation of threatened and endangered species requires maintenance of critical habitat. The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCN) is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in mature longleaf pine Pin us palustris, but also uses mature loblolly pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and 1.1676 mu m, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 mu m, and dead trees having significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151 and 1.9471 mu m. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70%. CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that 141.4 ha (3%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat. Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these important and imperiled components of biodiversity.

AB Lake Tanganyika, the second largest freshwater ecosystem in Africa, is characterised by a significant heterogeneity in phytoplankton concentration linked to its particular hydrodynamics. To gather a proper understanding of primary production, it is necessary to consider spatial and temporal dynamics throughout the lake. In the present work, daily MODIS-AQUA satellite measurements were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490) for surface waters. The spatial regionalisation of Lake Tanganyika, based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions of the chlorophyll-a dataset (July 2002-November 2005), allowed for the separation of the lake in 11 spatially coherent and co-varying regions, with 2 delocalised coastal regions. Temporal patterns of chlorophyll-a showed significant differences between regions. Estimation of the daily primary production in each region indicates that the dry season is more productive than the wet season in all regions with few exceptions. Whole-lake daily primary productivity calculated on an annual basis (2003) was 646 +/- 142mgCm(-2)day(-1). Comparing our estimation to previous studies, photosynthetic production in Lake Tanganyika appears to be presently lower (about 15%), which is consistent with other studies which used phytoplankton biovolume and changes of delta C-13 in the lake sediments. The decrease in lake productivity in recent decades may be associated to changes in climate conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping of total suspended matter concentration (TSM) can be achieved from space-based optical sensors and has growing applications related to sediment transport. A TSM algorithm is developed here for turbid waters, suitable for any ocean colour sensor including MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. Theory shows that use of a single band provides a robust and TSM-sensitive algorithm provided the band is chosen appropriately. Hyperspectral calibration is made using seaborne TSM and reflectance spectra collected in the southern North Sea. Two versions of the algorithm are considered: one which gives directly TSM from reflectance, the other uses the reflectance model of Park and Ruddick (2005) to take account of bidirectional effects.
   Applying a non-linear regression analysis to the calibration data set gave relative errors in TSM estimation less than 30% in the spectral range 670-750 nm. Validation of this algorithm for MODIS and MERIS retrieved reflectances with concurrent in situ measurements gave the lowest relative errors in TSM estimates, less than 40%, for MODIS bands 667 nm and 678 nm and for MERIS bands 665 nm and 687 nm. Consistency of the approach in a multisensor context (SeaWiFS. MERIS, and MODIS) is demonstrated both for single point time series and for individual images. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB The quantification of carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is of scientific importance and also relevant to climate-policy making. Eddy covariance flux towers provide continuous measurements of ecosystem-level exchange of carbon dioxide spanning diurnal, synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. However, these measurements only represent the fluxes at the scale of the tower footprint. Here we used remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to upscale gross primary productivity (GPP) data from eddy covariance flux towers to the continental scale. We first combined GPP and MODIS data for 42 AmeriFlux towers encompassing a wide range of ecosystem and climate types to develop a predictive GPP model using a regression tree approach. The predictive model was trained using observed GPP over the period 2000-2004, and was validated using observed GPP over the period 2005-2006 and leave-one-out cross-validation. Our model predicted GPP fairly well at the site level. We then used the model to estimate GPP for each I km x I km cell across the U.S. for each 8-day interval over the period from February 2000 to December 2006 using MODIS data. Our GPP estimates provide a spatially and temporally continuous measure of gross primary production for the U.S. that is a highly constrained by eddy covariance flux data. Our study demonstrated that our empirical approach is effective for upscaling eddy flux GPP data to the continental scale and producing continuous GPP estimates across multiple biomes. With these estimates, we then examined the patterns, magnitude, and interannual variability of GPP. We estimated a gross carbon uptake between 6.91 and 7.33 Pg C yr(-1) for the conterminous U.S. Drought, fires, and hurricanes reduced annual GPP at regional scales and could have a significant impact on the U.S. net ecosystem carbon exchange. The sources of the interannual variability of U.S. GPP were dominated by these extreme climate events and disturbances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new method for retrieving soil moisture content over vegetated fields, employing multitemporal radar and optical images, is presented. It is based on the integration of the temporal series of radar data within an inversion scheme and on the correction of the vegetation effects. The retrieval algorithm uses the Bayesian maximum posterior probability and assumes the existence of a relation among the soil conditions at the different times of the series. The correction of the vegetation effects models the variation, with respect to the initial time of the series, of the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil characteristics as function of the variations of the measured backscattering coefficient and of the biomass. The method is tested on the data acquired throughout the SMEX02 experiment. The results show that measured and estimated soil moistures are fairly well correlated and that the performances of multitemporal retrieval algorithm are better than those obtained by employing one radar acquisition, especially in terms of capability to detect soil moisture changes. Although the approach to correct the vegetation effects on radar observations needs to be further assessed on different sets of data, this finding demonstrates that the proposed method has a potential to improve the quality of the soil moisture retrievals.

AB The relative concentrations of different pigments within a leaf have significant physiological and spectral consequences. Photosynthesis, light use efficiency, mass and energy exchange, and stress response are dependent on relationships among an ensemble of pigments. This ensemble also determines the visible characteristics of a leaf, which can be measured remotely and used to quantify leaf biochemistry and structure. But current remote sensing approaches are limited in their ability to resolve individual pigments. This paper focuses on the incorporation of three pigments-chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoids-into the LIBERTY leaf radiative transfer model to better understand relationships between leaf biochemical, biophysical, and spectral properties.
   Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi needles were collected from three sites in the California Sierra Nevada. Hemispheric single-leaf visible reflectance and transmittance and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids of fresh needles were measured. These data were input to the enhanced LIBERTY model to estimate optical and biochemical properties of pine needles. The enhanced model successfully estimated reflectance (RMSE = 0.0255, BIAS = 0.00477, RMS%E = 16.7%), had variable success estimating transmittance (RMSE = 0.0442, BIAS = 0.0294, RMS%E = 181%), and generated very good estimates of carotenoid concentrations (RMSE = 2.48 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = 0.143 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 20.4%), good estimates of chlorophyll a concentrations (RMSE = 10.7 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = -0.992 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 21.1%), and fair estimates of chlorophyll b concentrations (RMSE = 7.49 mu g/cm(2), BIAS = -2.12 mu g/cm(2), RMS%E = 43.7%). Overall root mean squared errors of reflectance, transmittance, and pigment concentration estimates were lower for the three-pigment model than for the single-pigment model. The algorithm to estimate three in vivo specific absorption coefficients is robust, although estimated values are distorted by inconsistencies in model biophysics. The capacity to invert the model from single-leaf reflectance and transmittance was added to the model so it could be coupled with vegetation canopy models to estimate canopy biochemistry from remotely sensed data.

Results showed a positive correlation between backscatter and soil moisture in sites dominated by herbaceous vegetation cover (r = 0.74, p<0.04). ERS SAR backscatter was negatively correlated to water depth in all open (non-forested) wetlands when water table levels were more than 6 cm above the wetland surface (r = - 0.82, p<0.001). There was no relationship between backscatter and soil moisture in the forested (black spruce-dominated) wetland site. Our preliminary results show that ERS SAR data can be used to monitor variations in hydrologic conditions in high northern latitude wetlands (including peatlands), particularly sites with sparse tree cover.

AB Insect damage is a general problem that disturbs the growth of forests, causing economic losses and affecting carbon sequestration. Coarse-resolution data from satellites are potentially useful for national and regional mapping of forest damage, but the accuracy of these methods has not been fully examined. In this study, a method was tested for the mapping of defoliation in Scots pine [Pinus silvestris] forests in southeast Norway caused by the pine sawfly [Neodiption sertifer], with the use of multi-temporal MODIS 16-day composite vegetation index data and the TIMESAT processing method. The damage mapping method used differences in summer mean values and angles of the seasonal profiles, indicating decreasing foliage density, to identify pixels that represent areas containing forest damage. In addition to 16-day NDVI the Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) was tested. Damage areas were identified by classifying data into pixels representing damaged versus undamaged forest areas using a boolean combination of thresholded parameters. Classification results were evaluated against the change in LAI estimated from airplane LIDAR measurements, as an indicator of defoliation. The damage classifications detected 71% to 82% of the pixels with damage, and had kappa coefficients varying between 0.48 and 0.63, indicating some overestimation. This was due e.g. to failure to include clear-cut areas in the evaluation data. Damage classification with WDRVI only resulted in slight improvement compared to the NDVI. Only weak relationships were found between the LIDAR-estimated defoliation and the change parameters obtained from MODIS. Consequently, mapping of the degree of defoliation from MODIS was abandoned. In conclusion, the damage detection method based on MODIS data was found to be useful for locating insect damage, but not for estimating its intensity. Control of the detected damage areas using high-resolution remote sensing data, aerial survey, or fieldwork is recommended for accurate delineation in operational applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present an approach for monitoring and forecasting landscape level indicators of the condition of protected area (PA) ecosystems including changes in snowcover, vegetation phenology and productivity using the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS). TOPS is a modeling framework that integrates operational satellite data, microclimate mapping, and ecosystem simulation models to characterize ecosystem status and trends. We have applied TOPS to investigate trends and patterns in landscape indicators using test cases at both national and park-level scales to demonstrate the potential utility of TOPS for supporting efforts by the National Park Service to develop standardized indicators for protected area monitoring. Our analysis of coarse resolution satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements for North America from 1982-2006 indicates that all but a few PAs are located in areas that exhibited a sustained decline in vegetation condition. We used Yosemite National Park as our park-level test case, and while no significant trends in NDVI were detected during the same period, evidence of drought-induced vegetation mortality and recovery patterns dominated the 25 year record. In our Yosemite analysis, we show that analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products (vegetation indices, absorbed radiation, land surface temperature and gross primary production) in conjunction with ground-based measurements, such as runoff, lends additional utility to satellite-based monitoring of ecosystems indicators, as together they provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem condition. Analyses of MODIS products from 2001-2006 show that year-to-year changes in the onset of spring at Yosemite were as large as 45 days, and this signal in the satellite data record is corroborated by observed changes in spring runoff patterns. Finally, we applied TOPS to assess long-term climate impacts on ecosystem condition at the scale of an individual park. When driven by projected climatic changes at Yosemite of 4-6 degrees C warming by 2100 with no changes in precipitation patterns, TOPS predicts significantly reduced winter snowpack and an earlier onset of the growing season, resulting in prolonged summer drought and reduced vegetation productivity.

AB Impacts of global climate change are expected to result in greater variation in the seasonality of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics in southwest Alaska. All have wide-reaching physical and biological ecosystem effects in the region. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibrated radiance, snow cover extent, and vegetation index products for interpreting interannual variation in the duration and extent of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics for southwest Alaska. The approach integrates multiple seasonal metrics across large ecological regions.
   Throughout the observation period (2001-2007), snow cover duration was stable within ecoregions, with variable start and end dates. The start of the lake ice season lagged the snow season by 2 to 3 months. Within a given lake, freeze-up dates varied in timing and duration, while break-up dates were more consistent. Vegetation phenology varied less than snow and ice metrics, with start-of-season dates comparatively consistent across years. The start of growing season and snow melt were related to one another as they are both temperature dependent. Higher than average temperatures during the El Nino winter of 2002-2003 were expressed in anomalous ice and snow season patterns. We are developing a consistent, MODIS-based dataset that will be used to monitor temporal trends of each of these seasonal metrics and to map areas of change for the study area.

AB A novel methodology is proposed to reconstruct 3D tree architectures from terrestrial LiDAR (TLiDAR) scans. The methodology is robust and relatively insensitive to wind- and occlusion-induced artefacts in the 3D TLiDAR point clouds. A quantitative evaluation of structural attributes, like the vertical foliage and wood area profiles, as well as the shoot orientation distribution, was performed. Due to the difficulties of acquiring reliable and accurate estimates of these parameters in the field, an original evaluation approach was chosen that reproduces the TLiDAR scanning and subsequent tree reconstruction process in a virtual environment. In a second step the reconstructed tree models were ingested in a validated 3D radiative transfer model to simulate both their reflectance signatures (observable by space borne instruments) and directional transmission properties (measurable during field campaigns) under various spectral, illumination and tree density scenarios. The results of these evaluations confirm the appropriateness of the proposed tree reconstruction model for the generation of structurally and radiatively faithful copies of existing plant and canopy architectures.

AB The statistical properties of the k-NN estimators are investigated in a design-based framework, avoiding any assumption about the population under study. The issue of coupling remotely sensed digital imagery with data arising from forest inventories conducted using probabilistic sampling schemes is considered. General results are obtained for the k-NN estimator at the pixel level. When averages (or totals) of forest attributes for the whole study area or sub-areas are of interest, the use of the empirical difference estimator is proposed. The estimator is shown to be approximately unbiased with a variance admitting unbiased or conservative estimators. The performance of the empirical difference estimator is evaluated by an extensive simulation study performed on several populations whose dimensions and covariate values are taken from a real case study. Samples are selected from the populations by means of simple random sampling without replacement. Comparisons with the generalized regression estimator and Horvitz-Thompson estimators are also performed. An application to a local forest inventory on a test area of central Italy is considered.

AB The surface temperature of Utah's hypersaline Great Salt Lake is examined between 2000 and 2007 using 3345 images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the NASA Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua platforms. This study shows the utility of using a multi-year record of the easily accessible and fully processed MODIS thermal imagery to monitor spatial, diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in the surface water temperature (SWT) of lakes where long-term in situ measurements are rarely available. A cloud-free Terra image is available on average every day during the summer and early fall, every other day during spring and late fall, and every third day during the winter. MODIS-derived lake SWT exhibits a cool bias (similar to-1.5 degrees C) relative to in situ temperature observations gathered from three buoys and a slowly-moving watercraft.
   The dominant SWT signal is the annual cycle (with a range of 26 degrees C and peak temperature in mid-July) while the diurnal range is as large as 4 degrees C during the spring season. Year-to-year variations in SWT are largest during the fall with over 1 degrees C anomalously warm (cold) departures from the 8-year monthly medians observed during fall 2001 (2006). The MODIS imagery provides an updated SWT climatology for operational weather forecasting applications (e.g., lake-effect snow storm prediction) as well as for input into operational and research numerical weather prediction models.

AB An innovative index for LAI estimation over orchard canopies based on the combination of two near-infrared narrow wavebands (1050 mn and 1250 nm) is presented. The index is insensitive to physiological changes on the leaf level even under changing pheneological developmental stage. In the meantime, the index is highly sensitive for variations at the canopy level. Values of LAI estimated by means of this newly developed index, called sLAIDI (standardized LAI Determining Index), resulted in excellent agreements with in-situ measured LAI values of citrus trees, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.83. Based on in-situ measured data and simulated data (PROSPECT and ACRM), the newly developed sLAIDI was also found to perform outstanding at high LAI values in contrary to well-known LAI related indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Chlorophyll Ratio Index 2 (MCARI2) that saturate at LAI values of 5 and 8 respectively. Moreover, the sLAIDI index was independent of changing pigment contents. Consequently, this index was regarded a valuable tool to more accurately extract biochemical parameters after normalizing the considered spectral data for LAI. By implementing sLAIDI in existing chlorophyll-related indices (e.g., GM index), the performance to estimate the leaf chlorophyll content from spectral Citrus and peach canopy level data is increased (R-2 increases from 0.68 to 0.77). Moreover, a correction factor was proposed to enable the application of sLAIDI on fields with Strong variations of water content. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The self-shadowing of conifer canopies results from the size and arrangement of trees within a stand and is a first-Order term controlling radiance from forested terrain at common pixel scales of tens of meters. Although self-shadowing is a useful attribute for forest remote-sensing classification, compensation for the topographic effects of self-shadowing has proven problematic. This study used airborne canopy LiDAR measurements of 80 Pacific Northwest, USA conifer stands ranging in development stage from pre-canopy closure to old-growth in order to model canopy self-shadowing for four solar zenith angles (SZA). The shadow data were compared to physical measurements used to characterize forest stands, and were also used to test and improve terrain compensation models for remotely sensed images of forested terrain. Canopy self-shadowing on flat terrain strongly correlates with the canopy's geometric complexity as measured by the rumple index (canopy surface area/ground surface area) (R-2=0.94-0.87 depending on SZA), but is less correlated with other stand measurements: 95th percentile canopy height (R-2=0.68), mean diameter at breast height (dbh) (R-2=0.65), basal area ha(-1) (R-2=0.18), and canopy stem count ha(-1) (R-2=0.18). The results in this paper support interpretation of self-shadowing as a function of canopy complexity, which is an important ecological characteristic in its own right. Modeling of canopy self-shadowing was used to assess the accuracy of the Sun-Canopy-Sensor (SCS) topographic correction, and to develop a new empirical Adaptive Shade Compensation (ASC) topographic compensation model. ASC used measured shadow (as an estimate of canopy complexity) and the SCS term (to describe the illumination geometry) as independent variables in multiple regressions to determine the topographic correction. The ASC model provided more accurate radiance corrections with limited variation in results across the full range of canopy complexities and incidence angles. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring the response of land ice to climate change requires accurate and repeatable topographic surveys. The SPOT5-HRS (High Resolution Stereoscopic) instrument covers up to 120 km by 600 km in a single pass and has the potential to accurately map the poorly known topography of most glaciers and ice caps. The acquisition of a large HRS archive over ice-covered regions is planned by the French Space Agency (CNES) and Spotimage, France during the 2007-2008 International Polar Year (IPY). Here, we report on the accuracy and value of HRS digital elevation model (DEM) over ice and snow surfaces.
   A DEM is generated by combining tools available from CNES with the PCI Orthoengine(SE) software, using HRS images acquired in May 2004 over South-East Alaska (USA) and northern British Columbia (Canada). The DEM is evaluated through comparison with shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) DEM and ICESAT data, on and around the glaciers. A horizontal shift of 50 in is found between the HRS and SRTM DEMs and is attributed to errors in the SRTM DEM. Over ice-free areas, HRS elevations are 7 m higher than those of SRTM, with a standard deviation of 25 in for the difference between the two DEMs. The 7-m difference is partly attributed to the differential penetration of the electromagnetic waves (visible for HRS; microwave for SRTM) in snow and vegetation.
   We also report on the application of sequential DEMs (SRTM DEM in February 2000 and HRS DEM in May 2004) for the monitoring of glacier elevation changes. We map the topographic changes induced by a surge of one tributary of Ferris Glacier. Maximum surface lowering of 42 (+/- 10) m and rising of 77 (+/- 10) m are observed in the 4 years time interval. Thinning rates up to 10 (+/- 2.5) m/yr are observed at low altitudes and confirm the ongoing wastage of glaciers in South-East Alaska. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many investigators need and use global land cover maps for a wide variety of purposes. Ironically, after many years of very limited availability, there are now multiple global land cover maps and it is not readily apparent (1) which is most useful for particular applications or (2) how to combine the different maps to provide an improved dataset. The existing global land cover maps at I kin spatial resolution have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different remote sensing data and employed different methodologies. Perhaps more significantly, they have different legends. As a result, comparison of the different land cover maps is difficult and information about their relative utility is limited. In an attempt to compare the datasets and assess their strengths and weaknesses we harmonized the thematic legends of four available coarse-resolution global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1-km, and GLC2000) using the LCCS-based land cover legend translation protocols. Analysis of the agreement among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic classes of Evergreen broadleaf trees, Snow and Ice, and Barren show high producer and user accuracy and good agreement among the datasets, while classes of mixed tree types show high commission errors. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy, spatial agreement among the datasets, and the heterogeneity of landscapes. Suggestions for future mapping projects include careful definition of mixed unit classes, and improvement in mapping heterogeneous landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Most image classification algorithms rely on computing the distance between the unique spectral signature of a given pixel and a set of possible clusters within an n-dimensional feature space that represents discrete land cover categories. Each scrutinized pixel will ultimately be closest to one of the predefined clusters; different classification algorithms differ in the details of which cluster is considered as closest or most likely, but in general the selected algorithm will label each pixel with the label of the closest cluster. However, pixels expressing virtually identical distances to two or more clusters identify a limitation of this typical classification approach. Conditions for limitations to distance based classification algorithms include when distances are long and the pixel may not clearly belong to any single category, may represent mixed land cover, or can be easily confused spectrally between two or more categories. We propose that retention of the distance to the second closest cluster can shed light on the confidence with which label assignment proceeds and present several examples of how such additional information might enhance accuracy assessments and improve classification confidence. The method was developed with simplicity as a goal, assuming the classification has already been performed, and standard clustering reports are available. Over a test site in central British Columbia, Canada, we illustrate the described technique using classified image data from a nation-wide land cover mapping project. Calculation of multi-spectral Euclidean distances to cluster centroids, standardized by cluster variance, allows comparison of all potential class assignments within a unified framework. The variable distances provide a measure of relative confidence in the actual classification at the level of individual pixels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, one of the greatest threats to the terrestrial ecosystem is the increasing number and areal extent of invasive species. Increased human presence oil the islands has hastened the introduction of plant and animal species that threaten the native and endemic flora and fauna. Considerable research oil invasive species in the Galapagos Islands has been conducted by the Charles Darwin Foundation. We complement that work through a spatially- and spectrally-explicit satellite assessment of ail important invasive plant species (Psidium guajava - guava) on Isabela Island that integrates diverse remote sensing systems, data types, spatial and spectral resolutions, and analytical and image processing approaches. QuickBird and Hyperion satellite data are processed to characterize the areal extent and spatial structure of guava through the following approaches: (1) QuickBird data are classified through a traditional pixel-based approach (i.e., an unsupervised classification approach using the ISODATA algorithm), as well as ail Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach; (2) multiple approaches for spectral "unmixing" of the Hyperion hyper-spectral data are assessed to construct spectral end-members from QuickBird data using linear and non-linear mixture modeling approaches; and (3) landscape pattern metrics are calculated and compared for the pixel-based, object-based, and spectral unmixing approaches. The spectral-spatial characteristics of guava are interpreted relative to management strategies for the control of guava and the restoration of natural ecosystems in the Galapagos National Park.

AB This study investigates the applicability of empirical and radiative transfer models to estimate water content at leaf and landscape level. The main goal is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of these two approaches for estimating leaf water content by means of laboratory reflectance/transmittance measurements and for mapping leaf and canopy water content by using airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) data acquired over intensive poplar plantations (Ticino, Italy).
   At leaf level, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf gravimetric water content (GWC) by using inverse ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The analysis showed that leaf reflectance is related to changes in EWT rather than GWC, with best results obtained by using RMA regression by exploiting the spectral index related to the continuum removed area of the 1200 nm water absorption feature with an explained variance of 61% and prediction error of 6.6%. Moreover, we inverted the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model to estimate leaf EWT and GWC and compared the results with those obtained by means of empirical models. The inversion of this model showed that leaf EWT can be successfully estimated with no prior information with mean relative errors of 14% and determination coefficient of 0.65. Inversion of the PROSPECT model showed some difficulties in the simultaneous estimation of leaf EWT and dry matter content, which led to large errors in GWC estimation.
   At landscape level with MIVIS data, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate canopy water per unit ground area (EWTcanopy). We found a relative error of 20% using a continuum removed spectral index around 1200 rim. Furthermore, we used a model simulation to evaluate the possibility of applying empirical models based on appositely developed MIVIS double ratios to estimate mean leaf EWT at landscape level (EWT). It is shown that combined indices (double ratios) yielded significant results in estimating leaf EWT at landscape level by using MIVIS data (with errors around 2.6%), indicating their potential in reducing the effects of LAI on the recorded signal. The accuracy of the empirical estimation of EWTcanopy and EWT was finally compared with that obtained from inversion of the PROSPECT+SAILH canopy reflectance model to evaluate the potential of both methods for practical applications. A relative error of 27% was found for EWTcanopy and an overestimation of leaf EWT with relative errors around 19%.
   Results arising from this remote sensing application support the robustness of hyperspectral regression indices for estimating water content at both leaf and landscape level, with lower relative errors compared to those obtained from inversion of leaf and 1D canopy radiative transfer models.

AB We used two hyperspectral sensors at two different scales to test their potential to estimate biophysical properties of grazed pastures in Rondonia in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a field spectrometer, ten remotely sensed measurements (i.e., two vegetation indices, four fractions of spectral mixture analysis, and four spectral absorption features) were generated for two grass species, Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens. These measures were compared to above ground biomass, live and senesced biomass, and grass canopy water content. The sample size was 69 samples for field grass biophysical data and grass canopy reflectance. Water absorption measures between 1 100 and 1250 nm had the highest correlations with above ground biomass, live biomass and canopy water content, while ligno-cellulose absorption measures between 2045 and 2218 nm were the best for estimating senesced biomass. These results suggest possible improvements on estimating grass measures using spectral absorption features derived from hyperspectral sensors. However, relationships were highly influenced by grass species architecture. B. decumbens, a more homogeneous, low growing species, had higher correlations between remotely sensed measures and biomass than B. brizantha, a more heterogeneous, vertically oriented species. The potential of using the Earth Observing-1 Hyperion data for pasture characterization was assessed and validated using field spectrometer and CCD camera data. Hyperion-derived NPV fraction provided better estimates of grass surface fraction compared to fractions generated from convolved ETM+/Landsat 7 data and minimized the problem of spectral ambiguity between NPV and Soil. The results suggest possible improvement of the quality of land-cover maps compared to maps made using multispectral sensors for the Amazon region. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the desert country of Oman, available water resources are scarce and scattered. In most locations where water can be accessed, this resource is harnessed by oases planted to date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and other crops. So far, little is known about the site-specific conditions determining the existence, size and type of these oases. Remote sensing and image processing techniques were used to locate oases, to characterize the sites according to their topographic, hydrologic and geologic characteristics and to develop a typology of oases in nor-them Oman.
   To derive oasis positions, we calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Landsat images covering all of northern Oman, subtracted a regional average NDVI, averaged the resulting grid over 3 x 3 pixels and extracted the brightest of five classes determined by a natural breaks algorithm. A buffer of six pixels was added to the oases and the vegetated area as determined by the NDVI was summarized for these polygons. The oasis detection procedure was validated using Google Earth Pro (R). Topographic information was derived from data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), complemented by digitized Russian military maps, from which mean elevations and elevation range above the oases within a buffer of 2 km were extracted.
   Water contributing upslope area and distance to streams with catchments of 10 km(2) and 100 km(2) were derived from the same elevation model. All geologic formations of northern Oman were assigned to one of 7 groups and tested for influence on vegetation surrounding them. Four such geologic settings were identified and described by categorical variables. All input parameters were used to define oasis types based on cluster analysis.
   Our algorithm detected 2663 oases in northern Oman, of which 2428 had vegetated areas of more than 0.4 ha, the minimum size for reliable detection. The oases were subdivided into six groups. 'Plain Oases' (49% of all oases) lie mostly in the plains east and west of the mountains, and are fed by groundwater flow in Quaternary sediments. 'Foothill Oases' (46%) are scattered over the foothills, where they draw their water from groundwater flow that is channeled by rock formations. 'Mountain Oases' (3%) and 'Kawr Oases' (0.5%) lie in the mountains, close to an unconform boundary between limestones and confining rocks. 'Drainage Oases' (0.3%) are the largest oases in northern Oman. They lie close to a drainage channel, which drains the entire area west of the mountains. Finally, 'Urban Oases' (1.7%) consist of parks and sporting facilities, which do not lie in conclusive hydrologic settings. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important biophysical variable for characterizing the land surface vegetation. Global LAI product has been routinely produced from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. However, the MODIS standard LAI product is not continuous both spatially and temporally. To fill the gaps and improve the quality, we have developed a data filtering algorithm. This filter, called the temporal spatial filter (TSF), integrates both spatial and temporal characteristics for different plant functional types. The spatial gaps are first filled with the multi-year averages of the same day. If the values are missing over all years, the pixel is filled with a new estimate using the vegetation continuous field-ecosystem curve fitting method. The TSF integrates both the multi-seasonal average trend (background) and the seasonal observation. We implement this algorithm using the MODIS Collection 4 LAI product over North America. Comparison of the TSF results with the Savitzky-Golay filter indicates that the TSF performs much better in restoring the spatial and temporal distribution of seasonal LAI trends. The new LAI product has been validated by comparing with field measurements and the derived LAI maps from ETM+ data at a broadleaf forest site and an agricultural site. The validation results indicate that the new LAI product agrees better with both the field measurements and LAI values obtained from the ETM+ than does the MODIS LAI standard product, which usually shows higher LAI values.

AB The National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) program is a nationally coordinated research and monitoring program that identifies and tracks changes in ecological resources of representative estuarine ecosystems and coastal watersheds. In recent years, attention has focused on using high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery to map and monitor wetland plant communities in the NERRs, particularly invasive plant species. The utility of this technology for that purpose has yet to be assessed in detail. To that end, a specific high spatial resolution satellite imagery, QuickBird, was used to map plant communities and monitor invasive plants within the Hudson River NERR (HRNERR). The HRNERR contains four diverse tidal wetlands (Stockport Flats, Tivoli Bays, Iona Island, and Piermont), each with unique water chemistry (i.e., brackish, oligotrophic and fresh) and, consequently, unique assemblages of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). A maximum-likelihood classification was used to produce 20-class land cover maps for each of the four marshes within the HRNERR. Conventional contingency tables and a fuzzy set analysis served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, were 73.6%, 68.4%, 67.9%, and 64.9% for Tivoli Bays, Stockport Flats, Piermont, and Iona Island, respectively. Fuzzy assessment tables lead to higher estimates of map accuracies of 83%, 75%, 76%, and 76%, respectively. In general, the open water/tidal channel class was the most accurately mapped class and Scirpus sp. was the least accurately mapped. These encouraging accuracies suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery offers significant potential for the mapping of invasive plant species in estuarine environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The requirements for high resolution multi-spectral satellite images to be used in single tree species classification for forest inventories are investigated, especially with respect to spatial resolution, sensor noise and geo-registration. In the hypothetical setup, a 3D tree crown map is first obtained from very high resolution panchromatic aerial imagery and subsequently each crown is classified into one of a set of known tree species such that the difference between a model multi-spectral image generated from the 3D crown map and an acquired multi-spectral satellite image of the forested area is minimized. The investigation is conducted partly by generating synthetic data from a 3D crown map from a real mixed forest stand and partly on hypothetical high resolution multi-spectral satellite images obtained from very high resolution colour infrared aerial photographs, allowing different hypothetical spatial resolutions. Conclusions are that until a new generation of even higher resolution satellites becomes available, the most feasible source of remote sensing data for single tree classification will be aerial platforms.

AB Field emissivity measurements were made of leaves collected from nine deciduous tree and agricultural plant species. The data show, for the first time, that it is possible to discriminate subtle spectral emissivity features of leaves from the natural background emission. Under conditions of controlled measurement geometry (leaves arranged to cover a flat surface), the field emissivity spectra agreed fairly well with emissivity values calculated from laboratory directional hemispherical reflectance measurements. Spectral features associated with a variety of leaf chemical constituents, including cellulose, cutin, xylan, silica, and oleanolic acid could be identified in the field emissivity data. Structural aspects of leaf surfaces also influenced spectral behavior, notably the abundance of trichomes, as well as wax thickness and texture.
   Field spectral measurements made at increasing distances from natural plant canopies showed progressive attenuation of the spectral emissivity features. This attenuation is ascribed to increased multiple scattering that superimposes an opposite-in-sign reflected component on the emittance, and to the increasing number of canopy voids within the instrument field of view. Errors associated with the removal of atmospheric features and with the non-isotropic thermal characteristics of canopies also contribute to the loss of spectral information at greater measurement distances.
   In contrast to visible and short-wave infrared data, thermal infrared spectra of broad leaf plants show considerable spectral diversity, suggesting that such data eventually could be utilized to map vegetation composition. However, remotely measuring the subtle emissivity features of leaves still presents major challenges. To be successful, sensors operating in the 8-14 mu m atmospheric window must have high signal-to-noise and a small enough instantaneous field of view to allow measurements of only a few leaf surfaces. Methods for atmospheric compensation, temperature-emissivity separation, and spectral feature analysis also will need to be refined to allow the recognition, and perhaps, exploitation of leaf thermal infrared spectral properties.

AB A field experiment was performed with an L- and X-band radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz and 11.4 GHz in a deciduous forest in Julich (Germany) from September to November 2004. The radiometers were installed on the ground being directed upwards through the canopy. In this position downwelling microwave radiation was measured during the defoliation of the forest with a time resolution of 4 h. Simultaneously we measured the air and soil temperatures.
   Based on these data, the transmissivities of the forest canopy were estimated at different foliation states. Typical L-band transmissivities determined for the foliated and the defoliated states were 0.41 and 0.46, confirming the semi-transparency of the canopy at low microwave frequencies. Due to the anisotropic crown structure the L-band brightness temperatures were slightly horizontally polarized to the same degree for any state of the vegetation. From this we conclude that branches are the prevailing emitters of the canopy whereas leaves and trunks are less relevant for L-band observations. In the X-band, the canopy was opaque in the foliated state and became semi-transparent in the course of defoliation indicating that leaves are an important radiation source at this wavelength.
   Our results provide the experimental evidence to quantify the radiation properties of a deciduous forest canopy.

AB Remotely sensed infrared images are often used to assess wildland I ire conditions. Separately, fire propagation models are in use to forecast future conditions. In the Dynamic Data-Driven Application System (DDDAS) concept, the fire propagation model will react to the image data, which should produce more accurate predictions of fire propagation. In this study we describe a series of image processing tools that can be used to extract fire propagation parameters from multispectral infrared images so that the parameters can be used to drive a fire propagation model built upon the DDDAS concept. The method is capable of automatically determining the fire perimeter, active fire line, and fire propagation direction. A multi-band image gradient calculation, the Normalized Difference vegetation Index, and the Normalized Difference Burn Ratio along with several standard image processing techniques are used to identify and constrain the fire propagation parameters. These fire propagation parameters can potentially be used within the DDDAS modeling framework for model update and adjustment. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate that, under ideal circumstances, passive optical measurements can yield surface water depth estimates with an accuracy of a few centimeters. Our target area is the Salar de Uyuni, in Bolivia. It is a large, active salt flat or playa, which is maintained as an almost perfectly le vel and highly reflective surface by annual flooding, to a mean depth of 30-50 cm. We use MISR data to estimate spatial and temporal variations in water depth during the waning portion of the 2001 flooding cycle. We use a single ICESat laser altimetry profile to calibrate our water depth model.-Though the salt surface is probably the smoothest surface of its size on Earth, with less that 30 cm RMS height variations over an area of nearly 10(4) km(2), it is not completely featureless. Topography there includes a peripheral depression, or moat, around the edge of the salt, and several sets of prominent parallel ridges, with 5 km wavelength and 30 cm amplitude. The process by which these features form is still not well characterized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The operational retrieval of height-resolved cloud motion vectors by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on the Terra satellite has been significantly improved by using sub-pixel approaches to co-registration and disparity assessment, and by imposing stronger quality control based on the agreement between independent forward and aft triplet retrievals. Analysis of the fore-aft differences indicates that CMVs pass the basic operational quality control 67% of the time, with rms differences - in speed of 2.4 m/s, in direction of 17 degrees, and in height assignment of 290 m. The use of enhanced quality control thresholds reduces these rms values to 1.5 m/s, 14 degrees and 165 m, respectively, at the cost of reduced coverage to 45%. Use of the enhanced thresholds also eliminates a tendency for the rms differences to increase with height. Comparison of CMVs from an earlier operational version that had slightly weaker quality control, with 6-hour forecast winds from the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office yielded very low bias values and an rms vector difference that ranged from 5 m/s for-low clouds to 10 m/s for high clouds.

AB The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data products now include a scene classification for each 1.1-km, pixel that was developed using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a cutting-edge machine learning technique for supervised classification. Using a combination of spectral, angular, and texture features, each pixel is classified as land, water, cloud, aerosol, or snowlice, with the aerosol class further divided into smoke, dust, and other aerosols. The classifier was trained by MISR scientists who labeled hundreds of scenes using a custom interactive tool that showed them the results of the training in real time, making the process significantly faster. Preliminary validation shows that the accuracy of the classifier is approximately 81% globally at the 1.1-km pixel level. Applications of this classifier include global studies of cloud and aerosol distribution, as well as data mining applications such as searching for smoke plumes. This is one of the largest and most ambitious operational uses of machine learning techniques for a remote-sensing instrument, and the success of this system will hopefully lead to further use of this approach.

AB During the rainy season the abundance of mosquitoes over the Ferlo region (Senegal) is linked to dynamic, vegetation cover and turbidity of temporary and relatively small ponds. The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10 m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatio-temporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: i.e., the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5 ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25% of the Ferlo region, while only 0.9% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. The remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment.

AB An interactive Climatology of Global Ocean Winds (COGOW) is presented based on 5 years (August 1999-July 2004) of QuikSCAT satellite measurements of wind speed and direction 10 m above the sea surface. This climatology provides the first high spatial resolution, observationally based, online atlas of ocean winds. Users can retrieve climatological wind maps and wind statistics, both in tabular and graphical form, from the COGOW web-based atlas. The global coverage of these data provides highly accurate information about the wind statistics in regions of the world ocean that are sparsely sampled by ships and buoys. A case study of the recovery of the vessel Ehime Maru off the Hawaiian Island of Oahu is presented to demonstrate the usage and value of COGOW. Evidence of air sea interactions, one of many wind phenomena visible within COGOW, is discussed to further familiarize users with COGOW. Finally, the utility of COGOW with regard to various operational and research communities is summarized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface melting duration and extent of the Antarctic coasts and ice-shelves is a climatic indicator related to the summer temperature and radiative budget. Surface melting is easily detectable by remote sensing using passive microwave observations. The preliminary goal of this study is to extend to 26 years an existing data set of surface melting [Torinesi, O., Fily, M., Genthon, C. (2003), Interannual variability and trend of the Antarctic summer melting period from 20 years of spaceborne microwave data, J. Climate, 16(7), pp. 1047-1060] by including the most recent years of observation. These data come from 4 microwave sensors (the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and three Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)) observing the surface at different hours of the day. Since surface melting varies throughout the day as the air temperature or the radiation, the interannual melting extent and duration time series are biased by sensor changes. Using all the sensors simultaneously available since 2002, we were able to model the diurnal variations of melting and use this hourly model to correct the long-term time series. This results in an unbiased 26-year long time series better suited for climate analysis. The cooling trend found by Torinesi et al. using uncorrected time series for the 1980-1999 period is confirmed but the decreasing rate is weaker after correction. Furthermore, extending the series up to summer 2004-2005 reveals recent changes: the last 2 summers have been particularly warmer over all the East Antarctica compared to the 10 previous years, thus ending the cold period of the 1990s. The trend over 1980-2005 is no longer toward cooling but complex climatic variations appear. The time series are available at http://www.lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/-picard/melting/.

AB This work examines the application of a geometric-optical canopy reflectance model to provide measures of woody shrub abundance in desert grasslands at the landscape scale. The approach is through inversion of the non-linear simple geometric model (SGM) against 631 nm multi-angle reflectance data from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) flown on the European Space Agency's Project for On-Board Autonomy (Proba) satellite. Separation of background and upper canopy contributions was effected by a linear scaling of the parameters of the Walthall bidirectional reflectance distribution function model with the weights of a kernel-driven model. The relationship was calibrated against a small number of sample locations with highly contrasting background/upper canopy configurations, before application over an area of about 25 km(2). The results show that with some assumptions, the multi-angle remote sensing signal from CHRIS/Proba can be explained in terms of a combined soil-understory background response and woody shrub cover and exploited to map this important structural attribute of desert grasslands.

AB A logistic regression model based on forest inventory plot data and transformations of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery was used to predict the probability of forest for 15 study areas in Indiana, USA, and 15 in Minnesota, USA. Within each study area, model-based estimates of forest area were obtained for circular areas with radii of 5 km, 10 km, and 15 km and were compared to design-based estimates based on inventory plot data. Precision estimates for the circular areas were also obtained using variance formulae developed for this application that incorporated spatial correlation among model predictions for individual pixels. The model-based estimates were generally comparable to the design-based estimates. The advantages of the model-based approach are that maps and small areas estimates may be obtained and the necessity of releasing exact plot locations for user-specific applications is alleviated.

AB The snowpack is a key variable of the hydrological cycle. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of long-term monitoring of the Siberian snowpack on large spatial scales owing to evidence of increased river discharge, changes in snow fall amount and alterations with respect to the timing of ablation. This can currently only be accomplished using remote sensing methods. The main objective of this study is to take advantage of a new land surface forcing and simulation database in order to both improve and evaluate the snow depths retrieved using a dynamic snow depth retrieval algorithm. The dynamic algorithm attempts to account for the spatial and temporal internal properties of the snow cover. The passive microwave radiances used to derive snow depth were measured by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/1) data between July 1987 and July 1995.
   The evaluation of remotely sensed algorithms is especially difficult over regions such as Siberia which are characterized by relatively sparse surface measurement networks. In addition, existing gridded climatological snow depth databases do not necessarily correspond to the same time period as the available satellite data. In order to evaluate the retrieval algorithm over Siberia for a recent multi-year period at a relatively large spatial scale, a land surface scheme reanalysis product from the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase 2 (GSWP-2) is used in the current study. First, the high quality GSWP-2 input forcing data were used to drive a land surface scheme (LSS) in order to derive a climatological near-surface soil temperature. Four different snow depth retrieval methods are compared, two of which use the new soil temperature climatology as input. Second, a GSWP-2 snow water equivalent (SWE) climatology is computed from 12 state-of-the-art LSS over the same time period covered by the SSM/I data. This climatology was compared to the corresponding fields from the retrievals. This study reaffirmed the results of recent studies which showed that the inclusion of ancillary data into a satellite data-based snow retrieval algorithm, such as soil temperatures, can significantly improve the results. The current study also goes a step further and reveals the importance of including the monthly soil temperature variation into the retrieval, which improves results in terms of the spatial distribution of the snowpack. Finally, it is shown that further improved predictions of SWE are obtained when spatial and temporal variations in snow density are accounted for. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to monitor and rapidly react to remote detection of volcanic activity has been greatly improved through use of the Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE), an advanced software application installed on a spacecraft in Earth orbit. ASE is a NASA New Millennium Program experiment demonstrating science-driven autonomous command and control of a spacecraft. Flying on the Earth observing-1 (EO-1) spacecraft, ASE successfully detected thermal emission from the Mt. Erebus lava lake on 7 May 2004, having analyzed a Hyperion hyperspectral data product on board the spacecraft. EO-1 was re-tasked by ASE to obtain a follow-up observation 7 h later and sent a notification of detection of volcanic activity to the ground. The entire process was carried out autonomously. Initial acquisition to receipt on the ground of the positive detection took less than 3 h, a process that without ASE would have taken weeks. The ASE Thermal Classifier has detected several styles of effusive volcanic activity: active lava lakes, pahoehoe flow fields, open channel flows and lava domes. ASE successfully demonstrated that science-driven spacecraft operation greatly enhances science return per returned byte through the identification of the most valuable data, allowing prioritization of downlink products and the discarding of null data sets. This technology has applications on missions elsewhere in the solar system. Modified thermal classifiers can be used for detecting and monitoring active volcanism on the jovian satellite to, the neptunian moon Triton, and searching for active volcanism on Mars and icy satellites. The success of ASE is an incentive for future instrument and mission designers to consider on-board data-processing requirements (especially data storage capacity, number of processors and processor speed, and RAM) in order to take advantage of this flight-proven technology.

AB The leaf area index (LAI) product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is important for monitoring and modelling global change and terrestrial dynamics at many scales. The algorithm relies on spectral reflectances and a six biome land cover classification. Evaluation of the specific behaviour and performance of the product for regions of the globe such as Australia are needed to assist with product refinement and validation. We made an assessment of Collection 4 of the MODIS LAI product using four approaches: (a) assessment against a continental scale Structural Classification of Australian Vegetation (SCAV); (b) assessment against a continental scale land use classification (LUC); (c) assessment against historical field-based measurement of LAI collected prior to the Terra Mission; and (d) direct comparison of MODIS LAI with coincident field measurements of LAI, mostly from hemispherical photography. The MODIS LAI product produced a wide variety of geographically and structurally specific temporal response profiles between different classes and even for sub-groups within classes of the SCAV. Historical and concurrent field measurements indicated that MODIS LAI was giving reasonable estimates for LAI for most cover types and land use types, but that major overestimation of LAI occurs in some eastern Australian open forests and woodlands. The six biome structural land cover classification showed some significant deviations in class allocation compared to the SCAV particularly where grasslands are allocated to shrubland, savanna woodlands are allocated to shrubland, savanna and broadleaf forest, and open forests are allocated to savanna and broadleaf forest. The land cover and LAI products could benefit from some additional examination of Australian data addressing the structural representation of Eucalypt canopies in the "space of canopy realisation" for savanna and broadleaf forest classes.

AB Within the past decade, several global land cover data sets derived from satellite observations have become available to the scientific community. They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth's land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets.
   This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a 'best-estimate' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint I-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations.
   The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE.
   Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate. SYNMAP is available on request from Martin Jung.

AB Multispectral classification approaches were applied to high-resolution ASTER (15 in) and ETM+ (30 in) imagery for the purpose of developing new techniques for mapping recently deglaciated LIA perennial ice cover in the Canadian Arctic. Four areas in the Queen Elizabeth Islands, with dissimilar surficial geology and diverse topographic complexity, were selected to test the efficacy of both sensors for mapping these subtle landscape features. Automated classification (band calculation) methods were found to be most effective on quartzitic sandstone and siliceous crystalline bedrock, whereas, semi-automated (Supervised classification) techniques were most successful on substrates comprised primarily of carbonate lithologies. ASTER's superior spatial resolution yielded higher accuracies in topographically complex areas; however, ETM+ was more effective over a wider variety of substrate lithologies and topographic settings, with a mean overall accuracy of 91% (mean K statistic =0.71), compared to 87% (mean K statistic=0.60) for ASTER.

AB An analysis of tropical rain forest covering Amazonian lowlands has highlighted a systematic across-path, east-west radiometric gradient within Landsat TM imagery. Visual assessment of 45 and quantitative analysis of 20 Amazonian Landsat-4 and -5 TM scenes show that the gradient is band dependent and pronounced in visible light bands I to 3 but significant also in IR bands 4 to 7. The results show that the scan line location of a pixel explains a considerable amount of the DN variation of forests in the width of the entire scene (B1: 70%, 132: 52%, 133: 44%, 134: 34%, 135: 46%, B7: 39%). In digital numbers, the difference between east and west side of a scene may be small (9, 4, 3, 10, 9, 3, respectively) but these differences become significant if the images are to be mosaicked, or the data are used for mapping relatively subtle differences of natural forests. Apparently, the gradient is a result of at least three factors: 1) shadows caused by the undulating terrain, 2) anisotropic reflectance of the varying surfaces, and 3) atmospheric scattering. The phenomenon becomes more significant when the sun is high and the scanning line is close to solar azimuth direction-a. condition more easily encountered in lower latitudes of the earth.

AB A simple methodology for characterizing the land surface's response to precipitation is proposed based on the average behavior of coarse resolution remote sensing data. Feedback regimes are designated based on the temporal correlations between the vegetation and precipitation and the surface temperature and precipitation. The different feedback regimes are linked to the relative importance of vegetation and soil moisture in determining land-atmosphere interactions. The resultant feedback regimes are well localized spatially. In addition, the temporal dynamics are assessed in terms of lagged covariances and phase-space plots. The two dominant feedback regimes are distinguishable by the vegetation-precipitation correlation, implying that vegetative control may be the dominant factor in influencing surface-precipitation feedbacks. These zones are not easily distinguished in the NDVI-surface temperature correlations, but exhibit different behavior in their NDVI-precipitation and surface temperature-precipitation correlations. In addition, these zones can be distinguished in phase plots of both temperature and NDVI. These results suggest a methodology for quantifying the rate of the hydrological cycle in different regions of the globe as well as identifying areas where human induced land cover change may have the most effect transitioning between different feedback zones, and therefore altering the rate of the hydrologic cycle.

AB The number of training samples per class (n) required for accurate Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification is known to be affected by the number of bands (p) in the input image. However, the general rule which defines that n should be 10p to 30p is often enforced universally in remote sensing without questioning its relevance to the complexity of the specific discrimination problem. Furthermore, identifying this many training samples is often problematic when many classes and/or many bands are used. It is important, then, to test how this generally accepted rule matches common remote sensing discrimination problems because it could be unnecessarily restrictive for many applications. This study was primarily conducted in order to test whether the general rule defining the relationship between n and p was well-suited for ML classification of a relatively simple remote sensing-based discrimination problem. To summarise the mean response of n-to-p for our study site, a Monte Carlo procedure was used to randomly stack various numbers of bands into thousands of separate image combinations that were then classified using an ML algorithm. The bands were randomly selected from a 119-band Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) dataset comprised of 17 images acquired during the 2001-2002 southern hemisphere summer agricultural growing season over an irrigation area in south-eastern Australia. Results showed that the number of training samples needed for accurate ML classification was much lower than the cur-rent widely accepted rule. Due to the asymptotic nature of the relationship, we found that 95% of the accuracy attained using n = 30p samples could be achieved by using approximately 2p to 4p samples, or <= 1/7th the currently recommended value of n. Our findings show that the number of training samples needed for a simple discrimination problem is much less than that defined by the general rule and therefore the rule should not be universally enforced; the number of training samples needed should also be determined by considering the complexity of the discrimination problem.

AB We combined remote sensing and in-situ measurements to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from riparian vegetation over large reaches of western U.S. rivers and ET by individual plant types. ET measured from nine flux towers (eddy covariance and Bowen ratio) established in plant communities dominated by five major plant types on the Middle Rio Grande, Upper San Pedro River, and Lower Colorado River was strongly correlated with Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor on the NASA Terra satellite. The inclusion of maximum daily air temperatures (T-a) measured at the tower sites further improved this relationship. Sixteen-day composite values of EVI and T-a were combined to predict ET across species and tower sites (r(2) = 0.74); the regression equation was used to scale ET for 2000-2004 over large river reaches with T-a from meteorological stations. Measured and estimated ET values for these river segments were moderate when compared to historical, and often indirect, estimates and ranged from 851 874 min yr(-1). ET of individual plant communities ranged more widely. Cottonwood (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) stands generally had the highest annual ET rates (1100-1300 min yr(-1)), while mesquite (Prosopis velutina) (400-1100 mm yr(-1)) and saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) (300-1300 mm yr(-1)) were intermediate, and giant sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii) (500-800 mm yr(-1)) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) (300-700 mm yr(-1)) were the lowest. ET rates estimated from the flux towers and by remote sensing in this study were much lower than values estimated for riparian water budgets using crop coefficient methods for the Middle Rio Grande and Lower Colorado River.

AB In recent years, decision tree classifiers have been successfully used for land cover classification from remote sensing data. Their implementation as a per-pixel based classifier to produce hard or crisp classification has been reported in the literature. Remote sensing images, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions, are contaminated with mixed pixels that contain more than one class on the ground. The per-pixel approach may result in erroneous classification of images dominated by mixed pixels. Therefore, soft classification approaches that decompose the pixel into its class constituents in the form of class proportions have been advocated. In this paper, we employ a decision tree regression approach to determine class proportions within a pixel so as to produce soft classification from remote sensing data. Classification accuracy achieved by decision tree regression is compared with those achieved by the most widely used maximum likelihood classifier, implemented in the soft mode, and a supervised version of the fuzzy c-means classifier. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and fuzzy error matrix based measures have been used for accuracy assessment of soft classification. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Under natural sunlight illumination, the chlorophyll fluorescence emitted by the vegetation represents less than 3% of the reflected light in the near infrared part of the spectrum. This small amount is difficult to quantify except at certain wavelengths, where the solar spectrum is attenuated (Fraunhofer lines). An instrument measuring the in-filling of the atmospheric oxygen absorption band at 760 nm by chlorophyll fluorescence has been designed and constructed at the "Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnetique" in Orsay, France. The system was calibrated against a pulsed fluorimeter (FIPAM), especially developed for monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence at distance. The penetration of diuron, a herbicide acting on photosynthesis, was monitored by the passive instrument for several days on a corn canopy. A good agreement was found between gas exchange and variable chlorophyll fluorescence at the canopy level and variable fluorescence at the leaf level. The potential application of the passive chlorophyll fluorescence measurements for long range vegetation remote sensing is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The classification of agricultural tillage systems has proven challenging in the past using traditional classification methods due to the similarity of spectral reflectance signatures of soils and senescent crop residues. In this study, five classification methods were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) cropping methods: minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance, Maximum Likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and the cosine of the angle concept (CAC). A Landsat ETM+ image acquired over southern Michigan and northern Indiana was used to test these classification methods. Each classification method was validated with 293 ground truth sampling locations collected commensurate with the satellite overpass. Classification accuracy was then assessed using error matrix analysis, Kappa statistics, and tests for statistical significance. The results indicate that of the classification routines examined, the two spectral angle methods were superior to the others. The cosine of the angle concept algorithm outperformed all the other classification routines for tillage practice identification and mapping, yielding an overall accuracy of 97.2% (Kappa = 0.959).

AB Leaf area index (LAI) collected in a needle-leaf forest site near Ruokolahti, Finland, during a field campaign in June 14-21, 2000, was used to validate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI algorithm. The field LAI data was first related to 30-m resolution Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) images using empirical methods to create a high-resolution LAI map. The analysis of empirical approaches indicates that preliminary segmentation of the image followed by empirical modeling with the resulting patches, was an effective approach to developing an LAI validation surface. Comparison of the aggregated high-resolution LAI map and corresponding MODIS LAI retrievals suggests satisfactory behavior of the MODIS LAI algorithm although variation in MODIS LAI product is higher than expected. The MODIS algorithm, adjusted to high resolution, generally overestimates the LAI due to the influence of the understory vegetation. This indicates the need for improvements in the algorithm. An improved correlation between field measurements and the reduced simple ratio (RSR) suggests that the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band may provide valuable information for needle-leaf forests.

AB The concept of imaging spectrometry, or hyperspectral imaging, is becoming increasingly popular in scientific communities in recent years. Hyperspectral imaging data covering the spectral region between 0.4 and 2.5 mum and collected from aircraft and satellite platforms have been used in the study of the earth's atmosphere, land surface, and ocean color properties, as well as on planetary missions. In order to make such quantitative studies, accurate radiometric and spectral calibrations of hyperspectral imaging data are necessary. Calibration coefficients for all detectors in an imaging spectrometer obtained in a laboratory may need to be adjusted when applied to data obtained from an aircraft or a satellite platform. Shifts in channel center wavelengths and changes in spectral resolution may occur when an instrument is airborne or spaceborne due to vibrations, and to changes in instrument temperature and pressure. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for refining spectral calibrations of imaging spectrometer data using observed features in the data itself. The algorithm is based on spectrum-matching of atmospheric water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide bands, and solar Fraunhofer lines. It has been applied to real data sets acquired with airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Laser scanners of small footprint diameter and high sampling density provide possibility to obtain accurate height information on the forest canopy. When applying tree crown segmentation methods, individual single trees can be recognised and tree height as well as crown area can be detected. Detection of suppressed trees from a height model based on laser scanning is difficult;, however, it is possible to predict these trees by using theoretical distribution functions. In this Study, two different methods are used to predict small trees. In the first method, the parameter prediction method is utilised with the complete Weibull distribution, the parameters of which are predicted with separate parameter prediction models; thus, small trees are determined from the predicted tree height distribution. In the second method, the two-parameter left-truncated Weibull distribution is fitted to the detected tree height distribution.
   The results are presented by using timber volume and stem density as predicted stand characteristics. The results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) for the timber volume is about 25% when using only information obtained from laser scanning, whereas the RMSE for the number of sterns per ha is about 75%. Predictions for both characteristics are also highly biased and the underestimates are 24% and 62%, respectively. The use of the parameter prediction method to describe small trees improved the accuracy considerably; the RMSE figures for estimates of timber volume and number of sterns are 16.0% and 49.2%, respectively. The bias for the estimates is also decreased to 6.3% for timber volume and 8.2% for the number of steins. When a left-truncated height distribution is used to predict the heights of the missing small trees, the RMSEs for the estimates of timber volume and number of stems are 22.5% and 72.7%, respectively. In the case of the timber volume, the reliability figures for both the original laser scanning-based estimates and for the estimates that also contain small trees are comparable to those obtained by conventional compartment-wise Finnish field inventories.

AB Information on land cover distribution at regional and global scales has become fundamental for studying global changes affecting ecological and climatic systems. The remote sensing community has responded to this increased interest by improving data quality and methodologies for extracting land cover information. However, in addition to the advantages provided by satellite products, certain limitations exist that need to be objectively quantified and clearly communicated to users so that they can make informed decisions on whether and how land cover products should be used. Accuracy assessment is the procedure used to quantify product quality. Some aspects of accuracy assessment for evaluating four global land cover maps over Canada are discussed in this paper. Attempts are made to quantify limiting factors resulting from the coarse spatial resolution of data used for generating land cover information at regional and global levels. Sub-pixel fractional error matrices are introduced as a more appropriate way for assessing the accuracy of mixed pixels. For classification with coarse spatial resolution data, limitations of the classification method produce a maximum achievable accuracy defined as the average percent fraction of dominant land cover of all pixels in the mapped area. Relationships among spatial resolution, landscape heterogeneity and thematic resolution were studied and reported. Other factors that can affect accuracy, such as misregistration and legend conversion, are also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Topographic variations affect the reflectance properties of the Earth's surface and are often removed in remote sensing studies, especially when significant terrain variations exist. In this study, however, we show that shading effects assessed by Landsat can be treated as a signal that stores important topographic information, especially when the spectral characteristics of a surface are homogenous. The coastal transverse dunes of the Ashdod area, and the desert linear dunes of Nizzana. (both located in Israel), were selected to investigate the abovementioned idea. The dune heights in these areas are 10 m on average (relative to their surroundings) and have maximum slopes of 33degrees. An innovative method for extracting slope, aspect, and height data for sand dunes using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images was developed, based on the regularity and periodicity of dunes' landscapes. Using two Landsat images representing different sun zenith and azimuth angles, reflectance values of each image were converted to cos(i) values (i=incident angle between the surface normal and the solar beam radiation), applying histogram matching methods. The slope and aspect of each pixel were determined as those that give the best prediction of the observed value of cos(i). Height profiles were then extracted, using simple trigonometric relationships. The accuracies of heights and slopes along selected profile lines were to the order of 1 m and 3degrees, respectively (at a spatial resolution of 15 in). Best results were obtained when the images included one from the summer and the other from the winter, corresponding to maximum difference in solar zenith and azimuth angles. Errors in heights were attributed to surface heterogeneity (e.g., presence of biogenic soil crusts in the rainy season), geometric correction errors, cast shadows, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects. Comparison to Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 3D information showed that the proposed method is better in representing the topographic variation of the area than the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by ASTER.

AB in order to improve biodiversity management in the Wellington region of New Zealand, it is necessary to make an inventory of the indigenous forest-where is it, and what type is it? The single greatest impediment to making a spatially (i.e., 1:50,000 scale) and thematically detailed inventory from satellite imagery has been the topography of the three mountainous ranges in the Wellington region. The effective irradiance of incoming light varies with slope orientation, as does the proportion of light that is reflected towards the satellite (the bidirectional reflectance). In this paper, we show how satellite imagery may be processed to standardised spectral reflectance, which is a property of the vegetation alone, independent of sun position, slope, and view direction. Because of this, the use of automatic methods to map vegetation and provide spatially and thematically detailed maps is greatly simplified. Using this method, we produce a land-cover map of the Wellington region, with eight classes, to a classification accuracy of approximately 95%. We also show how the proportions of conifer, broad-leaved, and beech trees may be determined for indigenous forest to provide a framework for forest-type inventory. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB We use data from two satellites and a terrestrial carbon model to quantify the impact of urbanization on the carbon cycle and food production in the US as a result of reduced net primary productivity (NPP). Our results show that urbanization is taking place on the most fertile lands and hence has a disproportionately large overall negative impact on NPP. Urban land transformation in the US has reduced the amount of carbon fixed through photosynthesis by 0.04 pg per year or 1.6% of the pre-urban input. The reduction is enough to offset the 1.8% gain made by the conversion of land to agricultural use, even though urbanization covers an area less than 3% of the land surface in the US and agricultural lands approach 29% of the total land area. At local and regional scales, urbanization increases NPP in resource-limited regions and through localized warming "urban heat" contributes to the extension of the growing season in cold regions. In terms of biologically available energy, the loss of NPP due to urbanization of agricultural lands alone is equivalent to the caloric requirement of 16.5 million people, or about 6% of the US population.

AB The objective of this paper is to review research conducted over the past decade on the application of multi-temporal remote sensing for monitoring changes of Arctic tundra lands. Emphasis is placed on results from the National Science Foundation Land-Air-Ice Interactions (LAII) program and on optical remote sensing techniques. Case studies demonstrate that ground-level sensors on stationary or moving track platforms and wide-swath imaging sensors on polar orbiting satellites are particularly useful for capturing optical remote sensing data at sufficient frequency to study tundra vegetation dynamics and changes for the cloud prone Arctic. Less frequent imaging with high spatial resolution instruments on aircraft and lower orbiting satellites enable more detailed analyses of land cover change and calibration/validation of coarser resolution observations.
   The strongest signals of ecosystem change detected thus far appear to correspond to expansion of tundra shrubs and changes in the amount and extent of thaw lakes and ponds. Changes in shrub cover and extent have been documented by modem repeat imaging that matches archived historical aerial photography. NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) time series provide a 20-year record for determining changes in greenness that relates to photosynthetic activity, net primary production, and growing season length. The strong contrast between land materials and surface waters enables changes in lake and pond extent to be readily measured and monitored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Secondary forests may become increasingly important as temporary reservoirs of genetic diversity, stocks of carbon and nutrients, and moderators of hydrologic cycles in the Amazon Basin as agricultural lands are abandoned and often later cleared again for agriculture. We studied a municipality in northeastern Par, Brazil, that has been settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3-6 years), intermediate (10-20 years), advanced (40-70 years), and mature successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied 22%, 13%, 9%, and 6% of the area, respectively. Although this area underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type covers about 50% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover 8%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. The best separation among land covers appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings of successional forests were derived independently from indices of similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes, with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status, as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties.

AB The influence of zoning on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiant surface temperature (T-s) measurements is investigated in the City of Indianapolis, IN, USA using data collected by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) remote sensing system. Analysis of variance indicates statistically significant differences in mean T-s and NDVI values associated with different types of zoning. Multiple comparisons of mean T-s and NDVI values associated with specific pairings of individual zoning categories are also shown to be significantly different. An inverse relationship between T-s and NDVI was observed across the city as a whole and within all but one zoning category. A range of environmental influences on sensible heat flux and urban vegetation was detected both within and between individual zoning categories. Examples for implementing these findings in urban planning applications to find examples of high and low impact development are demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The full realization of the potential of remote sensing as a source of environmental information requires an ability to generalize in space and time. Here, the ability to generalize in space was investigated through an analysis of the transferability of predictive relations for the estimation of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data between sites in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. The data sets for each test site were acquired and processed in a similar fashion to facilitate the analyses. Three types of predictive relation, based on vegetation indices, multiple regression and feedforward neural networks, were developed for biomass estimation at each site. For each site, the strongest relationships between the biomass predicted and that measured from field survey was obtained with a neural network developed specifically for the site (r>0.71, significant at the 99% level of confidence). However, with each type of approach problems in transferring a relation to another site were observed. In particular, it was apparent that the accuracy of prediction, as indicated by the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomass, declined when a relation was transferred to a site other than that upon which it was developed. Part of this problem lies with the observed variation in the relative contribution of the different spectral wavebands to predictive relations for biomass estimation between sites. It was, for example, apparent that the spectral composition of the vegetation indices most strongly related to biomass differed greatly between the sites. Consequently, the relationship between predicted and measured biomass derived from vegetation indices differed markedly in both strength and direction between sites. Although the incorporation of test site location information into an analysis resulted in an increase in the strength of the relationship between predicted and actual biomass, considerable further research is required on the problems associated with transferring predictive relations.

AB The Gulf of Tonkin is a semi-closed gulf northwest of the South China Sea, experiencing reversal seasonal monsoon. Previous studies of water conditions have been conducted in the western waters of the gulf, but very few studies of the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution have been carried out for the entire gulf The present study investigates seasonal and spatial distributions of Chl-a and water conditions in the Gulf of Tonkin by analyzing Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Scanner (SeaWiFS) derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), in situ measurements, sea surface temperatures (SST), and other oceanographic data obtained in 1999 and 2000. The results show seasonality of Chl-a and SST variations in the Gulf of Tonkin, and reveal phytoplankton blooming events in the center part of the gulf during the northeast monsoon season. In summer, Chl-a concentrations were relatively low (<0.3 mg m(-3)) and distributed uniformly throughout most of the area, with a belt of higher Chl-a concentrations along the coast, particularly the coast of Qiongzhou Peninsula; in winter, Chl-a concentration increased (0.5 mg m(-3)) in the entire gulf, and phytoplankton blooms offshore-ward from the northeast coast to the center of the gulf, while Chl-a concentrations reached high levels (0.8-1 mg m(-3)) in the center of the blooms. One peak of Chl-a concentrations was observed during the northeast monsoon season in the year. SST were high (27-29 degreesC) and distributed uniformly in summer, but lower with a large gradient from northeast (17 degreesC) to southwest (25 degreesC) in winter, while strong northeast winds (8 - 10 m/s) were parallel to the east coast of the gulf Comparison of Chl-a values shows that SeaWiFS derived Chl-a concentrations match well with in situ measurements in most parts of the gulf in May 1999, but SeaWiFS derived Chl-a are higher than in situ data in river mouth waters. The seasonal variation of Chl-a concentrations and SST distribution were associated with the seasonally reversing monsoon; the winter phytoplankton blooms were related to vertical mixing and upwelling nutrients drawn by the northeast wind.

AB A radiance-to-flux conversion is needed to estimate radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from directional measurements made by broadband (BB) radiometers on satellites. Such a conversion is known to be one of the major sources of error in the resulting instantaneous shortwave and longwave fluxes. This paper analyzes the possibility to improve the radiance-to-flux conversion for the longwave radiation when spectral information about the radiation is available through a set of narrow-band (NB) measurements. The study is based on a database of spectral radiance fields at the top of the atmosphere built using radiative transfer computation. The analysis of this database shows that there exists a certain degree of correlation between the angular and the spectral behaviors of the radiation field. According to the type and the accuracy of the spectral information, this correlation allows a 25-55% reduction of the error introduced by the radiance-to-flux conversion with respect to a simple model that uses only broadband information. The method discussed in this paper might be used when broadband radiometer and spectral imager data are available together like the combination of Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Radiometer Imager (SEVIRI) or the combination of CERES and MODIS.

AB Statistical and radiative-transfer physically based studies have previously demonstrated the relationship between leaf water content and leaf-level reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region. The successful scaling up of such methods to the canopy level requires modeling the effect of canopy structure and viewing geometry on reflectance bands and optical indices used for estimation of water content, such as normalized difference water index (NDWI), simple ratio water index (SRWI) and plant water index (PWI). This study conducts a radiative transfer simulation, linking leaf and canopy models, to study the effects of leaf structure, dry matter content, leaf area index (LAI), and the viewing geometry, on the estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness from canopy-level reflectance. The applicability of radiative transfer model inversion methods to MODIS is studied, investigating its spectral capability for water content estimation. A modeling study is conducted, simulating leaf and canopy MODIS-equivalent synthetic spectra with random input variables to test different inversion assumptions. A field sampling campaign to assess the investigated simulation methods was undertaken for analysis of leaf water content from leaf samples in 10 study sites of chaparral vegetation in California, USA, between March and September 2000. MODIS reflectance data were processed from the same period for equivalent water thickness estimation by model inversion linking the PROSPECT leaf model and SAILH canopy reflectance model. MODIS reflectance data, viewing geometry values, and LAI were used as inputs in the model inversion for estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness, dry matter, and leaf structure. Results showed good correlation between the time series of MODIS-estimated equivalent water thickness and ground measured leaf fuel moisture (LFM) content (r(2)=0.7), demonstrating that these inversion methods could potentially be used for global monitoring of leaf water content in vegetation.

AB Empirical models are important tools for relating field-measured biophysical variables to remote sensing data. Regression analysis has been a popular empirical method of linking these two types of data to provide continuous estimates for variables such as biomass, percent woody canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Traditional methods of regression are not sufficient when resulting biophysical surfaces derived from remote sensing are subsequently used to drive ecosystem process models. Most regression analyses in remote sensing rely on a single spectral vegetation index (SVI) based on red and near-infrared reflectance from a single date of imagery. There are compelling reasons for utilizing greater spectral dimensionality, and for including SVIs from multiple dates in a regression analysis. Moreover, when including multiple SVIs and/or dates, it is useful to integrate these into a single index for regression modeling. Selection of an appropriate regression model, use of multiple SVIs from multiple dates of imagery as predictor variables, and employment of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to integrate these multiple indices into a single index represent a significant strategic improvement over existing uses of regression analysis in remote sensing.
   To demonstrate this improved strategy, we compared three different types of regression models to predict LAI for an agro-ecosystem and live tree canopy cover for a needleleaf evergreen boreal forest: traditional (Y on X) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, inverse (X on Y) OLS regression, and an orthogonal regression method called reduced major axis (RMA). Each model incorporated multiple SVIs from multiple dates and CCA was used to integrate these. For a given dataset, the three regression-modeling approaches produced identical coefficients of determination and intercepts, but different slopes, giving rise to divergent predictive characteristics. The traditional approach yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), but the variance in the predictions was lower than the variance in the observed dataset. The inverse method had the highest RMSE and the variance was inflated relative to the variance of the observed dataset. RMA provided an intermediate set of predictions in terms of the RMSE, and the variance in the observations was preserved in the predictions. These results are predictable from regression theory, but that theory has been essentially ignored within the discipline of remote sensing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID NEW-YORK; MISCLASSIFICATION
AB The effects of patch size and land-cover heterogeneity on classification accuracy were evaluated using reference data collected for the National Land-Cover Data (NLCD) set accuracy assessment. Logistic regression models quantified the relationship between classification accuracy and these landscape variables for each land-cover class at both the Anderson Levels I and II classification schemes employed in the NLCD. The general relationships were consistent, with the odds of correctly classifying a pixel increasing as patch size increased and decreasing as heterogeneity increased. Specific characteristics of these relationships, however, showed considerable diversity among the various classes. Odds ratios are reported to document these relationships. Interaction between the two landscape variables was not a significant influence on classification accuracy, indicating that the effect of heterogeneity was not impacted by the sample being in a small or large patch. Landscape variables remained significant predictors of class-specific accuracy even when adjusted for regional differences in the mapping and assessment processes or landscape characteristics. The land-cover class-specific analyses provide insight into sources of classification error and a capacity for predicting error based on a pixel's mapped land-cover class, patch size and surrounding land-cover heterogeneity.

AB While remote sensing offers the capability for monitoring land surface changes, extracting the change information from satellite data requires effective and automated change detection techniques. The majority of change detection techniques rely on empirically derived thresholds to differentiate changes from background variations, which are often considered noise. Over large areas, reliable threshold definition is problematic due to variations in both the surface state and those imposed by the sensing system. A new approach to change detection, applicable to high-temporal frequency satellite data, that maps the location and approximate day of change occurrence is described. The algorithm may be applied to a range of change detection applications by using appropriate wavelengths. The approach is applied here to the problem of mapping burned areas using moderate spatial resolution satellite data. A bi-directional reflectance model is inverted against multi-temporal land surface reflectance observations, providing an expectation and uncertainty of subsequent observations through time. The algorithm deals with angular variations observed in multi-temporal satellite data and enables the use of a statistical measure to detect change from a previously observed state. The algorithm is applied independently to geolocated pixels over a long time series of reflectance observations. Large discrepancies between predicted and measured values are attributed to change. A temporal consistency threshold is used to differentiate between temporary changes considered as noise and persistent changes of interest. The algorithm is adaptive to the number, viewing and illumination geometry of the observations, and to the amount of noise in the data. The approach is demonstrated using 56 days of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance data generated for Southern Africa during the 2000 burning season. Qualitatively, the results show high correspondence with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detection results and reveal a coherent spatio-temporal progression of burning. Validation of these results is in progress and recommendations for future research, pending the availability of independent validation data sets, are made. This approach is now being considered for the MODIS burned area algorithm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SCALE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS; VEGETATION-MANAGEMENT
AB Ensuring successful forest regeneration requires an effective monitoring program to collect information regarding the status of young crop trees and nearby competing vegetation. Current field-based assessment methodology provides the needed information, but is costly, and therefore assessment frequency is low. This often allows undesirable forest structures to develop that do not coincide with management objectives. Remote sensing techniques provide a potentially low-cost alternative to field-based assessment, but require the development of methods to easily and accurately extract the required information. Automated tree detection and delineation algorithms may be an effective means to accomplish this task. In this study, a tree detection-delineation algorithm designed specifically for high-resolution digital imagery of 6-year-old trees is presented and rigorously evaluated. The algorithm is based on the analysis of local transects extending outward from a potential tree apex. The crown boundary is estimated using the point of maximum rate of change in the transect data and a rule base is applied to ensure that the point is contextually suitable. This transect approach is implemented in both the tree-detection and crown-delineation phases. The tree-detection algorithm refines the results of an initial local maximum filter by providing an outline for each detected tree and retaining only one local maximum value within this outline. The crown-delineation algorithm is similar to the detection algorithm, but applies a different rule set in creating a more detailed crown outline. Results show that the algorithm's tree-detection accuracy was better than that using commonly applied fixed-window local maximum filters; it achieved a best result of 91%. For the crown-delineation algorithm, measured diameters from delineated crowns were within 17.9% of field measurements of diameter at the crown base on an individual tree basis and within 3% when averaged for the study. Tests of image pixel spacings from 5 to 30 cm showed that tree-detection accuracy was stable except at the lowest (30-cm) resolution where errors were unacceptable. Delineated crown-diameter accuracy was more sensitive to image resolution, decreasing consistently and nonlinearly with increasing pixel spacing. These results highlight the need for very high resolution imagery in automated object-based analysis of forest regeneration, (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The insights gained from present land cover classification activities suggest integration of multiangle data into classification attempts for future progress, Land cover types that exhibit distinct signatures in the space of remote sensing data facilitate unambiguous identification of cover types. In this first part, we develop a theine for consistency between cover type definitions, uniqueness of their signatures, and physics of the remote sensing data. The idea of angular signatures in spectral;pace is proposed to provide a cogent synthesis of information from spectral and angular domains. Three new metrics, angular signature slope (ASSI), length (ASLI), and intercept indices, are introduced to characterize biome signatures. The statistical analyses with these indices confirm the idea that incorporation of the directional variable should improve biome classification result. The consistency principle is tested with the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiorricter (MISR) leaf area index (LAI) algorithm by examining retrievals when both unique and nonunique signatures are input together with a land cover map, It is shown that this requirement guarantees valid retrievals. Pail II provides a theoretical basis for these concepts [Zhang et al., Remote Sens. Environ., in press.]. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Derivation of SeaWiFS vicarious calibration coefficients using in situ

ID ZONE COLOR SCANNER; COASTAL
AB The vicarious calibration technique is used to improve the performance of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) onboard the OrbView-2 spacecraft to get reliable results for the concentration of water constituents in turbid waters of the Baltic Sea. The technique is used to determine mean vicarious calibration coefficients that are multiplied with the slope of SeaWiFS calibration equation and consequently enhance the preflight calibration coefficients. The standard SeaWiFS test site for the derivation of Such coefficients is situated in a clear water region where the optical properties of the water are determined by the phytoplankton and its degradation products. In this paper, mean vicarious calibration coefficients are derived for the first time from in situ measurements in Case 2 water of the Baltic Sea. It was found a necessary adjustment of +3% for the center wavelength of 412 nm and between -0.1% and -3% for 443-670 nm. Similar coefficients were found by other research groups. The result is a maximum deviation of 33% in the channels 490-670 nm of determined SeaWiFS normalised water-leaving radiances considering the derived vicarious correction coefficients from the in Situ radiances. The deviation is greater at the channels 412 and 443 nm due to higher inaccuracy of atmospheric correction in the blue spectral range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral properties of a wheat canopy with vegetation fraction (AIF) from 0% to 100% in visible and near-infrared (NITR) ranges of the spectrum were studied in order to devise a technique for remote estimation of VF. When VF was <60%, from emergence till middle of the elongation stage, four distinct, and quite independent, spectral bands of reflectance existed in the visible range of the spectrum: 400 to 500 nm. 530 to 600 nm, near 670 nm, and around 700 nm. When VF was between 60% and 100%, reflectance in the NIR leveled off or even decreases with an increase of VF. The decreased reflectance in the NIR, occurring at or near the midseason, can be a limiting factor in the use of that spectral region for VF estimation. It was found that for VF>60%, the information content of reflectance spectra in visible range can be expressed by only two independent pairs of spectral bands: (1) the blue from 400 to 500 nm and the red near 670 nm; (2) the green around 550 rim and the red edge region near 700 rim. We propose using only the visible range of the spectrum to quantitatively estimate VF The green (as well as a 700-nm band) and the red (near 670 nm) reflectances were used in developing new indices, which were linearly proportional to wheat VF ranging from 0% to 100%. The Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) concept was used to correct indices for atmospheric effects. Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index in the form VARI=(R-green-R-red)/(R-green + R-red - R-blue) was found to be minimally sensitive to atmospheric effects allowing estimation of VF with an error of <10% in a wide range of atmospheric optical thickness. Validation of the newly suggested technique was carried out using wheat independent data sets and reflectance data obtained for cornfields in Nebraska. Predicted green VF was compared with retrieved from digital images. Despite the fact that the reflectance contrast among the visible channels is much smaller than between the visible and NIR, the sensitivity of suggested indices to moderate to high values of VF is much higher than for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the error in VF prediction did not exceed 10%. Suggested indices will complement the widely used NDVI, ARVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and others, which are based on the red and the NIR bands in VF estimation, and also Green Atmospherically Resistant Index (GARI), which is based on the green and the NIR bands.

ID SATELLITE DATA; FUTURE; CARBON
AB The Landsat Earth observation approach introduced in 1972 created a new way of monitoring land cover and land use globally. The Landsat 7 mission, successfully launched on April 15, 1999, continues those observations and demonstrates significant progress in precise numerical radiometry, spectral differentiation, and seasonally repetitive monitoring. Substantial improvements in calibration procedures, both prior to launch and during normal operations, have also been made to ensure long-term stability in the acquired spectral radiometry. Landsat 7 data acquisitions are being driven by a long-term data acquisition plan that was designed to ensure that substantially cloud-free, seasonal coverage would be recorded and archived in the US for all land areas of the globe. NASA competitively selected a Landsat Science Team, consisting of representatives from US universities and government agencies, to exploit the Landsat 7 record for global change research. This team is addressing the technical and analytical means to process and analyze the core of this observation record, and for the first time in the history of the Landsat mission, the technical and operational aspects of the mission are being driven by the goals of the US science community. The expected outcome of these efforts is a rapid improvement in understanding the Earth system, as well as conceptual knowledge that will underpin significant advancements in the application of this technology for commercial, operational, educational, and research purposes. Pathways to achieve effective Landsat continuity in the early decades of the 21st century are also being given careful attention, and there is no question that the lessons teamed from the Landsat 7 mission will strongly influence these next-generation sensor systems.

AB The recent launch of Landsat-7 ETM+ extends the uninterrupted stream of TM and ETM+ images to a potential span of 32 years. This exceptional image set will allow long-term studies of natural resources, but will require an operational method for converting image digital number (dn) to the temporally comparable surface reflectance factor (rho (s lambda)). A refinement to the empirical line (EL) approach for reflectance factor retrieval (RFR) from the Landsat-5 and -7 TM and ETM+ has been proposed. The refined empirical line (REL) approach requires only one within-scene calibration target, minimal field measurements of that target, and a reasonable estimate of dn for rho (s lambda) = 0 using a radiative transfer model or values provided by this analysis. This study showed that the REL approach worked well for a 10-year Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ image set in Arizona and rho (s lambda) was retrieved with an estimated accuracy of 0.01. A quantitative approach was proposed to determine the suitability of a within-scene target for the REL approach, and based on historical measurements, a variety of targets met the size and brightness requirements for the REL approach. This operational approach for RFR should encourage long-term investigations of natural resources to answer critical questions regarding resource management and effects of climate changes.

AB A new FLIDAR was designed for remote quantitative assessment of epidermal W absorption of leaves and canopies from chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (ChlF) measurements. The dual-excitation fluorescence light detection and ranging (DE-FLIDAR) performs a dual excitation of the Chi present in leaves, in the UV (355 nm) and visible (532 nm) part of the spectrum, the latter being used as a reference excitation not absorbed by the epidermis. Therefore, the epidermal UV absorption of vegetation can be estimated from the Chi fluorescence excitation ratio (FER). PhiF(532)/PhiF(355). Thanks to the alternated excitation by the DE-FLIDAR, the FER is immune to natural conditions in field, such as light-induced variable ChlF and leaf movement (variation of the angle of excitation). The DE-FLIDAR was used to investigate the presence of UV-absorbing compounds in individual leaves and canopies of different plant species, tobacco, pea, barley and wheat. The FER was much larger in outdoor-grown plants, indicating an accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds. Wie also analysed the epidermal UV absorption of the adaxial and abaxial side of tobacco leaves of different age. The logarithm of the FER showed a good agreement with the absorbance of methanolic extracts obtained from the same leaves. The presented DE-FLIDAR can perform up to three simultaneous fluorescence measurements; therefore, we could compare blue fluorescence (BR) to the epidermal UV absorption. In addition, a dual ratio. the red fluorescence (RF) to far-red fluorescence (FRF) emission ratio, excited at 355 and 532 nm, was shown to be linearly dependent on the Chi content. A mathematical model of leaf absorption and fluorescence, based on the Beer-Lambert's law, was developed to describe and analyse the fluorescence signatures obtained with the DE-FLIDAR.

AB This article evaluates the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and visible/infrared (VIR) satellite imagery for mapping the extent of standing water in the Peace-Athabasca Delta during spring and summer of 1998 SAR images contain data about the geometric and electrical characteristics of the objects, while VIR images contain information about the reflectivity of objects. Radar pulses can also penetrate vegetation to some degree depending on the wavelength and vegetation thickness. It is hypothesized that since Radarsat and SPOT images contain complementary information, flood mapping will be more efficient when the true image types are used in combination. Radarsat SAR and SPOT multi-spectral imagery from May 1998 and July 1998 were used for the flood mapping. A Radarsat S2 image (27.5 degrees incidence angle) was obtained for May 1998. To evaluate the incidence angle effect on flood mapping, a Radarsat S1 image (27.5 degrees incidence angle) and a Radarsat S7 image (47.0 degrees incidence angle) were obtained for July 1998. The Radarsat scenes were calibrated and filtered, and all imagery were orthorectified to minimize geometric distortion. A Mahala-nobis distance algorithm was used to classify the SPOT scenes, the Radarsat scenes, and a combination of the two into open water flooded vegetation, and nonflooded land The results indicate that flood mapping in both spring and summer conditions has significantly higher accuracy when Radarsat and SPOT imagery are used in combination, rather than separately. However, it is important to use Radarsat imagery acquired at low incidence angles. Classification of the SPOT scene combined with the Radarsat S1 scene achieved significantly better results than those obtained when the SPOT scene was classified in combination with the Radarsat S7 scene.

AB We demonstrate the potential of the C-band Vertically polarized transmission, vertically-polarised reception (VV) polarized European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to provide a capability for forest mapping with particular regard to forest degradation caused by pollution near the Severonikel smelter in the Kola Peninsula, Northern Russia. ERS SAR images covering the period from summer 1993 to summer 1995 are analyzed, and it is shown that a combination of acquisitions from summer and winter reveals areas of forest destruction, driven mainly by the summer (May) acquisition. The damaged forest is approximately the same brightness as undamaged forest is approximately the same brightness as undamaged forest in the winter but is found to be approximately 3 dB brighter in the summer. Regions of forest that have been damaged by wildfire are indistinguishable from the pollution-damaged areas. The physical basis for these observations is highlighted using a combination of knowledge of the in situ conditions and theoretical modeling. Destruction of the vegetation canopy (associated with pollution or fire) makes the radar measurements sensitive to the state of the underlying ground. During early summer (the principal time of snowmelt) a rough and wet snow surface causes an increase in backscattering coefficient in areas where the forest canopy has been destroyed. The modeling is also extended to alternative polarizations to study the potential of future Synthetic Aperture Radars, such as the Advanced SAR to be carried on board Envisat, and other systems to enhance this mapping capability.

AB Rainfall interception by vegetation is a major component in the hydrological balance at the land surface. Small-scale variations in rainfall interception occur when both rainfall and land surface are highly variable. A key parameter of interception is the amount of rain stored on vegetation. As radar backscatter is strongly influenced by the free-water content of vegetation, SAR remote sensing might be applied to analyze large-scale rainfall interception. We concentrated in this study on C-band radar and rainfall storage in forests. The backscatter sensitivity to wetness is simulated with a radiative transfer model, which has been modified to describe the changes in dimension and dielectric constant of leaves and needles due to wetting. The simulations indicate that backscatter may decrease when a sparse coniferous forest is wetted, while the backscatter of a closed forest is found to increase with 1-4 dB due to rain storage. Thus, the sensitivity to storage strongly depends on the type of forest. The simulations are empirically tested by analyzing two sets of successive SAR image pairs from the ERS tandem mission. Given the short time between these measurements, it is argued that backscatter changes are caused mainly by changes in rain storage. The observed backscatter change is compared with wetness change estimated by a stand are hydrological model using ground-based rain radar observations as input. The observed backscatter change between a wet and a dry forest varied between 0.7 dB and 2.5 dB, in the range of the simulations. It is concluded that C-band SAR is sensitive to forest wetness, although for a quantitative assessment of water storage on forest additional information on a least forest structure is needed.

TI Measurement and modeling of the spectral and directional reflection

AB Both spectral and directional reflection characteristics of terrestrial surfaces are of interest for remote sensing applications. We report on detailed laboratory measurements of the Cladina stellaris and Flavocetraria nivalis lichens and the Racomitrium lanuginosum moss canopies carried out at the European Goniometer facility at the Joint Research Center, Ispra, Italy, we present bidirectional reflectance factor data in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared parts of the spectrum. The moss had enhanced backscatter in the visible spectrum and was strongly backscattering in the near-infrared. We successfully fitted the low-dimensional parametric model of Rahman, Pinty, and Verstraete to our experimentally determined bidirectional reflectance factors. By means of cross-validation, we assessed the number of randomly sampled data points necessary to guarantee reliable model inversions. We found that approximately 100 measurement points were needed for our experimental data. Finally, we applied bootstrap techniques to show that the root-mean-square modeling error was as low as 5.7% for our chosen targets and model. Our findings, combined with digital elevation models and atmospheric radiative transfer models, may result in enhanced detection of lichens from optical satellite data. The complete dataset is available from the first author. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This article proposes, through a joint analysis of a range of satellite data sets, a regional approach to the assessment of forest cover of Central Africa and a continuously updated information base on which to build a monitoring system. The following landscapes are described in detail: lowland rain forest, swamp forest, secondary formations, forest-savanna mosaic, and plantations. The separability between the vegetation types is thus established for the sensors available at a regional scale (AVHRR, ATSR, ERS-1 SAR) and over a broad range of ecotones. The performances of the different sensors illustrate the complementarity of the presently available remote sensing techniques. A regional vegetation map was produced of a part of the Congo Basin covering about 20 million ha by the combination of the best sensors used in the present study. Each vegetation type is mapped with the most appropriate sensor in terns of spectral behavior and spatial resolution. AVHRR data are used for the distinction between forest and savanna and for overall ecosystem monitoring, ATSR data have been showed appropriate for mapping the secondary forests, while ERS SAR data are reliable for mapping the gallery-forests, the plantations, and the swamp forests. A contingency matrix has been computed between the synthetic vegetation map and the national forest map of Congo-Kinshasa. The overall source of difference is related to the confusion between lowland rain forest and swamp forest. The combination of these sensors contributes thus to a new product, the thematic content and spatial detail of which has never been achieved before at the regional level.

AB The Montreal Process indicators are intended to provide a common framework for assessing and reviewing progress toward sustainable forest management. The potential of a combined geometrical-optical/spectral mixture analysis model was assessed for mapping the Montreal Process age class and successional age indicators at a regional scale using Landsat Thematic data. The project location is an area of eucalyptus forest in Emu Creek State Forest, Southeast Queensland, Australia. A quantitative model relating the spectral reflectance of a forest to the illumination geometry, slope, and aspect of the terrain surface and the size, shape, and density, and canopy size. Inversion of this model necessitated the use of spectral mixture analysis to recover subpixel information on the fractional extent of ground scene elements (such as sunlit canopy, shaded canopy, sunlit background, and shaded background). Results obtained fron a sensitivity analysis allowed improved allocation of resources to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. It was found that modeled estimates of crown cover projection, canopy size, and tree densities had significant agreement with field and air photo-interpreted estimates. However, the accuracy of the successional stage classification was limited. The results obtained highlight the potential for future integration of high and moderate spatial resolution-imaging sensors for monitoring forest structure and condition.

TI Estimating error in an analysis of forest fragmentation change using
   North American Landscape Characterization (NALC) data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID PATTERN; DIVERSITY; IMAGES
AB We describe an approach for estimating measurement error in an analysis of forest fragmentation dynamics. We classified North American Landscape Characterization (NALC) images in four path-row: locations in the Upper Midwest to characterize changing patterns of forest cover. To estimate error, we calculated the differences in values of forest fragmentation metrics for overlapping scene pairs from the same time frame (or epoch). The overlapping image areas were subdivided into landscape partitions. We tested the effects of amount of forest co:er, landscape phenology, atmospheric variability (e.g., haze and clouds), and alternative processing approaches on the consistency of metric values calculated for the same place and approximate time but from different images. Two of the metrics tested (average patch size and number of patches) were more sensitive to image characteristics and contained more measurement error in a change detection analysis than the others (percent forest cover and edge density). Increasing the landscape partition size moderately reduced the amount of an-or in landscape change analysis, but at the cost of reduced spatial resolution. Processes used to generalize the forest map, such as small-polygon sieving and majority filtering, were not found to consistently decrease measurement error in metric values and in some cases increased error. Predictive models of error in a forest fragmentation change analysis were developed and significantly explained up to 50% of the variation in error. We demonstrate how, in a change analysis, predicted error can be used to identify locations that exhibit change substantially greater than the error in value estimation.

AB Sixteen landcover classes in a representative Swedish environment were analyzed and classified using one Landsat TM scene and seven ERS-1 SARPRI images acquired during 1993. Spectral and backscattering signature separabilities are analyzed using the Jeffries-Matusita distance measure to determine which combinations of channels/images contained the most information. Maximum likelihood, sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP, a Bayesian image segmentation algorithm), and back propagation neural network classification algorithms were applied and their performances evaluated. Results of the separability analyses indicated that the multitemporal SAR data contained more separable landcover information than did the multispectral TM data; the highest separabilities were achieved when the TM and SAR data were combined. Classification accuracy evaluation results indicate that the SMAP algorithm out-performed the maximum likelihood algorithm which, in turn, outperformed the neural network algorithm. The best KAPPA values, using combined data, were 0.495 for SMAP, 0.0445 for maximum likelihood, and 0.432 for neural network. Corresponding overall accuracy values were 57.1%, 52.4%, and 51.2%, respectively. A comparison between lumped crop area statistics with areal sums calculated from the classified satellite data gave the highest correspondence where the SMAP algorithm was used, followed by the maximum likelihood and neural network algorithms. Based on our application, we can therefore confirm the value of a multisource optical/SAR approach for analyzing landcover and the improvements to classification achieved using the SMAP algorithm.

AB A reliable estimation of primary production of terrestrial ecosystems is often a prerequisite for land survey and management, while being important also in ecological and climatological studies. At a regional scale, grassland primary production estimates are increasingly being made with the use of satellite data. In a currently used approach, regional gross, net, and aboveground net primary productivity (GPP, NPP, and ANPP) are derived from the parametric model of Monteith and are calculated as the product of the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (f(APAR)) and gross, net, and aboveground net production (radiation-use) efficiencies (epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an)); f(APAR) being derived from indices calculated from satellite-measured reflectances in the red and near infrared. The accuracy and realism of the primary production values estimated by this approach therefore largely depend on an accurate estimation of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an). However, data are scarce for production efficiencies of semiarid grasslands, and their time and spatial variations are poorly documented, often leading to large errors for the estimates. In this paper, a modelling approach taking into account relevant ecosystem processes and based on extensive field data was used to estimate time variations of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an) of a shortgrass site in Arizona. These variations were explained by variations in plant water stress, temperature, leaf aging, and processes such as a respiration and changes in allocation pattern between above- and below-ground compartments. Over the 3 study years, averaged values of epsilon(g), epsilon(n), and epsilon(an) were found to be 1.92, 0.74, and 0.29 g DM (MJ IPAR)(-1), respectively. epsilon(g) and epsilon(n) exhibited large interannual and seasonal variations mainly due to changes in water limitations during the growing season. Interannual variations of epsilon(an) were much less important. However, for shorter periods, epsilon(an) exhibited very contrasting values from regrowth to senescence. The calculation of ANPP seems less prone to errors due to environmental effects when computed on an annual basis. When estimating GPP and NPP, better results are expected if water limitations are taken into account. This could be possible through the estimation of water-stress factor by using surface temperature or other indices derived from thermal infrared remote sensing data. The limitations due to temporally varying efficiencies, shown here for shortgrass ecosystems, are also relevant to all drought-exposed ecosystems, particularly those with abundant evergreen or perennial species.

AB This article presents a set of techniques developed to classify land cover on a per-parcel (herein termed per-field) basis by integrating fine spatial resolution simulated satellite sensor imagery with digital vector data. Classification, based on the spectral and spatial properties of the imagery, was carried out on a per-pixel basis. The resulting classified images were then integrated with vector data to classify on a per-field basis. Four tools were adopted or developed to increase the accuracy and utility of the per-field classification and a fifth was proposed. The spectral variability within agricultural fields resulted in misclassification within the per-pixel classification. Mixed land cover in urban areas also resulted in misclassification. A low pass smoothing filter and a "texture" filter applied to the per-pixel classified image increased the classification accuracy of this land cover prior to per-field classification. The flexibility of the integration process enabled the exploitation of spectral and spatial variation between pixels within individual parcels to produce new classes during per-field classification and to identify fields with a high likelihood of misclassification.

AB Thermal infrared remote sensing has proved its usefulness in various environmental applications, including the evaluation of surface heat fluxes exchanged between the continental biosphere and the lower atmosphere. The concept of a minisatellite IRSUTE, has been evaluated. It is designed to allow the derivation of accurate (+/-50 W m(-2) or +/-0.8 mm/d water evaporation) estimates of surface heat flux at the field scale (near 40 m). Such estimates will be useful for meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural studies. The instrument will also be useful for environmental monitoring, for example, frost mapping forest fires, volcano activity, thermal pollution., etc. The IRSUTE concept has been further elaborated by conducting scientific studies (modeling canopy radiative temperature, method for flux estimation, ergodicity problem, emissivity of natural surfaces, correction of atmospheric effect), by analyzing methodological aspects (definition of pixel size, overpass time, time repeat cycle, analysis of angular effects) and system specification (superposition error and MTF effects assessment). These studies have resulted in the definition of a feasible instrument corresponding to the minisatellite category (95 kg), with a high spatial resolution (40 m), four bands in the thermal infrared domain (3.5-4.0 mu m and three bands between 8.2 mu m and 11.0 mu m, with two options), a 1-day revisit, corresponding to an orbite altitude of 540 km. The narrow ground swath (40 km) precludes a global coverage; as a result IRSUTE will focus on a set of test-sites. The phase A study is now complete. The main elements of lR-SUTE are defined. This article describes the IRSUTE mission characteristics and the main experimental results which led to the chosen specifications. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

ID REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; SPECTROSCOPY; CALIFORNIA; ROCKS
AB Imaging spectrometer (hyperspectral) data, field spectral measurements, and laboratory analyses were used to quantitatively map the concentration of mineral-bound ammonium (buddingtonite) in hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks in the southern Cedar Mountains, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Mineral-bound ammonium is a product of ion exchange in silicate minerals and has no visible distinguishing characteristics, however, diagnostic infrared spectral features are ideal for identification using both field and airborne/spaceborne spectrometers. Establishment of a laboratory- or field-based geochemical calibration is presently a prerequisite to quantitative mapping. For this study, ammonium content of rock samples was determined by chemical analysis and reflectance spectra were measured on whole-rock samples. A linear relation was found between ammonium concentration and the depth of a 2.12 mu m ammonium absorption feature in buddingtonite. An image-map of ammonium concentration in ppm was derived (AVIRIS) data by applying the linear calibration to the AVIRIS reflectance-calibrated spectrum at each pixel. Field spectral measurements, made with a PIMA field spectrometer on a 40 m grid, were used to create a ground-truth concentration map that confirmed the AVIRIS results. Field mapping, X-ray diffraction, and petrologic studies performed in conjunction with the AVIRIS analysis show that buddingtonite is the dominant ammonium mineral in the southern Cedar Mountains, that the ammonium is located along northeast-trending basin and range normal faults, and that it is restricted to two of four crystal-rich rhyolitic tuff units of Oligocene age. This study establishes that remote geochemical mapping using imaging spectrometer data is possible, and presents a methodology that could be extended to quantitatively map other minerals that have absorption features in the short-wave infrared.

ID HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER; WINDOW
AB In 1992 Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data were acquired front the NASA C-130 aircraft over the Sahelian region of West Africa as part of the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel (HAPEX). TIMS measures the radiation front the surface modified by the atmosphere in six channels located be between 8 min and 12.5 mu m in the thermal infrared. By using a variety of techniques it is possible to extract both the surface temperature and surface emissivity front the areas over which TIMS data were acquired. One such technique was tested with the data aquired during this experiment. Several TIMS images of both the east and Ic;est central sites on 2 and 4 September were processed, mid the spectral behaviors of different land cover types were determined. These included tiger bush, millet, and fallow grassland sites. There was a 5-10 K difference ii the brightness temperature over the six channels Ir;hen significant bare soil was visible. Channels 1-3 (8.2-9.4 mu m) were cooler than the longer wavelength channels (9.6-12.5 mu m), which is characteristic of soils rich in quartz. These differences in brightness were converted to emissivity differences using the max-milt difference (MMD) method. This method relies on an empirical relationship observed between the range of emissivities and the minimum value for the six TIMS channels. The MMD method was applied iteratively to several entire sce,zes for the east central site on the two days with the interesting results that Channel 5 showed very little spatial variation in emissivity and the short wavelength channels observed substantial regions with emissivities of about 0.8 or le.ss. There is excellent reproducibility when the same area is seen in different lines on the same day. However, there are differences when the same area is seen on the two days especially for the low; emissivity values. Some of these differences may be due to soil moisture differences 2-3%, which were observed for the two days. The observed surface temperatures were in good agreement with other measures, for example, vegetation temperatures agreed well with the measured air temperatures. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

   SCANNER
AB The Helmholtz reciprocity principle is often invoked to derived the didirectional reflectance distribution functions, then the anisotropic function, used for converting satellite radiance measurements into fluxes in Earth radiation budget studies. However, it has seldom been checked by satellite observation. This is only possible using satellites in low but non-Sun-synchronous Earth orbit, and even in this case situations allowing reciprocity verification are rare. The ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation Budget) radiometer on board Meteor-3-07 provided non-Sun-synchronous observations of the Earth from March 1994 to February 1995. Considering only clear-sky desert scenes which may be presumed to be unchanging, enough viewing/illumination geometry pairs to check the reciprocity principle, using reflectances averaged over a small (1.25 degrees x1.25 degrees) study areas can be obtained. We define a normalized reciprocity departure, which is zero when reciprocity is perfectly respected. The distribution of this parameter shows that the reciprocity principle is verified to better than 5% in 75% of the cases (and 1% in a third of the cases). We also define a parameter analogous to the normalized reciprocity departure, measuring anisotrophy of reflectance for arbitrary viewing/illumination geometry pairs, which would be zero for Lambertian reflection. Comparing the distributions of these parameters with the normalized reciprocity departure, we show that the reciprocal viewing/illumination geometry pairs are very distinct from the arbitrary pairs. This confirmation of the Helmholtz reciprocity principle reinforces our confidence in using it to construct anisotropic reflectance function from measurements for which not all viewing or illumination geometries are sampled.

This article presents a technique that integrates two significant data sets relating to agricultural land-use, namely, survey-based production statistics and vegetation growth profiles derived from satellite data. The article describes an application of this technique in which production data from an administrative survey ar used to constrain tghe classification of NDVI profiles of land cover classes. Because the technique reallocates aggregated production statistics consistent with low-resolution imagery and with limited ground control information, it is a particularly cost-effective method of extensive land-use mapping.

AB A global picture of wave damping by rain (WDBR), a phenomenon familiar to seafarers for centuries, has been so far unavailable owing to the fact that neither rules nor tools exist for its systematic measurement. The situation has changed following the launch of the first dual-frequency (5.3 GHz and 13.6 GHz) radar altimeter TOPEX, along with the three-frequency (18 GHz, 21 GHz, and 37 GHz) radiometer TMR (TOPEX Microwave Radiometer). In this study, a scheme for detecting possible WDBR using TOPEX/TMR data is proposed. The geographical distribution of identified WDBR is consistent with the simultaneous presence of high sea state and intensive rainfall. Frequent occurrences of WDBR are observed in the midlatitude of the two hemispheres, particularly in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, WDBR rarely occurs in the majority of the tropical and subtropical oceans. The global seasonality of WDBR is found to be weak as a result of the hemispheric phase opposition of sea state and rainfall in their annual variations. Knowledge of spatial distribution and temporal variation of WDBR is useful in dealing with potential systematic biases in satellite wind and wave measurements due to rain/sea interaction. It would have been interesting to compare the WDBR with coincident estimates of global rainfall from the SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave/Imager). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID ADJUSTED VEGETATION INDEX; SPLIT-WINDOW TECHNIQUE; WATER-VAPOR CONTENT;
   EMISSIVITY
AB A knowledge of land surface temperature (LST) is strongly required for many applications, notably agrometerology, climate, and environmental studies. Satellite remote sensing in the infrared provides an interesting alternative for the global and continuous measurements of this parameter. Two main problems arise in the use of remote sensing data for evaluation of LST. These are the atmospheric effect and the land emissivity effect. Different algorithms have been developed to correct these two effects. In this work we present the results of a comparative test of LST algorithms. We have used AVHRR images corresponding to a flat homogeneous region characterized by the presence of natural grassland with patches of bare soil. The images cover different seasons, thus allowing for changes in surface emissivity due to changes in vegetation cover. The results show that the Ulivieri et al. algorithms and the Price algorithm are statistically indistinguishable, according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These two algorithms provide LST estimates close to surface temperature used as ground data. We have tested also the algorithm proposed by Kerr et al., which uses a ''surrogate'' for the emissivity, the NDVI based on the visible and near-infrared radiances measured by the AVHRR firsts two channels. The use of this approach provides results close to the Ulivieri et al. algorithm. Thus suggesting the convenience of this method that does not require previous emissivity estimates. Alternative formulations for the vegetation index has been also tested with the Kerr et al. algorithm, but the best results correspond to the use of NDVI. A study of the error propagation in the different algorithms due to errors in land surface emissivity hs been also performed. The results of this study indicated that the minimum error propagation corresponds to the Ulivieri et al. algorithm while the Price algorithm presents the maximum one. The error propagation shows a thermal dependence for all the tested algorithms except for the Ulivieri et al. algorithm. This thermal dependence is very important for Prata and Platt algorithm.

AB When examining a remotely sensed signal through various scale changes, what is the most appropriate upscaling technique to represent this signal at different scales? And how can this be validated? Solutions to these questions were approached by examining how the 660 nm signal of six forest stands vary through four different scales of same-sensor imagery, four traditional resampling techniques, and a new object-specific resampling technique. Analysis of the original and modeled datasets suggests that appropriately upscaled imagery represents a more accurate scene-model than an image obtained at the upscaled resolution. Results further indicate the need for a multiscale approach to feature extraction and upscaling, as no single spatial resolution of imagery appears optimal for detecting or upscaling the varying sized, shaped, and spatially distributed objects within a scene. By employing the human eye as a model, we describe a novel object-specific approach for addressing this challenge. Upscaling evaluation is based on visual interpretation, an understanding of the applied resampling theories, and the root mean square error results of 6000 samples collected from a 10 m CASI scene, and from 1.5 m, 3 m, and 5 m same site CASI images upscaled to 10 m. Potential application of this object-specific approach in hierarchical ecosystem modeling is also briefly described. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB A study was performed to evaluate various techniques for estimating aboveground woody plant biomass in pine stands found in the southeastern United States, using C- and L- band multiple polarization radar imagery collected by the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) system. The biomass levels present in the test stands ranged between 0.0 and, 44.5 kg m(-2). Two SIR-C data sets were used: one collected in April, 1994, when the soil conditions were very wet and the canopy was slightly wet from dew and a second collected in October, 1994, when the soils and canopy were dry. During the October mission, pine needles were completely flushed and the foliar biomass was twice as great in the forest stands as in April. Four methods were evaluated to estimate total biomass: one including a straight multiple linear correlation between total biomass and the various SIR-C channels; another including a ratio of the L-band HV/C-band HV channels; and two others requiring multiple steps, where linear regression equations for different stand components (height, basal area, and crown or branch biomass) were used as the basis for estimating total biomass. lt was shown that the data collected in October (dry soil conditions) were better for estimation of biomass than the data collected in April (wet soil conditions). Overall, a multistep approach resulted in the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors (5.91 kg m(-2)) when biomass levels were (20 kg m(-2)). For all biomass levels, the simple regression technique resulted in the lowest RMS errors (8.1 kg m(-2)). The multiple-step approaches have the additional advantage of being able to provide estimates of different components of stand structure and biomass, such as average tree height, basal area, branch biomass, canopy biomass, trunk biomass, and foliage biomass. The LHV channel is the critical element in all the biomass equations, as would be expected from the body of literature. The addition of other channels-generally, CHV or CHH-significantly improves biomass estimates, whether as a ratio or as additional terms in a regression equation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB In previous work by the authors, multifrequency, polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) data were used to characterize forest categories and biomass density of a forest area in Maine, USA. This study area was included as a test site for ecological studies during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) missions in 1994. The SIR-C/X-SAR missions provided the first opportunity for Earth scientists to receive multifrequency and multipolarization SAR data from space from a single platform. During the Space Radar Laboratory missions in April and October 1994, images from AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR were acquired for the same areas within a few days of each other.
   In this paper, the capabilities of AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR images for characterizing a northern hardwood-boreal transitional forest were evaluated and compared. The use of multiple frequency, polarimetric information to produce forest-cover classification, biomass estimates, and forest spatial pattern analysis were investigated. The results from SIR-C/X-SAR compared with those from AIRSAR were generally similar despite different available frequency (C-band, L-band, X-band vs. C-band, L-band P-band) and resolution (25.0 m vs. 8.3 m).
   AIRSAR data better enabled the mapping of stands of hardwood and mixed: forests than did SIR-C/X-SAR data. However, SIR-C/X-SAR produced better classification results for conifer forest stands. There was no great benefit from using higher resolution for classification except for forest stands in which there were mixtures of species (i.e., hardwood and softwood). A comparison of the image data also showed that both instruments could provide reasonable estimates of biomass density up to about 15 kg/m(2). At higher biomass levels, both AIRSAR and SIR-C showed the well-known biomass saturation effect. The average biomass densities determined from the AIRSAR and SIR-C images were reasonably close at 9.7 kg/m(2) and 9.0 kg/m(2), respectively. Finally, spatial character of the image data was examined by using perimeter and area relations and lacunarity analysis. The results were consistent between. the two instruments and showed that the forest opening patterns were self-similar for openings greater than about 3 ha. (C)Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.

TI Taking into account vegetation effects to estimate soil moisture from
   C-band radar measurements
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Estimation of surface soil moisture is one of the major potential applications of radar remote sensing. The European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS 1 and 2) are equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar working at C-Band (5 Ghz) using a rather low incidence angle (23 degrees). For this frequency and angle, the effect of soil roughness and vegetation attenuation are not negligible. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the surface soil moisture using an algorithm that could be valid for the entire year. In this article it is shown, that, for wheat canopy, it is possible to apply an empirical relation for correcting for the effect of vegetation. The proposed algorithm is derived from a data set acquired over several years (from 1988 to 1994) using an airborne radar. It uses a simple cloud model to describe the vegetation attenuation. This algorithm does not need very precise information on. vegetation density and yields a final precision for the moisture content on the order of 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3).

ID SURFACES
AB To differentiate among geological materials and vegetation using thermal infrared spectra, radiometric measurements require corrections for focal temperature variations and reflected radiation. A laboratory technique is described for the determination of spectral emissivity signatures for natural geological samples using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and the self-emission of the scene. The approach described does not require control of the sample temperature. A quantitative assessment of uncertainties is presented. Comparison of the emissivity measurements from natural geological specimens with hemispherical reflectance data gave an average difference of about 0.01 in emissivity, except near strong features of the spectra. The technique is applicable to field measurements of high-emissivity objects.

   COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS AND ADDITIVE MODELING
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEX; BRAZIL
AB Bidirectional reflectance factor determinations in the visible and near-infrared of mineralized laterite samples collected at the surface of the alkaline/ultramafic rocks-carbonatite complex of Maicuru, northern Brazil, were evaluated for iron, phosphate, and titanium content. Nineteen spectra were subjected to principal components analysis in order to get a better insight into the factors affecting spectral discrimination. The spatial distribution in a PCI us. PC2 plot is related to the overall reflectance (albedo) along the PCI axis and to the spectral inversion around 1100 nm along the PC2 axis. The fatter can be characterised by any spectral ratio of reflectance values taken before and after the inversion wavelength. Two major groups were thus identified: titanium-rich (anatase, ilmenite) laterites and aluminum phosphate laterites. The former presented spectra with low to intermediate albedos and lower near-infrared/visible and very near-infrared reflectance ratio values. The phosphate-rich samples presented intermediate to high albedos and higher reflectance ratios. Titaniferous laterites have a greater content of opaques than the phosphates which are usually richer in iron oxides. The presence of titanium lowers the albedo whereas iron oxides absorb only in the visible and very near-infrared. Binary mixtures of Fe2O3 and carbon provided spectral variations analogous to the ones observed in the titaniferous laterites. Such modeling helped in evaluating the effects of opaques. As a practical result, a band radiometer could conceivably identify the titanium mineralized areas in the field.

TI RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION OF GOES-7 VISSR SOLAR CHANNELS DURING THE GOES
   PATHFINDER BENCHMARK PERIOD
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SATELLITE SENSORS; AVHRR; OCEAN; NOAA-7
AB The GOES-7 VISSR solar channels are radiometrically calibrated for the period from June 1987 through November 1988. Space, White Sands, and the Sonora Desert are used as calibration targets. Three different calibrations were performed: 1) using the stretched data (i.e., retransmitted data operationally destriped using NOAA's normalization procedure) and considering individual VISSR detectors separately, 2) using the stretched data averaged over the eight VISSR detectors; and 3) using the stretched data further destriped according to Simpson et al. (1995) and then averaged over the eight VISSR detectors. The third approach provides the best results (i.e., best equalization of the detectors). Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the VISSR radiance, using separate calibration coefficients for each detector (first approach) may not reduce the striping significantly. The calibration coefficients exhibit low frequency changes that are not correlated with seasonal variations in the extraterrestrial solar irradiance. High frequency fluctuations are large, and they are due in part,to NOAA's normalization procedure and to calibration uncertainties. Differences between the calibration coefficients of individual detectors also are large, as well as changes between consecutive VISSR acquisition times. Comparison of untampered (retransmitted data but not operationally destriped using NOAA's normalization procedure) ''Wednesday'' 1848 GMT data with stretched 1831 and 1901 GMT data indicates that NOAA's normalization procedure, though imperfect, reduces substantially the stripes present in the unstretched data. There is evidence, however, that NOAA's normalization procedure introduced artificial variations in the count squared of the targets that in one instance resulted in 30% lower calibration coefficients. The average calibration coefficients are generally higher by 15% than the values of Rossow et al. (1992); they are in better agreement with the values of Abel et al. (1992) and Whitlock et al. (1994). It is recommended that the radiometric calibration of the VISSR solar channels should be performed as frequently as possible (every day). Though the stripes in the VISSR data transmitted to Wallops Island should be reduced for operational, real-time purposes (eg., weather analysis and forecast), the original unnormalized data should be archived for subsequent use in quantitative, scientific applications.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Note
AB A case study thai shows a malfunction of the water vapor channel at 1.38 mu m to detect cirrus clouds is presented in this article. A combination of elevation, vegetation coverage, water vapor content, and albedo characteristics (mostly governed by the terrain) are the major factors affecting cirrus cloud detection. Using the criteria of relative low radiance and high signal-to-noise ratio amongst several targets and across the 1.84-1.92 mu m spectral region, the 1.8489-mu m channel was found to more effectively mask ground signals than the 1.3827-mu m channel. Over targets having moderate elevation, dry conditions, minimal vegetation, and high albedos, both spectra regions present significant ground signals that can mistakenly be attributed to cirrus cloud particles. It is strongly recommended that for accurate cirrus cloud detection, both spectral regions around 1.38 mu m and 1.88 mu m be examined along with the above-mentioned factors.

AB The influence of pixel heterogeneity, background, atmospheric and bidirectional effects on the relationship between fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the photosynthesizing tissue in a canopy (FAPAR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is investigated using a three-dimensional model of radiation transfer. Top of the canopy (TOC) NDVI and FAPAR increase with ground cover and plant leaf area. Their functional response to leaf orientation, solar zenith angle and atmospheric optical depth is similar. For instance, planophile canopies (mostly horizontal leaves) have a higher FAPAR and TOC NDVI than erectophile canopies (mostly erect leaves). However, FAPAR and TOC NDVI respond differently to other parameters such as soil reflectance and leaf optical properties. For example, an increase in soil reflectance increases FAPAR but decreases TOC NDVI. Atmospheric and bidirectional effects confound the interpretation of top of the atmosphere (TOA) NDVI. The transmissivity of NDVI, defined as the ratio TOA/TOC NDVI, decreases with increasing atmospheric turbidity and solar zenith angle. Sensing about the nadir directions under clear sky conditions and moderate solar incidence angles can result in transmissivities as high as 0.8. There are sufficient causal grounds for relating FAPAR to NDVI. The relationship is independent of pixel heterogeneity, parameterized here with ground cover, plant leaf area, and variations in leaf orientation and optical properties. On the other hand, the relationship is sensitive to background, atmospheric, and bidirectional effects. A simple linear model relating FAPAR to TOC NDVI is proposed, and its validity is discussed.

TI REMOTE-SENSING AND THE MEASUREMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL ENTITIES IN A
   FORESTED ENVIRONMENT .2. THE OPTIMAL SPATIAL-RESOLUTION
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALE; CLASSIFICATION
AB The prime objective of this study was to propose and test a method to identify the optimal spatial resolutions for detection and discrimination of coniferous classes in a temperate forested environment. The approach is based on the paradigm that there is an intricate relationship between the definition and the measurement of geographical entities and implies the following steps: 1) a priori define the geographical entities under investigation, 2) determine an optimization criterion for the choice of a sampling system, 3) progressively aggregate data acquired from a fine spatial sampling grid, 4) apply the optimization criterion on the series of spatially aggregated data, and 5) verify the validity of the results obtained in relation to the goal of the study. Airborne MEIS-II data, acquired at 0.5 m in eight spectral bands of the visible spectrum, were used for the study. Fourteen forest classes, at the stand level, were defined on the basis of four attributes: species, density, height, and organization of the trees. Representative sites for each forest class were selected. From the center of each site, the spatial resolution of the original data was degraded to 29.5 m, with an increment of 1 m, using an averaging window algorithm. The intraclass variance was calculated for each forest class, at every spatial resolution and for the eight spectral bands. The minimal variance was used as the indicator of the optimal spatial resolution. To evaluate the importance of the optimal resolution for class discrimination, a bivariate test of variance was performed for each pair of forest class considered at their optimal spatial resolution. Profiles of spectral separability were also established in relation to the whole series of spatial resolutions. The results show that, for all coniferous classes and for the eight spectral bands considered in the study, there is a minimal value in intraclass variance that indicates the optimal spatial resolution for each class, varying between 2.5 and 21.5 m. The optimal spatial resolution is primarily affected by the spatial and structural parameters of the forest stands. The analysis of variance between each pair of forest classes considered at their respective optimal spatial resolution reveals that all classes are significantly different in at least two spectral bands, except for 10 pairs. The spectral separability of the forest classes is at a maximum at, or very close to, their optimal spatial resolution. The study confirms the validity of the concept of optimal spatial resolution and proposes an original solution to the problem of the adequate scale of measurement for geographical entities.

AB Landsat TM data may be of use for forest timber and vitality monitoring. Literature study reveals inconsistent results of techniques based on spectral indices and regression. Existing models appear incomplete because they do not account for shadowing between trees, or because they treat trees as opaque bodies. For this reason a new forest light interaction model has been developed. It accounts for both shadowing and crown transparency. The inverse model has been implemented as an image processing algorithm. Model results are studied and compared with ground data from the Kootwijk forest in The Netherlands. Results indicate that the model gives a fair representation of reality. In this respect, the utility of the NDVI is also discussed. More research is necessary for further validation.

AB Several techniques that use multiple off-nadir view angles taken in a single azimuth plane (called a string of data) to estimate hemispherical reflectance have been developed.  The range of view angles that is required in order to obtain accurate inferences of hemispherical reflectance using string techniques was studied as applicable to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the High Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (HIRIS).  Full and half strings out to 60-degrees, 45-degrees, 30-degrees, and 15-degrees were tested on ground data of a wide range of cover types and sun angles.  Both a visible and near infrared band (AVHRR Bands 1 and 2) were tested using a knowledge-based system called VEG.  Using string techniques that calculate a single coefficient from an internal spectral data base, the results showed small errors for the full string +/- 60-degrees (less than 4% error), HIRIS like data (less than 5% error), and MODIS like data (less than 7% error).  Much larger errors occur in those cases where long extrapolations must be calculated (e.g., strings to only 15-degrees and 30-degrees).  Systems that view fore and aft out to 60-degrees would be desirable to minimize errors, assuming atmospheric corrections could be made at these angles.  HIRIS (views 60-degrees in forward and 30-degrees in aft directions) is a good compromise by viewing out to 60-degrees in only one direction and increases the error by approximately 2% or less.  MODIS (full string +/- 45-degrees) still has a relatively small error of approximately 5% or less.  Sensor systems capable of only viewing in the fore or aft directions (half strings) as opposed to both directions (full strings) greatly increase the error.

AB Monitoring techniques for deriving cirrus information over the ocean using polarimetric measurements from satellite are studied. Radiance and degree of linear polarization of the upwelling radiation at the top of a model atmosphere-ocean system are computed at the wavelength of 0.88-mu-m with the aid of the doubling-adding method, and where cirrus cloud is assumed to be composed of water droplets or randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals (columns and plates). The computational results show, in particular, the following features. Degree of polarization observed at the Brewster angle in the solar plane is suitable to derive cloud optical thickness (tau) for large solar zenith angles, particularly in the case of tau < approximately 5 while the radiance off the sunglint is suitable to infer tau in the range of tau < approximately 30. However, for improvement of accuracy, cloud information such as thermodynamic phase, size distribution, and shape of cloud particles should be separately obtained, in particular for utilization of degree of polarization. The difference of degree of polarization appears between water particles and hexagonal ice crystals at the top of the atmosphere when the scattering angle is within 50-100-degrees. Using this property, it should be possible to distinguish the thermodynamic phase of cloud particles. Furthermore, the feasibility of discrimination of the shape of the hexagonal ice crystals using the position of the neutral point is discussed, where phase angle is shown to shift to the backscattering direction at tau < 10. Hence, it is necessary to obtain tau separately.

TI THE USE OF SPOT DATA FOR WAVE ANALYSIS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB After recalling the various techniques used for wave measurement, this paper concentrates on the possibilities of using SPOT data for large scale wave analysis. Conditions for good wave pattern visibility are discussed from a theoretical point of view. In order to check the theory, examination of a large number of SPOT images was performed concerning the relation between viewing conditions and image quality. Using spectral analysis, a comparison is achieved using available simultaneous in situ directional data and SPOT images of an off-shore area in Brittany, France. Major conclusions are that both types of data compare rather well and that SPOT data could be used effectively in the coastal zone, provided that a proper software is designed to process small spatial windows. Recommendations are given for image acquisition procedure.

ID HAPEX-MOBILHY; LAND-SURFACES; EVAPORATION; CHANNELS
AB The Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) was flown on the NASA C-130 aircraft for series of a 12 flights during the HAPEX experiment in the Southwest of France during 1986.  TIMS provides coverage of the 8-12-mu-m thermal infrared band in six contiguous channels so that it is possible to observe the spectral behaviour of the surface emissivity over this wavelength interval.  The surfaces observed ranged from bare soils to coniferous forest.  As expected the fully vegetated fields, a small lake, and a coniferous forest exhibited little or no spectral variation.  However, the bare soil surfaces had a 5-10-degrees-C difference in radiant temperature over the TIMS channels with the three shorter wavelength channels (8.0-mu-m < lambda < 9.6-mu-m) having lower temperatures than the three longest wavelength channels.  This qualitatively agrees with laboratory measurements done by a group from the Universite Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg on soil samples from this area.  The quantitative agreement of the relative variation after correcting for atmospheric effects is good, but does depend on the day and location of the sample in the field.  This spectral variation arises from the absorption of infrared radiation due to the stretching vibrations of the silicon - oxygen bonds of silicates in the soil.  These results indicate that the longer wavelength channels in the 8-12-mu-m band may be preferable for surface temperature sensing for soils rich in silicates.

AB Vegetation indices (VI), such as greenness (GVI), perpendicular (PVI), transformed soil adjusted (TSAVI), and normalized difference (NDVI), measure the photosynthetic size of plant canopies and portend yields.  A set of equations, called spectral components analysis (SCA), that interrelates VI or cumulative seasonal VI (SIGMA-VI), leaf area index (L), fractional photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR, dimensionless), cumulative daily PAR energy absorbed (SIGMA-APAR, MJ / m2), above-ground dry photomass (DM, g / m2), and economic yield (Y, g / m2) are presented and used to analyze data from two studies conducted in 1989.  In one study we made boll counts and percent plant cover measurements in a salt-affected cotton field on 60 m grid intervals and calculated GVI, PVI, TSAVI, and NDVI at the grid intersections for SPOT-1 HRV and videography scenes.  The four VI from SPOT accounted for more of the variation in the lint yield estimated from the boll counts (75-76%) than those from videography (61-63%), but VI from the different systems each accounted for 67% of the variation in plant cover.  All relations were linear.  In the other study, reflectance factors and FPAR were measured periodically during the season in corn planted at three densities (7.7, 5.4, and 3.1 plants / m2).  FPAR could be estimated from NDVI and PVI, respectively, by FPAR = -0.344 +0.229 exp(1.95 NDVI) (r2 = 0.973) and FPAR = 0.015 + 0.036(PVI) (r2 = 0.956).  Methods of obtaining FPAR and their effect on the efficiency of conversion of APAR to DM are illustrated and discussed.  The data demonstrate how SCA unifies and strengthens the scientific basis of VI interpretations.

AB A truck-mounted Ku-, C-, and L-band scatterometer system was used to obtain diurnal multiparameter radar backscatter measurements of wheat in August 1987 and June and July 1988.  Concurrent field measurements of plant and soil moisture content were made in support of the radar data.  Analyses of these data demonstrate the sensitivity of the microwave signals to the daily movement of water in the soil / plant system.  The dependence of frequency, incidence angle, and polarization are discussed in relationship to the diurnal and seasonal changes in the soil and plant water content.  The results are used to identify potential agronomic applications and future research requirements.

AB Accurate observations of river water surface elevation (WSE) are critical for hydrodynamic (HD) model calibration in poorly gauged regions. This study presents a new river WSE retrieval approach that combines ICESat-2 derived cross-sections and Sentinel-2 observed sub-pixel river widths to achieve an effective HD model calibration. The unknown channel Manning coefficient, river bed elevation and cross-sectional shape in the HD model are calibrated simultaneously through a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The complete workflow is implemented in a flood-prone reach in Yiluo River basin. Results show that the WSE retrieved by the new approach has a higher spatiotemporal resolution in narrower rivers than that of Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies from 0.25 to 0.59 m against in-situ WSE. The HD model calibrated by WSE retrieved by the new approach simulates the WSE with RMSE of 0.36 m and the flood extent with critical success index (CSI) of 0.60 in validation, outperforming the results of the HD model calibrated by Sentinel-3 altimetry derived WSE, with corresponding results of 0.49 m and 0.58, respectively. Additional case studies in the Maqu and Lingkou reaches further demonstrate the applicability of the WSE retrieval approach proposed in this study for HD model calibration in different types of rivers. This study highlights the potential of the proposed WSE retrieval approach in HD model calibration to improve flood forecasting in poorly gauged regions.

AB By utilizing single-look complex data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the Doppler centroid anomaly method (DCA) can be employed to determine the velocity of the sea surface current field along the radar line-of-sight direction. However, due to the influence of platform or antenna perturbations, SAR Doppler shift measurements are subject to electromagnetic pointing error (EPE). These errors can typically be reduced by using echo information from land areas (including islands) within the SAR images to correct the Doppler shift. This allows the successful estimation of Doppler shifts due to sea surface factors and, in turn, the retrieval of ocean currents in the radar line-of-sight. However, in cases where SAR images lack data over land, uncorrectable EPE can result in significant inaccuracies in the retrieval of ocean currents. This study utilizes data captured by Sentinel-1A on four orbits in the Florida Strait region of the Gulf Stream from July 2020 to October 2022 to investigate the variation characteristics of EPE. To address the issues of calculating these in SAR images lacking land data, an EPE fitting method is proposed. The correction significantly reduces the error of S1A retrieved current velocity compared with line-of-sight current velocity from the HYCOM model and in situ HF radar, indicating that the proposed method provides an effective way to reduce the impact of EPE in SAR images, even when land is not directly observed.

AB The spatiotemporal distribution and variability of surface water remained poorly known at the pan-Greenland scale, and its dominant features (supraglacial rivers, lakes, and water-filled crevasses) were rarely studied collectively. We present pan-GrIS surface water extent and volume for a relatively cool (2018) and a relatively warm (2019) summer, using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery, a semi-automated multi-scale water extraction algorithm, and the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO). While the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery prevents inclusion of all water-filled crevasses and narrow rivers, our findings include: (1) strong interannual differences are observed in total surface water area (4903km(2) vs. 9988 km(2)), volume (3.5 km(3) vs. 6.8 km(3)), and mean elevation limit (1407 m a.s.l. vs. 1545 m a.s.l.) in response to a low (cool) (265 Gt/yr) and high (warm) (510 Gt/yr) runoff year; (2) large spatial contrasts in surface water extent, volume, elevation limit, and drainage pattern among the eight major GrIS basins; (3) supraglacial rivers dominate GrIS surface water appearance, accounting for 57%/48% of total surface water area/volume, respectively, over the two years (in contrast, water-filled crevasses and supraglacial lakes account for 33%/32% and 10%/20%, respectively); (4) ratio of remotely sensed water volume to RACMO-simulated cumulative surface runoff declines during the cool (2.6%) vs. the warm (1.8%) year; and from north (4.5%) to south (1.1%) Greenland. In summary, this study reveals strong temporal and spatial differences in GrIS surface water extent, volume, and drainage pattern and raises prospects for improved understanding of pan-Greenland Ice Sheet surface hydrology.

AB The ICESat-2 (IS2) ATL07 sea ice height product provides precise and accurate measurements of sea ice height for the polar regions. Although the original ATL07 product classifies the sea ice surface into snow-covered ice and open water (dark leads and specular leads), it has two critical issues: (1) it does not distinguish thin ice (gray ice) from thick/snow-covered ice or open water and (2) it involves uncertainties in the dark lead determination. To address these issues and obtain more accurate lead fraction and freeboard estimation, in this study, we assess a data-driven machine learning approach for sea ice surface type classification from the ATL07 product. A total of 17 IS2 tracks covering the Ross Sea in February, March, September, October, and November 2019 are used in this study. For training and testing the neural network (NN) models, we label the ATL07 data into three surface types: thick/snow-covered sea ice, thin/gray sea ice, and open water based on the coincident Sentinel-2 optical images. We use six variables from the ATL07 data: background rate, photon rate, relative surface height, width of height distribution, number of laser pulses, and difference in mean and median height, with the first three variables found to be the most significant in determining surface types. Our spatiotemporal test shows that the NN models can be applied to the ATL07 dataset with similar to 99% accuracy in the Ross Sea, and the beam test shows that the difference in the accuracy for three beams is negligible. While the current ATL07 product captures only similar to 5% of thin ice and similar to 81% of open water correctly, our NN models capture similar to 90% of both open water and thin ice leads successfully. When we qualitatively assess the surface classification of the NN models by using the coincident optical and radar images, our NN models do not show significant misclassification issues both in the daytime and nighttime and both in the winter and summer seasons. Compared to the IS2 ATL10 sea ice freeboard product, the ability of our NN model to separate thin ice and open water from snow-covered/thick ice is significant in freeboard estimation, especially for winter and highly packed sea ice areas. Open water and thin ice classes also improve mapping lead fraction and floe size distribution.

AB The liquid water contained within plant tissue per ground area is an indicator of plant biomass and related to plant transpiration. In the U.S. Corn Belt this plant water is dominated by water in crop tissue. Microwave remote sensing provides an opportunity to measure crop water at a 30 to 40-km spatial scale across the U.S. Corn Belt. Crop water has been shown to be directly proportional to L-band vegetation optical depth (VOD) through a proportionality constant called the b-parameter. NASA's SMAP satellite uses a static b-parameter of 0.11 for cropland areas, however the b-parameter varies with crop type. This study answers the following research questions. First, does the value of the b-parameter value vary across the U.S. Corn Belt given the observed differences in the proportions of corn and soybeans grown across the region? Secondly, does the SMAP b-parameter value vary throughout the growing season given the significant change in the distribution of crop water within tissue types throughout the growing season? Since in-situ measurements of the b-parameter are higher for corn, we hypothesize that as the relative fraction of corn in a SMAP pixel increases, the b-parameter will increase. We test this hypothesis using satellite scale modeling of crop water and SMAP L2 DCA VOD measurements at 18 sites across the U.S. Corn Belt for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. For each site year, the crop water for the satellite pixel is simulated using the Agro-IBIS crop model and is weighted according to the proportion of corn and soybeans grown in that location. We find that there is no statistically significant correlation between the relative corn fraction and the SMAP b-parameter across the U.S. Corn Belt and that the current SMAP cropland value of 0.11 is appropriate for the beginning of the growing season (growing degree days (GDD) < 10<(0)over bar>0. C center dot day). However, we find that the b-parameter in the second half of the growing season (GDD >= 10 (0) over bar0.C center dot day), during the crop reproductive stages, has an average value of 0.17. The results from this study indicate that while there is no change in the b-parameter due to the proportion of crops growing in a satellite pixel, there may be a difference in b-parameter due to changing water distribution within the crop canopy due to the development of crop reproductive structures (ears and pods) during the second half of the growing season.

AB Providing forest biomass estimates with desired accuracy and precision for small areas is a key challenge to incorporating forest carbon offsets into commodity trading programs. Enrolled forest carbon projects and verification entities typically rely on probabilistically sampled field data and design-based (DB) estimators to estimate carbon storage and characterize uncertainty. However, this methodology requires a large amount of field data to achieve sufficient precision and collection of these data can be prohibitively expensive. This has spurred interest in developing regional-scale maps of forest biomass that incorporate remote sensing data as an alternative to collecting expensive plot data. These maps are often generated using machine learning (ML) algorithms that combine remote sensing products and field measurements. While these maps can produce estimates across large geographic regions at fine spatial resolutions, the estimates are prone to bias and do not have associated uncertainty estimates. Here, we assess one such map developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Carbon Monitoring System. We consider model-assisted (MA) and geostatistical model-based (GMB) estimators to address map bias and uncertainty quantification. The MA and GMB estimators use a sample of field observations as the response, and the ML-produced map as an auxiliary variable to achieve statistically defensible predictions. We compare MA and GMB estimator performance to DB and direct (DR) estimators. This assessment considers both counties and a small areal extent experimental forest, all within Oregon USA. Results suggest the MA and GMB estimators perform similar to the DB estimator at the state level and in counties containing many field plots. But in counties with moderate to small field sample sizes, the GMB and MA estimators are more precise than the DB estimator. As within-county sample sizes get smaller, the GMB estimator tends to outperform MA. Results also show the DR estimator's state-level estimates are substantially larger than the DB, MA and GMB estimates, indicating that that the DR estimator may be biased. When assessing the GMB estimator for the experimental forest, we find the GMB estimator has sufficient precision for stand-level carbon accounting even when no field observations are available within the stand. Plot-level GMB uncertainty interval coverage probabilities were estimated and showed adequate coverage. This suggests that the GMB estimator is producing statistically rigorous uncertainty estimates.

AB Slope instability in reservoir areas is one of the greatest concerns for public and governments worldwide. The long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas after the impoundments remain poorly understood. Among the technologies applied to detecting and monitoring unstable slopes, interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is one of the most effective. However, owing to the slopes in a reservoir suffering from periodic water-level fluctuations, InSAR technology has shortcomings for monitoring unstable slopes with large displacement for a long time. In this study, a post-processing method of InSAR and a practical strategy were proposed to monitor the long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas both spatially and temporally. The strategy can capture the evolution trends of the unstable slopes based on the variations in their deformation areas with reservoir water-level fluctuations for a long time. The case study was carried out in the Xiluodu reservoir area of China. The monitoring data of the unstable slopes before and after reservoir impoundment were extracted from multi-source SAR data, including those from ALOS-1, ENVISAT ASAR, and Sentinel-1. It was found that there were 40 unstable slopes before the reservoir impoundment and 152 unstable slopes after the reservoir impoundment. Of the 152 slopes, 142 slopes (94%) began deforming in the first 3 years after reservoir impoundment, 15 slopes have been experiencing continuous deformation, and 137 slopes underwent intermittent deformation. The areas of 79 slopes (52%) increased during the water-level drawdown periods and decreased during the rising periods. The areas of 22 slopes (14%) demonstrated the opposite trend, and the areas of 51 slopes (34%) increased independently of the water-level fluctuations. In terms of evolution trends in the deformation area, 30% of slopes experienced a decreasing trend, 15% were under a constant deformation trend, and 55% showed an increasing trend. The distribution of the unstable slopes varied from the dam site to the end of the reservoir, and most of them favorited the areas where slope angle and height were 20-35 degrees and 30-300 m, respectively. The soil slopes composed of the previous landslide deposits were prone to deformation, followed by the dip to overdip layered rock slopes.

AB The reliability of remote sensing technology is essential for its efficient operational applications in nature conservation practices. In our study, multi-temporal, multispectral, and hyperspectral data from an Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 3 cm were applied to a permanent research plot (1 ha), while spaceborne PlanetScope multi-temporal data with GSD of 3 m were used for a wider area of 250 ha. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of these data for monitoring vegetation at the species level in the Central European relict arcto-alpine tundra (in the Krkonos?e Mountains, Czech Republic). We evaluated both types of data and their performance for various classifiers, and the benefits of adding multitemporal aspects to the classification and robustness of remote sensing for monitoring grass species. This study addresses the requirements of nature conservation practices in the Krkonos?e Mts. National Park to find a suitable method for monitoring changes in dominant and expanding grass species in response to global warming. The object-based Support Vector Machine, pixel-based Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classifiers were evaluated. We confirmed that the UAV multispectral and hyperspectral data with GSD of 3 cm can monitor dominant grass species (Nardus stricta, Calamagrostis villosa, Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia cespitosa) in tundra with excellent accuracy (95.9% and 94.0% overall accuracy for multi-temporal and mono-temporal composites, respectively). The best F1-scores for these species ranged from 94.7 to 99.4%. However, the accuracies were substantially lower for small and sparse growing species (Avenella flexuosa and Carex bigelowii). Unexpectedly, the UAV multispectral and hyperspectral data yielded comparable results. The multi-temporal approach improved the accuracy of all types of data. Overall, we confirmed the robustness of the remote sensing approach for grass monitoring at the species level given the high spatial match between various classification outputs. Our study established a workflow for reliable monitoring of tundra grass vegetation according to the requirements of nature conservation and proposed innovative measures for the spatial accuracy assessment of classification outputs.

AB The sensitivity of Global Positioning System (GPS) technique to detect displacements caused by Total Water Storage (TWS) changes has already been analyzed, while its sensitivity to individual TWS components, such as groundwater, is still in question. We use the probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (pPCA) to examine the spatio-temporal variations of vertical displacements from 98 GPS stations located in 9 regions of the world recognized as those where changes in groundwater masses are the most significant. To study the Earth's crust displacements induced by changes in groundwater masses, we remove from GPS displacements those induced by changes in masses of other water storage components using the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM). For validation purposes, displacements predicted by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions from which the WGHM compartments other than groundwater are subtracted are also used. We estimate an average global trend of vertical displacements induced by groundwater mass changes equal to 0.4 +/- 0.17 mm/yr for GRACE-WGHM differences. We observe that this trend is overestimated by groundwater-induced displacements estimated for GPS-WGHM differences for several regions around the world and mostly underestimated by WGHM. Spatio-temporal patterns are very coherent between GPS-WGHM differences and GRACEWGHM differences with significant signatures observed for periods of intense natural and/or human-induced groundwater mass changes. We show that the determined GRACE-WGHM differences and GPS-WGHM differences capture most of the wet and dry periods reflected by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We also find that groundwater-induced displacements estimated from the three datasets we use, show a prominent 6-year cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that GPS displacements can add very essential information to study and monitor local displacements due to groundwater mass changes and may successfully contribute to the climate-related research.

AB Micronutrient malnutrition is a global challenge affecting >2 billion people, in particular those with a crop-based diet and limited access to nutrient-rich food sources. Conventional methods for measuring the crop nutrients such as wet chemical analysis of grains are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive and, consequently, unsuitable for the consistent quantification of nutrients across space and time. In this study, we propose a new method that is using PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) and Sentinel-2 images to estimate the nutrient concentrations of crop grains before harvest. We collected grain samples for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat from a farm situated in Italy and measured their nutrient concentrations in the lab. These measurements together with the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images acquired at the main phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) were used as input for twoband vegetation indices (TBVIs) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to predict Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S) and Zinc (Zn). Models' performances were assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For PRISMA images, the best prediction results were obtained for P in soybean (R2 = 0.69), K in soybean (R2 = 0.66), Mg in soybean (R2 = 0.58), Fe in soybean (R2 = 0.57), K in wheat (R2 = 0.57), K in corn (R2 = 0.55), P in wheat (R2 = 0.51), S in rice (R2 = 0.58) using TBVIs. In contrast to PRISMA, PLSR outperformed TBVIs when Sentinel-2 images were used as input. For Sentinel-2, the best predictions were obtained for P in soybean (R2 = 0.73), K in wheat (R2 = 0.67), Mg in soybean (R2 = 0.62), Zn in wheat (R2 = 0.56), Fe in soybean (R2 = 0.52), P in wheat (R2 = 0.52). Our study showed that estimating the nutrient composition of crops using remote sensing images has the potential to change how we approach a cost-effective, timely, and spatially explicit representation of the crops' nutritional quality.

AB The local climate zone (LCZ) system provides a universal classification mechanism for urban and natural landscapes and plays an increasingly important role in urban climate research. With the rapid development of various LCZ mapping methods, a thorough survey of the LCZ mapping literature is urgently needed to better understand current progress, challenges, and future directions. Accordingly, this study provided a comprehensive review of the LCZ mapping literature during 2012-2021, with a detailed analysis on literature statistics, research topics, LCZ cities, and active research groups. Furthermore, remote sensing (RS)-based LCZ mapping methods were elucidated from feature sets, classification units, training areas, classification algorithms, and accuracy assessment; geographic information system (GIS)-based LCZ mapping methods were elaborated from LCZ pa-rameters, basic spatial units, classification algorithms, and accuracy assessment; and their combination methods were summarized from two typical integration strategies. Finally, several challenges and future directions for LCZ mapping were discussed. The topics include exploiting multi-source RS and GIS data, determining appro-priate LCZ mapping unit sizes, acquiring high-quality LCZ ground truth data, improving LCZ classification al-gorithms, optimizing LCZ parameters and subclasses, exploring the transferability of LCZ models, conducting global interannual LCZ mapping, and expanding the application of LCZs. The research community can quickly obtain abundant information on the LCZ mapping literature, understand the frameworks of different LCZ mapping methods, and inspire new directions for future research.

AB Sentinel-1 observes the whole globe every 12 days (6 days when both satellites were operational) and provides a wealth of data relevant to agriculture. Sugarcane cultivators could potentially benefit from these data by using them to assist operational and management practices. However, first, thorough understanding is needed of Sentinel-1 backscatter and its behavior over sugarcane canopies. In this study, we aimed to improve understanding of how Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to sugarcane yield variability and waterlogging. In order to do so we focused on an irrigated sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique. In the analysis presented, we assessed different polarizations, their ratio, and benchmarked them against optical indices and passive microwave observations in different seasons. With the help of a large sugarcane yield dataset, we analyzed how backscatter relates to sucrose yield variability in different seasons. We found VV backscatter related to the stalk development, the most important reservoir for sucrose accumulation. In addition, in a season with reported waterlogging, optical and radar observations showed a delay in sugarcane crop development. Further analysis showed the presence of water underneath the canopy caused an increase in all polarizations and the cross ratio (CR). The results imply that Sentinel-1 backscatter contains information on both waterlogging under the canopy as well as sucrose development in the stalk. By isolating and quantifying the impact of waterlogging on backscatter, it will be possible to further quantify sucrose development with backscatter observations and identify waterlogging simultaneously.

AB Frequent observations of surface water at fine spatial scales will provide critical data to support the management of aquatic habitat, flood risk and water quality. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites can provide such observations, but algorithms are still needed that perform well across diverse climate and vegetation conditions. We developed surface inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, at 12 sites across the conterminous United States (CONUS), covering a total of >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. Each scene in the 5-year (2017-2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 algorithm was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to explore if and where the two time series could potentially be integrated into a single highfrequency time series. Within each model, open water and vegetated water (vegetated palustrine, lacustrine, and riverine wetlands) classes were mapped. The models were validated using imagery from WorldView and PlanetScope. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1% and 0.9% for the Sentinel-1 algorithm and 3.1% and 0.5% for the Sentinel-2 algorithm, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. The Sentinel-2 algorithm showed higher accuracy (10.7% omission and 7.9% commission error) relative to the Sentinel-1 algorithm (28.4% omission and 16.0% commission error). Patterns over time in the proportion of area mapped as open or vegetated water by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithms were charted and correlated for a subset of all 12 sites. Our results showed that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithm open water time series can be integrated at all 12 sites to improve the temporal resolution, but sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for mixed-pixel, vegetated water. The methods developed here provide inundation at 5-day (Sentinel-2 algorithm) and 12-day (Sentinel-1 algorithm) time steps to improve our understanding of the short- and long-term response of surface water to climate and land use drivers in different ecoregions.

AB Urban vegetation, a harbinger of future global vegetation change, is controlled by complex urban environments. The urban-rural gradient in vegetation greenness trends and their responses to biogeochemical drivers (e.g. elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming) and land-cover changes, however, remain un-clear. Here we used satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index to examine the greenness trends for 1500-plus cities in China for 2000-2019. We developed a conceptual framework to differentiate between the contributions of four key drivers to the greenness trends: two biogeochemical drivers, a background biogeochemical driver (BBD) and an urban biogeochemical driver (UBD), and two drivers of land-cover changes, urban expansion or densification (UED) and urban green recovery (UGR). We find that the greening trends gradually decreased from urban cores to urban new towns and then to browning trends in urban fringes. The significant greening in urban cores was mainly contributed by BBD (25.6%) and UBD (52.3%). While the minor greening in urban new towns was contributed by both BBD (33.1%) and UBD (24.1%) and weakened by UED (-39.7%). The UED (-64.4%) dominated the browning in urban fringes. These results suggest that biogeochemical drivers and land-cover changes jointly regulated the urban-rural gradient in greenness trends, which contributes to the assessment of future global vegetation change driven by complex environmental changes.

AB Fractional cover time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil from remote sensing provide essential detail to understand how grasslands are affected by recent and future drought periods in the 21st century. In this regard, Sentinel-2A/B offer frequent large-area observations, which have not yet been fully exploited for a spatially continuous drought monitoring of highly dynamic Central European grasslands. In this study, we developed a generalized drought monitoring framework for Central European grasslands linking Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing. We first implemented a consistent and repeatable strategy to obtain a grassland spectral library supported by the Europe-wide Land Use/ Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and multitemporal Sentinel-2 data. Our library captured the spectral variability of PV, NPV, and soil cover from 12 grassland areas distributed along typical environmental and land use gradients of Central Europe. We trained a generalized regression-based unmixing model with synthetic data generated from the spectral library and compared fractional cover estimates to a multitemporal reference dataset. PV, NPV, and soil were estimated with good accuracy, achieving MAEs of 6.54%, 13.7%, and 12.2%, respectively. Local unmixing models trained on area-specific library subsets were overall outperformed by the generalized model highlighting the value of a comprehensive grassland library for generalized spectral unmixing. Based on fractional cover time series from 2017 to 2021, we calculated time series of the grassland-specific Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) capturing proportions of NPV and soil relative to PV. Comparison of annual growing season drought metrics derived from the NDFI to annual meteorological drought statistics from the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as well as the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) revealed widespread drought impacts on grasslands during the persistent drought period in Central Europe from 2018 to 2020. While impacts on grasslands overall closely followed meteorological and soil drought conditions, regionally varying drought metrics underline that local to regional environmental and hydrological conditions shaped the drought response of Central European grasslands. Our study emphasizes the value of combining Sentinel-2 data, field survey information, and spectral unmixing to enable drought monitoring across grassland gradients of Central Europe with Sentinel-2 time series.

AB Smoke aerosol emissions from Indonesian fires frequently cause adverse environmental consequences across southeast Asia. Satellite observations provide us with a great opportunity to monitor such emissions at large scales. However, existing satellite-based estimates of Indonesian fire emissions vary considerably in magnitude, differing by a factor of four. Here, we aim to improve Indonesian fire emissions estimates through improved calculations of fire radiative energy (FRE: time-integrated fire radiative power (FRP)) and smoke aerosol emission coefficients (Ce) using multiple new-generation satellite observations. Specifically, peatland and non-peatland Ce values were derived from FRP and emission rates of smoke aerosols based on Visible Infrared Im-aging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire and aerosol products. FRE was calculated from the diurnal FRP cycle that was reconstructed by fusing cloud-corrected FRP retrievals from the high temporal-resolution Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with those from high spatial-resolution VIIRS. Then, fuel type-specific Ce values and fused AHI-VIIRS FRE were used to produce hourly and daily fire emission data from 2015 to 2020 across Indonesia. To evaluate AHI-VIIRS estimates, we generated a reference dataset of total particulate matter (TPM) by computing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol observation differences from successive Terra and Aqua satellites overpasses over a set of manually-selected smoke plumes. AHI-VIIRS-based fire emissions correlated significantly with the MODIS reference data (r = 0.84; p < 0.001). The inter -annual time series analysis of AHI-VIIRS emissions showed extreme variability (similar to 26 fold), with the greatest amount in 2015 (6.09 Tg) and the least in 2020 (0.23 Tg), during the study period. Mean annual fire emissions distributed across Indonesia's islands were primarily from Kalimantan (43.8%) and Sumatra (41.7%), followed by Sulawesi (5.6%), Java (4.5%), and Papua (4.4%). Additionally, contributions of Indonesian fire emissions from peatland, forest, cropland, and savanna/grassland fuel types were 51.4%, 37.8%, 7.0%, and 3.8%, respectively, during the fire season of the strong 2015 El Nino event. The analysis suggests that the majority of Indonesian fire emissions are very likely associated with large-scale land use conversion from peatland to agriculture, as well as prolonged droughts induced by El Nino events.

AB Long-term land surface temperature (LST) variation is vital for the study of climate change and environmental monitoring. Change detection methods provide access to recovery trajectories of trend and seasonality and detect abrupt changes in LST time series, but a comprehensive evaluation of the published methods is lacking. In this study, simulated LST data with a temporal resolution of 8 days under different scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used methods: Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST), Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The results obtained using the simulated data indicated that BEAST was the best method for decomposing LST time series into trend and seasonality (mean RMSEs were 0.28 K and 0.27 K, respectively) and for detecting abrupt changes in these two components (mean F1 scores were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively). BFAST was less robust to high-complexity data (F1: 0.56 and 0.52, RMSE: 1.34 K and 1.46 K). 0.91 K and 1.29 K). DBEST is recommended to capture component details because it yields the least generalized output (F1 for trend: 0.37, RMSE: 0.64 K and 1.37 K). Both BFAST and DBEST exhibited reduced accuracy when the time-series data has long-lasting continuous missing data. An application using the 20-year MODIS LST time series supports the results obtained using the simulated data. BEAST exhibited the highest detection accuracy for land cover change (13 correct detections among 15 true changes), followed by DBEST (9) and BFAST (7). All three methods were ineffective for detecting low-magnitude disturbances: wildfires, heatwaves, and cold spells due to their low intensity or short duration. To reduce the non-negligible commission error of BEAST, this study proposes an improved BEAST, which eliminates the false breakpoints in BEAST using a set of thresholds. Compared with BEAST, the user accuracy of the improved BEAST was significantly increased by 13.9% in the simulated data, resulting in an F1 increase of 0.04, and 15 false breakpoints were eliminated among 53 detected disturbances in the MODIS LST time series. This study outlines commonly used change detection methods and offers guidance for choosing the optimal method to detect changes in LST time series. Furthermore, suggestions on the determination of parameters and false breakpoints elimination in the improved BEAST enable it more practical.

AB Very-high-resolution (VHR) land cover and land use (LCLU) is an essential baseline data for understanding finescale interactions between humans and the heterogeneous landscapes of urban environments. In this study, we developed a Fine-resolution, Large-area Urban Thematic information Extraction (FLUTE) framework to address multiple challenges facing large-area, high-resolution urban mapping, including the view angle effect, high intraclass and low interclass variation, and multiscale land cover types. FLUTE builds upon a teacher-student deep learning architecture, and includes two new feature extraction modules - Scale-aware Parsing Module (SPM) and View-aware Embedding Module (VEM). Our model was trained with a new benchmark database containing 52.43 million labeled pixels (from 2014 to 2017 NAIP airborne Imagery) to capture diverse LCLU types and spatial patterns. We assessed the credibility of FLUTE by producing a 1-meter resolution database named UrbanWatch for 22 major cities across the conterminous United States. UrbanWatch contains nine LCLU classes - building, road, parking lot, tree canopy, grass/shrub, water, agriculture, barren, and others, with an overall accuracy of 91.52%. We have further made UrbanWatch freely accessible to support urban-related research, urban planning and management, and community outreach efforts: https://urbanwatch.charlotte.edu.

AB NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission offers data for temperate and pan-tropical estimates of aboveground forest biomass (AGB). The spaceborne, full-waveform LiDAR from GEDI provides sample footprints of canopy structure, expected to cover about 4% of the land area following two years of operation. Several options are available for estimating AGB at different geographical scales. Using GEDI sample data alone, gridded biomass predictions are based on hybrid inference which correctly propagates errors due to the modeling and accounts for sampling variability, but this method requires at least two GEDI tracks in the area of interest. However, there are significant gaps in GEDI coverage and in some areas of interest GEDI data may need to be combined with other wall-to-wall remotely sensed (RS) data, such as those from multispectral or SAR sensors. In these cases, we may employ hierarchical model-based (HMB) inference that correctly considers the additional model errors that result from relating GEDI data to the wallto-wall data. Where predictions are possible from both hybrid and HMB inference the question arises which framework to choose, and under what circumstances? In this paper, we make progress towards answering these questions by comparing the performance of the two prediction frameworks under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Conventional model-based (MB) inference with wall-to-wall TanDEM-X data was applied as a baseline prediction framework, which does not involve GEDI data at all. An important feature of the study was the comparison of AGB predictors in terms of both standard deviation (SD: the square root of variance) and root mean square error (RMSE: the square root of mean square error - MSE). Since, in model-based inference, the true AGB in an area of interest is a random variable, comparisons of the performance of prediction frameworks should preferably be made in terms of their RMSEs. However, in practice only the SD can be estimated based on empirical survey data, and thus it is important also to study whether or not the difference between the two uncertainty measures is small or large under conditions relevant for the GEDI mission. Our main findings were that: (i) hybrid and HMB prediction typically resulted in smaller RMSEs than conventional MB prediction although the difference between the three frameworks in terms of SD often was small; (ii) in most cases the difference between hybrid and HMB inference was small in terms of both RMSE and SD; (iii) the RMSEs for all frameworks was substantially larger than the SDs in small study areas whereas the two uncertainty measures were similar in large study areas, and; (iv) spatial autocorrelation of model residual errors had a large effect on the RMSEs of AGB predictors, especially in small study areas. We conclude that hybrid inference is suitable in most GEDI applications for AGB assessment, due to its simplicity compared to HMB inference. However, where GEDI data are sparse HMB inference should be preferred.

AB Sea surface salinity (SSS) provides information on the variability of ocean dynamics (global water cycle and ocean circulation) and air-sea interactions, thereby contributing to the identification and prediction of significant changes in the global climate. Monitoring global SSS via satellite observations has been possible using L-band microwave radiometers since 2010; however, their performance is limited by their retrieval algorithms under conditions such as radio frequency interference, low sea surface temperatures, and strong winds. This study proposes a new global SSS model using multi-source data based on seven machine learning approaches: K-nearest neighbor, support vector regression, artificial neural network, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting model, and gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT). Five Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) SSS, and four ancillary data were used as input variables. All models produced better performance than either SMAP or HYCOM SSS products, with the top performing GBRT model reducing the root mean square difference for the validation dataset from 1.062 to 0.259 practical salinity units compared to the SMAP SSS product. The improved SSS products had increased correlation with the in-situ data for both low-and high-salinity waters across all global oceans, thus further advancing the understanding and monitoring of global SSS.

AB The success and rate of forest regeneration has consequences for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity, among others. Systematically monitoring forest regeneration over large and often remote areas is challenging. Remotely sensed data and associated analytical approaches have demonstrated consistent and transparent options for spatially-explicit characterization of vegetation return following disturbance. Moreover, time series of satellite imagery enable the establishment of spatially meaningful recovery baselines that can provide a benchmark for identifying areas that are either under-or over-performing relative to those baselines. This information allows for the investigation and/or prioritization of areas requiring some form of management intervention, including guiding tree planting initiatives. In this research, we assess recovery following stand replacing disturbances for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada for the period 1985-2017, wherein-51 Mha of Canada's forested ecosystems were impacted by wildfire, and -21 Mha were impacted by harvesting. For quantification of forest recovery, we implement the Years to Recovery or Y2R metric using Landsat time series data based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to relate the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance NBR value. By the end of the analyzed period, 76% of areas impacted by wildfire were considered spectrally recovered compared to 93% of harvested areas. On average, we found that harvest areas had more rapid spectral recovery (mean Y2R = 6.1 years) than wildfire (mean Y2R = 10.6 years) and importantly, that Y2R varied by ecozone, disturbance type, pre-disturbance land cover, and latitude. We used airborne laser scanning data to assess whether pixels that were considered spectrally recovered had attained United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization benchmarks of canopy height (>5 m) and cover (>10%) across four geographic regions representing different forest types. Overall, 87% and 97% of recovered pixels sampled in harvests and wildfires, respectively, had achieved at least one of the benchmarks, with benchmarks of height more readily achieved than benchmarks of cover. By analyzing spatial patterns of Y2R, we identified areas that had significant positive or negative spatial clustering in their rate of spectral recovery. Approximately 3.5-4% of areas disturbed by wildfire or harvest had significant positive spatial clustering, indicative of slower spectral recovery rates; these areas were also less likely to have attained benchmarks of height and cover. Conversely, we identified significant negative spatial clustering for 0.94% of areas recovering from harvest and 1.93% of areas recovering from wildfire, indicative of spectral recovery that was more rapid than the ecozonal baseline. Herein, we demonstrated that remote sensing can provide spatial intelligence on the nature of disturbance-recovery dynamics in forested ecosystems over large areas and moreover, can retrospectively quantify and characterize historic forest recovery trends within the past three decades that have implications for forest management, climate change mitigation, and restoration initiatives in the near term.

AB A new soil moisture and soil temperature wireless sensor network (the SMN-SDR) consisting of 34 sites was established within the Shandian River Basin in 2018, located in a semi-arid area of northern China. In this study, in situ measurements of the SMN-SDR were used to evaluate 24 different soil moisture datasets grouped according to three categories: (1) single-sensor satellite-based products, (2) multi-sensor merged products, and (3) model-based products. Triple collocation analysis (TCA) was applied to all possible triplets to verify the reliability and robustness of the results. Impacts of different factors on the accuracy of soil moisture products were also investigated, including local acquisition time, physical surface temperature, and vegetation optical depth (VOD). The results reveal that the latest Climate Change Initiative (CCI)-combined product (v06.1, merging extra low-frequency passive microwave data) had the best agreement with in situ measurements from the SMN-SDR, with the lowest ubRMSE ( 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) and highest R (> 0.6). Among all single-sensor retrieved soil moisture products, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products performed best in terms of R (> 0.6) and ubRMSE (close to 0.04 m(3)/m(3)), with the SMAP-MDCA (Modified Dual Channel Algorithm) being slightly better than the baseline SCA-V (Single Channel Algorithm-Vertical polarization). Importantly, the newly developed SMAP-IB product, which does not use auxiliary data, delivered the best bias statistics and higher VOD values compared with the drier SMAP retrievals, suggesting that the low VOD values (underestimated vegetation effects) may be the major factor causing the dry bias of SMAP products in this study area. It was also found that TCA may systematically overestimate the correlation and underestimate the ubRMSE of soil moisture products as compared with ground-based metrics. TCA-based metrics may vary considerably when using different triplets, due to the TCA assumptions being violated even with the most conservative triplets (in this case an active product, a passive product, and a model-based product). Redundant TCA-based metrics from multiple inde-pendent triplets could be averaged to increase the accuracy of final TCA estimates. This study is the first to use in situ measurements from the SMN-SDR to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used, multi-source soil moisture products. These results are expected to further promote the improvement of satellite-and model-based soil moisture products.

AB Water fulfils key roles in maintaining a plant's biological activity. Water shortage induces stomatal closure, causing a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration rates. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission is sensitive to subtle, stress-induced variations in non-photochemical quenching and in photosynthetic electron transport, caused by e.g., a fluctuation in the water availability. Based on this sensitivity, a framework for calibrating a water stress function in a crop growth model using ground-based SIF observations is proposed. SIF time series are simulated by coupling the AgroC crop growth model to the Soil Canopy Observations Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model. This allowed parametrizing the water stress function in the AgroC crop growth model, resulting in improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange over a sugar beet stand during stressed periods. The improvement in the estimation of the water and carbon fluxes by AgroC during the summer months highlights the ability of canopyscale SIF observations to serve as a remote sensing metric to indicate the intensity of a stress condition. We argue that our framework, linking SIF emission to stress functions, can be used to extract information concerning drought stress from the Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite, scheduled for launch in 2024.

AB The lack of proper understanding of multi-layer soil moisture (SM) profile (signals) remains a persistent challenge in sustainable agricultural water management and food security, especially during drought conditions. We develop a machine-learning algorithm using the concept of learning from patterns to estimate the multi-layer SM information in ungauged locations firmly based on local knowledge of the climatic and landscape controls. The Contiguous United States (CONUS) is clustered into homogeneous regions based on the association between SM and climate and landscape controls. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to homogenous regions to capture the complex relationship between appropriate predictor variables and in-situ SM at multiple layers over the CONUS. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 (L4) surface (0-5 cm) and rootzone (0-100 cm) SM along with climate and landscape datasets are used as predictor variables. In-situ multi-layer SM recorded by Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL), and U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) networks are utilized as predictands. XGBoost models are then trained region-wise and layer-wise to estimate multi-layer SM information at 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths (five layers) at 1-km spatial resolution. Results indicate that the predictor variables have varying levels of influence on SM with changing soil depth, and meteorological variables have the least importance. Validation at 79 independent locations indicates the multi-layer SM estimates successfully capture temporal dynamics of SM, with most locations achieving ubRMSE less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The high-resolution SM estimates offer spatial sub-grid heterogeneity compared to SMAP L4 SM.

AB In light of the ongoing global biodiversity crisis, the urge to monitor and map terrestrial plant biodiversity at large spatial extents has spurred research on adequate quantitative methods. The use of spectral diversity metrics from different remote sensing platforms has emerged as a promising tool for such biodiversity assessments. Satellite remote sensing presents the next frontier for implementation of these methods to assess plant diversity with spatial and temporal continuity at truly regional or global scales. However, the question of what exactly is monitored by spectral diversity metrics from relatively coarse multi-spectral satellite observations has remained largely unanswered. In this research, we examined which components contribute to satellite remotely sensed spectral diversity. We assessed the relationships between spectral diversity and in-situ taxonomic and trait diversity, and evaluated the role of confounding factors, vegetation cover, and landscape morphology (slope and elevation), in shaping these relationships. Hereto, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ field trait and species count data collected in the Montesinho-Nogueira Natura 2000 site (Portugal) together with radiative transfer models to quantify the theoretical link between in-situ trait diversity and simulated spectral diversity. Through the use of linear mixed-effect models, our results highlight that variation in vegetation cover dominates the Sentinel-2's spectral diversity signal (contributing 53-84% of the R2marginal). The vegetation cover component encompasses spatial variability in canopy architecture traits as well as the fraction of bare soil and plant litter spectra. These elements together strongly impact the overall spectral diversity signal, as shown both in our radiative transfer simulations and empirical comparisons. Next to vegetation cover, we found that taxonomic diversity is a significant predictor and covariate of spectral diversity, while the role of leaf trait diversity appeared insignificant in our multispectral dataset. Variation in vegetation cover dominated the spectral diversity signal in our study while it is not necessarily correlated with plant diversity. We, therefore, recommend that future applications of multi-spectral diversity metrics consider the impact of vegetation cover, including soil variability and the role of morphological traits, in shaping leaf trait - canopy reflectance relationships to better understand the ambiguous performance of spectral diversity as a proxy of plant diversity. This will result in higher robustness, consistency, and scalability of spectral diversity metrics for predicting in-situ plant diversity across scales, sensors, and ecosystems in regional biodiversity assessments.

AB Wildfires have become one of the biggest natural hazards for environments worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region, climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to medium to large wildfires (> 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span of two decades (1996-2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.66 to R2 = 0.93 in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from R2 = 0.48 to R2 = 0.81 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and from R2 = 0.49 to R2 = 0.85 for Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as having a lower Burning Index. We find that on average, wildfires cause a 25% initial decrease in the vegetation index (NDVI) and a larger than 80% drop in wetness indices (NBR and NDMI) after they occur. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period. We also find that the dynamical effects vary across regions and have an impact on seasonal cycles of vegetation in later years. Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.

AB Full waveform (FW) LiDAR systems have proven their effectiveness to map forest biophysical variables in the last two decades, owing to their ability of measuring, with high accuracy, forest vertical structures. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system on board the International Space Station (ISS) is the latest FW spaceborne LiDAR instrument for the continuous observation of Earth's forests. FW systems rely on very so-phisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to leverage their capabilities for the accurate estimation of the aforementioned forest characteristics. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to date comprises more than 25 billion acquired unfiltered shots, and along with the pre-processed data, amounting to more than 90 TB of data, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. To overcome the issues related to the generation of relevant metrics from GEDI data, we propose a new metric-free approach to estimate canopy dominant heights (H-dom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. To avoid metric computation, we leverage deep learning techniques and, more in detail, convolutional neural networks with the aim to analyze the GEDI Level 1B geolocated waveforms. Performance comparisons were conducted between four convolutional neural network (CNN) variants using GEDI waveform data (either un-touched, or subsetted) and a metric based Random Forest regressor (RF). Additionally, we tested if our frame-work can improve the generalization of the models to different distant regions. First, the models were trained using data from all the study regions. Cross validated results showed that the CNN based models compared well against their RF counterpart for both H-dom and V. The RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based models varied between 1.54 and 1.94 m with a coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.86 and 0.91, while the RF model produced an accuracy on H-dom estimates of 1.45 m (R-2 = 0.92). For V, CNN based estimations ranged from 27.76 to 33.33 m(3).ha(-1) (R-2 between 0.82 and 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.61 m(3).ha(-1) (R-2 = 0.88). Next, model generalization was assessed by means of a spatial transfer experiment. For H-dom, both the CNN and RF approaches showed similar performances to a global model, however, the CNN based approach showed higher variability on the estimation accuracy, and the variability was related to the forest structure between the trained and tested data (similar tree heights yield better accuracies). For the estimation of V, considering both approaches, the accuracy was dependent on the allometric relationship between H-dom and V in the training and testing regions while lower accuracies on V were obtained when the testing and training regions exhibited a different allometric relationship.

AB High resolution imaging spectrometers are prerequisite to address significant data gaps in inland optical water quality monitoring. In this work, we provide a data-driven alignment of chlorophyll-a and turbidity derived from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) with corresponding Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. For chlorophyll-a retrieval, empirical 'ocean colour' blue-green band ratios and a near infra-red (NIR) band ratio algorithm, as well as a semi-analytical three-band NIR-red ratio algorithm, were included in the analysis. Six million co-registrations with MSI and OLCI spanning 24 lakes across five continents were analysed. Following atmospheric correction with POLYMER, the reflectance distributions of the red and NIR bands showed close similarity between the two sensors, whereas the distribution for blue and green bands was positively skewed in the MSI results compared to OLCI. Whilst it is not possible from this analysis to determine the accuracy of reflectance retrieved with either MSI or OLCI results, optimizing water quality algorithms for MSI against those previously derived for the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and its follow-on OLCI, supports the wider use of MSI for aquatic applications. Chlorophyll-a algorithms were thus tuned for MSI against concurrent OLCI observations, resulting in significant improvements against the original algorithm coefficients. The mean absolute difference (MAD) for the blue-green band ratio algorithm decreased from 1.95 mg m(-3) to 1.11 mg m(-3), whilst the correlation coefficient increased from 0.61 to 0.80. For the NIR-red band ratio algorithms improvements were modest, with the MAD decreasing from 4.68 to 4.64 mg m(-3) for the empirical red band ratio algorithm, and 3.73 to 3.67 for the semi-analytical 3-band algorithm. Three implementations of the turbidity algorithm showed improvement after tuning with the resulting distributions having reduced bias. The MAD reduced from 0.85 to 0.72, 1.22 to 1.10 and 1.93 to 1.55 FNU for the 665, 708 and 778 nm implementations respectively. However, several sources of uncertainty remain: adjacent land showed high divergence between the sensors, suggesting that high product uncertainty near land continues to be an issue for small water bodies, while it cannot be stated at this point whether MSI or OLCI results are differentially affected. The effect of spectrally wider bands of the MSI on algorithm sensitivity to chlorophyll-a and turbidity cannot be fully established without further availability of in situ optical measurements.

AB Snow and ice melt processes are a key in Earth's energy-balance and hydrological cycle. Their quantification facilitates predictions of meltwater runoff as well as distribution and availability of fresh water. They control the balance of the Earth's ice sheets and are acutely sensitive to climate change. These processes decrease the surface reflectance with unique spectral patterns due to the accumulation of liquid water and light absorbing particles (LAP), that require imaging spectroscopy to map and measure. Here we present a new method to retrieve snow grain size, liquid water fraction, and LAP mass mixing ratio from airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy acquisitions. This methodology is based on a simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric and surface parameters using optimal estimation (OE), a retrieval technique which leverages prior knowledge and measurement noise in an inversion that also produces uncertainty estimates. We exploit statistical relationships between surface reflectance spectra and snow and ice properties to estimate their most probable quantities given the reflectance. To test this new algorithm we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra using the upcoming EnMAP orbital imaging spectroscopy mission, demonstrating an accurate estimation performance of snow and ice surface properties. A validation experiment using in-situ measurements of glacier algae mass mixing ratio and surface reflectance from the Greenland Ice Sheet gave uncertainties of +/- 16.4 mu g/gice and less than 3%, respectively. Finally, we evaluated the retrieval capacity for all snow and ice properties with an AVIRIS-NG acquisition from the Greenland Ice Sheet demonstrating this approach's potential and suitability for upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions.

AB With a large part of the world's population residing in coastal areas, and largely depending on the coastal environment, monitoring natural and human-induced coastal changes are paramount to understand the dynamic and vulnerability of these coastal systems/communities. To understand changes in coastal areas, e.g. environmental and social resilience to environmental change, local measurements are inadequate. Such large-scale issues can only be addressed with perhaps less accurate but large scale measurements from space. Considering vulnerability or exposure to coastal flooding, both the bathymetry (underwater) and topography (above water) are vital boundary conditions to understand and accurately estimate impacts on short (storms) and long (interseasonal) time-scales. In this work, we estimate the coastal bathymetry and topography with the optical VEN mu S satellite for every single overpass at the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC. The experimental VEN mu S satellite enables estimation of the topography and bathymetry by two repetitive identical images with a small time-lag. This capability proofs to result in topographies with a few meters accuracy and the bathymetry estimation is at best a few decimetres accurate. As a base for future Earth Observation missions such as Landsat or Sentinel 2, VEN mu S shows that higher resolution imagery (5 m), repetitive bands and a revisit time of only 2 days, enables unprecedented land/sea monitoring.

AB The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence, generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate. Here we use a continuous development model in combination with time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6 days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls. Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a transition in the relative importance of temperature versus photoperiod near the 10 degrees C isotherm in mean annual temperature. This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual temperatures below 10 degrees C.

AB The bulk surface properties, including canopy height (h), zero-plane displacement height (d), roughness length (z0), and aerodynamic resistance (rb and rd), are crucial biophysical parameters that influence momentum, energy and mass exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. The variabilities of these parameters are important for understanding possible impacts of the ecosystem on climate change, yet they have not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of large-scale, long-term observations. Here we provide global estimates of these bulk aerodynamic parameters, including d, z0, rb, and rd, for the period 1982-2017 based on remote-sensed leaf area index (LAI), h, and plant functional type dependent canopy morphological characteristics. The global h estimate is acquired from LAI using a semi-empirical relation in which the coefficients have been optimized based on the canopy height product from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Two LAI products, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), are used to calculate canopy height and parameters separately. The products derived from the above two LAI datasets agree very well (spatial correlation coefficient, SCC = 0.99, relative root-mean-square-error, rRMSE = 8.28% for h, SCC = 0.99, rRMSE = 12.15% for d, and SCC = 0.98, rRMSE = 13.78% for z0). Verification of the products against in-situ canopy height records from the FLUXNET and eddy-covariance (EC)-based d and z0 estimates shows that the estimates can reproduce the annual means and seasonal variations of the bulk surface properties. We found significant positive trends in global h (0.04-0.05% year-1), d (0.07% year- 1) and z0 (0.07% year- 1) associated with the Earth greening, but they are different from the trend in LAI (0.14-0.25% year-1). The differences between the trends in LAI and the trends in derived parameters are also found in different latitudes. For instance, in the Northern Hemisphere Polar region, the GLASS LAI increases by 0.48% year- 1, leading to positive trends of 0.03% year- 1 in h, 0.18% in d, and 0.20% year- 1 in z0. The above results highlight the importance of comprehensively considering changes in LAI, canopy height, and aerodynamic parameters when evaluating the effects of ecosystem change on climate. This long-term dataset can be used in climate models to assess the response of bulk aerodynamic parameters to climate changes and the impact of vegetation dynamics on regional and global climate.

AB The net direct radiative effect of mineral dust is a large uncertainty in global radiative forcing. To address this challenge, NASA's Earth Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) will map the surface mineralogy of Earth's desert dust source regions, constraining the composition of mineral dust aerosol for use in Earth system models (ESMs). This mission foreshadows multiple future global spectroscopic investigations for which coupling with ESMs will play a critical role. Planning such experiments requires a methodology for assessing the impact of uncertain remote observations on ESM accuracy. We design and implement an end-to-end simulation of the EMIT mission, leveraging Bayesian statistical methods and Monte Carlo sampling to analyze uncertainties in the retrieval and processing of EMIT data products. Special focus is placed on those uncertainties caused by atmospheric water vapor and aerosol loading conditions likely to be encountered by EMIT. We apply these results to a single-column configuration of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), revealing the potential impact of EMIT observations on radiative forcing estimates. We show that EMIT data stand to significantly reduce uncertainty in estimates of the dust direct radiative forcing attributable to uncertainties in surface mineralogies that are input to ESMs, and that the information gain for radiative forcing comes predominantly from better constraining iron oxides, which dominate the shortwave radiative effects of aerosol dust.

AB Given the considerable range of applications within the European Union Copernicus system, sustained satellite altimetry missions are required to address operational, science and societal needs. This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.Y

AB NASA?s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was designed to support the quantification and monitoring of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Its Snapshot Area Map (SAM) and target mode measurements provide an innovative dataset for carbon studies on sub-city scales. Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 - 6 ppm (median enhancements <^> 2 ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3?s dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1 ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3?s multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses. OCO-3?s frequent target and SAM mode observations will pave the way to constrain urban emissions at finer, sub-city scales.

AB Satellite passive microwave observations from 1.4 to 36 GHz already showed sensitivity to vegetation parameters, primarily through the calculations of the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) at individual window frequencies, separately. Here we evaluate the synergy of this frequency range for vegetation characterization, through the estimation of two vegetation parameters, its foliage and the photosynthesis activity as described by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and its woody components and carbon stock as described by the Above Ground Carbon (AGC), using different combinations of channels in the considered frequency range. Neural network retrievals are trained on these two vegetation parameters (NDVI and AGC), for several microwave channel combinations, including the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) that will observe simultaneously in window channels from 1.4 to 36 GHz, for the first time. This methodology avoids the use of any assumptions in the complex interaction between the surface (vegetation and soil) and the radiation, as well as any ancillary observations, to propose a genuine and objective evaluation of the information content of the passive microwave frequencies for vegetation characterization. Our analysis quantifies the synergy of the microwave frequencies from 1.4 to 36 GHz, and shows the expected potential of the CIMR instrument for the monitoring of vegetation parameters in tropical environments, as compared to current instruments. It also confirms that the 1.4 GHz observations have a high sensitivity to AGC, as compared to the other single frequencies up to 36 GHz, at least under tropical environments.

AB The 2017-2027 National Academies' Decadal Survey, Thriving on Our Changing Planet, recommended Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) as a "Designated Targeted Observable" (DO). The SBG DO is based on the need for agriculture, natural habitats, water use/quality, and urban development. We review existing algorithms in the community-state-of-practice in each category. This effort synthesizes the findings of more than 130 scientists.

AB Ground-clutter is a significant cause of missed-detection and underestimation of precipitation in complex terrain from space-based radars such as the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). This research proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework consisting of a precipitation detection model (PDM) and a precipitation regime classification model (PCM) to improve orographic precipitation retrievals from GPM-DPR using machine learning.
   The PDM is a Random Forest Classifier using GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) calibrated brightness temperatures (Tbs) and low-level precipitation mixing ratios from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) analysis as inputs. The PCM is a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the precipitation regime class, defined independently based on quantitative features of ground-based radar reflectivity profiles, using GPM DPR Ku-band (Ku-PR) reflectivity profiles and GMI Tbs. The AI framework is demonstrated for warm-season precipitation in the Southern Appalachian Mountains over three years (2016-2019), achieving large reductions in false alarms (77%) and missed detections (82%) relative to GPM Ku-PR precipitation products. The spatial distribution of predicted precipitation classes within the GPM overpass reflects the complex interactions between storms and topography that determine orographic precipitation regimes. For each GPM pixel, the local precipitation class informs on the vertical structure of rainfall microphysics aiming to capture low-level processes missed in GPM DPR reflectivity profiles contaminated by ground-clutter (i.e., the radar blind-zone).

AB Particulate organic carbon (POC) plays vital roles in marine carbon cycle, serving as a part of ?biological pump? moving carbon to the deep ocean. The blue-to-green band ratio algorithm is applied operationally to derive POC concentrations in global oceans; it, however, tends to underestimate high values in optically complex waters. With an attempt to develop accurate and robust oceanic POC models, this study aimed to explore machine learning methods in satellite retrieval of POC concentrations. Three machine learning methods, i.e. extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were tested, and the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was employed to identify sensitive features. Matchups of global in situ POC measurements and Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) products were used to train and evaluate POC models. Results showed that machine learning methods produced obvious better performance than the blue-to-green band ratio algorithm, and XGBoost was the most robust among the tested three machine learning methods. However, the blue-to-green band ratio algorithm still worked well for clear open ocean waters with low POC, and ANN was more effective for optically complex waters with extremely high POC. This study provided globally applicable methods for satellite retrieval of POC concentrations, which should be helpful for studying POC dynamics in global oceans as well as in productive marginal seas.

AB The largest earthquake in the Zagros Mountains struck the city of Azgeleh on the Iran-Iraq border on 12 November 2017. This M-w 7.3 earthquake was followed by an intense seismic sequence. Implementing the double-difference earthquake location technique, we relocate 1069 events recorded by our local seismic network, deployed after the mainshock. The spatial distribution of the epicenters indicates linear alignments of the events nucleated along at least four notable clusters. The clusters are characterized by at least one significant earthquake, such as the Tazehabad earthquake of 25 August 2018 (M-w 5.9) along a dense, east-west trending cluster and the Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake of 25 November 2018 (M-w 6.3) along the cluster with a northeast-southwest trend. We use two-pass differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) methods to study the coseismic permanent displacements of the Azgeleh, Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab events as well as the one-year postseismic deformation field of the 2017-2018 seismic sequence, respectively. We use non-linear and linear optimization algorithms to derive the source geometry and the slip distribution along the fault planes. The inversion is conducted by introducing also seismological constraints, leading to the definition of a listric geometry for the Azgeleh mainshock rupture that accommodates the slip area at depth of 10-16 km along a sub-horizontal plane (dipping similar to 3 degrees) and a low-angle (similar to 16 degrees) ramp. The thrust and dextral movements along this NNW-striking (similar to 345 degrees) fault have triggered a tear fault responsible for the Tazehabad event ruptured an east-west trending (similar to 267 degrees), north-dipping (similar to 78 degrees) sinistral shear fault. We present the dextral slip distribution of the Sarpol-e Zahab event along a NE-striking (similar to 34 degrees) fault, as a synthetic Riedel structure for the southern segment of the Khanaqin fault, dipping 63 degrees to the southeast. We find the postseismic deformation field associated with the seismic sequence is not confined only to the mainshock source (the Azgeleh fault), but also develops along the Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab faults. We additionally propose afterslip along a duplex, flat-ramp-flat structure down-dip and up-dip of the Azgeleh coseismic slip area. The up-dip afterslip develops onto the shallow detachment (similar to 3 degrees) at depth of similar to 8 km and the down-dip afterslip propagate onto the mid-crustal decollement level within the PanAfrican basement. The Azgeleh, Tazehabad, Sarpol-e Zahab and Khanaqin faults mark the Lurestan Arc-Kirkuk Embayment sharp margin in the Northwest Zagros and play a key role in the lateral escape of the Lurestan Salient and vertical strain partitioning in the Zagros front.

AB Remote sensing time series offer the possibility to monitor surface water at dense temporal intervals. Open data archives as well as developments in cloud computing are the main drivers towards and increased availability of raw data allowing for the extraction of detailed information on water bodies such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs. At the same time, changes in precipitation patterns, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, intensification of human water use, and regulatory upstream measurements affect water resources around the world today. With regard to water availability and supply-demand balance, artificial water reservoirs have become most important elements e.g. for hydropower, irrigated agriculture, flood control, as well as for domestic and industrial water use. Nevertheless, publicly accessible information on reservoirs is still not harmonized and available at global scale. Therefore, it is more essential than ever to acquire detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of water resources - especially reservoirs - and the drivers of their dynamics. In this study, we analyze daily water extent time series of the 1267 largest reservoirs worldwide based on the existing DLR-DFD Global WaterPack product derived from MODIS data (Klein et al., 2017). The study aims to present an experimental way of spatio-temporal variability analysis by implementing the TIMESAT software which is usually used for vegetation analyses. In our experimental approach we derive information on the timing when the open surface water areas of reservoirs increase and decrease by identifying start date, end date and duration of such reservoir cycles as well as timing of maximum surface water extent (hydro-metrics). For four selected reservoirs, these hydro-metrics derived from surface water extent are compared with hydro-metrics derived from in-situ water level measurements or altimetry datasets and are discussed in more detail. Based on the presented examples we demonstrate the potential of high temporal resolution surface water extent data and spatio-temporal variability analyses with TIMESAT for future applications supporting the understanding of reservoir variability as a result of water management and hydroclimatic variability.

AB Airborne and orbital imaging spectroscopy can facilitate the quantification of chemical and physical attributes of surface materials through analysis of spectral signatures. Prior to analysis, estimates of surface reflectance must be inferred from radiance measurements in a process known as atmospheric correction, which compensates for the distortion of the electromagnetic signal by the atmosphere. Inaccuracies in the correction process can alter characteristic spectral signatures, leading to subsequent mischaracterization of surface properties. Global ob-servations pose new challenges for mapping surface composition, as varied atmospheric conditions and surface biomes challenge traditional atmospheric correction methods. Recent work adopted an optimal estimation (OE) approach for retrieving surface reflectance from observed radiance measurements, providing the reflectance estimates with a posterior probability. This work incorporates these input probabilities to improve the accuracy of surface feature measurements. We demonstrate this using a generic feature-fitting method that is applicable to a wide range of Earth surface studies including geology, ecosystem studies, hydrology and urban studies. Specifically, we use a probabilistic framework based on generalized Tikhonov-regularized least squares, a rigorous formulation for appropriate weighting of features by their observation uncertainty and leveraging of prior knowledge of material abundance for improving estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of this procedure and quantify the increase in model performance by simulating expected accuracies in the reflectance estimation. To evaluate global uncertainties in mineral estimation, we simulate observations representative of the expected global range of atmospheric water vapor and aerosol levels, and characterize the sensitivity of our procedure to those quantities.

AB Soil moisture and gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) provide new opportunities for understanding the relationship between soil moisture and terrestrial photosynthesis over large regions. Here we explored the potential of the synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 based data for monitoring the responses of ecosystem productivity to drought. We used complementary observational information on root-zone soil moisture and GPP (9 km) from SMAP and fine-resolution SIF (0.05 degrees; GOSIF) derived from OCO-2 SIF soundings. We compared the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of anomalies of these variables over the conterminous U.S. during the 2018 drought, and examined to what extent they could characterize the drought-induced variations of flux tower GPP and crop yield data. Our results showed that SMAP GPP and GOSIF, both freely available online, could well capture the spatial extent and dynamics of the impacts of drought indicated by the U.S. Drought Monitor maps and the SMAP root-zone soil moisture deficit. Over the U.S. Southwest, monthly anomalies of soil moisture showed significant positive correlations with those of SMAP GPP (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.001) and GOSIF (R-2 = 0.76, p < 0.001), demonstrating strong water availability constraints on plant productivity across dryland ecosystems. We further found that SMAP GPP and GOSIF captured the impact of drought on tower GPP and crop yield. Our results suggest that synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 data products can reveal the drought evolution and its impact on ecosystem productivity and carbon uptake at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and demonstrate the value of SMAP and OCO-2 for studying ecosystem function, carbon cycling, and climate change.

AB Imaging spectroscopy is a valuable tool for mapping canopy foliar traits in forested ecosystems at landscape and larger scales. Most efforts to date have involved two-dimensional mapping of traits, typically representing top-of-canopy conditions. However, traits and their associated biological functions vary through the canopy vertical profile, such that incorporating information about vertical patterns may improve modeling of ecosystem processes like primary productivity. In 2016 and 2017, we collected extensive field data in forests in Domain 5 (Great Lakes) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to characterize the vertical variation in leaf mass per area (LMA), an important foliar trait related to plant growth and defense. Fieldwork was coincident with NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) overflights which collected imaging spectroscopy and lidar data. Using imaging spectroscopy to map top-of-canopy LMA and lidar to model vertical gradients of transmittance, we developed a method to map three-dimensional patterns in LMA in temperate broadleaf forests. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate top-of-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.57, RMSE 10.8 g m(-2)), which, along with lidar-derived metrics of light transmittance and height, was used in a multilevel regression to model within-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.78, RMSE 8.3 g m(-2)). The coupled models accurately estimated LMA throughout the canopy without taking into account species composition (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE: 8.5 g m(-2)).

AB The Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) of atmospheric aerosol is very important for environment and climate studies. Attempts have been made to retrieve the FMF from satellite data with varying success. In this work, the development of an artificial Neural Network for AEROsol retrieval (NNAero) is presented. NNAero uses data from the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites. The MODIS-derived spectral reflectances of solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface were used together with ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and FMF to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the joint retrieval of FMF and AOD. The NNAero results over northern and eastern China were validated against an independent reference AERONET dataset (i.e. not used in training the CNN). The results show that 68% of the NNAero AOD values are within the MODIS expected error (EE) envelope over land of +/-(0.05 + 15%), which is similar to the results from the MODIS Deep Blue (DB) algorithm (63% within EE), and both are better than the Dark Target (DT) algorithm (31% within EE). The validation of the NNAero FMF vs AERONET data shows a significant improvement with respect to the DT FMF, with Root Mean Squared Prediction Errors (RMSE) of 0.1567 (NNAero) and 0.34 (DT). The NNAero method shows the potential of improved retrieval of the FMF.

AB Transpiration (7) returns about half of continental precipitation back into the atmosphere. However, the global spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration are highly uncertain, and current estimates rely on either indirect remote sensing or empirical model formulations. Here, we show that T can be estimated reliably at the global scale using observations of plant sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). To do so, we derive T using two different methods from globally-distributed eddy-covariance measurements and compare it with satellite SIF retrievals from GOME-2 and OCO-2. Whereas most research to date has focused on the link between SIF and gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that SIF is as highly correlated with T (mean correlation coefficient R of 0.76 across sites for 16-day periods with GOME-2 and 0.75 at the daily scale with OCO-2). SIF shows a greater predictive skill to estimate T than traditional optical vegetation indices and its dynamics are very similar to those of T. Through the use of an advanced radiative transfer model, we also demonstrate a clear empirical link between SIF and T. At 83 FLUXNET sites, remote sensing data and flux-derived GPP and T are used to estimate the relevant parameters of the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) radiative transfer model and to model SIF. While the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis (GPP) is mostly controlled by leaf biochemical properties and plant structure, the SIF-T relationship appears largely determined by air temperature and intrinsic water use efficiency. Our findings suggest that ongoing advances in satellite SIF retrievals will allow for a more direct estimation of transpiration over large scales.

AB Forest canopies act as intermediaries in radiation energy exchange between the atmosphere and the snow surface. The size, location and distribution of forest discontinuities are important controls on forest shortwave radiation transmission and subsequent snow surface shading and radiation energy exchange between the atmosphere and the canopy, but challenges arise when accounting for these vegetation characteristics at large spatial scales. Airborne LiDAR datasets contain detailed information about canopy structure across large spatial scales which can be exploited within 2D transmission models. However, airborne LiDAR data typically does not resolve lower canopy elements, leading to unrealistic depictions of individual trees. We present a methodology to enhance airborne LiDAR data by calculating additional trunk and branch points based on segmentation of a canopy height model, allowing more accurate estimates of canopy shortwave transmissivity. To demonstrate this, we deployed a computationally efficient 2D radiation transfer modelling framework that calculates direct and diffuse radiation from a set of distributed synthetic hemispherical images. The model can predict incoming direct and diffuse solar radiation at the snow surface at high spatial (meter-scale) and temporal (minute-scale) resolutions. Comparison between synthetic and real hemispherical photographs showed that synthetic images, if based on enhanced LiDAR data, featured canopy and individual tree crowns that were much denser than the original LiDAR portrays, improving the representation of vegetation structure especially within dense environments and along canopy edges. Corresponding modelled total shortwave radiation matched well with spatially gridded measurements from a moving pyranometer at two sites, where model RMSE was reduced to 59 and 29 W m(-2) from 181 and 138 W m(-2), respectively, compared to the same transmission model with the original LiDAR data. Maps of snow surface shading patterns corresponded well to those seen in aerial photographs, showing the enhanced LiDAR data can be used to solve complex spatiotemporal patterns of sub-canopy incoming radiation. This work demonstrates that canopy structure information from the lower canopy is an important aspect for accurate radiation transfer modelling, and methods presented here can successfully mitigate problems inherent in many airborne LiDAR datasets to improve spatially distributed estimates of sub-canopy shortwave radiation.

AB Imbalance of residential environments in cities (e.g., slums and wealthy districts) causes serious social in-equality, negatively impacting livable city development and attracting worldwide attentions. Previous studies on residential environmental quality (REQ) mainly focused on general evaluations at city level, while ignored the spatial heterogeneity of REQ inside cities and failed to survey REQ at local scales. This study recognizes the heterogeneity of REQ strongly related to land-use patterns, and aims to explore how local land-use patterns influence REQ. Firstly, a multimodal semantic segmentation method is presented to classify land uses by using satellite images, building data and points of interests. Secondly, a feature system is defined to characterize land-use patterns, which can be extracted at multiple scales based on land-use classification results. Thirdly, these features are fitted with REQ survey data by random forest regressions, which can predict REQ scores across Beijing and give deep insights into how land-use patterns influence REQ. Experimental results indicate that 1) REQ of Beijing is strongly heterogeneous, and our method can generate a REQ map revealing REQ's imbalance across the city; 2) land-use patterns within 700 m have significant impacts on the local REQ; 3) spatial allocations of land uses are more important than proportions for influencing REQ; and 4) our method visualizes the rules that land-use patterns influence REQ, thus can assist urban land-use planning to balance and improve REQ.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is a potential technique for long-term monitoring of landslideprone areas. Pixel offset tracking methods work well for fast-moving landslides (more than tens of cm/yr). However, existing methods may present some limitations, such as (i) a high dependence of estimation window design on experience, (ii) a tradeoff between the accuracy of single points and the overall efficiency, and (iii) a low confidence in the results caused by heterogeneous in-window samples. In this paper, an improved offset tracking method is proposed to address these problems. First, the workflow is optimized by a "preseparation" step added before offset estimation to distinguish between feature matching and speckle pattern matching. The optimized workflow is more efficient for natural scenes containing both feature and non-saliency regions. Second, an improved algorithm called adaptive incoherence speckle offset tracking based on homogeneous samples (AISOT-HS) is proposed for non-saliency regions. Its two key points are (i) adaptive design of the optimal estimation windows by introducing a coherence map as a guide and (ii) offset estimation without heterogeneous samples. We apply the proposed method to study the evolution of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China) using SAR data from the Gaofen 3 (GF-3) satellite and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) system onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) satellite. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method improves the efficiency and reduces the uncertainty. We also analyze the spatiotemporal displacement pattern of this landslide, which shows that the Jinsha River landslide was most likely a thrust load-caused landslide. This study demonstrates the role of SAR remote sensing in global landslide monitoring, especially where ground truth data are scarce.

AB The eutrophication problems in lakes on the Yangtze Plain of China have attracted global concern. However, a comprehensive assessment of the eutrophication status and its evolution is still lacking for these regional lakes, mostly because of technical difficulties and/or insufficient data to cover the large region. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by using the entire archive of remote sensing images from two satellite ocean color missions (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, or MERIS (2003-2011), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument, or OLCI (2017-2018)), together with in situ data on remote sensing reflectance and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations across various lakes on the Yangtze Plain. A machine learning-based piecewise Chla algorithm was developed in this study, with special considerations to improve algorithm performance under lower Chla conditions. Remotely sensed Chla and algal bloom areas were then used to classify the eutrophication status of 50 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain, and the frequent satellite observations enabled us to estimate the probability of eutrophication occurrence (PEO) for each examined lake. The long-term mean Chla ranged from 17.58 mg m(-3) to 43.86 mg m(-3) on the Yangtze Plain, and severe floating algal blooms were found in 7 lakes. All 50 lakes had high climatological PEO values (50%) during the study period, indicating a generally high probability of eutrophication in lakes on the Yangtze Plain. However, 21 out of 51 lakes exhibited statistically significant (p<.05) decreasing trends in PEO during the observation period, suggesting an overall improvement in the water quality of lakes on the Yangtze Plain in recent years. The methods developed here are expected to contribute to real-time monitoring of drinking water safety for local regions, and the long-term results provide valuable baseline information for future lake conservation and restoration efforts.

AB Contemporary estimates of glacier changes are necessary to assess the impact of climate change, associated hazards and water resources management. Glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) are mostly retreating except the Karakoram and western Kunlun Shan, confirmed by remote sensing measurements. However, ground validation with precise measurements of these mass balance estimates are scarce. This study selected Guliya ice cap in the western Kunlun Shan to observe its recent changes regarding surface dynamics and mass balance using ASTER DEM of 2005 and 2015. Our findings indicate that one of the north-facing glaciers surged (with no previous surging history) during July and early November 2015, advancing at about 8 m per day on average. The mass balance shows a balance condition + 0.01 +/- 0.02 m w.e. a(-1). The ICESat data (2004-2008) at selected locations compared to dGPS data collected in the field during 2015, indicating a minute difference of 0.03 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) with ASTER data in the same area. Our findings suggest that Guliya ice cap in the western Kunlun Shan is in equilibrium state following a similar pattern (mass gain or stable conditions) as observed previously.

AB Quantification of snow cover changes and related phenology in global mountain areas has not been consistently addressed, despite the well-known importance of the snow in this environment. By using MODIS products from 2000 to 2018, this study reveals that around 78% of the global mountain areas are undergoing a snow decline characterized by snow cover duration decrease up to 43 days, and a snow cover area decrease up to 13%. Few areas show positive changes with snow cover duration increase up to 32 days, and snow cover area increase up to 11%, mainly during wintertime in Northern Hemisphere. Significant snow cover duration changes are related in 58% of the areas to both delayed snow onset, and earlier melt; moreover, the rate of earlier snowmelt is greater than the rate of later snow onset in the analyzed time period. Snow cover, and phenology changes are highly variable at mid-elevations, while from 4000 m upward only negative changes are detected. Air temperature is the main driver for snow onset and melt, while a combined effect of air temperature and precipitation dominates the winter season. These changes have multiple implications on water resources, ecosystem services, tourism, and energy production. The results are provided with the caveats that the short time period of the analysis (2000-2018) limit the attributions of long-term trends, and snow cover estimates are affected by uncertainties, which may be stronger in complex terrain.

AB This paper presents the temporal evolution of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) ocean wind speed retrieval performance during three years of the UK TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission. TDS-1 was launched in July 2014 and provides globally distributed spaceborne GNSS-R data over a lifespan of over three years, including several months of 24/7 operations. TDS-1 wind speeds are computed using the NOC Calibrated Bistatic Radar Equation algorithm version 0.5 (C-BRE v0.5), and are evaluated against ERA5 high resolution re-analysis data over the period 2015-2018. Analyses reveal significant temporal variability in TDS-1 monthly wind speed retrieval performance over the three years, with the best performance (similar to 2 m.s(-1)) achieved in the early part of the mission (May 2015). The temporal variability of retrieval performance is found to be driven by several non-geophysical factors, including TDS-1 platform attitude uncertainty and spatial/temporal changes in GPS transmit power from certain satellites. Evidence is presented of the impact of the GPS Block IIF Flex mode on retrieved GNSS-R wind speed after January 2017, which results in significantly underestimated ocean winds over a large region covering the North Atlantic, northern Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. These GPS transmit power changes are shown to induce large negative wind speed biases of up to 3 m.s(-1). Analyses are also presented of the sensitivity of TDS-1 wind speed retrieval to platform attitude uncertainty using statistical simulations. It is suggested that a 4 degrees increase in attitude uncertainty can produce up to 1 m.s(-1) increase in RMSE, and that TDS-1 attitude data do not fully reflect actual platform attitude. We conclude that the lack of knowledge about the GNSS-R nadir antenna gain map and TDS-1 platform-attitude limits the ability to determine the achievable wind speed retrieval performance with GNSS-R on TDS-1. The paper provides recommendations that accurate attitude knowledge and a good characterisation of GNSS-R nadir antenna patterns should be prioritised for future GNSS-R missions.

AB Remote sensing of far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an important tool for studying gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale. However, the relationship between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (f(esc)) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of near-infrared radiation. We combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.4-0.6) of fesc to the seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of SIF, defined as the product of APAR and f(esc), explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated. These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF, obtained by normalizing observed SIF for f(esc), improved only the relationship to APAR but considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote sensing based GPP estimates.

AB This work presents a new methodology to simultaneously account for both the mean and variance of 17 years of Carbon Monoxide [CO] measurements from the MOPITT satellite (from 2000 to 2016) over Southeast and East Asia. We demonstrate that the new technique is stable and produces a set of results which are both consistent with the understood geographical and temporal distribution of CO sources, as well as those of some other co-emitted species. These regions were chosen because they have high levels of CO loadings and complex factors driving their underlying emissions profiles. We first successfully categorize the region, based on the total CO column measurements, into those locations impacted by intense urbanization (high climatological mean, low climatological variance, high loading throughout most of the year, and variation mostly due to global-scale chemistry and climatology), large-scale biomass burning (low climatological mean, high climatological variance, mostly clean but with short and intense peak events occurring around a similar time year-to-year), those regions undergoing a significant change from one type to another, and those regions which are clean. We further reproduce the temporal and spatial distributions of other co-emitted species measured by other measurement platforms, including aerosols (AOD) and gasses (NO2), and demonstrate consistency across all three platforms. Third of all, we produce an important scientific finding using these new results, in terms of a significant geographic expansion of the known biomass burning regions from Myanmar through Northern Vietnam, as compared with previous research. Fourth, we also find that urbanization dominates emissions of CO over both known urban agglomerations in East and Southeast Asia, including around Beijing, Shanghai, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shandong, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hanoi and Bangkok, but also extend into otherwise unclassified or recently emerging mega-cities including Shanxi Province, Henan Province, and Liaoning Province. Additionally, we have found that there is a 37% overlap with emissions from FINN, providing both validation of the technique over known biomass burning regions, and an ability to quantify regions that are burning but not presently identified. Finally, we have a consistent and value-adding comparison and contrast with an EOF/PCA analysis in terms of both our regions classified as biomass burning and mixed/urban, with each approach offering its unique advantages and drawbacks. Although our approach has made some very simple assumptions in terms of cutoff that can and should be improved by the community, its robust results provide new insights into the rapid changes impacting CO throughout Asia, and will allow models to have an improved chance at representing peak events or areas undergoing rapid change.

AB Overcoming the obstacle of frequent cloud coverage in optical remote sensing data is essential for monitoring dynamic land surface processes from space. APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data.
   Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology.
   The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany.
   For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90% for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types.
   In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping.

AB Recently, there have been significant efforts in the integration of in-situ and satellite observations for effective monitoring of coastal areas (e.g., the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency). In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (R-rs [sr(-1)]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea. At the NJS, a direct comparison (Taylor diagram and statistical analysis) showed strong agreement between in-situ and satellite-derived WCC values (Chla: R-2 >= 0.70, RMSE <= 7.5 [mg m(-3)]; SPM: R-2 >= 0.72, RMSE <= 5.5 [g m(-)3]; CDOM absorption at 440 nm: R-2 >= 0.67, RMSE <= 1.7 [m(-1)]). Next, the plausibility of the spatial variation of retrieved WCCs over the study area was evaluated by generating maps of Chla [mg m(-3)], SPM [g m(-3]), and CDOM absorption at 440 nm [m(-1)] from MERIS and OLCI images using the MOD2SEA model. The integration of the spatio-temporal WCC data obtained from in-situ measurements and satellite images in this study finds applications for the detection of anomaly events and serves as a warning for management actions in the complex coastal waters of the Wadden Sea.

AB Over the last 20 years, substantial amounts of grassland have been converted to other land uses in the Northern Great Plains. Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1's surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year's progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = alpha + beta x AGDD - gamma x AGDD(2)). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the "same distribution" models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [alpha, beta, and gamma]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables. By summarizing annual image time series through land surface phenology modeling, LCLU classification can embrace both seasonality and interannual variability, thereby increasing the accuracy of LCLU change detection.

AB Methods to retrieve urban surface temperature (Ts) from remote sensing observations with sub-building scale resolution are developed using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART, Gastellu-Etchegorry et al., 2012) model. Corrections account for the emission and absorption of radiation by air between the surface and instrument (atmospheric correction), and for the reflected longwave infrared (LWIR) radiation from non-black-body surfaces ("emissivity" correction) within a single modelling framework. The atmospheric correction a) can use horizontally and vertically variable distributions of atmosphere properties at high resolution (<5 m); b) is applied here with vertically extrapolated weather observations and MODTRAN atmosphere profiles; and c) is a solution to ray tracing and cross section (e.g. absorption) conflicts (e.g. cross section needs the path length but it is typically unavailable during ray tracing). The emissivity correction resolves the reflection of LWIR radiation as a series of scattering events at high spatial (<1 m) and angular (Delta Omega approximate to 0.02 sr) resolution using a heterogeneous distribution of radiation leaving the urban surfaces. The method is applied to a novel network of seven ground-based cameras measuring LWIR radiation across a dense urban area (extent: 420 m x 420 m) where a detailed 3-dimensional representation of the surface and vegetation geometry is used. Our unique observation set allows the method to be tested over a range of realistic conditions as there are variations in: path lengths, view angles, brightness temperatures, atmospheric conditions and observed surface geometry. For pixels with 250 ( +/- 10) m path length the median (5th and 95th percentile) atmospheric correction magnitude is up to 4.5 (3.1 and 8.1) K at 10:10 on a mainly clear-sky day. The detailed surface geometry resolves camera pixel path lengths accurately, even with complex features such as sloped roofs.
   The atmospheric correction method evaluation, with simultaneous "near" (similar to 15 m) and "far" (similar to 155 m) observations, has a mean absolute error of 0.39 K. Using broadband approximations, the emissivity correction has clear diurnal variability, particularly when a cool and shaded surface (e.g. north facing) is irradiated by warmer (up to 17.0 K) surfaces (e.g. south facing). Varying the material emissivity with bulk values common for dark building materials (epsilon = 0.89 -> 0.97) alters the corrected roof (south facing) surface temperatures by similar to 3 (1.5) K, and the corrected cooler north facing surfaces by less than 0.1 K. Corrected observations, assuming a homogeneous radiation distribution from surfaces (analogous to a sky view factor correction), differ from a heterogeneous distribution by up to 0.25 K. Our proposed correction provides more accurate T-s observations with improved uncertainty estimates. Potential applications include ground-truthing airborne or space-borne surface temperatures and evaluation of urban energy balance models.

AB Satellite remote sensing of Land and Water Surface Temperature (L/WST) has many applications in studies of terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Retrieval of L/WST requires a well calibrated radiometer and an accurate atmospheric correction. In the present study, the performance of the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated for the retrieval of L/WST. libRadtran is used to retrieve atmospheric correction parameters based on atmospheric profiles of relative humidity and temperature from three global atmospheric models. Performance of single band retrievals is compared to typical MODTRAN results from the Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) and a split-window approach. A multi-temporal land masking method using imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat 8 is demonstrated, and is used to automatically classify imagery in the matchup dataset in three classes of cloud cover. Two sources of in situ data covering the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ) are used for validation of the L/WST product: (1) fixed locations in the Flemish Banks measurement network and (2) underway data from regular RV Belgica campaigns. In the present study the single band methods outperformed the split-window approach, and consistent retrievals are found for the MODTRAN and libRadtran simulations. Typical single band surface temperature retrievals in quasi cloud-free conditions have Root Mean Squared Differences (RMSD) of 0.7 K and 1 K for Bands 10 and 11 with low bias, depending on the method and atmospheric profile source. For imagery with scattered clouds, RMSD values increase to 1 K and 2 K respectively with an approximately 0.5 K cold bias, likely caused by cloud proximity. The calibration efforts combined into Collection 1 allows for accurate absolute surface temperature retrievals from B10 on Landsat 8/TIRS for homogeneous targets with known emissivity, such as liquid water. The method is adapted to global processing and can be used for Land Surface Temperature retrieval with a suitable source of emissivity data.

AB The complete surface temperature (T,) in urban areas, defined as the mean temperature of the total active surface area, is an important variable in urban micro-climate research, specifically for assessment of the urban surface energy balance. Since most vertically-oriented building facets are not observed by a nadir-viewing remote imaging radiometer, the radiometric surface temperature (T-r) measured at a specific view angle cannot be used with existing heat transfer equations to estimate radiative and convective fluxes in the urban environment. Thus, it is necessary to derive T-c for city neighborhoods. This study develops a simple method to estimate T-c from T-r with the aid of the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF-3D) numerical model, which calculates 3-D sub-facet scale urban surface temperatures for a variety of surface geometries and properties, weather conditions and solar angles. The effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics - e.g., building planar area index (lambda(p)), wall facet area index (F), solar irradiance - on the difference between T-c and T-r were evaluated using the TUF-3D model. Results showed the effects of geometric and meteorological characteristics on the difference between T, and T-r differ between daytime and nighttime. The study then sought to predict the relationship between T-r and T-c, using lambda(p), F, and solar irradiance for daytime and only using lambda(p), and F for nighttime. Based on the simulated data from TUF-3D, the resulting relationships achieve a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.97 and a RMSE of 1.5 K during daytime, with corresponding nighttime values of r(2) = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.69 K. The relationships between T-r and T-c are evaluated using high resolution airborne thermal images of daytime urban scenes: r(2) = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.09 K on August 6, 2013 at 12:40 pm; and r(2) = 0.86 and RMSE = 1.86K on October 24, 2017 at 11:30 am. The new relationships were also applied to estimate T-c from T-r in Hong Kong retrieved from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). In the present climatic context, the difference between T-c and T-r can reach 10 K during daytime in summer, and 6 K during daytime in winter, with seasonal variation attributable to the variations in shortwave irradiance. The nighttime difference between T-c, and T-r can also reach 2 K in both summer and spring seasons.

AB Accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC), crop residue cover (CRC), and bare soil (BS) in agricultural and vegetation-soil ecosystems is critically important. The traditional triangular space method uses a CRC spectral index (SI) and vegetation SI to create a two-dimensional scatter map in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation (FVC = 1), crop residue (CRC = 1), and bare soil (BS = 1). With this method, the CRC, FVC, and BS of each pixel are calculated based on their spatial locations in the triangular space. In practice, soil moisture and crop residue moisture (SM-CRM) affects the values of CRC spectral indices (SIs) for pure crop residue and soil, thereby reducing the accuracy of broadband remote sensing estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS. In the current work, we propose a new method for estimating fractional cover that uses a broadband spectral angle index (BAI) to estimate CRC. The proposed BAI is the included angle between (i) the line from the reflectance at band a to the reflectance at band b and (ii) the line from the reflectance at band b to the reflectance at band c, where bands a and b represent the VIS or NIR bands, respectively, and band c represents the SWIR1 or SWIR2 of the broadband remote sensing band. The proposed BAI method can mitigate the effects of soil and crop residue moisture content on spectral reflectance. This study evaluates proposed BAIs to estimate CRC and BAI-NDVI triangular space method to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS in cropland where water content varies greatly. Several different BAIs were validated using both laboratory-based measurements and field-based experiments using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument imaging. We used two laboratory-based treatments (mixed spectral reflectance of dry, saturated soil and crop residue and the mixed spectral reflectance of winter wheat leaf and dry, saturated soil and crop residue) to analyze the response of BAIs to CRC, SM-CRM, FVC, and vegetation water content. Next, we evaluated the performance of different BAIs in determining CRC based on the mixed spectral reflectance of crop residue and soil, as well as the performance of the BAI-NDVI triangular space method and linear spectral unmixing analysis to estimate CRC, FVC, and BS from mixed spectral reflectance measurements. Our results indicate that the proposed methods reduce the influence of moisture on broadband CRC SIs, provide accurate estimates of cropland CRC and fractional estimates of CRC, FVC, and BS, and may be applied in croplands where soil and crop residue moisture content varies greatly.

AB Complex dune-field landscape patterns (i.e., dune morphologies and their spatial arrangements) are recognized as indicators of dune self-organization and are required for investigating dune-field landscapes from remotely sensed images. However, dune-field landscape pattern maps are rarely available due to the insufficient attention paid to representing dune-field landscape mosaics and the labor-intensive manual interpretation processes in prior studies. Moreover, automatic or semi-automated dune-field landscape pattern mapping methods are still absent, resulting from a lack of appropriate image units to represent the heterogeneous dune-field landscape patches (DLPs). To address above issues, this study makes the first attempt to apply geoscenes, a new kind of complex units proposed recently, in dune-field landscapes and proposes a multiscale segmentation approach. The proposed approach is able to represent DLPs at multiple scales on images by integrating multisource features (i.e., class-related spatial-pattern features and the line-spatial-pattern features) in a unified segmentation framework. Visual and quantitative assessments of multiscale segmentation results demonstrate that our approach can delineate DLPs effectively. Comparisons among our approach, the multiresolution segmentation in eCognition software and an urban geoscene segmentation approach also reveal the superiority of our approach. This study is hence of great significance for dune-field landscape pattern mapping and offers a potential to be coupled into other landscape investigations.

AB It has been widely reported that Arctic sea ice has decreased in both extent and thickness, coupled with steadily rising mean annual temperatures. These trends have been particularly severe along the rock coast of southern Svalbard. Concerns have been raised over the potential for higher energy storms and longer ice-free open water seasons to increase the exposure of Arctic coasts, and consequently the concentration of infrastructure critical to Arctic community survival, to enhanced rates of erosion. Here we present and apply innovative remote sensing, monitoring and process analyses to assess the impact of recent coastal climatic changes. High resolution analyses demonstrate that the small scale ( < 0.001 m(3)) changes that are rarely considered quantitatively exhibit geomorphic responses distinct from those of larger, more readily detected cliff failures. We monitor temperature depth profiles in both the shore platform and the cliff face to show rock sensitivity over time to both global and local influences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of thermal processes on Arctic rock cliffs relative to platforms, and may hold implications for understanding strandflat development rates. New three-dimensional thermography (thermal mapping) and process zone characterisation has been used to spatially assess the sensitivity of Arctic rock coast responses to contemporary processes on deglaciating coasts. Through the spatial and temporal analyses of key geomorphic behaviour zones and comparison over a range of sites, the complex and changing interplay between subaerial weathering and cryogenic and intertidal processes has been highlighted. These data challenge long standing assumptions over the future of Arctic rock coasts and identify new, focused lines of enquiry on the decline in cryogenic processes and understanding the sensitivity of Arctic rock coasts to climatic changes.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) composed of transpiration from vegetation (ETveg) and evaporation from soil (ETsoil) and interception water (ETint) is a crucial process for driving global water and energy cycle. In this study, a three-source satellite ET algorithm is developed for estimating instantaneous ET rate (ETcal) under clear and non-rainy cloudy sky conditions and is validated at 20 AsiaFlux sites of multiple vegetation types (evergreen and deciduous forests, croplands and grasslands) in East Asia. The ET algorithm is completely independent from ground-based measurements and thus has the potential to be used on regional scale. All-sky surface net radiation flux is derived from satellite products. Satellite optical Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to partition the surface available energy into vegetated area and bare soil area. Satellite microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI), an indicator of vegetation water content, is utilized to estimate canopy resistance and transpiration from vegetation. Evaporation components from canopy interception water and soil surface are estimated based on Priestley-Taylor method. The estimated evaporation fraction (EF) for all sites can produce a small absolute bias of less than 0.03 (or 8.1%) with a good determination coefficient (R-2) larger than 0.42 when validated against the corrected in-situ measured EF on instantaneous and long-term mean scales. Instantaneous ETcal under all sky conditions are found to have a R-2 of 0.61, a bias of 16.5 Wm(-2) (13.7%) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 63.6 Wm(-2) (52.5%) over all sites, respectively. The performances of this algorithm are better achieved on 16-day (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 44.1 Wm(-2)) and monthly (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 39.1 Wm(-2)) scales. More importantly, EDVI-based ET method is able to produce ETcal with stable and good accuracy from clear sky to overcast sky (bias < 22 Wm(-2) or 18%, RMSE < 77 Wm(-2) or 59%). The daily ET and its components (ETveg, ETsoil and ETint) derived from our algorithm are further compared with those from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET products. EDVI-based ET (EDVI-ET) generally shows equal performances with GLEAM-ET when using in-situ ET as reference. EDVI-ET veg shows a fairly good correlation (R-2 = 0.21) and an underestimation of -0.32 mm/day compared with GLEAM-ETveg. EDVI-ETint shows a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.30) with GLEAM-ETveg after excluding three outlier tropical forest sites. Meanwhile, EDVI-ETsoil shows a fairly good positive correlation (R-2 = 0.15) and an overestimation of 0.23 mm/day compared with GLEAMET, ETsoil] . The results indicate that our method has great potential for regional ET estimation under various cloud conditions when combined with satellite optical and microwave remote sensing.

AB Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images collected over periods of several months were used to estimate vegetation height for Gabon and Switzerland. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to extract suitable spectral and textural features from reflectance images and to regress per-pixel vegetation height. In Gabon, reference heights for training and validation were derived from airborne LiDAR measurements. In Switzerland, reference heights were taken from an existing canopy height model derived via photogrammetric surface reconstruction. The resulting maps have a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.7 m in Switzerland and 4.3 m in Gabon (a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.4 m and 5.6 m, respectively), and correctly estimate vegetation heights up to >50 m. They also show good qualitative agreement with existing vegetation height maps. Our work demonstrates that, given a moderate amount of reference data (i.e., 2000 km(2) in Gabon and approximate to 5800 km(2) in Switzerland), high-resolution vegetation height maps with 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) can be derived at country scale from Sentinel-2 imagery.

AB Forest ecosystems have been increasingly affected by a variety of disturbances, including emerging infectious diseases (ElDs), causing extensive tree mortality in the Western United States. Especially over the past decade, EID outbreaks occurred more frequently and severely in forest landscapes, which have killed large numbers of trees. While tree mortality is observable from remote sensing, its symptom may be associated with both disease and non-disease disturbances (e.g., wildfire and drought). Species distribution modeling is widely used to understand species spatial preferences for certain habitat conditions, which may constrain uncertain remote sensing approaches due to limited spatial and spectral resolution. In this study, we integrated multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling to map disease-caused tree mortality in a forested area of 80,000 ha from 2005 to 2016. We selected sudden oak death (caused by pathogen P. ramorum) as a case study of a rapidly spreading emerging infectious disease, which has killed millions of oak (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densifiorus) in California over the past decades. To balance the needs for fine-scale monitoring of disease distribution patterns and satisfactory coverage at broad scales, our method applied spectral unmixing to extract sub-pixel disease presence using yearly Landsat time series. The results were improved by employing the probability of disease infection generated from a species distribution model. We calibrated and validated the method with image samples from high-spatial resolution NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program), and hyperspectral AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) sensors, Google Earth (R) imagery, and field observations. The findings reveal an annual sudden oak death infection rate of 7% from 2005 to 2016, with overall mapping accuracies ranging from 76% to 83%. The integration of multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling considerably reduced the overestimation of disease effects as compared to the use of remote sensing alone, leading to an average of 26% decrease in detecting disease-affected trees. Such integration strategy proved the effectiveness of mapping long-term, disease-caused tree mortality in forest landscapes that have experienced multiple disturbances.

AB Soil salinity increase is a serious and global threat to agricultural production. The only database that currently provides soil salinity data with global coverage is the Harmonized World Soil Database, but it has several limitations when it comes to soil salinity assessment. Therefore, a new assessment is required. We hypothesized that combining soil properties maps with thermal infrared imagery and a large set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a global soil salinity map. The thermal infrared imagery acts as a dynamic variable and allows us to characterize the soil salinity change. For this purpose we used Google Earth Engine computational environment. The random forest classifier was trained using 7 soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. In total, six maps were produced for 1986, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2016. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67-70%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend. Comparison with 3 studies investigating local trends of soil salinity change showed that our assessment was in correspondence with 2 of these studies. The global map of soil salinity change between 1986 and 2016 was produced to characterize the spatial distribution of the change. We conclude that combining soil properties maps and thermal infrared imagery allows mapping of soil salinity development in space and time on a global scale.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable linking the global water, carbon and energy cycles, while accurate ET estimates are crucial for understanding cropland water use in context with agricultural management. Satellite remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous information that can be used for global ET estimation. The NASA MODIS MOD16A2 operational product provides 500-m 8-day global ET estimates extending from 2001 to present. However, reliable estimates for delineating field level cropland ET patterns are lacking. In this investigation, we modified the MOD16 global algorithm to better represent cropland ET by calibrating model parameters according to C3 and C4 crop types, and incorporating finer scale satellite vegetation inputs to derive 30-m cropland ET estimates over the continental USA (CONUS). Similar overlapping enhanced vegetation index (EVI) records from Landsat and MODIS were used to generate a continuous 30-m 8-day fused EVI and ET record extending from 2008 to 2017 over CONUS croplands. The satellite-based ET estimates were compared with tower based ET observations over different crop types, and more traditional cropland actual ET (AET) estimates derived from reference ET and crop-specific coefficients. The new satellite based 30-m cropland ET estimates (ET30m) corresponded favorably with both tower ET observations (ETflux; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.70 mm d(-1), bias = 0.04 mm d(-1)) and the baseline global MOD16A2 ET product (ETMOD16). The ET30m results also showed better performance against the ETflux observations than ETMOD16 (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.82 mm d(-1)) or AET (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 2.47 mm d(-1)) for monitoring CONUS croplands. The spatial and temporal patterns of the ET3m results show enhanced delineation of agricultural water use, including impacts from variable climate, cropland area and diversity. The resulting ET30m record is suitable for operational applications promoting more effective agricultural water management and food security.

AB We present a method for remote sensing based monitoring of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning based on the assumption that an altered vegetation rainfall relationship (VRR) indicates changes in vegetation biophysical processes, potentially leading to changes in ecosystem functioning. We describe the VRR through a linear regression between integrated rainfall and vegetation productivity (using NDVI as a proxy) within a combined spatio-temporal window, sequentially moved over the study area and along the temporal axis of a time series. The trend in the slope values derived from such a sequential linear regression, termed SeRGS, thus represents a measure of change in the VRR. Scenarios of land degradation, defined here as a reduction in biological productivity, which may be caused by either climatic or anthropogenic factors are simulated for the period 1970-2016 from CRU rainfall and modelled NDVI data to test and evaluate the performance of the SeRGS method in detecting degradation, and compare it against the well-known RESTREND method. We found that SeRGS showed (1) overall more pronounced trends and higher significance levels (p <= 0.01) in detecting degradation events and (2) an improved statistical basis for the calculation of trends in the VRR (expressed by high coefficients of determination throughout the period of analysis), which was found to increase the validity of the results produced. Through the implementation of the temporal moving window the effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on vegetation productivity was effectively reduced, thereby enabling a more exact and reliable identification of the timing of degradation events (e.g. start, maximum and end of degradation) by using a time series breakpoint analysis (BFAST). Finally, the SeRGS method was applied using real data for Senegal (seasonally integrated MODIS NDVI and CHIRPS rainfall data 2000-2016) and we discuss patterns and trends. This study provides the theoretical basis for an improved assessment of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning, which is of relevance to land degradation monitoring targeting loss of vegetation productivity.

AB Lidar is an established tool for mapping forest structure, but its sparse spatial and temporal coverage often preclude its use in studying forest disturbance. In contrast, aerial imagery has been and continues to be regularly collected in many regions, and advances in stereo image matching have automated the creation of dense photogrammetric point clouds, which can also be used to map forest structure when paired with an accurate digital terrain model. As part of a study of the physical and ecological impacts of the 2012 High Park fire in Colorado, we generated a photogrammetric point cloud from pre-fire aerial imagery collected in 2008 and combined it with a digital terrain model generated from a 2013 post-fire lidar collection to produce canopy metrics commonly used in modelling of forest structure. We explore the correlation structure between the lidar and photogrammetry-derived canopy metrics, and the relationships between those metrics and forest structure attributes measured at unburned plots in the vicinity of the burn scar. Most corresponding lidar- and photogrammetry-derived canopy metrics had strong linear relationships between them (median r = 0.82), and metrics from both datasets yielded similar root mean square errors in multiple regression models of aboveground biomass (29.3% and 31.0%), basal area (29.8% and 27.7%), and several other forest structure attributes. We found the source of the canopy metrics (lidar or photogrammetry) to be a non-significant factor in some models of forest structure, suggesting that these datasets may be interchangeable in particular cases. Models derived from pre-fire aerial imagery were combined with burn severity information to quantify loss of biomass (2.31 +/- 0.001 Tg) and examine possible relationships between forest structure and burn severity. These applications illustrate how the broad spatial and temporal coverage of aerial imagery and growing coverage of lidar can be utilized to improve understanding of changes in forest structure, including assessments of forest carbon flux.

AB Land cover (LC) and land use (LU) have commonly been classified separately from remotely sensed imagery, without considering the intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between them. In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18% for LC and 87.92% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner.

AB Increases in liana abundance in tropical forests are pervasive threats to the current and future forest carbon stocks. Never before has the need been more evident for new approaches to detect the presence of liana in ecosystems, given their significance as fingerprints of global environmental change. In this study, we explore the use of longwave infrared reflectance (LWIR, 8-11 mu m) as a wavelength region for the classification of liana and tree leaves and compare classification results with those obtained using visible-near infrared reflectance data (VIS-NIR, 0.45-0.95 mu m). Twenty sun leaves were collected from each of 14 liana species and 21 tree species located at the canopy or forest edge (n = 700) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. LWIR and VIS-NIR reflectance measurements were performed on these leaves using a portable calibrated Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Agilent ExoScan 4100 and a UniSpec spectral analysis system, respectively. The VIS-NIR and LWIR data were first resampled. Then these two spectral libraries were pre-processed for noise reduction and spectral feature enhancement resulting in three datasets for each spectral region as follows: filtered only, filtered followed by extraction of the first derivative, and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Data reduction was then applied to these data sets using principal components analysis (PCA). The outputs obtained from the PCA were used to conduct the supervised classification of liana and tree leaves. In total, 21 classifiers were applied to datasets of training and testing to extract the classification accuracy and agreement for liana and tree leaves. The results suggest that the classification of leaves based on LWIR data can reach accuracy values between 66 and 96% and agreement values between 32 and 92%, regardless of the type of classifier. In contrast, the classification based on VIS-NIR data shows accuracy values between 50 and 70% and agreement values between 0.01 and 40%. The highest classification rates of liana and tree leaves were obtained from datasets pre-processed using the CWT or from the extraction of the first derivative and classified using either random forest, k-nearest neighbor, or support vector machine with radial kernel. The results using the LWIR reflectance highlight the potential of this spectral region for the accurate detection of liana extent in tropical ecosystems. Future studies should consider this potential and test the regional monitoring of lianas.

AB Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a useful representative of soil fertility and an essential parameter in controlling the dynamics of various agrochemicals in soil. Soil texture is also used to calculate soil's ability to retain water for plant growth. SOC and soil texture are thus important parameters of agricultural soils and need to be regularly monitored. Optical satellite remote sensing offers the potential for frequent surveys over large areas. In addition, the recently-operated Sentinel-2 missions provide free imagery. This study compared the capabilities of Sentinel 2 for monitoring and mapping of SOC and soil texture (clay, silt and sand content) with those obtained from airborne hyperspectral (CASI/SASI sensors) and lab ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer measurements at four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. Combination of 10 extracted bands of the Sentinel-2 and 18 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models and then produce spatial distribution maps of the selected attributes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy based on lab spectroscopy, airborne and Sentinel-2 in the majority of the sites was adequate for SOC and fair for clay; however, Sentinel-2 imagery could not be used to detect and map variations in silt and sand. The SOC and clay maps derived from the airborne and spaceborne datasets showed similar trend, with both performing better where SOC levels were relatively high, though at the highest levels Sentinel-2 was able to create the SOC map more precisely than the airborne sensors. Taken across all SOC levels measured in the reference data, Sentinel-2 results were marginally lower than lab spectroscopy and airborne imagery, but this reduction in precision may be offset by the extensive geographical coverage and more frequent revisit characteristic of satellite observation. The increased temporal revisit and area are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality information on variations in SOC and clay content of bare soils.

AB This study aimed to investigate the capability of the two-stream radiative transfer model 2SeaColor for the simultaneous retrieval of Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) concentrations from remote sensing measurements under various conditions (i.e., solar zenith angle values (SZAs) and water turbidity levels). For this evaluation, a time series of diurnal in-situ hyperspectral measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) concurrent with in-situ measured Chla and SPM concentrations between 2008 and 2010 by the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS), located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, was used. Validation of the model retrievals against in-situ measurements showed an acceptable accuracy (Chla: R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 2.98 [mg m(-3)]; SPM: R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 2.53 [g m(-3)]) with good agreement between the temporal trends of measured and retrieved concentration values over multiple years. However, the model inversion results yielded less good estimates at SZA > 60 degrees during winter. Furthermore, the effect of the tide on the variation of daily time series of Chla and SPM concentrations was analyzed. At the particular NJS location, the tidal effects on the concentrations of SPM and Chla were found to be small. The capability of the 2SeaColor model to retrieve reliable estimates, and the favorable location of the NJS, which is little influenced by tidal phase variations, contribute to a better understanding of the long-term variability of Chla and SPM concentrations. The results of this study may support the ongoing efforts on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) calibration and validation at the Dutch Wadden Sea.

AB Tropical dry forests and savannas provide important ecosystem services and harbor high biodiversity, yet are globally under pressure from land-use change. Mapping changes in the condition of dry forests and savannas is therefore critical. This can be challenging given that these ecosystems are characterized by continuous gradients of tree and shrub cover, resulting in considerable structural complexity. We developed a novel approach to map, separately, continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover across the South American Gran Chaco (1,100,000 km(2)), making full use of the Landsat-8 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image archives. We gathered a large training dataset digitized from very-high resolution imagery and used a gradient-boosting framework to model continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover at 30-m resolution. Our regression models had high to moderate predictive power (85.5% for tree cover, and 68.5% for shrub cover) and resulted in reliable tree and shrub cover maps (mean squared error of 4.4% and 6.4% for tree- and shrub cover respectively). Models jointly using optical and SAR imagery performed substantially better than models using single-sensor imagery, and model predictors differed strongly in some regions, especially in areas of dense vegetation cover. Mapping tree and shrub cover separately allowed identifying distinct vegetation formations, with shrub-dominated systems mainly in the very dry Chaco, woodlands with large trees mainly in the dry Chaco, and tree-dominated savannas in the wet Chaco. Our tree and shrub cover layers also revealed considerable edge effects in terms of woody cover away from agricultural fields (edge effects extending about 2 km), smallholder ranches (about 1.2 km), and roads and railways (about 1.4 and 0.9 km, respectively). Our analyses highlight both the substantial footprint of land-use on remaining natural vegetation in the Chaco, and the potential of multi-sensoral approaches to monitor forest degradation. More broadly, our approach shows that mapping canopy structure and distinct layers of woody vegetation in dry forest and savannas is possible across large areas, and highlights the value of the growing Landsat and Sentinel archives for doing so.

AB We have mapped the broad groups of crops grown each summer and winter, from 1987 to 2017, for a 300,000km 2 region of Queensland, Australia. These maps are part of a legislated decision-making process for the protection of prime agricultural land. For summer, the two groups of crops are 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' and 'Cotton'. For winter, the two groups of crops are 'Cereal' and 'Pulse'. Non-crop groups, present in both summer and winter, are 'Bare soil' and 'Other' (comprising pastures, woody vegetation, and crop residues). The foundation of the maps is time-series modelling-specifically, applying the concepts of geostatistics in the temporal domain-to model the variation in land-surface phonology within a growing season. The time-series model is flexible, robust, parsimonious, parallelisable, and able to deal with irregular observations. We combined satellite imagery from the Landsat sensors, as well as, when available, Sentinel-2A and MODIS (with the last two reprojected to the 30m grid of Landsat). We applied the time-series model pixel-wise across the study region, to three variables derived from satellite imagery gathered for an individual growing season: enhanced vegetation index, and the sub-pixel proportions of bare-ground and non-photosynthetic vegetation. Weekly-averaged predicted phenological metrics then served as explanatory variables in a tiered, tree-based classification model, for the prediction of the groups. The classification model comprised two expert rules and two random forests. Prior to fitting the classification model, geospatial object-based image analysis was used to change the scale of analysis from individual pixels to (approximately) field-based segments. From the perspective of a map-user, in any given growing season we predicted 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' correctly in 79% of cases; the values for 'Cotton', 'Cereal', and 'Pulse' were 90%, 84%, and 73%, respectively; 'Bare soil' was 72% in summer, and 88% in winter. 'Other' was the most accurately mapped group (98% correct in summer, and 99% correct in winter).

AB Fire is a widespread Earth system process with important carbon and climate feedbacks. Multispectral remote sensing has enabled mapping of global spatiotemporal patterns of fire and fire effects, which has significantly improved our understanding of interactions between ecosystems, climate, humans and fire. With several upcoming spaceborne hyperspectral missions like the Environmental Mapping And Analysis Program (EnMAP), the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) and the Precursore Iperspettrale Della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), we provide a review of the state-of-the-art and perspectives of hyperspectral remote sensing of fire. Hyperspectral remote sensing leverages information in many (often more than 100) narrow (smaller than 20 nm) spectrally contiguous bands, in contrast to multispectral remote sensing of few (up to 15) non-contiguous wider (greater than 20 nm) bands.
   To date, hyperspectral fire applications have primarily used airborne data in the visible to short-wave infrared region (VSWIR, 0.4 to 2.5 mu m). This has resulted in detailed and accurate discrimination and quantification of fuel types and condition, fire temperatures and emissions, fire severity and vegetation recovery. Many of these applications use processing techniques that take advantage of the high spectral resolution and dimensionality such as advanced spectral mixture analysis. So far, hyperspectral VSWIR fire applications are based on a limited number of airborne acquisitions, yet techniques will approach maturity for larger scale application when spaceborne imagery becomes available. Recent innovations in airborne hyperspectral thermal (8 to 12 pm) remote sensing show potential to improve retrievals of temperature and emissions from active fires, yet these applications need more investigation over more fires to verify consistency over space and time, and overcome sensor saturation issues. Furthermore, hyperspectral information and structural data from, for example, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are highly complementary. Their combined use has demonstrated advantages for fuel mapping, yet its potential for post-fire severity and combustion retrievals remains largely unexplored.

AB To address uncertainty in biomass estimates across spatial scales, we determined aboveground biomass (AGB) in Californian forests through the use of individual tree detection methods applied to small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We propagated errors originating from a generalized allometric equation, LiDAR measurements, and individual tree detection algorithms to AGB estimates at the tree and plot levels. Larger uncertainties than previously reported at both tree and plot levels were found when AGB was derived from remote sensing. On average, per-tree AGB error was 135% of the estimated AGB, and per-plot error was 214% of the estimated AGB. We found that from tree to plot level, the allometric equation constituted the largest proportion of the total AGB uncertainty. The proportion of the uncertainty associated with remote sensing errors was larger in lower AGB forests, and it decreased as AGB increased. The framework in which we performed the error propagation analysis can be used to address AGB uncertainties in other ecosystems and can be integrated with other analytical techniques.

AB Three extensive global wind speed and wave height datasets (altimeter, radiometer, model reanalysis) are analysed to investigate the global wind speed and wave height climate. Despite the fact that these datasets have all been carefully calibrated, they show systematic differences in wind speed. At high latitudes both altimeter and radiometer winds are biased high compared to buoy measurements. Altimeter winds are more impacted than radiometer winds. Based on the assumptions that altimeter winds respond primarily to the surface wave spectrum mean squared slope and radiometer winds respond primarily to the surface wave spectrum dissipation, it is shown that the observed differences are a result of changes in atmospheric stability. An analysis which accounts for differences in air and water temperatures describes the observed differences with surprising accuracy. Based on this analysis corrections to both altimeter and radiometer winds are proposed which account for the influence of atmospheric stability. It is also shown that satellites preferentially measure at particular local times of day. As winds have a diurnal variation in magnitude, this preferential measurement time can also bias statistical values obtained from such satellite systems.

AB Crop sowing date information is important for driving crop models and estimating crop yield. However, data on sowing dates are often scarce for both developed and developing countries, making remote sensing approaches to map sowing date an attractive approach. Yet the relative merits of different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate sowing date have not been well studied. We assess and compare the accuracies and uncertainties of satellite-derived sowing date estimates using different metrics (inflection point and threshold approaches) and satellite sensors that cover the range in the electromagnetic spectrum (optical, fluorescence, and radar). We validate these estimates using a county-level dataset derived from area-weighted field-level reported sowing dates for maize and soybean in the US states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, and conduct our analysis both at the county level and at the aggregated tri-state region. We specifically use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Ku-band backscattering from QuikSCAT (dB). We also compare the inflection point method and the threshold approach that defines sowing date as a specific threshold value (10%, 30% and 50%) between the minimum and maximum value in a logistic-curve smoothed phonology. We find that satellite-based estimate of sowing dates from all methods and sensors shows a wide range of predictive power at the county level, with R-2 ranging between 0.15 and 0.90, with significant variation across sensors. SIF has excellent prediction for more counties than the other sensors, but EVI performs more consistently with moderate to good prediction for the greatest bulk of counties among all sensors, while dB's predicted sowing dates are negatively correlated with observed dates for most counties. For each sensor, aggregation to the regional level produces time series of predicted sowing dates that more successfully capture linear time trends and inter-annual variability. Adjusting for spring temperatures and crop areal coverage significantly improves the accuracies of the estimated sowing dates at both the county and regional scales. Among the combinations of the three satellite products and four metrics, we find using SIF and/or EVI and the 30% threshold metric have the highest accuracies in terms of reproducing inter-annual variability and minimizing RMSE at regional scales. This study provides a systematic assessment of using different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate county- to regional scale crop sowing dates, which has important implications for mapping sowing date in data-limited regions across the globe.

AB Recent ice shelf disintegrations on the Antarctic Peninsula and subsequent increases in ice sheet mass loss have highlighted the importance of tracking ice shelf stability with respect to surface melt ponding and hydrofracture. In this study, we use active microwave scatterometry in time-series to estimate melt season duration, and winter backscatter levels as a proxy for relative concentration of refrozen ice lenses in Antarctic ice shelf firn. We demonstrate a physical relationship between melt days and firn/ice backscatter using scatterometry and field data from Greenland, and apply the observed relationship to derive and map a vulnerability index for Antarctica's ice shelves. The index reveals that some remaining Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves have already reached a firn state that is vulnerable to hydrofracture. We also show that the progression of an ice shelf towards vulnerability is affected by many factors, such as surface mass balance, internal stresses, and ice shelf geometry.

AB A consistent and hierarchical classification of vegetation, such as the U.S. National Vegetation Classification. (NVC) system, supports comprehensive conservation and management of natural ecosystems. At a detailed level, the NVC alliance is defined by diagnostic species and composition. Maps at this level of classification are often produced at local to regional scales (areas < 25,000 km(2)) with costly manual to semi-automated interpretation of high resolution imagery. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of machine learning for automated, per-pixel (30 m) mapping of forest alliances with multi-seasonal hyperspectral imagery from a future satellite mission (HyspIRI), as simulated from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Classic (AVIRIS-C) data. The study area was the San Francisco (S.F.) Bay Area, California, where we mapped forest alliances at regional and county scales. We implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in a two stage approach, first mapping regional land cover followed by forest alliances in closed-canopy tree pixels. Predictor variables were reflectance bands and hyperspectral metrics based on indices, derivatives and absorption-fitting techniques applied to reflectance spectra, with data grouped into summer and three-season (spring, summer, fall) sets. For forest alliances, hyperspectral metrics improved overall accuracy of classifications by 2.9 to 6.4% relative to classifications based on the original reflectance bands. Multi-seasonal data improved overall accuracy by 1.3 to 6.2% relative to summer-only data. Using multi-seasonal metrics, the S.F. Bay Area regional classification with 21 alliances had an overall accuracy of 65.7% (Kappa 0.63), while the Sonoma County classification with 16 alliances had an accuracy of 75.9% (Kappa 0.72). Most forest alliances had internal variation in lifeform, species and structural properties that increased within-class spectral-temporal variation and complicated discrimination. Despite this challenge, classification accuracies were similar to regional NVC alliance reference data. We conclude that a hyperspectral satellite, with its repeat and global image acquisitions, has strong potential for accurate and economical mapping and monitoring the Earth's vegetation communities.

AB Although numerous approaches for deriving water depth from bands of remotely-sensed imagery in the visible spectrum exist, digital terrain models for remote tropical carbonate landscapes remain few in number. The paucity is due, in part, to the lack of in situ measurements of pertinent information needed to tune water depth derivation algorithms. In many cases, the collection of the needed ground-truth data is often prohibitively expensive or logistically infeasible. We present an approach for deriving water depths up to 15 m in Case 1 waters, whose inherent optical properties can be adequately described by phytoplankton, using multi-spectral satellite imagery without the need for direct measurement of water depth, bottom reflectance, or water column properties within the site of interest. The reliability of the approach for depths up to 15 m is demonstrated for ten satellite images over five study sites. For this depth range, overall RMSE values range from 0.89 m to 2.62 m when using a chlorophyll concentration equal to 0.2 mg m(-3) and a generic seafloor spectrum generated from a spectral library of common benthic constituents. Accuracy of water depth predictions drastically decreases beyond these depths. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is robust to selection of bottom reflectance inputs and sensitive to parameterization of chlorophyll concentration.

AB Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 +/- 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 +/- 3%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.

AB Detailed and up-to-date knowledge on the situation in temporary settlements of forced migrants plays an important role for effective humanitarian assistance. These settlements emerge as planned or spontaneous camps or camp-like structures, characterized by a small-scale physical morphology and high dynamics. Information on the built-up area (BUA; i.e. areas occupied by buildings) in these settlements provides important evidence on the local situation. The objective of this work is to present a generic procedure for the detailed extraction of BUA in complex temporary settlements from very high spatial resolution satellite data collected by different sensor types. The proposed approach is embedded in the methodological framework of object-based image analysis and is compound of i) the computation of an exhaustive set of spectral-spatial features aggregated on multiple hierarchic segmentation scales, ii) filter based feature subset selection and iii) supervised classification using a Random Forest classifier. Experimental results are obtained based on Pleiades multispectral optical and TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery for six distinct but representative test areas within the refugee camp Al Zaatari in Jordan. The experiments include a detailed assessment of classification accuracy for varying configurations of considered feature types and training data set sizes as well as an analysis of the feature selection (FS) outcomes. We observe that the classification accuracy can be improved by the use of multiple segmentation levels as well as the integration of multi-sensor information and different feature types. In addition, the results show the potential of the applied FS approach for the identification of most relevant features. Accuracy values beyond 80% in terms of kappa statistic and True Skill Statistic based on significantly reduced feature sets compared to the input underline the potential of the proposed method.

AB Effective modeling of many hydrological and climatological processes requires accurate spatial characterization of soil moisture, often over large regions and across different spatial scales. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be sensitive to surface soil moisture, and is therefore a promising alternative to field data campaigns. However, the presence of spatially-variable vegetation and surface roughness also affect SAR backscatter. In this research, empirical models were developed to both predict soil moisture from SAR and assess the relationship between LiDAR-derived vegetation and surface conditions, and polarimetric SAR parameters in a vegetated peatland environment. Importantly, the low predictive strength of soil moisture models was only evident through a process of model cross-validation (bivariate regression R-2 ranged from 0.14 to 0.66 for fitted models and 0.05 to 0.41 for independently cross-validated models). The LiDAR-derived vegetation density was found to explain a large amount of variance in the SAR data, and models to predict soil moisture from SAR from only the least vegetated sites within the peatland demonstrated much higher predictive strength (R-2 = 0.11 to 0.71). Soil moisture within the vegetated and least-vegetated sites was not significantly different. Therefore, non vegetated areas may be useful as representative imaging locations for remotely monitoring surface moisture conditions in large peatland complexes with heterogeneous vegetation.

AB GRACE gravity variation recovery and InSAR-derived ground displacement data show promise in supporting and assessing groundwater management policies. However, GRACE system's resolution is too low, and the inversion of InSAR data into volume of groundwater storage loss requires extensive and often unavailable lithological data. Here we present how InSAR can be used to constrain and spatially focus GRACE-derived groundwater mass loss to depletion areas, reducing the gap between the GRACE scale and the typical water management scales. While we highlight the tremendous potential of a fully geodetic, quantitative, and high resolution mapping of groundwater storage loss, we also point out the crucial need for producing guidelines on the proper GRACE solution to use for any study area and/or application.
   In order to illustrate the GRACE/InSAR combination procedure, we present a case study in Central Mexico, where groundwater depletion of similar to 5000 Million Cubic Meters per year (MCM/yr) is reported by the water governance agencies and is well documented in the scientific literature. However, in this region, not all GRACE solutions provide reasonable groundwater depletion estimates. Using two of them, an inversion is performed to focus the groundwater-related GRACE signal over different mass distribution maps. Several mass distributions are tested, including two from InSAR-derived aquifer compaction mapping. The results show that the regions of Mexico City and Bajio, an agricultural and industrial corridor 250 km North of Mexico City, are the main contributors to the regional groundwater depletion. The mass distribution map produced directly from InSAR leads to results closer to official groundwater budgets than the others tested.

AB Different remote sensing data were combined to characterise a winter anticyclonic eddy in the southeastern Bay of Biscay and to infer its effects on cross-shelf exchanges, in a period when typical along shelf-slope currents depict a cyclonic pattern. While the joint analysis of available satellite data (infrared, visible and altimetry) permitted the characterisation and tracking of the anticyclone properties and path, data from a coastal high-frequency radar system enabled a quantitative analysis of the surface cross-shelf transports associated with this anticyclone. The warm core anticyclone had a diameter of around 50 km, maximum azimuthal velocities near 50 cm s(-1) and a relative vorticity of up to -0.45f. The eddy generation occurred after the relaxation of a cyclonic wind-driven current regime over the shelf-slope; then, the eddy remained stationary for several weeks until it started to drift northwards along the shelf break. The surface signature of this eddy was observed by means of high-frequency radar data for 20 consecutive days, providing a unique opportunity to characterise and quantify, from a Lagrangian perspective, the associated transport and its effect on the Chl-a surface distribution. We observed the presence of mesoscale structures with similar characteristics in the area during different winters within the period 2011-2014. Our results suggest that the eddy-induced recurrent cross-shelf export is an effective mechanism for the expansion of coastal productive waters into the adjacent oligotrophic ocean basin.

AB Topographical information is of fundamental interest for a wide range of disciplines including glaciology, agriculture, communication network planning, or hazard management. In volcanology, elevation data are of particular importance when assessing material flows throughout a volcanic system. To obtain accurate estimates of time-varying topography in volcanic active regions, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are required. To monitor and evaluate topographical changes and especially volumetric gains and losses during the 2014-2015 Baroarbunga eruption, Iceland, multi-temporal TanDEM-X DEM sequences were evaluated.
   The 2014-2015 volcanic eruption was associated with the rare event of a caldera collapse, visible on the surface of the Vatnajokull glacier, as well as major lava effusion in the Holuhraun plain. Before investigating topographical change at the two study areas, the TanDEM-X DEMs were analysed for absolute and relative height errors resulting from the radar system parameters, the SAR processing or the local environment. The uncertainty investigation determined that acquisitions over the snow-covered Baroarbunga caldera were primarily affected by microwave penetration into snow and DEMs over the Holuhraun lava field exhibited increased height errors due to active lava flows and dynamic outwash plain.
   The topographical analysis of the 2014-2015 Baroarbunga eruption revealed a maximum vertical displacement of approximately -65 m and + 43 m at the study area of the Baroarbunga caldera and Holuhraun lava field respectively. With a total subsidence volume of -1.40 +/- 0.13 km(3) and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) lava volume of +1.36 +/- 0.07 km(3), known uncertainties in volume were decreased by approximately 35% and 77% accordingly. Taking into account the calculation of rates, the temporal development of caldera collapse and lava effusion was found to exhibit a near-exponential decrease. The ratio between subsidence and DRE lava volume moreover indicated the coupling between piston collapse and magma drainage.

AB Estimating sea ice motion from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery at C-band is the most reliable approach because of its high spatial resolution and ever increasing temporal resolution given the multiple current and upcoming SAR platforms. However, there is still uncertainty in SAR derived sea ice motion depending on the ice type and its thermodynamic state. There have been suggestions (mostly theoretical) that use of L-band SAR and its inherent longer wavelength (15-30 cm) and subsequent increased penetration capability could be beneficial for estimating sea ice motion, especially during the melt season. Here, we estimate and analyze sea ice motion for 9 pairs of C- and L-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2, PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 located in the Canadian Arctic over a variety of sea ice types at different thermodynamic states. Results show that the increased signal penetration of L-band SAR into multi-year ice (MYI) during the melt season facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over newly formed ice and dry first-year ice, the reduced sensitivity to surface scattering and richer texture from L-band SAR imagery facilitates the detection of more motion vectors with stronger cross-correlation coefficients compared to C-band SAR. Over dry MYI, L-band provided stronger cross-correlation coefficients but C-band detected more motion vectors with a more representative spatial distribution. With Arctic sea ice continuing shift from a multi-year to first-year dominated icescape, coupled with an increasing melt season length, L-band SAR's ability to provide improved sea ice motion estimates during both the melt and freeze-up time periods could prove even more useful in the coming decades.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) opens a new perspective on the monitoring of vegetation photosynthesis from space, and has been recently used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, previous studies on SIF were mainly based on satellite observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and the evaluation of these coarse-resolution SIF measurements using GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers has been hindered by the scale mismatch between satellite and tower footprints. We use new far-red SIF observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with much finer spatial resolution and GPP data from EC flux towers from 2014 to 2016 to examine the relationship between GPP and SIF for temperate forests. The OCO-2 SIF tracked tower GPP well, and had strong correlation with tower GPP at both retrieval bands (757 nm and 771 nm) and both instantaneous (mid-day) and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship for the 757 nm band (SIF757) at the daily timescale. Daily SIF757 exhibited much stronger correlation with tower GPP compared to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the surface reflectance product derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard either Terra or Aqua satellite and had a similarly strong relationship as EVI based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected reflectance product (MCD43A4) based on data from both Terra and Aqua. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) explained 85% of the variance in SIF757, while the product of APAR and two environmental scalars - fT(min) and fVPD (representing minimum temperature stress and water stress) explained higher variance (92%) in SIF757. This suggests that SIF mainly depends on APAR and is also affected by environmental stresses that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. The BRDF-corrected EVI also has advantages over SIF in that EVI has spatially and temporally continuous coverage and has a much longer record (2000-present). The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated GPP well (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.0001; RMSE = 1.11 gC m(-2) d(-1)), and its performance was comparable to or slightly better than that of the MODIS GPP algorithm, a GPP model based on the light use efficiency logic. With intensive OCO-2 observations acquired in the Target mode around Park Falls, a calibration/validation site for OCO-2, we also generated gridded SIF and then estimated GPP on a per-pixel basis at the landscape scale. Our findings demonstrate the strong ability of chlorophyll fluorescence observed by OCO-2 in estimating GPP for temperate forests and reveal its potential and limitations in future ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling studies.

AB Atmospheric effects represent one of the major error sources of repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and could mask actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. The tropospheric delays vary both vertically and laterally and can be considered as the sum of (i) a vertically stratified component highly correlated with topography and (ii) a turbulent component resulting from turbulent processes in the troposphere varying both in space and time. In this paper, we outline a framework to routinely use pointwise GPS data to reduce tropospheric effects on satellite radar measurements. An Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition (ITD) model is used and further developed to separate tropospheric stratified and turbulent signals and then generate high-resolution correction maps for SAR interferograms. Cross validation is employed to assess the performance of the ITD model and act as an indicator to users of when and where correction is feasible. Tests were carried out to assess the impact of GPS station spacing on the ITD model InSAR correction performance, which provides insights into the trade-off between station spacing and the achievable accuracy. The appliCation of this framework to Sentinel-1A interferograms over the Southern California (USA) and Southern England (UK) regions shows approximately 45-78% of noise reduction even with a sparse (similar to 50-80 km station spacing) GPS network and/or with strong and non-random tropospheric turbulence. This is about a 50% greater improvement than previous methods. It is believed that this framework could lead to a generic InSAR atmospheric correction model while incorporating continuous and global tropospheric delay datasets, e.g. numerical weather models.

AB Large-scale biomass quantification of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) marsh is critical to understand the carbon and energy cycle in the Florida Everglades. There is also a need to monitor biomass changes in the coastal Everglades due to continuing sea level rise. Previous research in biomass estimation of coastal marshes has focused on pixel-based parametric modeling methods. In this study, an object-based ensemble analysis approach was developed to map sawgrass biomass at multiple scales using Landsat data. Four machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were evaluated and compared to the commonly used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for both live and total sawgrass biomass estimation. A weighted combining scheme was developed to integrate predictions from comparable models for ensemble analysis. Nonparametric machine learning models had better performance than the parametric approach. ANN and SVM produced similar results in live biomass estimation with the correlation coefficient (r) larger than 0.9, while ANN achieved the best result for the total biomass estimation (r = 0.94). Sawgrass biomass maps were produced for two harvest seasons in 2014 and 2016 at three detail levels, which successfully revealed the spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) sawgrass biomass variations. Ensemble analysis of the ANN and SVM predictions of live sawgrass biomass not only made the estimation more reliable, but also generated an uncertainty map to identify the regions with a robust biomass prediction, as well as challenging areas for biomass quantification. It is concluded that the object-based ensemble analysis is a promising alternative to the commonly used pixel-based biomass modeling techniques.

AB This study provides a method determining the characteristics of snow and ice with remote sensing by converting top of atmosphere brightness temperature to surface emissivity which depends on wavelength and observation angle with respect to snow and ice properties.
   Envisat's Advanced Along-Track Spectral Radiometer (AATSR) features dual-view thermal infrared measured brightness temperature. Using bands 11 mu m and 12 mu m in nadir and forward (55) view and a total column water vapour (TCWV) product from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), we obtain four measurements per pixel. We retrieve three surface emissivities epsilon(lambda,theta) per pixel calculated from simulated surface temperatures related to 11 mu m/nadir view values.
   We define emissivity "classes" for different snow grain sizes from angular and spectral field measurements of snow grain size and emissivity above snow and ice from Hori et al. (2006, 2007): fine, medium, coarse, suncrust, and ice. Remaining pixels are either indistinct between classes, unclassified, or invalid. Temperatures above the freezing point label pixels as wet. Analysing 26 AATSR scenes in 2007 and 2008, we retrieve a high portion of classification in Greenland, Antarctica, and the sea ice of the Hudson Bay. Steep and heterogeneous topography may cause invalid and unclassified pixels in Eurasia. Close to coasts we generally find a higher snow temperature and a large number of wet pixels.

AB The Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis presents daily SST estimates on a global 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees grid. The current version (Version 4.1, http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GHGMR-4FJ04) features the 1-km resolution MODIS retrievals, which are fused with AVHRR GAC, microwave, and in-situ SST data by applying internal correction for relative biases among the data sets. Only the night-time (dusk to dawn locally) satellite SST retrievals are used to estimate the foundation SST. The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36 degrees C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products.
   The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a "mesh-less" interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples. Future improvements of the MUR SST analysis will include ingestion of day-time MODIS retrievals as well as more recent high-resolution SST retrievals from VIIRS.

AB A single-frequency dielectric model at 1.4 GHz for frozen mineral soils was developed, with the temperature and gravimetric clay content varying from -1 to -30 degrees C and from 9.1 to 41.3%, respectively. The model is based on the refractive mixing dielectric model and the dielectric data measured for the three typical soils collected in the Yamal tundra. The refractive mixing dielectric model was applied to fit the measured dielectric data as a function of soil moisture at a number of fixed temperatures. As a result, the parameters of the developed model were derived as a function of temperature and texture. This set of parameters consists of the maximum gravimetric fraction of unfrozen bound water and the values of the complex refractive indexes relating to soil solids, unfrozen bound water, and moistened ice. The developed model for frozen mineral soils in conjunction with the previously developed by us dielectric model for thawed mineral soils is considered as an integral dielectric model which is applicable for permittivity calculations of soil in both thawed and frozen states.
   The developed integral dielectric model for frozen and thawed mineral soils was validated using the dielectric data for five measured soils, and the statistical errors were estimated in terms of the root mean square error and the determination coefficient. In addition, the only known in the literature dielectric model for frozen soils suggested by Zhang was validated based on dielectric data for soils measured in this research. The comparative analysis proved substantially better accuracy of predictions in the case of the developed model as compared to those related to the Zhang model.

AB The inflexion-based and threshold-based approaches are the two most popular approaches for extracting land surface phenology (LSP). The first approach uses inflexion point of the vegetation growth curve to determine the start-of-season (SOS) and end-of-season (EOS), while the second approach identifies SOS and EOS with a predefined percentage of vegetation growth amplitude. These two approaches have long been thought to be independent. In this letter, we investigated the relationship between the two approaches for extracting SOS. It was found that the thresholds at several key points in the inflexion-based approach are constant. The threshold at the inflexion point for SOS and EOS is 9.18% of vegetation growth amplitude. This threshold can link the SOS derived from the two approaches, which made it possible to determine the significant vegetation growth transitions for the threshold-based approach. Other thresholds for SOS retrieval, such as commonly-used 10% and 20% of vegetation growth amplitude, were also analyzed using a global reference NDVI. A high SOS difference between the two approaches indicates a slow vegetation growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Post-classification with multi-temporal remote sensing images is one of the most popular change detection methods, providing the detailed "from-to" change information in real applications. However, due to the fact that it neglects the temporal correlation between corresponding pixels in multi-temporal images, the post-classification approach usually suffers from an accumulation of misclassification errors. In order to solve this problem, previous studies have separated the change and non-change candidates with change vector analysis, and they have only updated the classes of the changed pixels with the post-classification; however, this approach with thresholding loses the continuous change intensity information, where larger values indicate higher probability to be changed. Therefore, in this paper, a new post-classification method with iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) and Bayesian soft fusion is proposed to obtain reliable and accurate change detection maps. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) independent classification is implemented to obtain the class probability for each image; 2) the ISFA algorithm is used to obtain the continuous change probability map of multi-temporal images, where the value of each pixel indicates the probability to be changed; and 3) based on Bayesian theory, the a posteriori probabilities for the class combinations of coupled pixels are calmlated to integrate the class probability with the change probability, which is named as Bayesian soft fusion. The class combination with the maximum a posteriori probability is then determined as the change detection result. In addition, a class probability filter is proposed to avoid the false alarms caused by the spectral variation within the same class. Two experiments with multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images indicated that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method based on Bayesian theory and ISFA was also verified to have the ability to improve the change detection rate and reduce the false alarms at the same time. Given its effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could be widely applied in land-use/land-cover change detection and monitoring at a large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Plant density is useful variable that determines the fate of the wheat crop. The most commonly used method for plant density quantification is based on visual counting from ground level. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a method for estimating wheat plant density at the emergence stage based on high resolution imagery taken from UAV at very low altitude with application to high throughput phenotyping in field conditions. A Sony ILCE alpha 5100L RGB camera with 24 Mpixels and equipped with a 60 mm focal length lens was flying aboard an hexacopter at 3 to 7 m altitude at about 1 m/s speed. This allows getting ground resolution between 0.20 mm to 0.45 mm, while providing 59-77% overlap between images. The camera was looking with 45 degrees zenith angle in a compass direction perpendicular to the row direction to maximize the cross section viewed of the plants and minimize the effect of the wind created by the rotors. Agisoft photoscan software was then used to derive the position of the cameras for each image. Images were then projected on the ground surface to finally extract subsamples used to estimate the plant density. The extracted images were first classified to separate the green pixels from the background and the rows were then identified and extracted. Finally, image object (group of connected green pixels) was identified on each row and the number of plants they contain was estimated using a Support Vector Machine whose training was optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization.
   Three experiments were conducted in Greoux, Avignon and Clermont sites with some variability in the sowing dates, densities, genotypes, flight altitude, and growth stage at the time of the image acquisition. The application of the method on the 270 samples available over the three sites provides a RMSE and relative RMSE on estimates of 34.05 plants/m(2) and 14.31% with a bias of 9.01 plants/m(2). However, differences in performances were observed between the three sites, mostly related to the growth stage at the time of the flight. Plants should have between one to two leaves when images are taken. Further, a specific sensitivity analysis shows that the ground resolution of the images should be better than 0.40 mm. Finally, the repeatability of the method is good especially when images are taken from similar observational geometries. The current limits and possible improvements of the method proposed are finally discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) is used in forest inventories to quantify stand structure with three dimensional point clouds. However, the structure of point clouds depends not only on stand structure, but also on the LiDAR instrument, its settings, and the pattern of flight. The resulting variation between and within datasets (particularly variation in pulse density and footprint size) can induce spurious variation in LiDAR metrics such as maximum height (h(max)) and mean height of the canopy surface model (C-mean). In this study, we first compare two LiDAR datasets acquired with different parameters, and observe that h(max) and C-mean are 56 cm and 1.0 m higher, respectively, when calculated using the high-density dataset with a small footprint. Then, we present a model that explains the observed bias using probability theory, and allows us to recompute the metrics as if the density of pulses were infinite and the size of the two footprints were equivalent. The model is our first step in developing methods for correcting various LiDAR metrics that are used for area-based prediction of stand structure. Such methods may be particularly useful for monitoring forest growth over time, given that acquisition parameters often change between inventories. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A regionally tuned three component "abundance" model of Brewin et al. (2012) has been used to discriminate satellite ocean color derived fields of phytoplankton biomass observable as Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), into three size classes, i.e. microplankton (>20 mu m), nanoplankton (>2 to <20 mu m) and picoplankton (<2 mu m). The model has been applied to MODIS-Aqua and Oceansat-2, Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) derived fields of Chl-a data between Nov. and Mar. In the Arabian Sea, during the evolution of blooms of the large (>800 mu m sized) green mixotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans. A comparison of shipboard measured and model derived values of phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) show the superiority of the regionally tuned model over parameterizations used in the original model of Brewin et al. (2012). A total number of 39 in situ data points have been used for the tuning of the regional model and 5 different in-situ data points have been used for the comparison with in situ data in this remote region of data paucity. The absolute mean and the maximum absolute errors for all size fractions are 4.7% and 17.2% respectively, as compared to the values of 9.6% and 26% respectively obtained using Brewin et al. (2012). When applied to a weekly time series of Chl-a images, the regionally tuned model is able to capture the seasonal cycle of PSC in the Arabian Sea associated with the tail end of the fall inter-monsoon (Nov.), the winter monsoon (Dec. to Feb.) and the transition to the spring inter-monsoon Although ocean color remote sensing is a useful tool for studying phytoplankton processes in regions like the Arabian Sea that suffer from a paucity of in-situ observations, enhancing the validity and confidence in satellite ocean color derived products such as PSC, will require additional shipboard datasets.

AB Quantitative approaches to assess the complexity of groundwater drought are hindered by the lack of direct observations of groundwater over space and time. Here, we present an approach to evaluate groundwater drought occurrence based on observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Normalized GRACE-derived groundwater storage deviations are shown to quantify groundwater storage deficits during the GRACE record, which we define as the GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI). As a case study, GGDI is applied over the Central Valley of California, a regional aquifer undergoing intensive human activities and subject to significant drought periods during the GRACE record. Relations between GGDI and other hydrological drought indices highlight our ability to capture drought delays unique to groundwater drought. Further, GGDI captures characteristics of groundwater drought that occur as a result of complex human activities and natural changes, thus presenting a framework to assess multi-driver groundwater drought characteristics.

AB Remote sensing of water quality in turbid coastal and inland waters requires accurate atmospheric correction, which is technically challenging. While previous efforts have shown the advantage of using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of near-infrared (NIR) bands for atmospheric correction, such an approach could only be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite (MODISA). This is because MODIS data from the Terra satellite (MODIST) contain more noise and other sensor artifacts, thus this sensor has been generally regarded by the ocean color research community as not being able to provide science quality data. Here, we address this technical challenge through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment, and demonstrate preliminary success using turbid Taihu Lake as an example. The noise in the three SWIR bands was evaluated first, and then reduced through a noise reduction method. The SWIR bands were adjusted over open-ocean waters using the well-calibrated NIR ocean bands (1-km resolution) and radiative transfer, which were then used to adjust the land bands (250-m and 500-m resolution) in the visible and NIR over turbid waters where concurrent field-measured reflectance spectra are available. Of all three combinations of SWIR bands, the combination of 1240 and 1640-nm bands was found to perform the best, showing significantly improved retrieval accuracy for Taihu Lake, leading to recovery of low-quality MODIST data to higher-quality data comparable to MODISA, and thus doubling valid data coverage. Testing of this approach on another highly turbid lake (Chaohu Lake, China) showed similar results. While the general application of this approach to turbid lakes still needs to be tested as local tuning of the calibration coefficients may be required, these results suggest that MODIST may be used as effectively as MODISA for monitoring Taihu Lake water quality.

AB There is significant public health interest in gaining a better understanding of the health effects associated with particulate matter (PM) of differing sizes and compositions. Unfortunately the PM monitoring data needed for such studies are limited. Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been used to overcome this limitation, but existing techniques using AOD to estimate surface concentrations of PMhave limited ability to differentiate particle size and type, and the spatial resolution is often too coarse to evaluate PM variability on local scales. Fortunately there has been a significant breakthrough in aerosol product from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument onboard the NASA Terra satellite. Recent computational advances have made it possible to derive a "local mode" MISR aerosol product at a spatial resolution of 4.4 km that maintains the quality of the 17.6 km resolution Version 22 operational aerosol product. MISR is uniquely capable of providing total AOD as well as AOD fractionated by size (small, medium, and large), enabling estimation of size-resolved surface PM concentrations.
   Total and size-fractionated AOD from the MISR 4.4 km aerosol product were used to develop spatio-temporal models to estimate surface concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5 chemical species over Southern California. We found, and confirmed by leave-one-site-out cross validation, that PM2.5 was best estimated with a spatio-temporal model of AOD small + medium that also included adjustment for relative humidity and wind speed (R-2 = 0.67, CV R-2= 0.51), while PM10 was best estimated from AOD large with adjustment for dew point and wind speed (R-2 = 0.76, CV R-2 = 0.44). Total AOD was most strongly associated with PM2.5 components SO4 2 ( R-2= 0.74, CV R-2= 0.69) and NO3(-)(R-2= 0.72, CV R-2= 0.39). The best fitting models were applied to all available MISR aerosol retrievals over the region, generating surfaces of estimated size-resolved PM concentrations that will be a great asset to the environmental science and public health communities.

AB Urban greenspace has significant cooling effects on urban heat. Recent studies investigating the effects of spatial configuration of greenspace show significant, but inconsistent results, including both positive and negative effects. To investigate the causes of this inconsistency, we compared Baltimore, MD and Sacramento, CA, USA, two cities with very different climatic conditions. We quantified and compared the relationships between the spatial configuration of trees and land surface temperature (LST) using different statistical approaches, and conducted the analyses using spatial units of different sizes, based on trees mapped from 1 m high resolution imagery. We found: (1) trees' cooling efficiency was higher in Baltimore than in hotter and drier Sacramento. Additionally, percent cover of trees was more important than their spatial configuration in predicting LST in Baltimore, but the opposite was found in Sacramento. (2) Spatial configuration of trees affects LST more in Sacramento than in Baltimore, and the effects of spatial configuration of trees on LST varied greatly in terms of magnitude, significance, and even direction, between the two cities. Notably, mean patch size had significantly positive effects on LST in Baltimore, but negative effects in Sacramento. In contrast, edge density had negative effects on LST in Baltimore, but positive effects in Sacramento. (3) Different statistical approaches resulted in dramatic changes in the relationships between CST and configuration metrics. Our results underscore the necessity of controlling the effects of percent cover of trees, when quantifying the effects of spatial configuration of trees on LST. (4) Spatial autocorrelation may influence relationships between landscape metrics and LST, particularly when the unit of analysis is relatively small. (5) The relationships between spatial configuration metrics and LST are stronger with an increase of the size of the analytical unit. This study can enhance our understanding of the effects of spatial configuration of greenspace on urban heat island (UHI). It also provides important insights to urban planners and natural resource managers on how to mitigate the impact of urbanization on UHI through urban design and vegetation management.

AB In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradients in the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) using satellite data. 12 years (2003-2014) of high resolution synoptic SST images acquired from NASA's MODIS instrument onboard Terra and Aqua platforms were processed to mitigate quality issues related to stripe noise and cloud misclassification and then compiled into monthly, yearly, and decadal maps of SST gradient magnitudes. We used these composite maps and corresponding time series to identify regions with strong frontal activity and characterize the seasonal and long term evolution of thermal gradients. While a clear seasonal cycle was observed in most subregions of the SAO, the satellite data do not suggest significant interannual variability or long term changes in the magnitude of thermal fronts in the SAO except in the upwelling region of Cape Frio Brazil, where SST gradients have increased at an approximate rate of 1% per year since 2003.

AB In Quebec, Eastern Canada, snowmelt runoff contributes more than 30% of the annual energy reserve for hydroelectricity production, and uncertainties in annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) over the region are one of the main constraints for improved hydrological forecasting. Current satellite-based methods for mapping SWE over Quebec's main hydropower basins do not meet Hydro-Quebec operational requirements for SWE accuracies with less than 15% error. This paper assesses the accuracy of the GlobSnow-2 (GS-2) SWE product, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, for hydrological applications in Quebec. GS-2 SWE values for a 30-year period (1980 to 2009) were compared with space- and time-matched values from a comprehensive dataset of in situ SWE measurements (a total of 38,990 observations in Eastern Canada). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GS-2 SWE product is 94.1 +/- 20.3 mm, corresponding to an overall relative percentage error (RPE) of 35.9%. The main sources of uncertainty are wet and deep snow conditions (when SWE is higher than 150 mm), and forest cover type. However, compared to a typical stand-alone brightness temperature channel difference algorithm, the assimilation of surface information in the GS-2 algorithm clearly improves SWE accuracy by reducing the RPE by about 30%. Comparison of trends in annual mean and maximum SWE between surface observations and GS-2 over 1980-2009 showed agreement for increasing trends over southern Quebec, but less agreement on the sign and magnitude of trends over northern Quebec. Extended at a continental scale, the GS-2 SWE trends highlight a strong regional variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was similar to 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r(2) values of 32-36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r(2) values of 25-34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management.

AB The recognized shortcomings of fire spread modeling systems and the widespread use of their outcomes in fire management decisions render the evaluation of fire simulation results crucial for model calibration and improvement. Additionally, new methods are essential to avoid model misapplication in fuel and fire management decision processes. This study proposes an exploratory evaluation framework of fire growth simulations using satellite active fire data. It uses nine very large fires that occurred in Portugal between 2003 and 2012. Their fire growth was simulated using the Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) and compared with active fire data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The evaluation is based on two spatial measures that quantify the absolute (SpD) and relative (NRSpD) spatial discrepancies between fire growth simulations and satellite active fires. Both measures account for the uncertain location of the fire front(s) inside the active fire footprint. Results highlight the contribution of the spatial discrepancy measures to locate areas of low/high spatio-temporal agreement between simulated fire growth and MODIS active fires, thereby aiding the assessment of potential sources of simulation error. Results also show that despite the coarse spatial resolution of MODIS active fires, these data are able to capture the spatial dynamics of fire growth. Limitations on the spatial measures were identified, particularly the lack of independence of evaluations using the NRSpD. In spite of being exploratory, this study represents a novel contribution to the evaluation of fire growth simulations because: 1) it uses satellite active fire data and is independent of the collection of reference burnt area perimeters; 2) it proposes two simple quantitative spatial discrepancy measures; and 3) it can be applied to a large number of wildfires, regardless of their geographical location. This innovative approach represents a potential cost effective evaluation scheme, that can be used systematically whenever evaluation of a large number of large wildfires is required and reference burned area perimeters are not available.

AB The Gulf of Aden, situated in the northwest Arabian Sea and linked to the Red Sea, is a relatively unexplored ecosystem. Understanding of large-scale biological dynamics is limited by the lack of adequate datasets. In this study, we analyse 15 years of remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a data (Chl-a, an index of phytoplankton biomass) acquired from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The improved spatial coverage of OC-CCI data in the Gulf of Aden allows, for the first time, an investigation into the full seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass. Analysis of indices of phytoplankton phenology (bloom timing) reveals distinct phytoplankton growth periods in different parts of the gulf: a large peak during August (mid-summer) in the western part of the gulf, and a smaller peak during November (mid-autumn) in the lower central gulf and along the southern coastline. The summer bloom develops rapidly at the beginning of July, and its peak is approximately three times higher than that of the autumnal bloom. Remotely-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST), wind-stress curl, vertical nutrient profiles and geostrophic currents inferred from the sea-level anomaly, were analysed to examine the underlying physical mechanisms that control phytoplankton growth. During summer, the prevailing southwesterlies cause upwelling along the northern coastline of the gulf (Yemen), leading to an increase in nutrient availability and enhancing phytoplankton growth along the coastline and in the western part of the gulf. In contrast, in the central region of the gulf, lowest concentrations of Chl-a are observed during summer, due to strong downwelling caused by a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy. During autumn, the prevailing northeasterlies enable upwelling along the southern coastline (Somalia) causing local nutrient enrichment in the euphoric zone, leading to higher levels of phytoplankton biomass along the coastline and in the lower central gulf. The monsoon wind reversal is shown to play a key role in controlling phytoplankton growth in different regions of the Gulf of Aden. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Implementation of S-band marine radar for surface wave measurement under

AB Civil marine radar, which operates at a low grazing-incidence angle and with horizontal polarization in transmitting and receiving, can be modified and used as a primary tool for surface wave monitoring. The high spatial resolutions of sea-clutter image sequences from X-band radar offer a means of deriving individual waves and wave field at low-cost. However, the performance of X-band radar is impaired under rainy conditions, which are usually accompanied by the severe weather at sea. In the present study, we examine the effectiveness of S-band radar for wave measurements under precipitation. The results of comprehensive comparative studies with sea-truth data show that S-band radar is capable of carrying out wave measurements in rainy conditions. Although the longer wavelength of the S-band leads to a coarser resolution of radar imagery, the S-band radar features at least the equivalent performance of the X-band system in non-rainy conditions, in terms of wave height measurement. The results suggest that the S-band and X-band could be complementary systems. In rainy conditions the S-band is more efficient but in the non-rainy periods the X-band gives more confident results. The relationship of significant wave height with radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the modulation transfer function (MTF) between radar spectrum and wave spectrum for the used X-band and S-band radars are established and discussed in this paper.

TI RST-FIRES, an exportable algorithm for early-fire detection and

   case of the MSG-SEVIRI sensor

AB Wildfires are a worldwide phenomenon with local and global effects. Many satellite-based methods for fire detection and monitoring have been developed to exploit data acquired by sensors onboard polar orbiting platforms. Their relatively low temporal resolution (hours) is, however, decidedly not adequate for detecting short-living events or fires characterised by a marked diurnal cycle and rapid evolution times. Geostationary satellites have very high temporal resolution of 30 to 2.5 min and could, in principle, be more suitable for providing timely alerts and facilitating possible mitigation actions. However, such short revisit times are coupled with spatial resolutions of 3-5 km; which are coarser than those of the polar orbiting sensors generally having 1 km capability in the infrared region. This could represent a significant limitation for small fire detection and precise localization. However, unlike polar orbiting systems, the geostationary attitude assures very stable observational conditions at the pixel level, including fixed view angles, same time of day, and same ground resolution cell dimensions. This can be crucial for fire-detection methods based on multi-temporal analyses.
   This work describes in detail the Robust Satellite Techniques for FIRES detection and monitoring (RST-FIRES), a multi-temporal change-detection technique, and its application to the data of Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) platform. Its performance in terms of reliability and sensitivity was verified by >20,000 SEVIRI images collected throughout the day during a four-year -collaboration with the regional Civil Protection Departments and other Local Authorities of two Italian regions which provided about 950 near real-time ground and aerial checks of the RST-FIRES detections.
   The results indicate a mean commission error rate of 18%, ranging from 3% to 30% according to the specific experimental campaign, with an average omission error of 44%, ranging from 3% to 66% depending on the campaign and the validation source used.
   This study fully demonstrates the added value of the RST-FIRES technique for the early warning of fire events. During the considered validation campaigns, RST-FIRES provided the sole fire alert in 348 cases; in further 227 cases, its warnings were given >1 h before any other source of information was provided.
   Finally, this paper presents and discusses a comparison among RST-FIRES and other SEVIRI-based fire detection products.
   On the whole, RST-FIRES is shown to be 3 to 70 times more sensitive than all of the other considered SEVIRI-based products. This satisfactory result was not completely unexpected, considering the quite high false positive rate exhibited by RST-FIRES and the fact that other algorithms were designed to work in a wider area, from continental to the SEVIRI full disk.

ID NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; INTERFEROMETRY; DEFORMATION
AB We used interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the ALOS-1 satellite to investigate the active movement of landslides along the Columbia River Gorge from 2007-2011. To increase the spatial extent of the deformation signal, we developed a coherence-based small-baseline subset (SEAS) method and derived the time series of the landslide movement. We find no significant movement on the previously mapped Washougal, Sakamania, Oregon Shore, and Wind Mountain landslides. However, we document the slow movement of the Redbluff landslide, which is part of the Cascade Landslide Complex. The InSAR data reveal up to approximately 25 cm of line-of-sight displacement over the 4-year observation period. The Redbluff landslide is seasonally activated, with accelerated movement observed during the early winter of each year. The amplitude of the seasonal signal is variable from year-to-year, with the greatest movement observed in early winter of 2009 and 2011. To assess the triggering mechanisms, we compared the displacement time series data with local precipitation data. The deformation correlated well with precipitation, implying the slow movement is controlled by rainfall that infiltrates to the base of the slide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite altimetry has demonstrated a strong potential for the continuous monitoring of ocean, ice sheets and land surfaces over the last 25 years. While instrument processing and retracking techniques of the radar echoes improved over the years for ocean applications to produce homogeneous products for all satellite altimetry missions, less effort has been devoted to applications over land. European Space Agency (ESA) continues improving the quality of ENVISAT data over all type of surfaces through frequent reprocessing of altimeter corrections. No similar effort was performed for the ERS missions until recently with the release of the ESA ERS REAPER product mostly devoted to ocean applications. In parallel, Centre de Topographie des Oceans et de l'Hydrosphere (CTOH) processed the ERS-2 waveforms (WAP data) with a new implementation of the Ice-2 retracker algorithm, adding improvements and corrections to make ERS-2 data compatible and homogenous with the ENVISAT mission for continuity and long-term altimetry data analysis over land and ice sheets. The resulting product is evaluated against ENVISAT data during the tandem phase when they flew 30 min apart on the same orbit during 10 cycles of the two missions from June 2002 to July 2003. Maps of along-track differences averaged over the 10 cycles of the tandem phase and associated RMSE are presented over ocean, both Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets and land along with time series of altimetry backscattering coefficients and altimetry-based water levels. Similar comparisons were performed between ENVISAT and ERS-2 REAPER data. Low bias and RMSE values for altimeter heights and backscattering were found between ENVISAT and ERS-2 over ocean and flat areas over land and ice sheets with generally better results obtained using CTOH data. Comparisons with in situ water stages also show good agreement for Ice-2 and especially Ice-1 retracicers derived water levels (R > 0.95). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST), derived from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) sensors, is a key variable for characterization of urban heat island, modeling of surface energy balance, estimation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture, and retrieval of air temperature. Among the satellite TIR sensors in operation, Landsat TIR sensor provides the only feasibility for long-term reconstruction of a LST dataset for environmental applications. However, a holistic technique is not currently available to generate spatially and temporally continuous LSTs from Landsat due to its 16-day revisit frequency, impact of atmospheric conditions and the SLC (Scan Line Corrector)-off gap. Previous algorithms had been developed to overcome these limitations, it is still not possible to generate LSTs at any desired date with consistent accuracy and corrections. Therefore, this study aimed to devise an algorithm to reconstruct consistent, daily LSTs at Landsat spatial resolution based solely on Landsat imagery. By selecting Beijing, China, as the study area, a total of 512 images from 1984 to 2011 were downloaded from the USGS online portal and were consistently calibrated to surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The cloud-, cloud shadow-, and snow-contaminated pixels were excluded according to quality flags; and a further screening procedure based on temporal information of Landsat spectral bands 2,4, and 5 was conducted. Brightness temperatures were converted to LST5 through the single channel algorithm with input of water vapor from the NCEP Reanalysis dataset. Field LSTs were collected from 11 weather stations in Beijing in the year of 2008, 2009, and 2010. The proposed algorithm included four modules: Data filtEr, temporaL segmentation, periodic and trend modeling, and GAussian process (DELTA). Accuracy assessment showed that, compared with the in situ LSTs from weather stations, satellite-derived LSTs inverted through the single channel algorithm had an average accuracy of 2.3 K. Further comparison between LSTs reconstructed from the DELTA algorithm and those collected from weather stations in the year 2008 yielded a mean error of 3.5 K. Twelve LST maps reconstructed from the DELTA in 2000 showed that LST5 of different land covers exhibited similar seasonal patterns and reached their maximal values in June/July. Using LST of every August 15th as an example, the SUHI (surface urban heat island) intensity of Beijing was computed, which ranged from 33 K to 5.3 K from 1984 to 2011, with an increase pattern of LST in both rural and urban areas.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices are increasingly used to provide data on Earth's landscapes structures and atmosphere constituents. Their developments, especially with scanning and multi-beam systems require accurate modeling tools to analyze existing data and to design future systems. A few radiative transfer models (RTMs) can simulate LiDAR waveform of one pulse. Based on that, this paper presents an efficient, flexible and user-friendly approach that extends the existing single-pulse simulation to a device-specific multi-pulse tool in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The realistic acquisition configurations (platform positions and orientations dataset) can be imported and the simulated waveforms can be converted into industrial data formats and processed by industrial software. Multi-pulse simulations of several airborne and terrestrial devices are presented. DART was also extended to simulate photon counting devices, by combining the physical principles of the single-photon detector with the waveforms. In addition, it computes solar noise contribution in LiDAR signal for any atmospheric configuration through combined simulation of waveforms and passive radiance images with any sun-sensor geometry.

AB In this work the long-term DInSAR deformation time series have been jointly exploited with the geological information and the structural characteristics of the buildings, in order to study the interactions between the soils and the man-made structures and to investigate the response of different buildings to the settlements. The presented analysis has been carried out by applying the advanced multi-temporal DInSAR technique referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach to an ERS/ENVISAT SAR dataset, collected over the town of Roma (Italy) in the 1992-2010 time interval.
   Our study has been performed first at the large spatial scale, and then at the local scale, focusing on some buildings located within the city centre on the eastern side of the Tevere River.
   The obtained SBAS-DInSAR measurements, analysed in light of the geological setting and the spatial distribution of the settlements, indicate that the observed displacements are mainly linked to a residual consolidation process, correlated with the urbanization and hydrometric level of the Tevere River. The local variation in the deformation rates can be related to the intrinsic variability of the soils filling the alluvial valley and to time since loading application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB An implementation approach using the ocean color index (OCI)-based chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) algorithm for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) has been developed. The OCI Chl-a algorithm for satellite-derived Chl-a data was originally developed by Hu, Lee, and Franz (2012) (J. Geophys. Res., 117, C01011, doi: 01010.01029/02011JC007395) for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It uses two Chl-a algorithms, i.e., the color index (CO-based (reflectance difference-based) algorithm for oligotrophic waters and the usual ocean chlorophyll-type (OCx)-based (reflectance ratio-based) algorithm (e.g., OO3M for MODIS and OC3V for VIIRS), and merges the two algorithms for different Chl-a range applications (named OCI algorithm). In this study, we use the in situ Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) optics data to demonstrate conclusively that using the OCI-based Chl-a algorithm can significantly improve VIIRS Chl-a data over oligotrophic waters with much reduced data noise from instrument calibration and the imperfect atmospheric correction. Using the VIIRS-measured global Chl-a data derived from the Multi Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, we have developed the Cl-based algorithm specifically for VIIRS, and further improved the two Chl-a algorithms merging method using the blue-green reflectance ratio values. Extensive evaluation results show that the new OCI Chl-a algorithm for VIIRS can produce consistent Chl-a data compared with those from the OC3V algorithm. In particular, the data transition between the CI-based and OC3V-based Chl-a algorithm is quite smooth, and there are no obvious discontinuities in VIIRS-derived Chl-a data. The new OCI-based Chl-a algorithm has been implemented in MSL12 for routine production of VIIRS global Chl-a data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Estimating the change in the magnitude and distribution of forest biomass is important for monitoring carbon dynamics and understanding the implications on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In this study, we assessed the capacity of multi-temporal airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate forest biomass dynamics at a mixed subtropical forest of southeast China, and analyzed the magnitude and spatial patterns of the above ground biomass (AGB) change over a 6-year period. To do so, we evaluated different approaches to estimate change in AGB, specifically direct (i.e., predicting biomass change using the differences in LiDAR metrics) and indirect (i.e., modeling biomass for each point in time and predicting the change as their differences) approaches. Once models were developed, the change in AGB was mapped across the study site and examined in relation to forest type and age. Our results demonstrated that the direct approach (CV-R-2 = 0.63, CV-rRMSE = 25.64%) produced more accurate estimates in change of AGB than the indirect approach (CV-R-2 = 0.59, CV-rRMSE = 28.35%). Canopy height metrics of delta mean height (Delta h(mean) 1 and a number of upper percentile heights, (i.e., Delta h(75) and Delta h(95)), calculated from the LiDAR first returns, were found to be most sensitive to changes in biomass, whereas metrics based on maximum canopy height or canopy density had less predictive power. Furthermore, differences in point cloud densities did not significantly impact the estimations of AGB and change of AGB at the plot-scale (30 x 30 m). Spatial extrapolation of the AGB change indicated that, in general, most of the forest area had an overall gain in biomass. The middle-aged stands (typically dominated by Quercus acutissima between 41 and 60 years old) show marked growth of biomass (median Delta AGB = 2.29 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) followed by mature (typically dominated by Pinus massoniana between 31 and 60 years old) (median Delta AGB = 1.72 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and young stands (typically consisting of regenerated broadleaved trees younger than 40 years old) (median Delta AGB = 1.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas over-mature stands (typically dominated by Cunninghamia lanceolate older than 35 years) show the lowest growth (median Delta AGB = 0.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) This study demonstrates benefits of using multi-temporal LiDAR data to help identify specific areas for management interventions, to enhance forest productivity, maintain biomass stocks and optimize carbon sequestration.

AB The long time series (1982-2012) of Pathfinder v.5.2 (PFV52) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data has been used to build daily (nighttime), high-resolution, reprocessed gap-free SST maps (REP L4) covering the Mediterranean Sea. This effort has been pursued with the objective to create a spatially complete, accurate, homogeneous and stable, i.e. free of spurious trends, long term SST dataset. Indeed, these are the essential attributes for its usage in climate applications. The interpolation of Level 3 (L3, i.e. daily collated images) PFV52 data to L4 has been carried out at the original 4km Pathfinder resolution by adapting to the PFV52 dataset the Mediterranean near-real-time SST processing chain set up within the MyOcean projects and now operational in the framework of the European Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The homogeneity and consistency of the MyOcean/CMEMS REP L4 SST dataset is guaranteed by Pathfinder, since PFV52 dataset is built from the same class of sensors and reprocessed with the same algorithm. On the other hand, in order to quantify the accuracy and demonstrate the stability of both PFV52 and REP L4 SST data, a thorough validation has been performed by comparison with an independent in situ dataset, built from all the available in situ observations covering the entire reprocessing period. The validation indicates that this new optimally interpolated time series represents a valuable SST dataset for climate studies. In addition, the REP L4 dataset extends and improves previous similar datasets covering the Mediterranean Sea, presently resulting as the longest time series at 4km resolution. Future releases of the Pathfinder SST dataset will then be used to update this time series in the framework of the CMEMS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Southern Ocean is an important sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the magnitude of the CO2 sink is uncertain because of the scarcity of in-situ observations due to its remote and rough waters. Empirical relationships were deduced based on the in-situ partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in surface seawater and its main controls including Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) obtained during the 26th CHINARE cruise in late spring (November) and early summer (December) 2009. An extrapolation method based on multiple linear regressions was set up for combining the empirical relationship with satellite data to compute the sea-air carbon fluxes and carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean (south of 50 degrees S). The empirical relationships are validated with independent measurements from SOCATv2 database. The mean standard deviation differences (Std) between extrapolated and measured pCO(2) from SOCATv2 database (13.8 to 18.1 mu atm) are consistent with the precision of our regressions (13.6 to 213 mu atm). Including the effects of sea ice, we estimate a Southern Ocean CO2 source to the atmosphere in November 2009 about 1.65 Tg C with an uncertainty of +/- 0.73 Tg C by uncertainty propagation formula. While in December 2009, we estimated a CO2 sink of -2.34 Tg C with an uncertainty of +/- 1.03 Tg C. The carbon source and sink of the South Atlantic Ocean, the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean were estimated. For the austral summer, the South Atlantic Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean are still strong carbon sink. When compared to the climatological monthly results of Takahashi et al. (2012), our results showed a similar distribution of sea-air carbon flux. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forests of the Contiguous United States (CONUS) have been found to be a large contributor to the global atmospheric carbon sink. The magnitude and nature of this sink is still uncertain and recent studies have sought to define the dynamics that control its strength and longevity. The Landsat series of satellites has been a vital resource to understand the long-term changes in land cover that can impact ecosystem function and terrestrial carbon stock. We combine annual Landsat forest disturbance history from 1985 to 2011 with single date IKONOS stereo imagery to estimate the change in young forest canopy height and above ground live dry biomass accumulation for selected sites in the CONUS. Our approach follows an approximately linear growth rate following clearing over short intervals and does not estimate the distinct non-linear growth rate over longer intervals. We produced canopy height models by differencing digital surface models estimated from IKONOS stereo pairs with national elevation data (NED). Correlations between height and biomass were established independently using airborne LiDAR, and then applied to the IKONOS-estimated canopy height models. Graphing current biomass against time since disturbance provided biomass accumulation rates. For 20 study sites distributed across five regions of the CONUS, 19 showed statistically significant recovery trends (p < 0.001) with canopy growth from 0.26 m yr(-1) to 0.73 m yr(-1). Aboveground live dry biomass (AGB) density accumulation ranged from 1.31 t/ha yr(-1) to 12.47 t/ha yr(-1). Mean forest AGB accumulation was 631 t/ha yr(-1) among all sites with significant growth trends. We evaluated the accuracy of our estimates by comparing to field estimated site index curves of growth, airborne LiDAR data, and independent model predictions of C accumulation. Growth estimates found with this approach are consistent with site index curves and total biomass estimates fall within the range of field estimates. This is a viable approach to estimate forest biomass accumulation in regions with clear-cut harvest disturbances. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Glaciers are an important climate indicator due to their sensitive dependence upon local and regional climate variables, which makes them worthwhile research subjects. A comprehensive description of the glaciers' interaction with the environment and their dynamical behavior requires complex physical models and the measurement of relevant parameters. In-situ data acquisitions are costly and often spatially sparse due to the large extent of glaciers; however, satellite-based sensors offer timely data with complete ground coverage, making them a good choice for continuous monitoring of glaciers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allows a nearly weather-independent monitoring of glacier motion, which is beneficial for often cloudy regions like Alaska or Patagonia. This paper presents a new workflow for the automatic extraction of glacier surfaces from SAR intensity images and the determination of their velocities involving a fluid mechanics model. An initial motion estimation is obtained from intensity tracking on SAR image pairs and subsequently corrected by a physics-based spatial regularization. The surface velocity is approximated by the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids. The regularization is formulated as a data assimilation problem in which the final solution is a proper solution of the Navier-Stokes equation and simultaneously fitted to the observed velocity. This partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization is solved with adjoint models using finite element methods. The proposed method is evaluated on the Taku Glacier, AK, an outlet glacier of the Juneau Icefield. Our presented approach is independent from the type of sensor as long as initial velocity estimates can be obtained. The final results can be used as input to methods estimating ice volume and thickness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite was launched in 2011. On-board this satellite is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with thermal infrared detection capabilities similar to those of the earlier Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observation System. Fire detection products have been developed using the thermal infrared data for both VIIRS and MODIS and, although having the observation of fire as their main objective, such products are also sensitive to the radiant emissions of active volcanic surfaces, but a comparison of their capabilities in this regard remains outstanding. Here, this comparison is conducted, with a focus on the volcanoes of Indonesia, and findings are initially promising, suggesting that the VIIRS fire detection capability is an improvement over that of its predecessor. For example, between 3 April 2012 and 14 July 2014, volcanic activity was detected on 519 days by the VIIRS product, as compared with 308 days for the MODIS-Aqua product (MYD14). Causes of this apparent enhanced sensitivity are explored and, with the examination of additional data from the MODISTerra product and the MODVOLC system, are shown to be the combined influence of spatial resolution, data processing steps, imaging scan width and the fire product algorithm used. As greater quantities of data become available, a more comprehensive comparison of these observations will be possible and will be undertaken at a global scale.

AB Lake level serve as an important indicator of the climate and continuous measurements are therefore essential. Satellite radar altimetry has now been used successfully for more than two decades to measure lake level as an addition to gauge measurements. The technique has, due to the large footprint of conventional altimetry, primarily been used for large lakes. CryoSat-2, which was launched in 2010, carries the first altimeter that is able to operate in SAR mode. The along-track resolution is approximately 300 m in SAR mode thus enabling us to accurately monitor substantially smaller lakes.
   Here we evaluate the precision of the along-track mean lake levels derived from CtyoSat-2 data for five lakes; Skanderborg so, Mosso, and Anew (Denmark), Okeechobee (US), and Vanern (Sweden) with a surface area ranging from 9 to 5600 km(2). Three of the lakes are compared with gauge data. As a reference we compare our results with water levels obtained from Envisat We find that the along-track precision of the mean based on CryoSat-2 is a few centimeter, even for the small lakes, which is a significant improvement compared to previous missions such as Envisat When validating against gauge data we find RMS values of differences between the estimated lake levels and in-situ gauge measurements of only 8 cm or less, after bias correcting the estimated lake levels. To estimate the along-track mean values we apply a novel approach. Instead of attempting to identify and remove the polluted observations we use a mixture distribution to describe the observation noise, which prevents the polluted observations from biasing our final reconstructed time series. These results demonstrate the promising possibilities of the upcoming mission Sentinel-3, which potentially will be able to provide accurate time series even for small lakes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Beginning in November 2013, large turbidity plumes were observed offshore the Port of Miami (Florida, USA), likely associated with a project to deepen and widen the Miami Harbor channels. Local coral colonies, including those considered threatened by the US Endangered Species Act, exacerbate the need for thorough assessment of these plumes. Without ruling out other causal factors such as wind storms and tidal currents, it is difficult to conclude whether the plumes were caused by the dredging. From current in situ monitoring programs, it is also difficult to estimate the size, duration, extent and historical context of these plumes. Satellite observing systems, in contrast, offer a means by which these plumes can be monitored and compared to previous events. As such, turbidity plumes visible in Landsat 8 and MODE Aqua imagery were first manually outlined, and then refined (for MODIS only) using anomaly and normalized anomaly thresholds determined from pre-dredging data. Local environmental conditions were also considered and used to determine dates for which elevated reflectance data might be expected in the absence of dredging. In total, the spatial extent of all turbidity plumes observed from November 2013 to April 2015 was between 127 and 228 km(2), at least 5 times that for January October 2013. Furthermore, the frequency of observed plumes in images increased from 23% to 84% after dredging began. Coral areas were particularly affected after dredging began, with over 11 km(2) of coral area being within plumes on an average of 16% of images (maximum 39%). Temporal differences in location, severity, and size were also observed. Together, these results highlight widespread turbidity plumes associated with the Port of Miami dredging activities, which may cause large adverse effects on local coral communities. The approaches developed in this work, in particular the focus on historical norms after considering all perturbation factors, may be included in monitoring and assessment of this and future dredging activities, especially where fragile marine ecosystems may be impacted.

AB Correcting for tropospheric delays is one of the largest challenges facing the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) community. Spatial and temporal variations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity create tropospheric signals in InSAR data, masking smaller surface displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. Correction methods using weather model data, GNSS and/or spectrometer data have been applied in the past, but are often limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the auxiliary data. Alternatively a correction can be estimated from the interferometric phase by assuming a linear or a power-law relationship between the phase and topography. Typically the challenge lies in separating deformation from tropospheric phase signals. In this study we performed a statistical comparison of the state-of-the-art tropospheric corrections estimated from the MERIS and MODIS spectrometers, a low and high spatial-resolution weather model (ERA-I and WRF), and both the conventional linear and new power-law empirical methods. Our test-regions include Southern Mexico, Italy, and El Hierro. We find spectrometers give the largest reduction in tropospheric signal, but are limited to cloud-free and daylight acquisitions. We find a similar to 10-20% RMSE increase with increasing cloud cover consistent across methods. None of the other tropospheric correction methods consistently reduced tropospheric signals over different regions and times. We have released a new software package called TRAIN (Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise), which includes all these state-of-the-art correction methods. We recommend future developments should aim towards combining the different correction methods in an optimal manner. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Free and open access to satellite imagery and value-added data products have revolutionized the role of remote sensing in Earth system science. Nonetheless, rapid changes in the global environment pose challenges to the science community that are increasingly difficult to address using data from single satellite sensors or platforms due to the underlying limitations of data availability and tradeoffs that govern the design and implementation of currently existing sensors. Virtual constellations of planned and existing satellite sensors may help to overcome this limitation by combining existing observations to mitigate limitations of any one particular sensor. While multi-sensor applications are not new, the integration and harmonization of multi-sensor data is still challenging, requiring tremendous efforts of science and operational user communities.
   Defined by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) as a "set of space and ground segment capabilities that operate in a coordinated manner to meet a combined and common set of Earth Observation requirements", virtual constellations can principally be used to combine sensors with similar spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric characteristics. We extend this definition to also include sensors that are principally incompatible, because they are fundamentally different (for instance active versus passive remote sensing systems), but their combination is necessary and beneficial to achieve a specific monitoring goal. In this case, constellations are more likely to build upon the complementarity of resultant information products from these incompatible sensors rather than the raw physical measurements. In this communication, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding virtual constellations for terrestrial science applications, discuss potentials and limitations of various candidate sensors, and provide context on integration of sensors. Thematically, we focus on land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC), with emphasis given to medium spatial resolution (Le., pixels sided 10 to 100 m) sensors, specifically as a complement to those onboard the Landsat series of satellites. We conclude that virtual constellations have the potential to notably improve observation capacity and thereby Earth science and monitoring programs in general. Various national and international parties have made notable and valuable progress related to virtual constellations. There is, however, inertia inherent to Earth observation programs, largely related to their complexity, as well as national interests, observation aims, and high system costs. Herein we define and describe virtual constellations, offer the science and applications information needs to offer context, provide the scientific support for a range of virtual constellation levels based upon applications readiness, capped by a discussion of issues and opportunities toward facilitating implementation of virtual constellations (in their various forms).

AB Recent studies showed that machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)) reasonably reproduce passive microwave brightness temperature observations over snow-covered land as measured by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the ML algorithms relative to ML inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose ML performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately 20% of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than 65% of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in SWE at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, SWE with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons. Therefore, these findings suggest that compared with the ANN, the SVM could potentially serve as a more efficient and effective measurement model operator within a Tb data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving SWE estimates across regional- and continental-scales.

   VARIABILITY; ULTRAVIOLET; DECREASE
AB Existing Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) ultraviolet (UV) data for the west region of the Southern Ocean indicate a decreasing trend. Since the area surrounding Antarctica is largely unpolluted, LER changes can only be due to variations in the cloud cover and/or in the sea ice extension. In order to evaluate their influence on LER and assess the trend of the UV reflectivity under ice-free and various sea ice concentration (SIC) levels, we compared a multi-satellite-based LER dataset with different satellite observations of cloud cover and SIC for October to March from 1979 to 2012. Despite the high cloud fraction for most of this period, sea ice was found to be the main driver of LER variability and had a greater influence on LER variability than cloud cover. The cloud cover was lower in spring than in summer for all datasets, and this difference appears to be primarily associated with the sea ice extent. While an increment of the cloud fraction of 20% has been found to cause an increase in LER of up to 13 reflectivity units (RU) under ice-free conditions, this increase is halved under low SIC. In contrast, no significant changes in LER data were found under high SIC levels. The correlation between LER and SIC is evident when the latter is higher than approximately 30%. The best correlations (r) between LER and SIC were found for the Weddell Sea (r = 0.87), the Ross Sea (r = 0.85), and the Indian Ocean (r = 0.90) for November, and for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (r = 0.86) and the Pacific Ocean (r = 0.83) for February and October, respectively. In contrast, no correlation was found in the proximity of the coastlines of west Antarctica in October. Overall, an enhancement of SIC from 0% to 100% results in a LER increase of 44 RU. This value is larger than the corresponding sea ice-induced increase computed for the observed and modeled shortwave albedos at the top of the atmosphere (21 and 13 RU, respectively). The LER data distributions for different regions and months show a marked seasonal double peak in reflectivity. The highest relative frequency is driven by the sea ice and peaks at approximately 90 RU, whereas the secondary peak of approximately 50 RU is dominated by cloudiness. Negative trends in the UV reflectivity of the grid cells characterized by a SIC greater than 30% were found for the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas (up to -3.6 +/- 1.0 per decade in March). Trends computed over the entire Southern Ocean for mid/high SIC bins are mostly negative, although are often not statistically significant. However, the trend in the reflectivity of the ice-free grid cells was generally positive, probably due to changes in the cloud amount/opacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The recent rise in global demand for natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) has led to expansive areas of natural forest being transformed into monoculture plantations. This paper explores the utility of annual Landsat time series for monitoring forest disturbance and the role of natural rubber in mainland Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. A region on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was chosen for this study considering four primary questions: 1) how accurately can annual Landsat time series map the location and timing of forest disturbances in evergreen and seasonal tropical forests, 2) are there cross-border differences in frontier and non-frontier forest disturbance rates between Cambodia and Vietnam, 3) what proportion of disturbances in frontier and non-frontier forests can be accounted for by the impact of rubber plantations, and 4) is there a relationship between global market prices for natural rubber and the annual rate of frontier forest clearing for rubber plantations on both sides of the border. We used LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) for temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series and disturbance mapping. Our results show that this approach can provide accurate forest disturbance maps but that accuracy is affected by forest type. Highest accuracies were found in evergreen forest (91%), with lower accuracies in mixed (82%) and dry-deciduous forest types (86%). Our final map considering all forest types yielded an overall accuracy of 86%. Forest disturbance rates were generally higher on the Cambodian side of the border. Frontier forest disturbance rates averaged 3.8%/year in Cambodia compared to 2.5%/year in Vietnam. Conversion to rubber was the dominant form of frontier forest change in both countries (42% in Cambodia and 84% in Vietnam). Non-frontier forest disturbances averaged 4.0% and 2.5% in Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, with most disturbances likewise linked with rubber plantations. Although rates of frontier forest disturbance differed in both countries, they each displayed similar correlations between disturbance rates related to rubber plantation expansion and price fluctuations of natural rubber. This suggests links between localized land cover/use change and international market forces, irrespective of differing political and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study underlines the value of using dense Landsat time series when exploring the dynamics of human-induced land cover change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The methodology for selection, creation, and application of a global remote sensing validation dataset using high resolution commercial satellite data is presented. High resolution data are obtained for a stratified random sample of 500 primary sampling units (5 km x 5 km sample blocks), where the stratification based on Koppen climate classes is used to distribute the sample globally among biomes. The high resolution data are classified to categorical land cover maps using an analyst mediated classification workflow. Our initial application of these data is to evaluate a global 30 m Landsat-derived, continuous field tree cover product. For this application, the categorical reference classification produced at 2 m resolution is converted to percent tree cover per 30 m pixel (secondary sampling unit)for comparison to Landsat-derived estimates of tree cover. We provide example results (based on a subsample of 25 sample blocks in South America) illustrating basic analyses of agreement that can be produced from these reference data. Commercial high resolution data availability and data quality are shown to provide a viable means of validating continuous field tree cover. When completed, the reference classifications for the full sample of 500 blocks will be released for public use. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1% (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9%), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4% of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1 Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6 Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 112 Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.

AB We have, for the first time, developed a simple linear regression model based on PALSAR ScanSAR backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)), water levels from Envisat altimetry, and MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) product to generate water depth maps over flooded forest in the central Congo Basin. The water depth maps we generated are relative to the lowest water level from Envisat altimetry, which is assumed to be a base level with essentially zero depth. The predicted and observed water depths along the Envisat pass showed excellent agreements with RMS differences of 12.8 cm to 17.8 cm. The water depth maps were also independently validated with oh/at obtained from PALSAR interferometry, and storage anomalies estimated by multiplying inundation extents from PALSAR ScanSAR with spatially averaged water level anomalies from Envisat altimetry. The water storage volumes calculated from our water depth maps were calculated to be 11.3 +/- 2.0 km(3), 103 +/- 23 km(3), and 93 +/- 1.8 km(3) for 12/05/2006,12/08/2007, and 12/10/2008, respectively. It is expected that our method can be applied to other river basins that have flooded forest with satellite radar altimeter over-passes. The water depth maps can be directly used to calibrate and validate the spatial and temporal variation of inundation extent and water depth in the wetland derived from a 2-D hydrodynamic model. Furthermore, our water depth maps can be used as a "true" dataset to perform a pre-launch "virtual mission" study of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2020.

AB The segmentation of remotely sensed images acquired over tropical forests is of great interest for numerous ecological applications, such as forest inventories or conservation and management of ecosystems, for which species classification techniques and estimation of the number of individuals are highly valuable inputs. In this paper, we propose a method for hyperspectral image segmentation, based on the binary partition tree (BPT) algorithm, and we apply it to two sites located in Hawaiian and Panamean tropical rainforests. Different strategies combining spatial and spectral dimensionality reduction are compared prior to the construction of the BPT. Various superpixel generation methods including watershed transformation and mean shift clustering are applied to decrease spatial dimensionality and provide an initial segmentation map. Principal component analysis is performed to reduce the spectral dimensionality and different combinations of principal components are compared. A non-parametric region model based on histograms, combined with the diffusion distance to merge regions, is used to build the BPT. An adapted pruning strategy based on the size discontinuity of the merging regions is proposed and compared with an already existing pruning strategy. Finally, a set of criteria to assess the quality of the tree segmentation is introduced. The proposed method correctly segmented up to 68% of the tree crowns and produced reasonable patterns of the segmented landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High spatio-temporal resolution optical remote sensing data provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor and detect forest disturbance and loss. To demonstrate this potential, a 12-year time series (2000 to 2011) with an 8-day interval of a 30 m spatial resolution data was generated by the use of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) with Landsat sensor observations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as input. The time series showed a close relationship over homogeneous forested and grassland sites, with r(2) values of 0.99 between Landsat and the closest STARFM simulated data; and values of 0.84 and 0.94 between MODE and STARFM. The time and magnitude of clearing and re-clearing events were estimated through a phenological breakpoint analysis, with 96.2% of the estimated breakpoints of the clearing event and 83.6% of the re-clearing event being within 40 days of the true clearing. The study highlights the benefits of using these moderate resolution data for quantifying and understanding land cover change in open forest environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, ALOS PALSAR data have been used to map above ground biomass (AGB) in savanna ecosystems in Cameroon. The study has been motivated by the need to have estimates of carbon in African savannas. The L-band PALSAR mosaic data are suitable for the retrieval of savanna biomass (typically less than 100 Mg.ha(-1)) at national and continental scales. The retrieval methods have been developed using the following steps a) collection of in situ data and estimate of AGB and its uncertainties, b) pre-processing of SAR data, with an emphasis on the reduction of uncertainties due to speckle, while preserving the SAR resolution (25 m), c) development of a regression model with a reduced number of fitting parameters. The methodology is developed in a representative study area where in situ data are collected, using standard PALSAR Fine Beam Dual polarisation data, and d) pixel-to-pixel mapping of AGB over 259 228 km(2) of Cameroon savanna using PALSAR mosaic data. The dense tropical forest has been masked using the GlobCover 2009 land cover map. A value of AGB and its uncertainty has been assigned to each pixel. The results indicate a total AGB of 1.25 +/- 0.04 Pg or 0.63 +/- 0.02 PgC of above-ground carbon in the Cameroon savanna. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Solar radiation flux, irradiance, is a fundamental driver of almost all hydrological and biological processes. Ecological models of these processes often require data at the watershed scale. GIS-based solar models that predict insolation at the watershed scale take topographic shading into account, but do not account for vegetative shading. Most methods that quantify subcanopy insolation do so only at a single point. Further, subcanopy model calibration requires significant field effort and knowledge of characteristics (species composition, leaf area index & mean leaf angle for each species), and upscaling to watersheds is a significant source of uncertainty.
   We propose an approach to modeling insolation that uses airborne LiDAR data to estimate canopy openness as a Light Penetration Index (LPI). We couple LPI with the GRASS GIS r.sun solar model to produce the Subcanopy Solar Radiation model (SSR). SSR accounts for both topographic shading and vegetative shading at a landscape scale.
   After calibrating the r.sun model to a weather station at our study site, we compare SSR model predictions to black thermopile pyranometer field measurements and to hemispherical photographs using Gap Light Analyzer software, a standard method for point estimation of subcanopy radiation. Both SSR and hemispherical models exhibit a similar linear relationship with pyranometer data, and the models predict similar total solar radiation flux across the range of canopy openness. This approach allows prediction of light regimes at watershed scales with resolution that was previously possible only for local point measurements. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of the sub-pixel bi-spectral fire temperature and area retrieval with moderate and coarse spatial resolution satellite data has grown in recent years despite the numerous significant limitations of the method. Many of these limitations arise from a well-known sensitivity to errors in the 11-mu m background radiance estimate used in the retrieval. Since this estimate is almost always obtained by averaging neighboring pixels, the accuracy of the bi-spectral retrieval is intrinsically coupled to the local 11-mu m surface variability at the scale of the sensor footprint. In this paper, we explore the impact of this variability on the accuracy of the retrieval using ten years of 1-km MODIS fire data. In addition, we propose a simple a priori rejection test to identify and eliminate cases in which the retrieval is destined for failure (i.e., has no physically valid solution), or has a greater likelihood of yielding highly inaccurate fire area and average temperature estimates as a result of this variability. Finally, we examine the implications of our rejection scheme on the feasibility of performing the bi-spectral retrieval globally using MODIS and other comparable 1-km sensors. Under our proposed rejection criterion based on 11-mu m background variability, the bi-spectral retrieval could be performed with sufficient accuracy (here defined as limiting the average bias in retrieved fire fraction to approximately a factor of two) for only 7% of all MODIS fire pixels detected globally during the ten-year study period. Consideration of additional error sources is likely to further reduce this fraction. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc

AB Water deficit indices based on the spatial relationship between surface temperature (Ts) and NDVI, known as triangle approaches, are widely used for drought monitoring. However, their application has been recently questioned when the main factor limiting evapotranspiration is energy. Even though water is the main control in dryland ecosystems, these can also undergo periods of energy and temperature limitation. In this paper we aimed to: (i) evaluate the TVDI (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index) to estimate water deficits (e.g. ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration), and heat surface fluxes using MODIS data; and (ii) provide insights about the factors most affecting the accuracy of results. Factors considered included the type of climatic control on evapotranspiration, NE, (i.e. water-limited vs. energy-limited), the quality of T-air estimates, the heterogeneity of land cover types and climatic variables in the region, or the algorithm to extract hydrological boundaries from the images.
   The TVDI was compared with eddy covariance (EC) data from two shrublands with different climatic controls for XE in South Spain. Evaluations showed that it could be used to estimate the water deficit when water was the main limiting factor (R = 0.81-0.88; Mean Average Error, MAE = 0.16-0.17) but not in energy-limited situations (R < 02; MAE = 0.10-0.2). Spatial heterogeneity in climatic variables also had a different impact on accuracy depending on limiting factors. Relative humidity was significant at the water-limited site while solar irradiance and air temperature were more important at the energy-limited site. The skill of the TVDI to estimate surface fluxes at the water-limited site was confirmed for the dominant sensible heat flux, H (R-2 = 0.93; Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE = 12.85%) but not for NE (R2 = 0.01, MAPE = 115.22%) as NE fluxes at this site are just slightly above the error of the eddy covariance system. At the energy-limited site, XE (R2 = 0.74; MAPE = 31.83%) and H estimates (R2 = 0.80; MAPE = 26.85%) were better than those from the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) or the PML (Penman-Monteith-Leuning) models. However, the skill to predict surface fluxes in this case was due to the net radiation inputs and not by the TVDI input Our analyses also suggest: (1) to apply the TVDI excluding energy-limited sites/periods based on climatic knowledge of limiting factors on NE; (2) the best conditions for TVDI performance correspond to the situation when the controlling factors are less limiting, e.g. during the growing season (higher SWC and lower VPD); and (3) to account better for the role of vegetation controls on transpiration.

AB The directional multispectral hybrid type forest radiative transfer model FRT by Kuusk and Nilson (2000) was compared using directional reflectance factor of high angular resolution measured over three mature hemiboreal forest stands in Estonia. The model systematically underestimated backward scattering even in the case of the best available input data, especially in coniferous stands. The measured BRF distribution could be reproduced if the spherical leaf angle distribution was replaced by erectophile in order to better model the angular dependence of gap fraction, and the Ross-Nilson area scattering phase function was replaced by significantly more asymmetric Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The limited amount of available data does not allow deciding how universal are the applied asymmetry parameter values. The asymmetry of the phase function may depend on the species composition, stand age, and site type. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface albedo and emissivity are essential variables in surface energy balance. In recent decades, several land surface energy models have used both surface broadband albedo and emissivity in order to achieve reliable evapotranspiration retrievals on a daily basis. Despite these improvements in surface energy models, we noticed an assumption that most studies make when using this framework. It assumes that the surface broadband albedo and emissivity can be estimated directly as a weighted average of spectral surface bi-directional reflectances, and as a weighted average of spectral surface emissivities retrieved at a given view angle, respectively. However, this approach does not take into account surface anisotropy, which is described by the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) in the case of the surface albedo. In this paper, we analyze the influence that estimating land surface albedo directly from the surface reflectance (alpha(REF)) or through the BRDF integration (alpha(BRDF)) has on the estimation of energy balance components (net radiation, latent and sensible heat fluxes and evapotranspiration) by using the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI). To this end, in-situ data and remote sensing images acquisitioned at different view zenith angles (VZA) such as 0 degrees, +/- 40 degrees and +/- 57 degrees by the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over an agricultural area were used. Results show high variation in alpha(REF) depending on the VZA when compared to alpha(BRDF), with the highest difference observed in the backward scattering direction along the hot spot region (RMSE of 0.11 and relative error of 65%). Net radiation gives relative errors from 6 to 17%, with the maximum error obtained in the images that include the hot spot effect, whereas significant changes are not observed in case of the ground heat flux and the evaporative fraction. However, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and daily evapotranspiration show relative errors ranging between 23-39%, 6-18% and 5-15% respectively. In a future study, the influence of estimating surface emissivity directly from the average of spectral emissivities under a given view angle or using a hemispherical value will be analyzed.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in investigating environmental, ecological processes and climate change at various scales, and is also valuable in the studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture conditions, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. These studies require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of TIR data, but rare of those can enhance both spatial and temporal details. This paper presents a new data fusion algorithm for producing Landsat-like LST data by blending daily MODIS and periodic Landsat TM datasets. The original Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was improved and modified for predicting thermal radiance and LST data by considering annual temperature cycle (ATC) and urban thermal landscape heterogeneity. The technique of linear spectral mixture analysis was employed to relate the Landsat radiance with the MODIS one, so that the temporal changes in radiance can be incorporated in the fusion model. This paper details the theoretical basis and the implementation procedures of the proposed data fusion algorithm, Spatio-temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Temperature mapping (SADFAT). A case study was conducted that predicted LSTs of five dates in 2005 from July to October in Los Angeles County, California. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 13 K to 2 K Like existing spatio-temporal data fusion models, the SADFAT method has a limitation in predicting LST changes that were not recorded in the MODIS and/or Landsat pixels due to the model assumption.

AB Validation of remotely sensed soil moisture is complicated by the difference in scale between remote sensing footprints and traditional ground-based soil moisture measurements. To address this issue, a new method was developed to evaluate the information content of remotely sensed soil moisture data using only large-scale precipitation. Under statistically stationary conditions, precipitation conditionally averaged according to soil moisture results in a sigmoidal curve, with high average precipitation corresponding to high average soil moisture, in a manner that reflects the dependence of drainage and evaporation on soil moisture. However, errors in soil moisture measurement degrade this relationship. Thus, soil moisture data can be assessed by the degree to which the natural sigmoidal relationship is preserved. The metric of mutual information was used as an error-dependent measure of the strength of the sigmoidal relationship. In this way, a choice model was constructed between different soil moisture data records, based on maximum mutual information. Three AMSR-E soil moisture algorithms (VUA-NASA, NASA, and U. Montana) were evaluated with the choice model for a nine-year period (2002-2011) over the contiguous United States at 1/4 degrees latitude-longitude resolution, using NLDAS precipitation. The U. Montana product resulted in the highest mutual information for 50% of the region, followed closely by VUA-NASA at 47%, and distantly by NASA at 3%. Areas where the U. Montana product yielded the maximum mutual information generally coincided with low vegetation biomass and flatter terrain, while the VUA-NASA product contained more useful information in more rugged and more highly vegetated areas.

AB The present study aims to investigate the potential of the random forests ensemble classification and regression technique to improve rainfall rate assignment during day, night and twilight (resulting in 24-hour precipitation estimates) based on cloud physical properties retrieved from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) data.
   Random forests (RF) models contain a combination of characteristics that make them well suited for its application in precipitation remote sensing. One of the key advantages is the ability to capture non-linear association of patterns between predictors and response which becomes important when dealing with complex non-linear events like precipitation. Due to the deficiencies of existing optical rainfall retrievals, the focus of this study is on assigning rainfall rates to precipitating cloud areas in connection with extra-tropical cyclones in mid-latitudes including both convective and advective-stratiform precipitating cloud areas. Hence, the rainfall rates are assigned to rain areas previously identified and classified according to the precipitation formation processes. As predictor variables water vapor-IR differences and IR cloud top temperature are used to incorporate information on cloud top height. Delta T8.7-10.8 and Delta T10.8-12.1 are considered to supply information about the cloud phase. Furthermore, spectral SEVIRI channels (VIS0.6, VIS0.8, NIR1.6) and cloud properties (cloud effective radius, cloud optical thickness) are used to include information about the cloud water path during daytime, while suitable combinations of temperature differences (Delta T3.9-10.8, Delta T3.9-7.3) are considered during night-time.
   The development of the rainfall rate retrieval technique is realised in three steps. First, an extensive tuning study is carried out to customise each of the RE models. The daytime, night-time and twilight precipitation events have to be treated separately due to differing information content about the cloud properties between the different times of day. Secondly, the RF models are trained using the optimum values for the number of trees and number of randomly chosen predictor variables found in the tuning study. Finally, the final RF models are used to predict rainfall rates using an independent validation data set and the results are validated against co-located rainfall rates observed by a ground radar network. To train and validate the model, the radar-based RADOLAN RW product from the German Weather Service (DWD) is used which provides area-wide gauge-adjusted hourly precipitation information.
   Regarding the overall performance, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (Rsq), hourly rainfall rates show already a good correlation with Rsq = 0.5 (day and night) and Rsq = 0.48 (twilight) between the satellite and radar based observations. Higher temporal aggregation leads to better agreement. Rsq rises to 0.78 (day), 0.77 (night) and 0.75 (twilight) for 8-h interval. By comparing day, night and twilight performance it becomes evident that daytime precipitation is generally predicted best by the model. Twilight and night-time predictions are generally less accurate but only by a small margin. This may due to the smaller number of predictor variables during twilight and night-time conditions as well as less favourable radiative transfer conditions to obtain the cloud parameters during these periods.
   However, the results show that with the newly developed method it is possible to assign rainfall rates with good accuracy even on an hourly basis. Furthermore, the rainfall rates can be assigned during day, night and twilight conditions which enables the estimation of rainfall rates 24 h day. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Argentine continental shelf and shelf-break regions comprise a large and rich biological area of the ocean. However, field estimations of primary production are scarce, making remote sensing of ocean color a valuable tool to provide synoptic maps of primary production in this ecologically relevant region. Field studies performed during spring 2005, and summer and winter 2006 showed a high spatial and seasonal variability in the daily integrated water column primary production, chlorophyll-a and biomass-normalized photosynthetic parameters. Using field measurements, five different and relatively simple (non-spectral and vertically homogeneous biomass) models were tested: three chlorophyll-, one carbon- and one absorption-based model. The chlorophyll-based 'BIOM' model developed by Platt and Sathyendranath (Science, 241:1613-1620; 1988) provided the closest estimates to the field values, and was selected as the local algorithm. Its performance was assessed using simultaneous satellite-derived products and field photosynthetic parameters as input. Close values compared to the field estimates were obtained using BIOM (Absolute Percent Difference error, APD similar to 10%), even though satellite-derived products used as input to the model (i.e. chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient in the photosynthetically active radiation range - PAR-, and PAR irradiance) showed relative high errors (APD similar to 40%, 20% and 50%, respectively). Provided that an efficient way to assign the physiological parameters in a pixel-by-pixel basis is found, this model seems to be the best to produce primary production maps from remote sensing of ocean color in the southern Argentine shelf and shelf-break regions.

AB Extracting large scale water storage (WS) patterns is essential for understanding the hydrological cycle and improving the water resource management of Iran, a country that is facing challenges of limited water resources. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission offers a unique possibility of monitoring total water storage (TWS) changes. An accurate estimation of terrestrial and surface WS changes from GRACE-TWS products, however, requires a proper signal separation procedure. To perform this separation, this study proposes a statistical approach that uses a priori spatial patterns of terrestrial and surface WS changes from a hydrological model and altimetry data. The patterns are then adjusted to GRACE-TWS products using a least squares adjustment (LSA) procedure, thereby making the best use of the available data. For the period of October 2002 to March 2011, monthly GRACE-TWS changes were derived over a broad region encompassing Iran. A priori patterns were derived by decomposing the following auxiliary data into statistically independent components: (i) terrestrial WS change outputs of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS); (ii) steric-corrected surface WS changes of the Caspian Sea; (iii) that of the Persian and Oman Gulfs; (iv) WS changes of the Aral Sea; and (v) that of small lakes of the selected region. Finally, the patterns of (i) to (v) were adjusted to GRACE-TWS maps so that their contributions were estimated and GRACE-TWS signals separated. After separation, our results indicated that the annual amplitude of WS changes over the Caspian Sea was 152 mm, 101 mm over both the Persian and Oman Gulfs, and 71 mm for the Aral Sea. Since January 2005, terrestrial WS in most parts of Iran, specifically over the center and northwestern parts, exhibited a mass decrease with an average linear rate of similar to 15 mm/yr. The estimated linear trends of groundwater storage for the drought period of 2005 to March 2011, corresponding to the six main basins of Iran: Khazar, Persian and Oman Gulfs, Urmia, Markazi, Hamoon, and Srakhs were -6.7, -6.1, -11.2, -9.1, -3.1, and -4.2 mm/yr, respectively. The estimated results after separation agree fairly well with 256 in-situ piezometric observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   IMPACT
AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the East China Sea (ECS) have been reported every year in the last decade, and satellite remote sensing has often been used to study the bloom size and duration. Yet satellite remote sensing suffered from lack of reliable algorithms to detect HABs in optically complex coastal waters and from frequent cloud cover. Thus, it has not been possible to document short-term changes of HABs in synoptic scales. Here, using measurements from the Geo-stationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), we studied diurnal changes of a HAB of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum donghaiense in the ECS in May 2011. The standard remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products from the GDPS processing algorithms showed promise in delineating HABs in turbid coastal waters, yet the cloud-masking is often too tight to reveal valid cloud-free data. An alternative approach was developed to circumvent this difficulty by using the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) and a normalization technique. A modified red tide index (RI) was developed from the normalized R-rc data at 443,490 and 555 nm, and proven effective in delineating the P. donghaiense bloom in sediment-rich waters. The hourly RI images on 29 and 30 May 2011 (8 images per day from 8:30 to 15:30) showed consistent bloom evolution through the course of a day, with physical locations driven by tides while its surface expression increased significantly from early morning to early afternoon (maximum around 14:30 local time, a 124% and 163% increase from 9:30, respectively). The maximum coverage of the HAB at 14:30 on 29 May 2011, when no cloud was observed, reached 6620 km(2). While the short-term changes in the surface expression could be a result of the horizontal dilution due to tides, vertical migration of the dinoflagellate from early morning to afternoon, as reported elsewhere, may be a dominant reason. The case study here demonstrates the unique value of a geostationary satellite ocean color sensor in revealing short-term dynamics of HABs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture plays an essential role in the terrestrial water cycle. It is very important to obtain soil moisture for many applications. Soil moisture acquired by remote sensing, land surface modeling, and data assimilation must be evaluated against in-situ measurements before being used, but a procedure should be performed to upscale the point-scale measurements to the grid-scale or footprint-scale. In this study, a new upscaling algorithm is developed by introducing MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia (ATI). First, a functional relationship between the station-averaged soil moisture and the pixel-averaged ATI is constructed. Second, this relationship is used to calculate the representative soil moisture time series at a certain spatial scale. Last, the Bayesian linear regression is applied to obtain the upscaled area-averaged soil moisture by using in-situ measurements as independent variables. The algorithm is evaluated using a network of in-situ moisture sensors in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that it can effectively obtain the area-averaged soil moisture, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.023 m(3)/m(3) before upscaling to 0.013 m(3)/m(3) after upscaling. Finally, the algorithm is implemented to the 100 km x 100 km grid box where the network is installed, and the temporal pattern of the upscaled soil moisture agrees with the hydro-meteorological knowledge of this region.

AB Accurate latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat flux partitioning from Land Surface Models (LSMs) is important for numerical weather prediction. Land data assimilation can play a key role in improving heat flux prediction by merging information from a range of remotely sensed products with LSMs. This paper demonstrates this potential for an open grassland site in Australia via one-dimensional experiments spanning a year-long period. With a focus on how a LSM is impacted, in-situ field observations were assimilated. Data types as available from passive microwave and thermal infra-red remote sensors were tested for their impact, with individual and joint assimilation of LE and H, near-surface soil moisture, and skin temperature observations-all on time scales approximating satellite overpass intervals. Assessed against independent data from field observations, the multi-observation approach of joint near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation made the greatest improvements to LE (expressed as daily evapotranspiration; ET), being slightly better than for joint LE and H assimilation. This result questions the value of using LE and H retrievals from thermal imagery within an assimilation context. Individually, skin temperature assimilation was one of the best performers for soil temperature estimates but with degraded root-zone soil moisture estimates and minimal ET improvements. Likewise, near-surface soil moisture assimilation produced the greatest root-zone soil moisture improvement but with relatively modest ET improvement. Combined near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation balanced the improvements to both soil moisture and temperature states along with strong improvements to ET estimates, highlighting the benefits of multi-observation assimilation.

AB Water-level changes from 56 of the 100 largest lakes in China were derived from ICESat/GLAS data during the period of 2003 to 2009. An automated method for determining the trend of water-level change had been proposed in this study. Lake water footprints were first identified from the ICESat/GLAS GLA14 data product. Water level change was then determined from the footprints over lake water in each campaign. Trend of water-level changes was fitted with a line for each lake. Trends of water level changes from ICESat/GLAS matched well with gauge measurements in both Qinghai Lake and Nam Co. Our results showed that the trend of water-level change varied from -0.51 m/a to 0.62 m/a. Eighteen lakes showed a decreasing trend of water-level change and 38 lakes showed an increasing trend. Most lakes in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed an increasing trend which was probably caused by snow or glacier melts under climate warming. However, most lakes in the Yarlung Zangbu River basin showed a decreasing trend presumably resulting from intensified evaporation caused by climate warming and intensified western wind in the winter. Desertification and aggravated soil erosion in this region contributed to water level decrease. Lakes in northern Inner-Mongolia and Xinjiang and Northeast Plain of China showed decreasing trends with precipitation reduction and warming as the most probable reasons. Water consumption for agricultural use also contributed to water-level decrease in lakes of those regions. Lakes in East China Plain fluctuated presumably because most lakes were greatly affected by inflows of Yangtze River and human activities. Lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau also fluctuated. There were no obvious changes in climate warming or precipitation in this region. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A small-scale oceanic eddy, which was generated in autumn 2011 at the headland of Cap-Vert off the coast of Senegal, West Africa, and then propagated westward into the open North Atlantic Ocean, is studied by multi-sensor satellite and surface drifter data. The eddy was generated after a sudden increase of the trade winds causing an enhanced southward flow and upwelling at the coast of Senegal. After this wind burst event, an extremely nonlinear cyclonic eddy with a radius of about 10 to 20 km evolved downstream of Cap-Vert with Rossby number larger than one. Our analysis suggests that the eddy was generated by flow separation at the headland of Cap-Vert. The eddy was tracked on its way into the open North Atlantic Ocean from satellites over 31 days via its sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a (CHL) signature and by a satellite-tracked surface drifter. The satellite images show that this small-scale eddy transported nutrients from the upwelling region westward into the oligotrophic North Atlantic thus giving rise to enhanced CHL concentration there. Maximum CHL concentration was encountered few days after vortex generation, which is consistent with a delayed plankton growth following nutrient supply into the euphotic zone within the eddy. Furthermore, the eddy was imaged by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the Envisat satellite. It is shown that the radar signatures of cold eddies result from damping of short surface waves by biogenic surface films which arise from surface-active material secreted by the biota in the cold eddy as well as by the change of the stability of the air-sea interface.

AB Evaluations of existing land cover maps have revealed that high landscape heterogeneity and small patch sizes are a major reason for misclassification. These problems globally occur in biomes of mixed vegetation structure and are particularly relevant for African savannas. This paper presents a multi-resolution approach to derive fractional cover of vegetation growth forms at sub-pixel level, aiming at an improved mapping of land cover in the African grassland, savanna and shrubland biome. Fractional cover is delineated for woody growth forms (trees and shrubs), herbaceous growth forms, and bare surface. The approach incorporates very high resolution (QuickBird/IKONOS, 0.6-1 m), high resolution (Landsat TM/ETM+, 30 m), and medium resolution data (MODIS, 250 m). While QuickBird/IKONOS data are classified into discrete classes, at Landsat and MODIS resolutions, sub-pixel cover is delineated using non-parametric ensemble regression trees from the random forest family. The propagation of errors in the hierarchical multi-resolution approach is assessed with Monte Carlos simulations.
   The multi-resolution approach allows the adequate description of the heterogeneous vegetation structure in selected study regions of Southern Africa The RMSE of the delineated fractional cover values range between 3.1% and 8.2% when compared with higher resolution data and between 4.4% and 9.9% when compared with field surveys. Errors at the Landsat resolution show minor influence on the accuracy of the MODIS results. Regarding the inter-resolution error propagation, for 90% of the Monte Carlo simulations, errors at the Landsat resolution resulted in RMSEs for MODIS increased by less than 4% (woody vegetation), 3.5% (herbaceous vegetation) and 2% (bare surface).

AB By using a global data set (NOMAD), improved algorithms were developed for deducing from ocean color remote sensing data the concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, total chlorophyll alpha (TChl_alpha), zeaxanthin (Zea) and fucoxanthin (Fuco), and the associated primary phytoplankton groups, namely, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, haptophytes and diatoms, in the oceans. A modified classification for the waters of the world's ocean based on the dominant phytoplankton group was then devised. By using a local data set from the northern South China Sea (NSCS), algorithms were also developed for assessing the cell abundances of picophytoplankton, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and pico-eukaryotes, in this region. These algorithms were then applied to the remotely sensed data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer at Aqua sensor (MODIS-Aqua) to study the abundances and the distributional patterns of picophytoplankton in the entire NSCS. The results agreed well with field observations, which were available only from selected locations in the study area. On a basin scale, the results were consistent with expected variations in phytoplankton pigments, phytoplankton community composition, and picophytoplankton biomass, in response to the major known environmental phenomena in the NSCS, such as the progressive increase in biological productivity towards the coast, the runoff from the Pearl River, higher biological productivity in the wintertime, upwelling around the Taiwan Bank, winter upwelling northwest of the Luzon Island, and the transformation and dissipation of internal waves off the Dongsha Atoll. This work represents the first effort in estimating the cell abundances of the principal picophytoplankton groups in the oceans from space. The general application of this approach to the global ocean needs to be further validated and calibrated with a more extensive data base from field observations in other parts of the oceans.

AB Supervised classification of land cover across space and time is a long-standing goal of the Earth Science community. Although most past and current analyses focus on detecting changes between two or more times, the opening of the USGS Landsat archive in 2009 has enabled exploration of methods for higher-frequency, time-serial monitoring of land cover dynamics. Modifying the protocols used to develop the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001), we fit a single classifier to a spatio-temporally distributed reference sample and applied the model to 55 Landsat-5 images covering a section of the North Carolina Piedmont Plateau from 1984 to 2007. A generalized classification scheme, multi-temporal sampling design, supervised classification based on intra-annual spectral indices, and design-based accuracy assessment yielded a time-series of 16 land cover maps from 1985 to 2006 with a spatial extent of 1.7x 10(6) ha, minimum mapping unit of 1 ha, and mean temporal interval of <2 years. Comparable to accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Layer for the region, overall accuracy for a spatio-temporally independent test sample was 75%, with K=0.7. When weighted by class proportions, percent correctly classified and kappa rose to 88% and 0.84, respectively. The resulting map series shows spatially and temporally complex changes in water, urban, forest, and herbaceous cover resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes that would not be observable in either unior bi-temporal maps. Agricultural crop area dropped from similar to 45% in the 1980s to similar to 36% in the 1990s and then rose slightly to similar to 38% at the end of the period. Forest area increased to a maximum of similar to 55% in the 1990s and then dropped to similar to 53% in 2005. Urban growth appeared to be most rapid in the 1980s and 1990s and slowed thereafter. With continued focus on the semantics, causation, sampling, and uncertainty underlying spectral land cover classification, long-term series of Landsat images will provide increasingly robust, reliable records for a growing scientific user community. These multi-temporal datasets will be indispensable for understanding past land cover dynamics and predicting the implications of future change on the provision and management of ecosystem services.

AB The size of snow grains plays an important role for modeling the snow albedo in polar regions. The Snow Grain Size and Pollution (SGSP) retrieval computes the snow grain size using spectral reflectances from the Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS): the channels at 0.47 mu m, 0.86 mu m, and 1.24 mu m. The unique feature of the SGSP retrieval is that it does not require a-priori information on the snow grain shape.
   In this paper, the SGSP-retrieved snow grain size is validated with six data sets from ground measurement campaigns in the Arctic, the Antarctic, Greenland, and Japan. Almost half of the comparison cases have a difference below 15%; the correlation coefficient is 0.86. The application of the SGSP retrieval on the Antarctic Ross ice shelf demonstrates the potential to detect snow fall events by analyzing the snow grain size time series for sudden grain size decreases.

AB Remote sensing studies, based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), have shown controversial findings on the dry season and drought sensitivity of tropical forests. Here, we used Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)/Terra data to study view-illumination effects on intra- and inter-annual EVI variability in the dry season of the Brazilian Xingu Indigenous Park between 2005 and 2010. In this period, the Amazon region experienced the two most extensive droughts of the 21st century, but the study area was not severely affected by the 2005 drought when compared to the 2010 episode. Bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) was analyzed in Seasonal Semideciduous Forest. Intra-annual dry season EVI was evaluated as a function of the reflectance of MISR bands, MISR view zenith angles (VZA), view direction (forward scattering or backscattering), solar zenith angle (SZA), and the shade fraction from linear spectral mixture model. In a subsequent analysis, we used only the MISR nadir camera to eliminate the impacts of view angle and view direction on inter-annual EVI variability. Furthermore, we standardized the EVI monthly and quarterly using 2005 and 2010 as references. Results showed that view angle, view direction and solar illumination introduced significant intra- and inter-annual EVI variability not directly associated with canopy photosynthetic activity. Because of the stronger near-infrared (NIR) reflectance dependence, EVI was much more sensitive to view angle and view direction than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), especially between +/- 45.6 degrees and nadir. EVI increased with view angle from forward scattering to backscattering. At MISR nadir viewing, EVI increased from the beginning to the end of the dry season due to increasing NIR reflectance resulting from a decreasing SZA from 43 degrees (June) to 28 degrees (September) and from a reduction in shade fraction. Monthly and quarterly inter-annual analysis using the MISR nadir camera showed the absence of well-defined patterns between the EVI, canopy greenness and droughts. Nadir EVI curves had similar patterns between the years when considering the standard deviation values. EVI differences across months were random and below the average standard deviation calculated between June and September of 2005 or 2010 (+/- 0.03). Due to the uncertainties, the quarterly standardized EVI mean was higher for 2005 (+ 0.349 +/- 0.839) than for 2010 (+ 0.041 +/- 0.754), but the opposite was observed when the quarter for EVI standardization was moved from July-August-September (JAS) to June-July-August (JJA). Our MISR results reinforce the strong need to take into account view-illumination effects when analyzing time series of MODIS EVI. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The number of cloud-free views by Earth-orbiting optical remote sensing instruments must be characterized to verify that the coverage is sufficient to address a mission's science objectives. This study determines the expected cloud-free coverage for the Hyperspectral Infra-red Imager (HyspIRI) mission concept using the Terra MODIS 5 km daytime cloud mask dataset covering the period 2001-2010. The HyspIRI mission concept has two instruments: a Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a Thermal Infrared (TIR) multispectral imager. The VSWIR and TIR instruments have equatorial revisit times of 19 and 5 days, respectively.
   Using the MODIS cloud mask data, we determined the percentage of the Earth's land and shallow water regions that would have been viewable with cloud-free acquisitions for each quarter and year in 2001 through 2010. For the VSWIR, the average cloud-free coverage was 83.0% quarterly and 99.6% annually. Average TIR monthly coverage was also evaluated to be 90.7%. The standard deviations for these statistics were all less than 1.2%, and the average coverages exceed HyspIRI's quarterly and annual requirements (listed in Table 6) by over twenty standard deviations. By the central limit theorem, it follows that in a typical year, HyspIRI will meet its coverage requirements (listed in Table 6) with extremely low uncertainty, acquiring a sufficient number of scenes to enable both monthly and quarterly assessments of the vast majority of the Earth's land and shallow water.
   This paper includes: yearly global statistics for cloud-free MODIS observations at 5 km resolution between 2001 and 2010; a one year global map representing percent cloud-free observations between 2001 and 2010; global maps representing percent cloud-free observations between 2001 and 2010 for each quarter; maps of the predicted number of views by each HyspIRI instrument quarterly and over the course of a year; and predicted global coverage quarterly and for one year for each HyspIRI instrument, with additional monthly statistics for TIR.

AB Atmospheric correction is a key stage in the processing of remotely sensed data. The empirical line method (ELM) is used widely to correct at-sensor radiance or DN to at-surface reflectance. It is based on a simple linear relationship between those two variables. Effective application of the model requires that it is estimated in a precise and unbiased fashion. The usual approach is to use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to model the relationship between the average reflectance and radiance for a small number (3 to 8) of ground targets (GTs) and then to apply the regression on a per-pixel basis to the image. This leads to a mismatch between the scale at which the model is estimated and the scale at which the model is applied. Further, this approach wastes information and can lead to inconsistent estimators. These problems are addressed in the new approach presented here. The model was estimated on a per-pixel rather than per-GT basis. This yielded consistent, precise estimators for the ELM, but placed stronger requirements on the modeling. Specifically spatial autocorrelation and non-constant variance (heteroskedasticity) in the model residuals needed to be addressed. This was undertaken using the linear mixed model (LMM), which is a model-based expression of the geostatistical method. Of particular interest is the use of a non-stationary LMM to address the heteroskedasticity. The approach taken in this paper is of significance for a broader set of remote sensing applications. Regression and geostatistics are often applied, based typically on a stationary model. This paper shows how heteroskedasticity can be assessed and modeled using the non-stationary LMM. Heteroskedasticity is present in other remote sensing applications hence the non-stationary modeling approach, demonstrated here, is likely to be beneficial. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ID CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; LEAF; SCATTERING; AIRBORNE
AB Canopy level chlorophyll fluorescence and reflectance of maize were retrieved simultaneously by using spectral fitting (SF) techniques applied to canopy and reference upwelling radiances measured on the ground in the O-2-A atmospheric absorption band by means of a ground-measurements-based (GMB) method, using a white reference panel. This method was inspired by the Fluorescence Experiment (FLEX) mission concept, which is expected to provide the user community with a top-of-canopy radiance product, as well as sufficient data on atmospheric conditions to enable the simulation of a white reference panel radiance, after which the ground-based method can also be applied by the users of FLEX data. For the retrieval, a coupled surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model was also used to simulate the canopy radiance in specific atmospheric conditions and to quantify fluorescence and reflectance variables by using a second method based on the canopy radiance simulation (CRS), which uses the canopy radiance measurements only. The CRS method does not require any cross calibration of reference measurements, and is extremely useful when a reliable reference cannot be found. Part of the mathematical functions that modeled reflectance and fluorescence were recently used by the authors to perform simulations of observations from space. Simulations of the retrievals for both methods were performed at two different spectral band widths of 9 nm and 20 nm to evaluate the accuracy limits for a signal to noise ratio equal to 300:1. These simulations demonstrated an enhanced accuracy as compared to previously reported retrievals on the ground, and indicated that the CRS model can indeed be successfully applied for the retrieval of fluorescence. In the retrievals from measurements, the two intervals were compared to better evaluate the combined influence of the atmospheric conditions and forward modeling spectral accuracy on the CRS method. The 20 nm interval was also used to evaluate the possibility of retrieving the bi-directional and hemispherical-directional reflectances in the viewing direction of the canopy and surroundings. Lastly, the narrower 9 nm interval delivered the most accurate simulations and was chosen for comparing the retrievals obtained by means of the two different methods. From this comparison fluorescence retrieved by means of the CRS method resulted higher (about 5%) than that retrieved with the GMB method by means of the same mathematical functions, while the retrieved reflectances were very similar. The methods presented here demonstrate that fluorescence can be retrieved even when atmospheric and surface information is limited. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFICATIONS; PROBABILITY; CALIBRATION; ACCURACY; FORESTS
AB Statistical inference requires expression of an estimate in probabilistic terms, usually in the form of a confidence interval. An approach to constructing confidence intervals for remote sensing-based estimates of net deforestation is illustrated. The approach is based on post-classification methods using two independent forest/non-forest classifications because sufficient numbers of observations of forest/non-forest change were not available for direct classification. Further, the approach uses a model-assisted estimator with information from a traditional error matrix for the forest/non-forest classifications to compensate for bias as the result of classification errors and to estimate variances. Classifications were obtained using a logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and two dates of Landsat imagery, although the approach to inference can be used with multiple classification approaches. For the study area in northeastern Minnesota. USA, overall pixel-level accuracies for the year 2002 and 2007 forest/non-forest classifications were 0.85-0.88, and estimates of proportion net deforestation for the 2002-2007 interval were less in absolute value than 0.015. However, standard errors for the remote sensing-based estimates of net deforestation were on the order of 0.02-0.04, meaning that the estimates were not statistically significantly different from zero. Particular attention is directed to the potentially severe sample size and classification accuracy requirements necessary for estimates of net deforestation to be detected as statistically significantly different from zero.

AB This paper analyzes the potential of the radar altimeter onboard ENVISAT for estimating surface soil moisture in the semi-arid Gourma region in Northern Mali. To this end, the relationships between observed backscattering coefficients derived from 4 retracking algorithms, namely Ocean, Ice-1, Ice-2 and Sea-Ice, and ground data, including soil type, topography, vegetation and soil moisture are investigated. The considered period is 2002-2010. Results show a strong linear relationship between the backscattering coefficients and surface soil moisture measured at six different stations along the satellite track. The best results are obtained with the Ice-1 and Ice-2 algorithms. In these cases, correlation coefficients are higher than 0.8 with RMSE smaller than 2%. Vegetation effects are found to be small due both to the nadir-looking configuration of the radar altimeter and to the low vegetation cover. Finally, the relationship between soil moisture and normalized backscattering coefficient is used to retrieve soil moisture from the altimeter data. These estimates are then compared to soil moisture estimations obtained from the METeorological Operational (METOP) Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT). These results highlight the high capabilities of Ku-band altimeters to provide an accurate estimation of surface soil moisture in semiarid regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The start of season (SOS) phenological metric indicates the seasonal onset of vegetation activity, including canopy growth, photosynthesis and associated increases in land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2) exchanges influencing weather and climate variability. Satellite optical-infrared (IR) remote sensing is responsive to vegetation greenness and SOS, but measurement accuracy and global monitoring are constrained by atmosphere cloud/aerosol contamination and seasonal decreases in solar illumination for many areas. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter from satellite passive microwave remote sensing provides an alternative means for global phenology monitoring that is sensitive to vegetation canopy biomass and water content, and insensitive to atmosphere and solar illumination constraints. A global VOD record from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) was used to estimate North America SOS patterns and annual variability at the ecoregion scale. The SOS metrics were derived for a four year (2004-2007) record using TIMESAT and AMSR-E 10.7 GHz frequency VOD retrievals composited to 4-day median time series. The VOD SOS corresponded favorably with MODIS-for-NACP NDVI (0.73<R<0.81; p<0.01) and LAI (0.66<R<0.89; p<0.01) greenup dates, and stand level SOS estimates derived from flux tower gross primary production (r(2) = 0.61, p<0.01) and ecosystem respiration (r(2)=0.44, p<0.01) estimates. The VOD SOS was temporally offset from MODIS greenup and tower SOS metrics by up to 4-7 weeks (RMSE) and the offset patterns coincided with the primary climate constraints (temperature and water) to vegetation growth. The VOD SOS generally preceded greenup in cold temperature constrained ecoregions and followed greenup in warmer, water limited ecoregions, with delays increasing for areas with greater woody vegetation cover. The AMSR-E VOD record captures canopy biomass changes independent of NDVI greenness or LAI measures, providing new and complementary phenological information for regional carbon, water and energy cycle studies.

AB An advanced approach for estimating the sub-pixel fraction of snow covered area for boreal forest and tundra belt from optical data is presented. The method named SCAmod by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) is based on a forward semi-empirical model where the at-satellite observed reflectance is expressed as a function of the fractional snow cover (FSC). The effective forest transmissivity determined for each target unit-area and the generally applicable reflectances of three major contributors (wet snow, forest canopy and snow-free ground) serve as model parameters. The forest transmissivity describes the visibility of the ground through the forest canopy from above, and can be determined from visible reflectance data acquired at full snow cover conditions. SCAmod can be applied to data from various sensors operating at optical and near-infrared region. We apply the method to Envisat/AATSR and Terra/MODIS data and validate the resulting FSC against ground truth data over Finland, with considerations of feasibility of these ground truth data in a scale of the MODIS/AATSR pixel. In comparison, also NASA MOD10_L2 fractional snow product is validated. The results indicate that SCAmod performs better than MOD10_L2 particularly in forested areas; an RMSE of 0.11 for the fraction of snow covered area (range is 0-1) is achieved. For large-scale snow mapping, using reflectance data for transmissivity determination would evidently be very time-consuming. Here we present also a new method for transmissivity generation using global land cover data and demonstrate its use for snow cover mapping in continental scale. The resulting FSC data are compared against FSC from high-resolution Landsat TM/ETM + data for selected areas in Northern and Eastern Europe. The comparison indicates that SCAmod is feasible also in continental-scale snow mapping and is superior in identifying snow in dense forests. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optical water types were identified from an in situ data set of concomitant biogeochemical and optical parameters collected in contrasted turbid coastal areas of the eastern English Channel, southern North Sea and French Guiana at different seasons (211 stations). Four optical classes have been defined using a clustering approach performed on the spectrally normalized reflectance spectra. Normalization of the reflectance spectra was carried out during the statistical analysis to emphasize the shape of the reflectances rather than their magnitude. Each optical water type is associated with a specific bio-optical environment, in agreement with previous works. Two classes present a very marked optical character, one being mostly determined by strong phytoplankton and dissolved material loads, and the other one by a high proportion of mineral particles. The two remaining classes are related to optically mixed situations although there are some differences in the relative proportion of particulate mineral material. Applying this optical typology to the SeaWiFS daily reflectance data, we emphasized the high representativeness of these 4 optical water types which allow to describe about two thirds of the reflectance spectra found within the development sites whatever the season. The adequacy of optical water type definition for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of coastal water masses optical quality, which reflects the impact of biological and hydrodynamic processes occurring at different time scales (i.e. from high frequency to seasonal processes), has been demonstrated. The four optical classes' typology has been shown to remain highly representative at global scale. This underlines the effective optical vicinity of some parts of the coastal ocean during some periods of the year, in spite of the recognized high optical diversity of coastal waters. This further demonstrates the high pertinence of class-based approach for large scale coastal applications. Finally, the potential for class-based inversion algorithms for improving ocean color products retrieval, as well as the applicability of such class-specific algorithms with respect to satellite information have been illustrated from the estimation of the suspended matter concentration. This work provides very encouraging evidence of the potential and adequacy of class-based inversion methods for deriving bio-optical products in optically complex waters such as the coastal ocean.

AB Forest photosynthetic exchange rates at landscape scales have proven difficult to either accurately measure or estimate. Recent developments (Hall et al., 2011, 2008: Hilker et al., 2011a, 2010a) permit us to infer photosynthetic forest light use efficiency (epsilon) using multi-angle measurements of photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from the CHRIS/PROBA satellite imaging spectrometer, thus completing a long sought-after capability to remotely sense the major inputs driving gross primary production GPP i.e., epsilon and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). In this first of two companion papers we introduce the theoretical underpinnings of an innovative approach that utilizes our recent developments to produce remotely sensed and spatially explicit maps of epsilon and GPP from space, and a data assimilation approach to extend the spatially explicit maps to diurnal, daily and annual time scales. We quantify GPP using the traditional radiation-limited approach of Monteith (1972); however we apply it in an innovative way. [I] Using CHRIS/PROBA we quantify epsilon at each satellite overpass for a 625 km(2) area at 30 m resolution. [II] We use a novel physiologically-based multivariate function of APAR, temperature and water vapor pressure deficit model (described herein) and use it to down-regulate epsilon at 30 minute intervals. [III] We use the CHRIS/PROBA images of spatial variation in epsilon, and NDVI to quantify APAR, hence produce snapshots of GPP. We use a data assimilation approach to extend epsilon and GPP to temporally continuous and spatially contiguous maps of vegetation carbon uptake. In the second part of this study (Hilker et al., 2011b) we demonstrate and validate our approach over eight different forest flux tower sites in North America. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite data sets often contain outliers (Le., anomalous values with respect to the surrounding pixels), mostly due to undetected clouds and rain or to atmospheric and land contamination. A methodology to detect outliers in satellite data sets is presented. The approach uses a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) basis. The information rejected by this EOF basis is used to identify suspect data. A proximity test and a local median test are also performed, and a weighted sum of these three tests is used to accurately detect outliers in a data set. Most satellite data undergo automated quality-check analyses. The approach presented exploits the spatial coherence of the geophysical fields, therefore detecting outliers that would otherwise pass such checks. The methodology is applied to infrared sea surface temperature (SST), microwave SST and chlorophyll-a concentration data over different domains, to show the applicability of the technique to a range of variables and temporal and spatial scales. A series of sensitivity tests and validation with independent data are also conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In rainfed vineyards water deficits play a major role in determining berry yield and composition. Therefore, reliable indicators of vine water status might be of great value for the optimization of grape yield and quality. In the present study the feasibility of using hyperspectral reflectance indices related to plant biophysical properties at predicting berry yield and quality attributes in rainfed vineyards is assessed. The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay in commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedes region (Catalonia. Spain) over two consecutive years (2007-2008). Field measurements of fractional intercepted Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fIPAR), canopy reflectance, predawn water potential (Psi(p)) and the canopy to air temperature difference at midday (Delta T-midday) were conducted at the stage of veraison. Yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index,.IMAD) were determined at harvest. Contrasted water availability among vineyards prompted considerable variation in berry yield and quality attributes. Across years, higher yield was accompanied by higher TA (r = 0.59. p<0.01) and lower IMAD (r = -0.63. p<0.01) while no significant relationship was observed between yield and TSS. Yield was related to canopy vigor (fIPAR) in a variable extend: in 2007, yield was positively related to fIPAR (r = 0.71, p<0.05) while yield was found to decrease along with increasing fIPAR in 2008 (r = -0.62. p<0.05). Contrastingly, NDVI provided consistent estimates of yield across years (r = 0.57, p<0.05). These results suggest that NDVI might be more appropriate to characterize the effects of varying water availability on yield than fIPAR. In addition, yield was found to be related to Delta T-midday (r = -0.63 and r = -0.66, in 2007 and 2008, respectively). Accordingly, the Water Index (WI), an indicator of vine water status, provided robust estimates of yield across years (r = 0.61, p<0.01). The strength of the correlation between NDVI and WI vs. yield suggests that yield was influenced by changes in both leaf area (intercepted light) and photosynthesis (stomatal aperture) in a variable extent according to the timing and severity of water deficits in the years of study. Berry quality attributes did not show significant relationships against fIPAR but were related to Delta T-midday. Accordingly, NDVI did not show significant correlation with berry quality attributes, while WI was found to be consistently related to TA (r = 0.70, p<0.01) and IMAD (r = -0.71, p<0.01) across years. The results obtained suggest that the WI might provide reliable estimates of berry quality attributes in vineyards experiencing moderate to severe water deficits with potential application in precision viticulture activities such as selective harvesting according to grape quality attributes as well as for ripening assessment.

AB Urban and peri-urban environments are composed of a wide variety of materials, making land cover classification challenging. The objective of this research is to determine how effectively multi-season Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and single-season Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data can be combined to map 17 land cover categories in the Greater Boston area of, Massachusetts, USA. The key goal of this work is to test the integration of radar and optical data. The contribution of different dimensions of input data to a random forest classifier was evaluated with map accuracy statistics. PALSAR data produced a 30.99% overall classification accuracy. Higher classification accuracy (72.24%) was achieved by adding texture variables derived from the PALSAR data. A September Landsat image produced a map accuracy of 77.96%. The inclusion of Landsat images from other three seasons increased map accuracy to 86.86% and Landsat derived texture variables further increased the map accuracy to 92.69%. The highest map accuracy (93.82%) was achieved by combining Landsat and PALSAR. Though combining PALSAR and Landsat only increased the overall accuracy by 1.1%, it was a statistically significant increase, whose magnitude was limited by the high accuracy already achieved with Landsat data. Moreover, confusion matrices and land cover maps indicated that most of this increase was from three urban land cover types (low density residential, high density residential, and commercial/industrial). The results demonstrate the value of combining multitemporal Landsat imagery, ALOS PALSAR data, and texture variables for land cover classification in urban and peri-urban environments.

AB Global night-time fire counts for the years from 1995 to 2009 have been obtained by using the latest version of Along Track Scanning Radiometer Top of Atmosphere radiance products (level 1B), and related trends have been estimated. Possible biases due to cloud coverage variations have been assumed to be negligible. The sampling number (acquisition frequency) has also been analysed in detail and proved not to influence our results. The new ATSR World Fire Atlas (WFA) product continuity has been tested by comparing the partially overlapping fire counts time series from the ATSR-2 (on board ERS-2) and the AATSR (on board ENVISAT) missions which showed negligible offsets. The ATSR-WFA products show very good correlation with the TRMM-VIRS and MODIS-Aqua/Terra monthly night-time fire counts. Global night-time fire trends have been evaluated by inspecting the time series of hot spots aggregated a) at 2 degrees x 2 degrees scale; b) at district/country/region/continent scales, and c) globally. The statistical significance of the estimated trend parameters has been verified by means of the Mann-Kendall test. Results indicate that no trends in the absolute number of fire counts can be identified at the global scale, that there has been no appreciable shift in the fire season during the last 14 years, and that statistically significant positive and negative trends are only found when data are aggregated at smaller scales.

AB The Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and its predecessors, ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, have always had the basic objective of determining surface temperature accurately enough to allow quantitative investigations of climatic behaviour. This is achieved by performing exacting measurements of emitted radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. In order to achieve the desired quality for sea surface temperature, it is necessary to have the use of three thermal channels (at least at night) with precise and stable radiometric calibration, high clarity and sensitivity of the thermal infra-red image data, dual-view geometry for an improved atmospheric correction, as well as additional visible and near infrared channels. This special issue, comprising 18 papers and this Preface, demonstrates the thermal calibration of the ATSR instruments, the high performance of sea surface temperature data from these sensors, and the way in which the ATSR observations have also been used to derive quantitative information about land surface properties (specifically, temperature and reflectance), aerosols and clouds, fires and gas flares. These papers celebrate the success of the ATSR instruments and the associated ground-based measurements which combined are providing exciting time series of climate observations.

AB Satellite imagery has proven to be a powerful tool for measuring chlorophyll a in surface waters. While this provides an estimate of total phytoplankton biomass, it does not distinguish between phytoplankton groups, many of which have functional differences and therefore affect biogeochemical cycles differently. Phytoplankton pigment analysis has been used to quantify a wide range of photosynthetic and accessory pigments, and chemotaxonomic analysis (e.g. CHEMTAX) has been used to successfully quantify functional taxonomic groups in nature based on pigment distributions. Here, we combine CHEMTAX analysis with satellite-derived distributions of specific phytoplankton pigments to describe the distributions of particular components of the phytoplankton community in the northeast coast of the United States from space. The spatial and seasonal variations in phytoplankton community structure elucidated through satellite remote sensing methods generally agreed with observations of abundance estimates of cell counts. Diatoms were generally the most abundant phytoplankton in this region, especially during Winter-Spring and in the inner shelf, but phytoplankton populations shifted to increasing abundance of other taxa during Summer, especially offshore. While still preliminary, satellite-derived taxa-specific information with proper regional controls holds promise for providing information on phytoplankton abundance to a taxonomic group level which would greatly improve our understanding of the impacts of human activity and climate change on ecosystems.

AB The key variable describing global seasonal snow cover is snow water equivalent (SWE). However, reliable information on the hemispheric scale variability of SWE is lacking because traditional methods such as interpolation of ground-based measurements and stand-alone algorithms applied to space-borne observations are highly uncertain with respect to the spatial distribution of snow mass and its evolution. In this paper, an algorithm assimilating synoptic weather station data on snow depth with satellite passive microwave radiometer data is applied to produce a 30-year-long time-series of seasonal SWE for the northern hemisphere. This data set is validated using independent SWE reference data from Russia, the former Soviet Union, Finland and Canada. The validation of SWE time-series indicates overall strong retrieval performance with root mean square errors below 40 mm for cases when SWE <150 mm. Retrieval uncertainty increases when SWE is above this threshold. The SWE estimates are also compared with results obtained by a typical stand-alone satellite passive microwave algorithm. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of the newly developed assimilation approach. Additionally, the trends and inter-annual variability of northern hemisphere snow mass during the era of satellite passive microwave measurements are shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The approach of using primarily satellite observations to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) without resorting to interpolation of many surface observations has recently shown promising results. Previous work has shown that the remote sensing based greenness and radiation (GR) model can give accurate GPP estimates in crops. However, the feasibility of its application and the model calibration to other ecosystems remain unknown. With the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and the surface based estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), we provide an analysis of the GR model for estimating monthly GPP using flux measurements at fifteen sites, representing a wide range of ecosystems with various canopy structures and climate characteristics. Results demonstrate that the GR model can provide better estimates of GPP than that of the temperature and greenness (TG) model for the overall data classified as non-forest (NF), deciduous forest (DF) and evergreen forest (EF) sites. Calibration of the GR model is also conducted and has shown reasonable results for all sites with a root mean square error of 47.18 g C/m(2)/month. Different coefficients acquired for the three plant functional types indicate that there are shifts of importance among various factors that determine the monthly vegetation GPP. The analysis firstly shows the potential use of the GR model in estimating GPP across biomes while it also points to the needs of further considerations in future operational applications.

AB Tropical forests are an important component of the global carbon balance, yet there is considerable uncertainty in estimates of their carbon stocks and fluxes, which are typically estimated through analysis of aboveground biomass in field plots. Remote sensing technology is critical for assessing fine-scale spatial variability of tropical forest biomass over broad spatial extents. The goal of our study was to evaluate relatively new technology, small-footprint, discrete-return lidar and hyperspectral sensors, for the estimation of aboveground biomass in a Costa Rican tropical rain forest landscape. We derived a suite of predictive metrics for field plots: lidar metrics were calculated from plot vertical height profiles and hyperspectral metrics included fraction of spectral mixing endmembers and narrowband indices that respond to photosynthetic vegetation, structure, senescence, health and water and lignin content. We used single- and two-variable linear regression analyses to relate lidar and hyperspectral metrics to aboveground biomass of plantation, managed parkland and old-growth forest plots. The best model using all 83 biomass plots included two lidar metrics, plot-level mean height and maximum height, with an r(2) of 0.90 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 38.3 Mg/ha. When the analysis was constrained to plantation plots, which had the most accurate field data, the r(2) of the model increased to 0.96, with RMSE of 10.8 Mg/ha (n = 32). Hyperspectral metrics provided lower accuracy in estimating biomass than lidar metrics, and models with a single lidar and hyperspectral metric were no better than the best model using two lidar metrics. These results should be viewed as an initial assessment of using these combined sensors to estimate tropical forest biomass; hyperspectral data were reduced to nine indices and three spectral mixture fractions, lidar data were limited to first-return canopy height, sensors were flown only once at different seasons, and we explored only linear regression for modeling. However, this study does support conclusions from studies at this and other climate zones that lidar is a premier instrument for mapping biomass (i.e., carbon stocks) across broad spatial scales.

AB Drought monitoring is important to analyse the influence of rainfall deficiency patterns on bushfire behaviour. Remote sensing provides tools for spatially explicit monitoring of drought across large areas. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of MODIS-based reflectance spectral indices to monitor drought across forest and woodland vegetation types in the fire prone Sydney Basin Bioregion, NSW, Australia. A time series of eight spectral indices were created from 2000 to 2009 to monitor inter-annual changes in drought and were compared to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a precipitation deficit/surplus indicator. A pixel-to-weather station paired correlation approach was used to assess the relationship between SPI and the MODIS-based spectral indices at different time scales. Results show that the Normalised Difference Infrared Index band 6 (NDIItr6) provided the most suitable indicator of drought for the high biomass vegetation types considered. The NDIIb6 had the highest sensitivity to drought intensity and was highly correlated with SPI at all time scales analysed (Le., 1,3 and 6-month SPI) suggesting that variations in precipitation patterns have a stronger influence on vegetation water content than vegetation greenness properties. Spatial similarities were also found between patterns of NDIIb6-based drought maps and SPI values distribution. NDIIb6 outperformed the spectral index currently in use for operational drought monitoring systems in the region (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and its implementation in existing drought-monitoring systems is recommended.

AB In this study, different methods for fusing airborne laser scanning (ALS) and multispectral imagery were compared. The improvement observed when computing the position of individual ALS returns in the original unrectified scenes (back-projecting ALS) was contrasted against the geometric errors observed in many orthorectified images. Results showed that back-projecting the ALS is the most accurate technique for fusing high-resolution datasets. Potential sources of systematic errors were studied for all techniques, finding the nadir angle as the most influencing one. The capacity of back-projecting ALS and true orthorectification for reducing the tree leaning problem found in traditional orthophotos was evaluated. Modelled tree lean correlated with geometric errors even while individual factors alone did not. The technique used for true orthorectification solved tree leaning near nadir, but it was affected by the variance of the kriging model, resulting in a low overall accuracy. In view of the results observed in back-projected ALS, the spatial resolution of the imagery was regarded as its main source of uncertainty. The convenience of adding a correction of the effect of the atmospheric refraction and the Earth's curvature was also discussed. Even though the magnitude of those corrections was low, they succeeded in avoiding nadir angle-dependent systematic errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A lack of reliable observations for canopy science research is being partly overcome by the gradual use of lidar remote sensing. This study aims to improve lidar-based canopy characterization with airborne laser scanners through the combined use of lidar composite metrics and machine learning models. Our so-called composite metrics comprise a relatively large number of lidar predictors that tend to retain as much information as possible when reducing raw lidar point clouds into a format suitable as inputs to predictive models of canopy structural variables. The information-rich property of such composite metrics is further complemented by machine learning, which offers an array of supervised learning models capable of relating canopy characteristics to high-dimensional lidar metrics via complex, potentially nonlinear functional relationships. Using coincident lidar and field data over an Eastern Texas forest in USA, we conducted a case study to demonstrate the ubiquitous power of the lidar composite metrics in predicting multiple forest attributes and also illustrated the use of two kernel machines, namely, support vector machine and Gaussian processes (GP). Results show that the two machine learning models in conjunction with the lidar composite metrics outperformed traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier and linear regression models. For example, the five-fold cross validation for GP regression models (vs. linear/log-linear models) yielded a root mean squared error of 1.06 (2.36) m for Lorey's height, 0.95 (3.43) m for dominant height, 534 (8.51) m(2)/ha for basal area, 21.4 (40.5) Mg/ha for aboveground biomass, 654 (9.88) Mg/ha for belowground biomass, 0.75 (2.76) m for canopy base height, 2.2 (2.76) m for canopy ceiling height, 0.015 (0.02) kg/m(3) for canopy bulk density, 0.068 (0.133) kg/m(2) for available canopy fuel, and 033 (0.39) m(2)/m(2) for leaf area index. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the GP regression were more indicative of the true errors in the predicted canopy variables than those from their linear counterparts. With the ever-increasing accessibility of multisource remote sensing data, we envision a concomitant expansion in the use of advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning, to explore the potentially complex relationships between canopy characteristics and remotely-sensed predictors, accompanied by a desideratum for improved error analysis.

AB Diatom cells have distinctive optical characteristics, originating from their relatively large cell size, fucoxanthin content and silica cell wall. It has been proposed that diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms can be identified by optical remote sensing and that specifically tuned chlorophyll and primary production algorithms should be applied in regions where these blooms are present. However there have been few studies on how the optical properties of diatom blooms change as they progress from active growth to senescence, and it is unlikely that measurements on laboratory cultures encompass the full range of physiological states found in natural waters. We have therefore examined the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the waters around the island of South Georgia at the end of the spring diatom bloom. Considerable variability was found in the relationships between the inherent optical properties and analytically determined chlorophyll a concentrations even in the surface layer, which meant that the usual bio-optical assumptions for Case 1 waters did not apply. To account for this variability, phytoplankton absorption and scattering were modeled as a two-component mixture, with the components representing actively growing and senescent material. The specific inherent optical properties of the two components were derived by linear regression of total IOPs against chlorophyll concentration and a fraction of the suspended mineral concentration. These specific IOPs were used to develop radiative transfer models of diatom blooms in varying stages of growth and senescence. Remote sensing reflectances calculated using this technique confirmed the tendency of the standard algorithms employed in SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data processing to under-estimate near-surface chlorophyll concentrations in diatom blooms. However the inclusion of increasing proportions of senescent material had a significant effect on algorithm performance only at chlorophyll concentrations below 10 mg m(-3). Optical depths predicted by the model around South Georgia were 9+/-2 m at 512 nm, indicating that a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass was located below the depth from which the remote sensing signals originated.

AB Semi-empirical topographic normalization methods (e.g.. C-correction) have been widely used to correct illumination differences in optical satellite data. The objective of this study was to examine the precision and accuracy of the C-correction's empirical parameter, c, as a function of the sample from which it was derived. Three sampling methods were compared: a random sample, a sample stratified on north and south aspects, and a sample stratified by cosine of the solar incidence angle, i. In the latter, power allocation was used to determine the quantity of observations for each stratum. Four overlapping satellite images were used (two Landsat 5 TM and two SPOT 5 HRG) with different acquisition dates and large solar zenith angles over an alpine region in Sweden. The sample stratified by cosine of i produced c with the highest precision from repeated trials and had coefficients of determination (R-2) twice as high as those from the other sampling methods. Use of power allocation in the cosine of i stratified sample enabled better representation of spectral variability: this was particularly important for the NIR band where the outcome of c differed according to sampling method. Evaluations using t-tests and classification accuracy showed that c derived from the cosine of i stratified sample correctly normalized a larger percentage of the evaluation data. The distribution of cosine of i in the study area, the spectral variability and vegetation types exert influences to consider when sampling to derive c. Although sampling was restricted to alpine vegetation only, some vegetation classes may have benefitted from separate c-parameter calculation. In general, dry alpine heath and alpine grass heath had relatively higher c-parameters, mesic alpine heath was slightly lower, and alpine willow and alpine meadow had lower c-parameters for the near-infrared band. The cosine of i stratified sampling method using power allocation may be useful for calculation of c for vegetation conditions other than those presented here, as well as for other empirical parameters (e.g., the Minnaert constant, k).

AB The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 Alaska land cover classification is the first 30-m resolution land cover product available covering the entire state of Alaska. The accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Alaska land cover classification employed a geographically stratified three-stage sampling design to select the reference sample of pixels. Reference land cover class labels were determined via fixed wing aircraft, as the high resolution imagery used for determining the reference land cover classification in the conterminous U.S. was not available for most of Alaska. Overall thematic accuracy for the Alaska NLCD was 76.2% (se. 2.8%) at Level II (12 classes evaluated) and 83.9% (se. 2.1%) at Level I (6 classes evaluated) when agreement was defined as a match between the map class and either the primary or alternate reference class label. When agreement was defined as a match between the map class and primary reference label only, overall accuracy was 59.4% at Level II and 69.3% at Level I. The majority of classification errors occurred at Level I of the classification hierarchy (i.e., misclassifications were generally to a different Level I class, not to a Level II class within the same Level I class). Classification accuracy was higher for more abundant land cover classes and for pixels located in the interior of homogeneous land cover patches. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper assessed the incorporation of road structural information in the classification process of impervious surface areas. A multi-process classification model was adopted and it consisted of an a priori classifier and an a posteriori classifier. The role of the a priori classifier was to classify the relatively simple portions of the image. This partial classification acted as the basis for the production of linear features using an iterative Radon transform. Spatial statistics derived from the linear features led to road structural intermediate inputs (RSIIs) (for example, distance to the closest segment endpoint). RSIIs were integrated with spectral information on the remaining unclassified pixels and an assessment was done to evaluate whether they would improve a binary impervious classification task The experimental results on a 2006 Landsat ETM+ image suggested that classification accuracy improved by 8.4% for the portion of the dataset classified with the a posteriori classifier and led to an improvement of 32% over the entire dataset In addition, a more challenging and wide-reaching hypothesis was tested, namely whether RSIIs could completely replace spectral information in portions of the image instead of complementing it. Exclusive use of RSIIs matched or improved classification accuracy obtained solely from spectral information, even when more than half of the validation dataset was forwarded to the a posteriori classifier. This finding offers an important contribution to the remote sensing community, since the proposed methodology handles the missing spectral information problem through exclusive analysis of the given degraded image; no external information, such as spectral information from other times and/or vector data, is needed.

AB We study hyperspectral images of the Bodele Depression in Northern Chad, acquired by the Hyperion sensor onboard EO-1 spacecraft. Relative abundances of four major mineral components are obtained on a pixel-by-pixel basis and we report on the comparison of images of a dust storm with the same areas on a calm day. Minerals lifted and suspended particles downwind of a dust source are thus identified. Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) decomposition results for the calm condition match those of our field study. LSU calm vs. stormy comparison, based on absorbance features, highlight the spectral contrast. Despite low contrast above bright areas, morphological dissimilarity is evident via the wave and tongue-like features, aligned with the prevailing northeasterly winds. We analyze the longest part of shortwave infra-red (2080-2380 nm) wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent, optical properties are stable, and absorption features of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates, and carbonates are pronounced. The results of our spectral analyses reveal that clay minerals may be used as tracers for atmospheric dust monitoring even above bright areas. Such clay minerals include kaolinite, illite-moscovite, and Fe-rich nontronite. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most frequently applied methods for integrating controls on primary production through satellite data is the light use efficiency CLUE) approach, which links vegetation gross or net primary productivity (GPP or NPP) to remotely sensed estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Eddy covariance towers provide continuous measurements of carbon flux, presenting an opportunity for evaluation of satellite estimates of GPP. Here we investigate relationships between eddy covariance estimated GPP, environmental variables derived from flux towers, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and GPP across African savanna ecosystems. MODIS GPP was found to underestimate GPP at the majority of sites, particularly at sites in the Sahel. EVI was found to correlate well with estimated GPP on a site-by-site basis. Combining EVI with tower-measured PAR and evaporative fraction (EF, a measure of water sufficiency) improved the direct relationship between GPP and EVI at the majority of the sites. The slope of this relationship was strongly related to site peak leaf area index (LAI). These results are promising for the extension of GPP through the use of remote sensing data to a regional or even continental scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Northern Eurasian land mass encompasses a diverse array of land cover types including tundra, boreal forest, wetlands, semi-arid steppe, and agricultural land use. Despite the well-established importance of Northern Eurasia in the global carbon and climate system, the distribution and properties of land cover in this region are not well characterized. To address this knowledge and data gap, a hierarchical mapping approach was developed that encompasses the study area for the Northern Eurasia Earth System Partnership Initiative (NEESPI). The Northern Eurasia Land Cover (NELC) database developed in this study follows the FAO-land Cover Classification System and provides nested groupings of land cover characteristics, with separate layers for land use, wetlands, and tundra. The database implementation is substantially different from other large-scale land cover datasets that provide maps based on a single set of discrete classes. By providing a database consisting of nested maps and complementary layers, the NELC database provides a flexible framework that allows users to tailor maps to suit their needs. The methods used to create the database combine empirically derived climate-vegetation relationships with results from supervised classifications based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The hierarchical approach provides an effective framework for integrating climate-vegetation relationships with remote sensing-based classifications, and also allows sources of error to be characterized and attributed to specific levels in the hierarchy. The cross-validated accuracy was 73% for the land cover map and 73% and 91% for the agriculture and wetland classifications, respectively. These results support the use of hierarchical classification and climate-vegetation relationships for mapping land cover at continental scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents an approach for semi-automated classification of tree species in different types of forests using first and second generation ADS40 and RC30 images from two study areas located in the Swiss Alps. In a first step, high-resolution canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from the ADS40 stereo-images. In a second step, multi-resolution image segmentation was applied. Based on image segments seven different tree species for study area 1 and four for study area 2 were classified by multinomial regression models using the geometric and spectral variables derived from the ADS40 and RC30 images. To deal with the large number of explanatory variables and to find redundant variables, model diagnostics and step-wise variable selection were evaluated. Classifications were ten-fold cross-validated for 517 trees that had been visited in field surveys and detected in the ADS40 images. The overall accuracies vary between 0.76 and 0.83 and Cohen's kappa values were between 0.70 and 0.73. Lower accuracies (kappa <0.5) were obtained for small samples of species such as non-dominant tree species or less vital trees with similar spectral properties. The usage of NIR bands as explanatory variables from RC30 or from the second generation of ADS40 was found to substantially improve the classification results of the dominant tree species. The present study shows the potential and limits of classifying the most frequent tree species in different types of forests, and discusses possible applications in the Swiss National Forest Inventory.
