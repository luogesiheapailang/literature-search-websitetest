AB Estimation of photosynthetic light use efficiency (s) from satellite observations is an important component of climate change research. The photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index based on the reflectance at 531 and 570 nm, allows sampling of the photosynthetic activity of leaves; upscaling of these measurements to landscape and global scales, however, remains challenging. Only a few studies have used spaceborne observations of PRI so far, and research has largely focused on the MODIS sensor. Its daily global coverage and the capacity to detect a narrow reflectance band at 531 nm make it the best available choice for sensing E from space. Previous results however, have identified a number of key issues with MODIS-based observations of PRI. First, the differences between the footprint of eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the MODIS footprint, which is determined by the sensor's observation geometry make a direct comparison between both data sources challenging and second, the PRI reflectance bands are affected by atmospheric scattering effects confounding the existing physiological signal. In this study we introduce a new approach for upscaling EC based E measurements to MODIS. First, EC-measured S values were "translated" into a tower-level optical PRI signal using AMSPEC, an automated multi-angular, tower-based spectroradiometer instrument. AMSPEC enabled us to adjust tower-measured PRI values to the individual viewing geometry of each MODIS overpass. Second, MODIS data were atmospherically corrected using a Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, which uses a time series approach and an image-based rather than pixel-based processing for simultaneous retrievals of atmospheric aerosol and surface bidirectional reflectance (BRDF). Using this approach, we found a strong relationship between tower-based and spaceborne reflectance measurements (r(2)=0.74, p<0.01) throughout the vegetation period of 2006. Swath (non-gridded) observations yielded stronger correlations than gridded data (r(2)=0.58, p<0.01) both of which included forward and backscatter observations. Spaceborne PRI values were strongly related to canopy shadow fractions and varied with different levels of c. We conclude that MAIAC-corrected MODIS observations were able to track the site-level physiological changes from space throughout the observation period. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new empirical approach is developed for ocean color remote sensing. Called the Empirical Satellite Radiance-In situ Data (ESRID) algorithm, the approach uses relationships between satellite water-leaving radiances and in situ data after full processing, i.e., at Level-3, to improve estimates of surface variables while relaxing requirements on post-launch radiometric re-calibration. The approach is evaluated using SeaWiFS chlorophyll, which is the longest time series of the most widely used ocean color geophysical product. The results suggest that ESRID 1) drastically reduces the bias of ocean chlorophyll estimates, most impressively in coastal regions, 2) modestly improves the uncertainty, and 3) reduces the sensitivity of global annual median chlorophyll to changes in radiometric re-calibration. Simulated calibration errors of 1% or less produce small changes in global median chlorophyll (<2.7%).
   In contrast, the standard NASA algorithm set is highly sensitive to radiometric calibration: similar 1% calibration errors produce changes in global median chlorophyll up to nearly 25%. We show that 0.1% radiometric calibration error (about 1% in water-leaving radiance) is needed to prevent radiometric calibration errors from changing global annual median chlorophyll estimates more than the maximum interannual variability observed in the SeaWiFS 9-year record (+/- 3%), using the NASA standard method. This is much more stringent than the goal for SeaWiFS of 5% uncertainty for water leaving radiance. The results suggest that ESRID, combined with a field sampling program, can improve the quality and reliability of ocean color data, while promoting a unified description of ocean biology from satellite and in situ platforms. Although the results here are focused on chlorophyll, in principle the approach described by ESRID can be applied to any surface variable potentially observable by visible remote sensing.

AB Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) has invaded riparian ecosystems throughout the Western United States, including significant portions of riparian ecosystems within U.S. National Parks and Monuments. Recently, the saltcedar leaf beetle (Diorhabda elongata) was released as a tamarisk biocontrol agent. Although initial releases have been monitored, no comprehensive program is currently in place to monitor the rapid spread of Diorhabda that has resulted from numerous subsequent releases by county and state agencies. Long term monitoring of tamarisk defoliation and its impacts on habitat and water resources is needed. This study examines the potential for using higher spatial resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and lower spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for monitoring defoliation caused by Diorhabda and subsequent changes in evapotranspiration (ET). Widespread tamarisk defoliation was observed in an eastern Utah study area during summer 2007. ASTER normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed only minor changes between 2005 and 2006, but a significant drop in NDVI was found within riparian areas between 2006 and 2007. The decrease in NDVI caused by defoliation was apparent despite partial refoliation within the study area. MODIS time series data revealed that absolute decline in EVI varied by site, but that the timing of EVI decline during summer 2007 was early with respect to phenological patterns from 2001 through 2006. Defoliation caused decreases in ET values estimated from both ASTER and MODIS data. MODIS estimated ET declined earlier than in previous years, although annual ET was not significantly different than ET in previous years due to high year-to-year variability. Challenges to detection and monitoring of tamarisk defoliation include spectral mixing of tamarisk and other cover types at subpixel spatial resolution, spatial coregistration of time series images, the timing of image acquisition, and changes unrelated to defoliation in non-tamarisk land cover over time. Continued development of the techniques presented in this paper may allow monitoring the spread of Diorhabda and assessment of potential water salvage resulting from biocontrol of tamarisk.

AB Precipitation data with accurate, high spatial resolution are crucial for improving our understanding of basin scale hydrology. We explore the relation between precipitation estimates derived from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for different spatial scales on the Iberian Peninsula in southern Europe, using time series from 2001 to 2007 Analysis shows that NDVI is a good proxy for precipitation. On an annual basis an exponential function best describes the relation between NDVI and precipitation. The optimum relation between NDVI and precipitation is found at an approximate scale of 75-100 km. This is an intermediate scale and it is likely that at smaller scales NDVI is determined primarily by anthropogenic land use and at larger scales factors such as geology, soils, and temperature play an increasingly important role. The fact that both TRMM and NDVI are subject to bias due to orbital deviations, atmospheric conditions and imperfect retrieval algorithms could also influence the scale dependency. The derived relation between NDVI and precipitation is used to develop a new downscaling methodology that uses coarse scale TRMM precipitation estimates and fine scale NDVI patterns. The downscaled precipitation estimates are subsequently validated using an independent precipitation dataset. The downscaling procedure resulted in significant improvements in correlation, bias, and root mean square error for average annual precipitation over the whole period, for a dry year (2005), and a wet year (2003).

AB Estimation of forest cover change is important for boreal forests, one of the most extensive forested biomes, due to its unique role in global timber stock, carbon sequestration and deposition, and high vulnerability to the effects of global climate change. We used time-series data from the MODerate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to produce annual forest Cover loss hotspot maps. These maps were used to assign all blocks (18.5 by 18.5 km) Partitioning the boreal biome into strata of high, medium and low likelihood of forest cover loss. A stratified random sample of 118 blocks was interpreted for forest cover and forest cover loss using high spatial resolution Landsat imagery from 2000 and 2005. Area of forest cover gross loss from 2000 to 2005 within the boreal biome is estimated to be 1.63% (standard error 0.10%) of the total biome area, and represents a 4.02% reduction in year 2000 forest cover. The proportion of identified forest cover loss relative to regional forest area is much higher in North America than in Eurasia (5.63% to 3.00%). Of the total forest cover loss identified, 58.9% is attributable to wildfires. The MODIS pan-boreal change hotspot estimates reveal significant increases in forest Cover loss due to wildfires in 2002 and 2003, with 2003 being the peak year of loss within the 5-year Study period. Overall, the precision of the aggregate forest cover loss estimates derived from the Landsat data and the Value of the MODIS-derived map displaying the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol for operational, cost-effective, and timely biome-wide monitoring of gross forest cover loss.

AB Understanding the spatial scaling behavior of evapotranspiration and its relation to controlling factors on the land surface is necessary to accurately estimate regional water cycling. We propose a method for ascertaining this scaling behavior via a combination of wavelet multi-resolution analysis and information theory metrics. Using a physically-based modeling framework, we are able to compute spatially distributed latent heat fluxes over the tall-grass prairie in North-central Kansas for August 8, 2005. Comparison with three eddy-covariance stations and a large aperture scintillometer demonstrates good agreement, and thus give confidence in the modeled fluxes. Results indicate that the spatial variability in radiometric temperature (a proxy for soil moisture) most closely controls the spatial variability in evapotranspiration. Small scale variability in the water flux can be ascribed to the small scale spatial variance in the fractional vegetation. In addition, correlation analysis indicates general scale invariance and that low spatial resolution data may be adequate for accurately determining water cycling in prairie ecosystems.

AB This investigation quantitatively links chlorophyll a+b (chl(a+b)) concentration, a physiological marker of forest health condition, to hyperspectral observations of Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana), a dominant Boreal forest species. Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) observations, in the visible-near infrared domain, were acquired over eight selected Jack Pine sites, near Sudbury, Ontario, between June and September of 2001. Supplementing the airborne campaigns was concurrent on-site collection of foliage samples for laboratory spectral and chemical measurements. The study first connected needle-level optical properties with pigment concentration through the inversion of radiative transfer models, LIBERTY and PROSPECT. Next, a chlorophyll sensitive optical index (R750/R710), was "scaled-up" using SAILH, a turbid medium canopy model, to estimate total pigment content at the canopy-level. Due to the potential confounding effects of open canopy structure and foliage clumping, the analysis accordingly focused on high spatial resolution CASI imagery (1 m) to visually target tree crowns, while accounting for shadowed areas. Chl(a+b) concentration estimation from airborne spectral data using coupled leaf and canopy models was shown to be feasible with a root mean square error of 5.3 mu g/cm(2), for a pigment range of 25.7 to 45.9 mu g/cm(2). Such predictive algorithms using airborne-level data provide the methodology to be potentially scaled-up to satellite-level hyperspectral platforms for large scale monitoring of vegetation productivity and forest stand condition.

AB Spectral libraries are commonly established as a means to archive representative signatures of natural materials. Such signatures can then be used to train feature extraction and classification algorithms applied to imagery, for comparison with unlabeled spectra. A number of spectral libraries are publicly available and widely used in the community. Disparities in viewing and illumination measurement configurations between libraries generally preclude the direct comparison of spectra for the same materials. Within libraries, measurements may be reported for varying sample properties, such as grain size in the case of powdered minerals or leaf or canopy structure in the case of vegetation. In such instances, use of the library and the selection of representative spectra to identify an unknown material may require a priori knowledge or an educated guess of the physical properties of the unknown material to conduct the comparison.
   This study demonstrates that continuous wavelet analysis can provide a new and useful representation of spectral libraries and minimize these disparities amongst libraries. In the context of spectral mixture analysis we suggest that the selection of representative endmember spectra from spectral libraries can be more readily defined in the wavelet domain than using reflectance data. In the context of sensing target compositional variability, for example changes in the chemistry of a given mineral, spectral differences due to distinct sample composition are more readily identified using wavelets. The examples provided in this paper are mainly for powdered mineral spectra because there are a number of widely known public spectral libraries of powdered minerals that have been in common use in the hyperspectral community but the principles apply to a range of natural materials including vegetation.

AB This study examines the feasibility of using MODIS images (MOD02 products) for the detection and monitoring of forest clear cuts in the boreal forest in north-west Russia. The proposed approach combines three change detection methods, including Change Vector Analysis, Textural Analysis using the coefficient of variation, and Constrained Energy Minimization analysis. For each individual method a series of thresholds was tested in order to obtain an optimal identification of clear cuts. A clear cut detection was only accepted if the change was detected by each individual method. All input parameters needed were derived from a set of reference clear cuts, mapped from 30 in resolution Landsat ETM+ imagery and used also for accuracy assessment. Change assessment was tested with MODIS images of two and of three acquisition dates. Referring to two test sites (Karelia, Komi) the detection omission and commission errors, assessed within a 3 x 3 pixels moving kernel, were at 23% and 8%, and at 2 1% and 17%, respectively. In terms of detectable clear cut size, a detection accuracy of about 90% can be expected for clear cuts in the size category above 15 ha, which contains the majority of cuts in the region. MODIS therefore provides good capabilities for large scale monitoring of major clear cut activities in the boreal forests of north-western Russia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To study the effect of aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget (ERB), the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB) has integrated spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements over the ocean from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Scanner (SEVIRI) into its Geostationary Earth's Radiation Budget, or GERB, processing system referred to as the RGP. Aerosols affect the ERB both directly (when radiation interacts with an aerosol particle) and indirectly (when aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei). Quantifying the indirect effect is challenging as it requires accurate aerosol retrievals in the close proximity to clouds, where aerosol retrievals may be biased due to leakages from the cloud mask (CM). The initial focus of the RGP project was on the direct effect using confidently clear scenes.
   A single channel CM exploiting the SEVIRI temporal sampling was developed at the RMIB for the use in the RGP project. In this study, that single channel mask was evaluated against two multi-channel CMs, one from the Meteorological Products Extraction Facility (MPEF) at the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the other from the Satellite Application Facility for Supporting NoWCasting and Very Short Range Forecasting (SAFNWC), respectively. The NOAA/NESDIS Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) single channel aerosol algorithm was adjusted to SEVIRI spectral bands and consistently applied to the pixels identified as cloud-free. The aerosol products corresponding to the three CMs were compared, and the RMIB CM was found to be sufficiently accurate and conservative, for RGP applications.
   Comparisons with independent AODs derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites show that the RMIB CM-based SEVIRI aerosol product compares well with its MODIS counterpart. However, a small fraction of cloud-contaminated pixels may still remain in the SEVIRI AOD imagery, chiefly within one to two SEVIRI pixels of the cloud boundary, thus limiting its use for indirect forcing studies. Also, the RMIB CM may screen high AOD non-dust aerosol events (e.g., smoke from biomass burning) as cloud. The potential of the new SEVIRI aerosol product is illustrated by generating 9 km-resolution seasonal maps of AODs and Angstrom Exponents, and by using the GERB radiative flux measurements for a preliminary quick assessment of the direct aerosol forcing.

AB Extensive plot studies across Amazonia have demonstrated that there are large regional gradients in forest productivity and that the dynamics of the forests seem to have accelerated substantially in recent decades, with ensuing impacts on forest structure. Most of these sites are, however, one hectare plots nested within a heterogeneous landscape, and a clear need exists to understand the landscape and regional context of these studies. Remote sensing offers the potential to scale up from plot to higher landscape levels but it has proven complex to evaluate forest structure, and therefore biomass patterns in tropical areas, due to saturation, signal noises, and unclear relationships between reflectance values and structural properties, both for optical and radar systems. In this study, we explore the potential of a textural approach to detect landscape and regional variations in the structure of tropical forest canopies, as viewed from high resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. We used lacunarity analysis and a derived variable, the index of translational homogeneity (ITH), as a tool to search for structural and dynamic forest properties within and among different Amazonian landscapes. The main goals of this research were: (1) to examine the sensitivity and robustness of ITH analysis to details of the analysis procedure; (2) to explore the intra- and inter-regional textural properties of a variety of tropical forest canopies [Caxiuan (a) over tilde, Manaus, Sinop, Santarem (Brazil), and Tambopata (Peru)], and (3) to relate textural properties derived,from lacunarity to structural properties of the forest canopy, mainly crown size. Our results show how ITH and lacunarity analyses offer insights into the spatial distribution of structural properties of forest canopies, easily differentiating between terra firme forests and swamp forests. The studied forest canopies are self-similar on length-scales of 5-11 m, and show translational invariance on scales above 20 m (central and western Amazonia) and 30 m (eastern Amazonia) For a restricted range of solar elevation angles, the ITH appears to be determined mainly by the mean size of tree crowns, and by the fraction of large (shadow-generating) trees.

AB View angle effects present in spectral vegetation indices can either be regarded as an added source of uncertainty for variable retrieval or as a Source of additional information, enhancing the variable retrieval; however, the magnitude of these angular effects remains for most indices unknown or unquantified. We use the ESA-mission CHRIS-PROBA (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard the Project for On-board Autonomy) providing spaceborne imaging spectrometer and multiangular data to assess the reflectance anisotropy of broadband as well as recently developed narrowband indices, Multiangular variability of Hemispherical Directional Reflectance Factor (HDRF) is a prime factor determining the indices' angular response. Two contrasting structural vegetation types, pine forest and meadow, were selected to study the effect of reflectance anisotropy on the angular response. Calculated indices were standardized and statistically evaluated for their varying HDRF. Additionally we employ a coupled radiative transfer model (PROSPECT/FLIGHT) to quantify and substantiate the findings beyond an incidental case study. Nearly all tested indices manifested a prominent anisotropic behaviour. Apart from the conventional broadband greenness indices [e.g. Simple Ratio Index (SRI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)], light use efficiency and leaf pigment indices [e.g. Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI)] did express significant different angular responses depending on the vegetation type. Following the quantification of the impact, we conclude that the angular-dependent fraction of non-photosynthetic material is of critical importance shaping the angular signature of these VIs. This work highlights the influence of viewing geometry and surface reflectance anisotropy, particularly when using light use efficiency and leaf pigment indices. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation water content (VWC) is one of the most important parameters for the successful retrieval of soil moisture content from microwave data. Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) is a widely-used index to remotely sense Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) of leaves and canopies; however, the amount of water in the foliage is a small part of total VWC. Sites of corn (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), and deciduous hardwood woodlands were sampled to estimate EWT and VWC during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2005 (SMEX05) near Ames, Iowa, USA. Using a time series of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) imagery, NDII was related to EWT with R-2 of 0.85; there were no significant differences among land-cover types. Furthermore, EWT was linearly related to VWC with R-2 of 0.87 for corn and 0.48 for soybeans, with a significantly larger slope for corn. The 2005 land-cover classification product from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service had an overall accuracy of 92% and was used to spatially distribute VWC over the landscape. SMEX05 VWC versus NDII regressions were compared with the regressions from the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), which was conducted in the same study area. No significant difference was found between years for corn (P=0.13), whereas there was a significant difference for soybean (P=0.04). Allometric relationships relate the size of one part of a plant to the sizes of other parts, and may be the result from the requirements of structural support or material transport. Relationships between NDII and VWC are indirect, NDII is related to canopy EWT, which in turn is allometrically related to VWC. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The procedure is first investigated with partly artificial data and then applied to multitemporal, multispectral satellite imagery. Substantial improvement over the previous method is obtained for scenes which exhibit a high proportion of change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the use of ocean color remote sensing to measure the transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. From 2000 to 2005 we recorded surface measurements of DOC, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), salinity, and water-leaving radiances during five cruises to the Mississippi River Plume. These measurements were used to develop empirical relationships to derive DOC, CDOM, and salinity from monthly composites of SeaWiFS imagery collected from 1998 through 2005. We compared our remote sensing estimates of river flow and DOC transport with data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from 1998 through 2005. Our remote sensing estimates of river flow and DOC transport correlated well (r(2) similar to 0.70) with the USGS data. Our remote sensing estimates and USGS field data showed low variability in DOC concentrations in the river end-member (7-11%), and high seasonal variability in river flow (similar to 50%). Therefore, changes in river flow control the variability in DOC transport, indicating that the remote sensing estimate of river flow is the most critical element of our DOC transport measurement. We concluded that it is possible to use this method to estimate DOC transport by other large rivers if there are data on the relationship between CDOM, DOC, and salinity in the river plume.

AB This article describes a series of fundamental analyses designed to test and compare the utility of various MODIS data and products for detecting land cover change over a large area of the tropics. The approach for estimating proportional forest cover change as a continuous variable was based on a reduced major axis regression model. The model relates multispectral and multi-temporal MODIS data, transformed to optimize the spectral detection of vegetation changes, to reference change data sets derived from a Landsat data record for several study sites across the Central American region. Three MODIS data sets with diverse attributes were evaluated on model consistency, prediction accuracy and practical utility in estimating change in forest cover over multiple time intervals and spatial extents.
   A spectral index based on short-wave infrared information (normalized difference moisture index), calculated from half-kilometer Calibrated Radiances data sets, generally showed the best relationships with the reference data and the lowest model prediction errors at individual study areas and time intervals. However, spectral indices based on atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, as with the Vegetation Indices and Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function - Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data sets, produced consistent model parameters and accurate forest cover change estimates when modeling over multiple time intervals. Models based on anniversary date acquisitions of the one-kilometer resolution NBAR product proved to be the most consistent and practical to implement. Linear regression models based on spectral indices that correlate with change in the brightness, greenness and wetness spectral domains of these data estimated proportional change in forest cover with less than 10% prediction error over the full spatial and temporal extent of this study.

AB Spring-summer (November, December, January) ice sheet and sea ice regional surface albedo, surface temperature, sea ice concentration and sea ice extent averages and trends from 1981 to 2000 have been calculated for the Antarctic area. In this research the AVHRR Polar Pathfinder 5-km EASE-Grid Composites and the combined SMMR and SSMI data sets from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Boulder, Colorado have been employed. A regional analysis has been made for five longitudinal sectors around Antarctica: the Weddell Sea (WS), the Indian Ocean (IO), the Pacific Ocean (PO), the Ross Sea (RS) and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea (BS). The IO and PO sectors show ice sheet albedos of 0.85 and temperatures of -25 degrees C. The corresponding values in the RS and BS sectors are 0.80 and -16 degrees C respectively. The sea ice albedo is about 0.60 in the RS, BS and WS sectors and 0.55 in the IO and PO sectors. The average sea ice temperature varies around -12 degrees C. All the sectors show slight increasing spring-summer albedo trends and decreasing spring-summer temperature trends and similar interannual variability in albedo and surface temperature. The steepest ice sheet albedo trend of 0.0019 +/- 0.0009/yr is found in the RS sector. The steepest sea ice albedo trend of 0.0044 +/- 0.0017 /yr occurs in the PO sector. The steepest temperature trends for both the ice sheet and sea ice occur in the BS sector, having values of -0.075 +/- 0.040 degrees C/yr and -0.107 +/- 0.027 degrees C/yr respectively. The sea ice concentration shows slight increasing trends, the highest being in the PO sector (0.3 +/- 0.12%/yr), whereas the sea ice extent trends are near zero with the exception of the RS sector (14,700 +/- 8600 km(2) /yr) and the BS sector (- 13,000 +/- 6400 km(2)/yr).

AB Many factors influence classification accuracy and a typical error budget includes uncertainty arising from the 1) selection of processing algorithms, 2) selection of training sites, 3) quality of orthorectification, and 4) atmospheric effects. With the development of high spatial resolution imagery, the impact of errors in geographic coregistration between imagery and field sites has become apparent - and potentially limiting - for classification applications, especially those involving patchy target detection. The goal of this study was to document and quantify the effect of coregistration error between imagery and field sites on classification accuracy. Artificial patchy targets were randomly placed over a study area covered by a QuickBird image. Classification accuracy of these targets was assessed at two levels of coregistration. Results showed that producer's accuracy of target classification increased from 37.5% to 100% between low and high levels of coregistration respectively. In addition, "Error due to Location", a measure of how well pixels were located within respective classes, decreased to zero at high coregistration levels. This study highlights the importance of considering coregistration between imagery and field sites in the error budget, especially with studies involving high spatial resolution imagery and patchy target detection.

AB We explored simple and useful spectral indices for estimating photosynthetic variables (radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic capacity) at a canopy scale based on seasonal measurements of hyperspectral reflectance, ecosystem CO2 flux, and plant and micro-meteorological variables. An experimental study was conducted over the simple and homogenous ecosystem of an irrigated rice field. Photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (APAR), the canopy absorptivity of APAR (fAPAR), net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEECO2) gross primary productivity (GPP), photosynthetic capacity at the saturating APAR (P-max), and three parameters of radiation use efficiency (epsilon(N): NEECO2/APAR;epsilon(G): GPP/APAR; phi: quantum efficiency) were derived from the data set. Based on the statistical analysis of relationships between these ecophysiological variables and reflectance indicators such as normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI[i(2)j]) using all combinations of two wavelengths (i and j nm), we found several new indices that would were more effective than conventional spectral indices such as photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI=NDSI[near-infrared, red]). EG was correlated well with NDSI[710, 410], NDSI[710, 520], and NDSI[530, 550] derived from nadir measurements. (P was best correlated with NDSI[450, 1330]. NDST[550, 410] and NDSI[720, 420] had a consistent linear relationships with WAR throughout the growing season, whereas conventional indices such as NDVI showed very different relationships before and after beading. Off-nadir measurements were more closely related to the efficiency parameters than nadir measurements. Our results provide useful insights for assessing plant productivity and ecosystem CO2 exchange, using a wide range of available spectral data as well as useful information for designing future sensors for ecosystem observations.

AB Snow water equivalent (SWE) is one of the key parameters for many applications in climatology, hydrology, and water resource planning and management. Satellite-based passive microwave sensors have provided global, long-term observations that are sensitive to SWE. However, the complexity of the snowpack makes modeling the microwave emission and inversion of a model to retrieve SWE difficult, with the consequence that retrievals are sometimes incorrect. Here we develop a parameterized dry snow emission model for analyzing passive microwave data, including those from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) at 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz, and 36.5 GHz for SWE estimation. We first evaluate a multiple-scattering microwave emission model that consists of a single snow layer over a rough surface by comparing model calculations with data from two field measurements, from the Cold Land Process Experiment (CLPX) in 2003 and from Switzerland in 1995. This model uses the matrix doubling approach to include incoherent multiple-scattering in the snow, and the model combines the Dense Media Radiative Transfer Model (DMRT) for snow volume scattering and emission with the Advanced Integral Equation Model (ATEM) for the randomly rough snow/ground interface to calculate dry snow emission signals. The combined model agrees well with experimental measurements. With this confirmation, we develop a parameterized emission model, much faster computationally, using a database that the more physical multiple-scattering model generates. For a wide range of snow and soil properties, this parameterized model's results are within 0.013 of those from the multiple-scattering model. This simplified model can be applied to the simulation of the microwave emission signal and to developing algorithms for SWE retrieval. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Algorithms for retrieval of aerosol and snow/ice properties in polar and mid-latitude regions are described. These include (i) a cloud mask, (ii) a snow/sea ice discriminator, (iii) algorithms for retrieval of snow properties (snow grain size and impurities) and (iv) surface temperature of snow/ ice and open ocean water. The cloud mask and snow/ice discriminator are used for cloud clearing as well as surface classification. For cloud-free pixels that are determined to be snow-covered an algorithm for retrieval of snow grain size and impurity concentration has been constructed. Radiative transfer simulations of the coupled atmosphere-surface system are used to construct lookup tables that are used in the retrieval process which proceeds by comparing measured top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiances with synthetic values obtained from the lookup tables. These algorithms are designed to be applicable to polar and mid-latitude regions, but can easily be extended for use in other regions with seasonal and permanent snow-cover. The surface temperature retrieval algorithm consists of two parts: one for retrieval of the snow/ice surface temperature (IST), and another one for the retrieval of open-ocean surface temperature (SST). A multilinear regression technique is used to determine the empirical coefficients in the expression for the surface temperature, and Arctic radiosonde data are used in conjunction with radiative transfer models to simulate the sensor-measured radiances. The algorithms have been extensively tested against synthetic data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) and GLobal Imager (GLI) data as well as other data sources.

AB Although modern ocean color sensors, such as MODIS and SeaWiFS, are often considered global missions, in reality it takes many days, even months, to sample the ocean surface enough to provide complete global coverage. The irregular temporal sampling of ocean color sensors can produce biases in monthly and annual mean chlorophyll estimates. We quantified the biases due to sampling using data assimilation to create a "truth field", which we then sub-sampled using the observational patterns of MODIS and SeaWiFS. Monthly and annual mean chlorophyll estimates from these sub-sampled, incomplete daily fields were constructed and compared to monthly and annual means from the complete daily fields of the assimilation model, at a spatial resolution of 1.25 degrees longitude by 0.67 degrees latitude.
   The results showed that global annual mean biases were positive, reaching nearly 8% (MODIS) and > 5% (SeaWiFS). For perspective the maximum interannual variability in the SeaWiFS chlorophyll record was about 3%. Annual mean sampling biases were low (< 3%) in the mid-latitudes (between -40 degrees and 40). Low interannual variability in the global annual mean sampling biases suggested that global scale trend analyses were valid.
   High latitude biases were much higher than the global annual means, up to 20% as a basin annual mean, and over 80% in some months. This was the result of the high solar zenith angle exclusion in the processing algorithms. Only data where the solar angle is < 75 degrees are permitted, in contrast to the assimilation which samples regularly over the entire area and month. High solar zenith angles do not facilitate phytoplankton photosynthesis and low chlorophyll concentrations occurring here are missed by the data sets. Ocean color sensors selectively sample in locations and times of favorable phytoplankton growth, producing overestimates of chlorophyll.
   The biases derived from lack of sampling in the high latitudes varied monthly, leading to artifacts in the apparent seasonal cycle from ocean color sensors. A false secondary peak in chlorophyll occurred in May-August, which resulted from lack of sampling in the Antarctic.
   Persistent clouds, characteristic in the North Pacific, also produced overestimates, again by selectively sampling only the high growth periods. In contrast, areas characterized by thick aerosols showed chlorophyll underestimates to nearly -30% in basin monthly means. This was the result of selective sampling in lower aerosol thickness periods, which corresponded with lower phytoplankton growth periods.
   A combination of MODIS and SeaWiFS sampling was most effective at reducing mid-latitude biases due to inter-orbit gaps, sun glint, and sensor tilt changes. But these biases were low using a single sensor, suggesting multiple sensors had little effect in reducing global and regional monthly and annual mean biases.
   Ocean color data are an invaluable source of information about global biological processes. However, these results suggest that sampling errors need to be considered in applications involving global and regional mean chlorophyll biomasses as well as seasonal variability and regional trend analysis.

AB The primary productivity of a plant community can be modeled as the product of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by the canopy and a light use efficiency factor, where the amount of absorbed PAR (APAR) is the product of the fractional absorption and the amount of incident PAR. By implementing a method, PARcalc, using atmospheric data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), incident PAR is estimated in this study. In addition, since many PAR datasets are generated by converting shortwave radiation into PAR, the ratio of PAR to shortwave radiation was also investigated. PARcalc models the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) as a product of atmospheric transmittance, the cosine of the Sun zenith angle, and the solar constant. The atmospheric transmittance includes the attenuation of radiation by Rayleigh and aerosol scattering, and absorption by water and ozone. A cloud transmittance factor which is primarily a function of the cloud optical thickness is added in order to cope with cloudy conditions. The model was implemented at two sites in Sweden, Asa and Norunda, where in situ measurements of PPFD were made during the spring and summer of 2004. Modeled time-series were evaluated against the measurements, and daily sums of PPFD were calculated by fitting of a sine function in combination with linear interpolation of the instantaneous estimates from sunrise to sunset. This gave correlation coefficients at Norunda and Asa of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively, when comparing modeled and measured daily insolation. The average relative errors were 24% and 25%. Corresponding figures for five day averages were 0.91 and 0.86; and 9.3% and 11.9%. Instantaneous estimates of PPFD were modeled with correlation coefficients of 0 88-0 93 and average relative errors from 17.0%. These numbers were acquired when using measured values for determining cloudiness; the corresponding figures when the method is fully implemented using satellite data are 0.84 to 0.71 and 24.9%, respectively. The ratio of PAR to shortwave radiation was measured at Norunda 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2004 and was found to vary between 0.27 and 0.48 on a daily basis with an average of 0.43 for the whole period.(c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Luzon Strait experiences a seasonal surge of phytoplankton based on ocean color data. To examine the timing and position of the bloom, daily MODIS chlorophyll data (2002-2005) were acquired and analyzed. Supporting data such as MODIS SST and nLw, bands, QuikSCAT wind data, river discharge, and bathymetry were also used and processed in order to investigate the possible driving forces behind the bloom occurrence. Results show that chlorophyll concentration in the Luzon Strait dramatically increases during NE monsoon reaching to approximately 2.0 mg/m(3). Highest chlorophyll concentration is observed near the western slope of the Luzon Strait. The monsoonal bloom in the Luzon Strait is likely due to upwelling and can be possibly associated with the interaction of the northward flowing Luzon coastal current with the westward intrusion of Kuroshio during NE monsoon. The positive wind stress curl also contributes to this occurrence. The influence of Cagayan River is only limited within few kilometers from the river mouth. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents the methodology used to detect temporal changes in the extent of annual flooding within the Cambodia and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) based on MODIS time-series imagery (Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in Flood Inundation; WFFI). This methodology involves the use of a wavelet-based filter to interpolate missing information and reduce the noise component in the time-series data, as proposed in a previous study. The smoothed time profiles of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVT), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and the Difference Value between EVI and LSWI (DVEL) are obtained from MOD09 8-day composite time-series data (resolution: 500 m; time period: 2000-2005). The proposed algorithm was applied to produce time-series inundation maps (WFFI products) for the five annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2004. The WFFI products were validated via comparisons with Landsat-derived results and inundation maps based on RADARSAT images, hydrological data, and digital elevation model data. Compared with the RADARSAT-derived inundation maps at the province level, the obtained RMSE range from 364 to 443 km(2) and the determination coefficients [R-2] range from 0.89 to 0.92. Compared with Landsat-derived results at the 10-km grid level, the obtained RMSE range from 6.8 to 15.2 km(2) and the determination coefficients [R-2] range from 0.77 to 0.97. The inundated area of flooded forests/marsh to the northeast of Tonle Sap Lake were underestimated, probably because of extensive vegetation cover in this area. The spatial characteristics of the estimated start dates, end dates, and duration of inundation cycles were also determined for the period from 2000 to 2004. There are clear contrasts in the distribution of the estimated end dates and duration of inundation cycles between large-scale floods (2000-2002) and medium- and small-scale floods (2003 and 2004). At the regional scale, the estimated start dates for the southern part of An Giang Province during 2003 and 2004 was distinctly later than that for surrounding areas. The results indicate that these triple-cropping areas enclosed by dikes increased in extent from 2003 to 2004. In contrast, the estimated end dates of inundation at the Co Do and Song Hart State Farms were clearly earlier than those for surrounding areas, although the estimated start dates were similar. Temporal changes in the inundation area of Flood pixels in the Dong Thap and Long An Provinces are in excellent agreement with daily water-level data recorded at Tan Chan Station. The estimated area of Long-term water body increased in size from 2000 to 2004, especially in coastal areas of the Ca Mau and Bac Lieu Provinces. Statistical data for Vietnam indicate that this trend may reflect the expansion of shrimp-farming areas. The WFFI products enable an understanding of seasonal and annual changes in the water distribution and environment of the Cambodia and the VMD from a global viewpoint. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a quantitative assessment of the capability of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) technique refer-red to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach to investigate fault creep phenomena. In particular we have computed, via the SBAS-DInSAR algorithm, time series of the surface displacements relevant to the Hayward fault zone, within the San Francisco Bay Area (California), from the European Space Agency's ERS-1/2 satellite radar data for the 1992 to 2000 time period. Starting from the DInSAR time series we measured the relative displacements across the fault with no need for any atmospheric filtering step. These results have been systematically compared to the measurements available from the alignment arrays that are located along the fault. Our analysis shows that the standard deviation of the differences between the DInSAR and the in situ measurements is on the order of 2 mm. Moreover, the estimated mean deformation rates have an accuracy that is better than 1 mm/year. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the improvements made in census procedures over recent decades, the availability of detailed population data is limited. For many applications, including environmental and health analyses, methods are therefore needed to model population distribution at the small-area level. With the development of GIS and remote sensing techniques, the ability to develop such models has greatly improved. This paper describes a GIS-based approach using remotely sensed land cover and nighttime light emissions data to model population distribution at the land parcel level across the European Union. Light emission data from the DMSP satellites were first resampled and modelled using kriging and inverse distance weighting methods to provide a 200-m resolution light emissions map. This was then matched to CORINE land cover classes across the EU. Regression methods were used to derive models of relationships between census population counts (at NUTS 5 level) and land cover area and light emissions. Models were developed at both national and EU scale, using a range of different modelling strategies. Model performance, as indicated by the regression statistics, was seen to be good, with R-2 typically in the order of 0.8-0.9 and SEE ca. 4000 people. In southern countries, especially, incorporation of light emissions data was found to improve model performance considerably compared to models based only on land cover data. More detailed post hoe validation in Great Britain, using independent data on population at census tract (enumeration district and output area) and postcode level, for 1991 and 2001, showed that models gave good predictions of population at the 1 km level (R-2 > 0.9), but were less reliable at resolutions below ca. 500 m. Impending enhancements in the available land cover and light emissions data are expected to improve the capability of this modelling approach in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite images and ground-based observations were used to investigate the morphology and origin of valleys and ridges across large ignimbrite provinces around La Pacana Caldera, N. Chile. We studied 12 separate sites that included five different ignimbrite units that range in age from similar to 5.6 +/- 0.5 Ma to 1.35 +/- 0.15 Ma. Over 400 features from within these study sites were quantified. Study sites typically have dimensions of 25 x 35 km. Measurements were made using Landsat TM, ETM+, and SRTM-derived DEM and Shaded Relief images. Morphological measurements were made of the ridges and channels, including the direction of regional slope, length, orientation and gradient of each feature. A classification of the different ignimbrite erosion influences, resulting in varying landscape morphologies identified 4 landscape types; Fluvial, Eolian, Modified and Complex. We conclude that the most prevalent features are fluvial-derived channels but the most distinctive are linear, wind-derived ridges. The orientation of these ridges suggests that strong uni-directional winds from the northwest have been constant over a long period of time (> 1 MY). (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exploiting the fact that the spectral characteristics of light backscattered from sediment-laden ice differ substantially from those of clean ice and that sediment tends to accumulate at the ice surface during the first melt season, remote-sensing techniques provide a valuable tool for mapping the extent of particle-laden ice in the Arctic basin and assessing its particulate loading. This study considers two fundamental problems that still need to be addressed in order to make full use of satellite observations for this type of assessment: (i) the effects of the atmosphere on surface reflectances derived from radiances measured by the satellite sensor need to be quantified and ultimately corrected for, and (ii) the spectral reflectance of the ice surface as a function of particle loading and sub-pixel distribution needs to be determined in order to derive quantitative estimates from the at-sensor satellite signal. Here, spectral albedos have been computed for different ice surfaces of variable sediment load with a radiative transfer model for sea ice coupled with an optical model for particulates included in sea ice. In a second step, the role of the atmosphere in modulating the surface reflectance signal is assessed with the aid of an atmospheric radiative transfer model applied to a "standard" Arctic atmosphere and surface boundary conditions as prescribed by the sea ice radiative transfer model. A series of sensitivity studies helps assess differences between top-of-the-atmosphere and true surface reflectance and has been utilized to derive a look-up table for atmospheric correction of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data over sediment-laden sea ice surfaces. In particular, the effects of solar elevation, viewing geometry, and atmospheric properties are considered. The atmospheric corrections are necessary for certain geometries and surface types. Large discrepancies between raw and corrected data are particularly evident in the derived coverage of clean ice and ice with small sediment loading. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the effect of aerosols on biologically- and photochemically-active UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is important for many ongoing climate, biophysical, and air pollution studies. In particular, estimates of the UV characteristics of the most common Australian aerosols will be valuable inputs to UV Index forecasts, air quality studies, and assessments of the impact of regional environmental changes. By analyzing climatological distributions of Australian aerosols we have identified sites where co-located ground-based UV-B and ozone measurements were available during episodes of relatively high aerosol activity. Since at least June 2003, surface tN global irradiance spectra (285-450 nm) have been measured routinely at Darwin and Alice Springs in Australia by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). Using colocated sunphotometer measurements at Darwin and Alice Springs, we identified several episodes of relatively high aerosol activity. Aerosol air mass types were analyzed from sunphotometer-derived angstrom parameter, MODIS fire maps and MISR aerosol property retrievals. To assess aerosol effects we compared the measured UV irradiances for aerosol-loaded and clear-sky conditions with each other and with irradiances simulated using the libRadtran radiative transfer model for aerosol-free conditions. We found that for otherwise similar atmospheric conditions, smoke aerosols over Darwin reduced the surface UV irradiance by as much as 40-50% at 290-300 nm and 20-25% at 320-400 nm near active fires (aerosol optical depth, AOD, at 500 nm similar to 0.6). Downwind of fires, the smoke aerosols over Darwin reduced the surface irradiance by 1525% at 290-300 nm and similar to 10% at 320-350 nm (AOD at 500 nm similar to 0.2). The effect of smoke increased with decrease of wavelength and is strongest in the UV-B. The aerosol attenuation factors calculated for the selected cases suggest smoke over Darwin has an effect on surface 340380 nm irradiances that is comparable to that produced by smoke over Sub-Saharan Africa. Dust activity was very low at Alice Springs during 2004, therefore we were not able to identify strong dust events to fully assess the UV effect of dust. For the cases studied, smoke aerosols seem to produce a stronger reduction in surface LYV irradiances than dust aerosols. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurately mapping community types is one of the main challenges for monitoring and and semi-arid grasslands with remote sensing. The multi-angle approach has been proven useful for mapping vegetation types in desert grassland. The Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) provides 4 spectral bands and 9 angular reflectance. In this study, 44 classification experiments have been implemented to find the optimal combination of MISR multi-angular data to mine the information carried by MISR data as effectively as possible. These experiments show the following findings: 1) The combination of MISR's 4 spectral bands at nadir and red and near infrared bands in the C, B, and A cameras observing off-nadir can obtain the best vegetation type differentiation at the community level in New Mexico desert grasslands. 2) The k parameter at red band of Modified-Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (MRPV) model and the structural scattering index (SSI) can bring useful additional information to land cover classification. The information carried by these two parameters, however, is less than that carried by surface anisotropy patterns described by the MRPV model and a linear semi-empirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function model, the RossThin-LiSparseMODIS (RTnLS) model. These experiments prove that: 1) multi-angular reflectance raise overall classification accuracy from 45.8% for nadir-only reflectance to 60.9%. 2) With surface anisotropy patterns derived from MRPV and RTnLS, an overall accuracy of 68.1% can be obtained when maximum likelihood algorithms are used. 3) Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms can raise the classification accuracy to 76.7%. This research shows that multi-angular reflectance, surface anisotropy patterns and SVM algorithms can improve desert vegetation type differentiation importantly. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc..

AB This study examined the covariability between interannual changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and actual evapotranspiration (ET). To reduce possible uncertainty in the NDVI time series, two NDVI datasets derived from Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data and the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) group were used. Analyses were conducted using data over northern Asia from 1982 to 2000. Interannual changes over 19 years in the PAL-NDVI and GIMMS-NDVI were compared with interannual changes in ET estimated from model-assimilated atmospheric data and gridded precipitation data. For both NDVI datasets, the annual maximum correlation with ET occurred in June, which is the beginning of the vegetation growing season. The PAL and GIMMS datasets showed a significant, positive correlation between interannual changes in the NDVI and ET over most of the vegetated land area in June. These results suggest that interannual changes in vegetation activity predominantly control interannual changes in ET in June. Based on analyses of interannual changes in temperature, precipitation, and the NDVI in June, the study area can be roughly divided into two regions, the warmth-dominated northernmost region and the wetness-dominated southern region, indicating that interannual changes in vegetation and the resultant interannual changes in ET are controlled by warmth and wetness in these two regions, respectively.

AB A snow water equivalent (SWE) algorithm has been developed for thin and thick snow using both in situ microwave measurements and snow thermophysical properties, collected over landfast snow covered first-year sea ice during the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES) overwintering mission from December 2003 to May 2004. Results showed that the behavior of brightness temperatures (Tbs) in thin snow covers was very different from those in a thick snowpack. Microwave SWE retrievals using the combination of T-b 19 GHz and air temperature (multiple regression) over thick snow are quite accurate, and showed very good agreement with the physical data (R-2 =0.94) especially during the cooling period (i.e., from freeze up to the minimum air temperature recorded) where the snow is dry and cold. Thin snow SWE predictions also showed fairly good agreement with field data (R-2 =0.70) during the cold season. The differences between retrieved and in situ SWE for both thin and thick snow cover are mainly attributable to the variations in air temperature, snow wetness and spatial heterogeneity in snow thickness.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the spatial occurrences of droughts, detected by remotely sensed drought-indices over the desert-steppe and desert geo-botanical zones of Mongolia. All indices were derived from reflectance and thermal data sets, obtained from the NOAA-AVHRR data between 1982 and 1999. One group of the drought-indices is based on vegetation state derived from the reflective channels. This group includes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Anomaly of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIA), Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Another group, based on surface brightness temperature derived from the thermal channel of NOAA-AVHRR, includes the Temperature Condition Index (TCI). The third group is based on combination between the reflective and thermal channels includes the ratio between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI (LST/NDVI), the Vegetation Health Index (VH), and the Drought Severity Index (DSI). Change detection procedure was performed by using the Change Vector Analysis in the temporal domain. Comparison analysis among the drought-indices reveals that there is no spatial coincidence between them, even when the vegetation growing period was divided into 2-month sub-periods - beginning, middle, and end. Based on the statistical analysis, higher correlations were found among the reflective indices while lesser or no relationships were found between the thermal and combination of the thermal and reflective indices. Furthermore, no agreement was found between the spatial extent of the satellite-derived drought-indices and the meteorological-based Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and also between the traditional ground-observed drought-affected-areas (DAA) maps. It was found that the combination of satellite-derived drought-indices can identify wider drought-occurred areas rather than the PDSI and the DAA maps. In summary, this study concludes that it is difficult to point out the most reliable drought index, and that the ground observations cannot provide sufficient information for validation of satellite derived drought indices.

AB SAn integrated approach to retrieve microwave emissivity difference vegetation index (EDVI) over land regions has been developed from combined multi-platform/multi-sensor satellite measurements, including SSM/I measurements. A possible relationship of the remotely sensed EDVI and the leaf physiology of canopy is explored at the Harvard Forest site for two growing seasons. This study finds that the EDVI is sensitive to leaf development through vegetation water content of the crown layer of the forest canopy, and has demonstrated that the spring onset and growing season duration can be determined accurately from the time series of satellite estimated EDVI within uncertainties of approximately 3 and 7 days for spring onset and growing season duration, respectively, compared to in situ observations. The leaf growing stage can also be monitored by a normalized EDVI. EDVI retrievals from satellite generally are possible during both daytime and nighttime when it is not raining. The EDVI technique studied here may provide higher temporal resolution observations for monitoring the onset of spring, the duration of growing season, and leaf development stage compared to current operational satellite methods.

AB In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal IRS Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) data for mapping of vegetation cover types in India. A vegetation cover type map was generated from a hybrid approach (supervised and unsupervised) classification of 8-10 months IRS WiFS composite data (Raw bands, Max NDVI) over the period of 1998 to 1999. The study has identified 35 cover classes with a description of 22 vegetation cover including 14 forest cover types from 188 in spatial resolution WiFS data. India has a diverse range of forests: from the tropical evergreen in the south to the alpine meadows in the north, from the deserts in the west to the evergreen forests in the north-east and a diverse pattern of vegetation cover. More than half of the forest area in India is tropical-moist and dry-deciduous types distributed in central part. The WiFS vegetation cover map was compared to the estimates of forest cover area derived from IRS LISS III images (as per Forest Survey of India). There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the WiFS product and the LISS product, however, the WiFS product provided additional information on vegetation cover types and other land use/cover classes. Analysis of temporal NDVI profile allows identification of distinct growth pattern between the different vegetation cover types. It is evident that WiFS data can be used to provide timely and detailed vegetation cover type maps with limited ancillary data. The WiFS derived maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models that require timely estimation of forest area and type. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The main aim of this paper is to show the utility of cokriging for image fusion (i.e. increasing the spatial resolution of satellite sensor images). It is assumed that co-registered images with different spatial and spectral resolutions of the same scene are available and the task is to generate new remote sensing images at the finer spatial resolution for the spectral bands available only at the coarser spatial resolution. The main advantages of colcriging are that it takes into account the correlation and cross-correlation of images, it accounts for the different supports (i.e. pixel sizes), it can take into account explicitly the point spread function of the sensor and has the property of prediction coherence. In addition, ancillary images (topographic maps, thematic maps, etc.) as well as sparse experimental data could be included in the process. The main drawback of cokriging in the previous context is that it requires several covariances and cross-covariances some of which are not accessible empirically (i.e. from the pixel values of the images). The solution adopted in this paper was to use linear systems theory to obtain the required covariances from the ones that were estimated empirically. Colcriging was compared with a benchmark image fusion approach (the high pass filter method) to assess performance against a standard. In fact, cokriging may be seen as a generalization of the high pass filter method where the low pass filter and high pass filter are estimated by fitting parameters to data. The present paper discusses the downscaling cokriging method, shows its implementation and illustrates the process in the case of sharpening several remotely sensed images. The desired target image was known so that the performance of the method could be evaluated realistically. Different statistics were used to show that the cokriged predictions were more precise than the HPF predictions. Downscaling cokriging is a new method of great potential in remote sensing that should be incorporated to the toolkit of the remote sensing researcher, (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The monitoring of snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth (SD) in boreal forests is investigated by applying space-borne microwave radiometer data and synoptic snow depth observations. A novel assimilation technique based on (forward) modelling of observed brightness temperatures as a function of snow pack characteristics is introduced. The assimilation technique is a Bayesian approach that weighs the space-borne data and the reference field on SD interpolated from discrete synoptic observations with their estimated statistical accuracy. The results obtained using SSM/I and AMSR-E data for northern Eurasia and Finland indicate that the employment of space-borne data using the assimilation technique improves the SD and SWE retrieval accuracy when compared with the use of values interpolated from synoptic observations. Moreover, the assimilation technique is shown to reduce systematic SWE/SD estimation errors evident in the inversion of space-borne radiometer data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A warm core eddy was detected south of the Brazil-Malvinas (Falkland) Confluence (BMC) region in satellite images of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean in late 2002. The structure was also sampled by in situ instruments deployed by a ship in 2 days of November 2002. An analysis of satellite data was performed to account for the lifecycle, dimension, surface temperature, surface chlorophyll concentration, surface height anomaly and displacement of the eddy since it was detached from the Brazil Current in September 2002. Satellite data were derived from several sources such as the AMSR-E, MODIS and radar altimeter. The structure lasted 64 days at south of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region later being re-assimilated by the Brazil Current return flow. In situ data collected during 2 days showed that the eddy was about 150 m deep, 5.5 degrees C warmer and 1 practical salinity unit saltier than adjacent waters. The salt anomaly associated to the eddy was estimated as 1.37x10(12) kg while its heat content was 4.24x10(18) J. These are typical estimates for eddies present at the BMC region. Sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration, and sea surface height anomaly time series were analyzed for the eddy's center along its trajectory path throughout its lifetime. Mean translational velocities for the eddy during its lifetime were computed from visual interpretation and by using an adaptation of the Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) method on AMSR-E SST images. The overall deviation between the two methods was 26%. This suggests that the MCC method has a potential to be applied in monitoring programs to automatically account for the translational velocities of eddies in the BMC region. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Optimal deconvolution (ODC) utilizes the footprint overlap in microwave observations to estimate the earth's brightness temperatures (T-B). This paper examines the accuracy of ODC-estimated T-B compared with a standard averaging technique. Because brightness temperatures cannot be independently verified, we constructed synthetic True T-B for accuracy assessment. We assigned T-B at a high spatial resolution (1 km) grid and computed the True T-B by spatial averaging of the assigned T-B to a lower resolution earth grid (25 km), selected to match the resolution of products generated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). We used the sensor antenna response function along with the 1-km assigned T-B to generate synthetic observations at AMSR-E footprint locations. These synthetic observations were subsequently deconvolved in the ODC technique to estimate T-B at the lower resolution earth grid. The ODC-estimated T-B and the simple grid cell averages of the synthetic observations were compared with the True T-B allowing us to quantity the efficacy of each technique. In areas of high T-B contrast (such as boundaries of water bodies), ODC performed significantly better than averaging. In other areas, ODC and averaging techniques produced similar results. A technique similar to ODC can be effective in delineating water bodies with significant clarity. That will allow microwave observations to be utilized near the shorelines, a trouble spot for the currently used averaging techniques. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fire is a prominent disturbance factor and a major force of environmental change especially in the African savannas. The development of an accurate system to map and monitor fires on the African continent is a priority of numerous international research centers and programs. This effort has produced a flurry of research projects in recent years to detect and map areas affected by fires at the continental scale using coarseresolution satellite imagery. The end product of these projects consists of weekly or monthly maps of burned area, several of which are available to the user community on the internet. It is argued here that the algorithms used to generate these products are designed to capture relatively large and contiguously burned areas and that the heterogeneous patterns of burn scars created by mosaic burning regimes pose a problem for current detection methodologies. Fine-scale burned area maps are generated using a series of Landsat ETM+imagery covering the 2002-2003 fire season for the study area in the savanna of southern Mali. These maps document a seasonal-mosaic pattern of burning in which burning begins early in the dry season and continues for several months ultimately affecting over 50% of the landscape. The majority of these fires burn relatively small areas producing a highly fragmented landscape pattern. A comparison of the fine scale maps with those from two widely available coarseresolution products finds that the latter fail to detect approximately 90% of the burned area. A general argument is developed which suggests that the documented bias in the coarse resolution products is a function of low-resolution bias which derives from the fine-scale spatiotemporal pattern of burning not uncommon to savanna and other frequently burned environments. The study demonstrates how low-resolution bias can result in a significant underestimation of burned areas and/or a shift in the seasonal burned area profile in areas where mosaic burning occurs. The findings have implications for the development of broad-scale burned area detection algorithms as well as their applications to natural resource management and global environmental change research.

AB The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) alters the seasonal and inter-annual variations exhibited in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and this hampers the detection and, consequently, the interpretation of temporal variations in land-surface vegetation. The magnitude and sign of bi-directional effects in commonly used AVHRR data sets depend on land-surface properties, atmospheric composition and the type of atmospheric correction that is applied to the data. We develop an approach to estimate BRDF effects in AVHRR NDVI time series using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) BRDF kernels and subsequently adjust NDVI time series to a standard illumination and viewing geometry. The approach is tested on NDVI time series that are simulated for representative AVHRR viewing and illumination geometry. These time series are simulated with a canopy radiative transfer model coupled to an atmospheric radiative transfer model for four different land cover types-tropical forest, boreal forest, temperate forest and grassland - and five different atmospheric conditions - turbid and clear top-of-atmosphere, turbid and clear top-of-atmosphere with a correction for ozone absorption and Rayleigh scattering applied (Pathfinder AVHRR Land data) and ground-observations (fully corrected for atmospheric effects). The simulations indicate that the timing of key phenological stages, such as start and end of growing season and time of maximum greenness, is affected by BRDF effects. Moreover, BRDF effects vary with latitude and season and increase over the time of operation of subsequent NOAA satellites because of orbital drift. Application of the MODIS kernels on simulated NVDI data results in a 50% to 85% reduction of BRDF effects. When applied to the global 18-year global Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Pathfinder data we find BRDF effects similar in magnitude to those in the simulations. Our analysis of the global data shows that BRDF effects are especially large in high latitudes; here we find that in at least 20% of the data BRDF errors are too large for accurate detection of seasonal and interannual variability. These large BRDF errors tend to compensate, however, when averaged over latitude. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE classification; accuracy; cross-validation; probability sampling
ID CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN
AB Assessing the accuracy of land cover maps is often prohibitively expensive because of the difficulty of collecting a statistically valid probability sample from the classified map. Even when post-classification sampling is undertaken, cost and accessibility constraints may result in imprecise estimates of map accuracy. If the map is constructed via supervised classification, then the training sample provides a potential alternative source of data for accuracy assessment. Yet unless the training sample is collected by probability sampling, the estimates are, at best, of uncertain quality, and may be substantially biased. This article discusses a new approach to map accuracy assessment based on maximum posterior probability estimators. Maximum posterior probability estimators are resistant to bias induced by non-representative sampling, and so are intended for situations in which the training sample is collected without using a statistical sampling design. The maximum posterior probability approach may also be used to increase the precision of estimates obtained from a post-classification sample. In addition to discussing maximum posterior probability estimators, this article reports on a simulation study comparing three approaches to estimating map accuracy: 1) post-classification sampling, 2) resampling the training sample via cross-validation, and 3) maximum posterior probability estimation. The simulation study showed substantial reductions in bias and improvements in precision in comparisons of maximum posterior probability and cross-validation estimators when the training sample was not representative of the map. In addition, combining an ordinary post-classification estimator and the maximum posterior probability estimator produced an estimator that was at least, and usually more precise than the ordinary post-classification estimator.

AB Accurate estimation of surface energy fluxes from space at high spatial resolution has the potential to improve prediction of the impact of land-use changes on the local environment and to provide a means to assess local crop conditions. To achieve this goal, a combination of physically based surface flux models and high-quality remote-sensing data are needed. Data from the ASTER sensor are particularly well-suited to the task, as it collects high spatial resolution (15-90 m) images in visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared bands. Data in these bands yield surface temperature, vegetation cover density, and land-use types, all critical inputs to surface energy balance models for assessing local environmental conditions. ASTER is currently the only satellite sensor collecting multispectral thermal infrared images, a capability allowing unprecedented surface temperature estimation accuracy for a variety of surface cover types. Availability of ASTER data to study surface energy fluxes allows direct comparisons against ground measurements and facilitates detection of modeling limitations, both possible because of ASTER's higher spatial resolution.
   Surface energy flux retrieval from ASTER is demonstrated using data collected over an experimental site in central Iowa, USA, in the framework of the Soil Moisture Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). This experiment took place during the summer of 2002 in a study of heterogeneous agricultural croplands. Two different flux estimation approaches, designed to account for the spatial variability, are considered: the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) and the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm or Land model (SEBAL). ASTER data are shown to have spatial and spectral resolution sufficient to derive surface variables required as inputs for physically based energy balance modeling. Comparison of flux model results against each other and against ground based measurements was promising, with flux values commonly agreeing within similar to 50 W m(-2). Both TSEB and SEBAL showed systematic agreement and responded to spatially varying surface temperatures and vegetation densities. Direct comparison against ground Eddy Covariance data suggests that the TSEB approach is helpful over sparsely vegetated terrain. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Precipitation-runoff processes are correlated with catchment's hydrological conditions before the precipitation. Thus, an estimation of these conditions, particularly regarding soil wetness variations, is of considerable importance to improve the reliability of flood warning. In this paper, a new methodology is presented which, on the basis of microwave satellite observations, could permit us to monitor soil wetness variations at a global scale. The proposed method seems able to overcome the problems connected to surface roughness and vegetation cover that mainly limit the soil moisture estimations from satellite in the microwave region.
   Preliminary results achieved for the flooding event which occurred in the Carpathian basin (Hungary) in April 2000 will be described in detail. They seem to confirm the reliability of the proposed technique in the identification of different amounts of soil wetness, not only during and after the considered event, but, in order to possibly use it for warning system purposes, in the phase preceding the event as well.
   Such an approach is automatic and, for construction, globally exportable. Moreover, because of the complete independence from the specific satellite platform, such a technique could be easily exported to the new generation of satellite sensors with improved performances like AMSR-E aboard EOS-Aqua and MIRAS aboard SMOS.

AB This study compared aspatial and spatial methods of using remote sensing and field data to predict maximum growing season leaf area index (LAI) maps in a boreal forest in Manitoba, Canada. The methods tested were orthogonal regression analysis (reduced major axis, RMA) and two geostatistical techniques: kriging with an external drift (KED) and sequential Gaussian conditional simulation (SGCS). Deterministic methods such as RMA and KED provide a single predicted map with either aspatial (e.g., standard error, in regression techniques) or limited spatial (e.g., KED variance) assessments of errors, respectively. In contrast, SGCS takes a probabilistic approach, where simulated values are conditional on the sample values and preserve the sample statistics. In this application, canonical indices were used to maximize the ability of Landsat ETM+ spectral data to account for LAI variability measured in the field through a spatially nested sampling design. As expected based on theory, SGCS did the best job preserving the distribution of measured LAI values. In terms of spatial pattern, SGCS preserved the anisotropy observed in semivariograms of measured LAI, while KED reduced anisotropy and lowered global variance (i.e., lower sill), also consistent with theory. The conditional variance of multiple SGCS realizations provided a useful visual and quantitative measure of spatial uncertainty. For applications requiring spatial prediction methods, we concluded KED is more useful if local accuracy is important, but SGCS is better for indicating global pattern. Predicting LAI from satellite data using geostatistical methods requires a distribution and density of primary, reference LAI measurements that are impractical to obtain. For regional NPP modeling with coarse resolution inputs, the aspatial RMA regression method is the most practical option. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) uses linear mixture models to provide physical representations of land surface reflectance as continuous fields of spectral endmember abundances. While most spectral mixture analyses are site-specific and use local image endmembers to model abundance of specific materials, the linear mixture model can also provide a physical basis for a more general representation of land surface reflectance as mixtures of generic endmembers. A spectral mixture analysis of a global composite of 30 spectrally diverse Landsat ETM+ subscenes indicates that a wide variety of ETM+ reflectance spectra can be accurately represented as linear combinations of soil and rock substrate, green vegetation, and dark surface reflectance spectra. The global analysis indicates that >98% of ETM+ image spectral variance can be represented within a three-dimensional spectral mixing space and that >90% of the variance can be described with a two-dimensional projection of the mixing space. A wide variety of individual subscene and composite mixing spaces consistently show similar triangular distributions of mixed reflectances bounded by linear mixtures of the substrate, vegetation, and dark surface endmembers. Distinct binary mixing spurs representing ice/snow and submarine/reef reflectance are also linear but separate from the primary triangular mixing space. While the three-endmember substrate, vegetation, dark surface (SVD) linear mixing model does not accommodate some significant characteristics of the three-dimensional mixing space, it is able to represent more than 95% of the 30 million observed ETM+ image spectra with misfits of less than 0.04 reflectance units. Linear binary mixing continua between the dark surface endmember and both the substrate and vegetation endmembers indicate the extent to which shadowing and nonreflective surfaces combine with illuminated substrate and vegetation at subpixet scales to modulate spectrally mixed ETM+ reflectances in a wide variety of land cover types. SVD fractions estimated with a standard set of generic endmember spectra could offer many of the benefits of standard metrics like vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI) and linear transformations (e.g. Kauth-Thomas Tasseled Cap), while retaining the unique benefits of physically based fraction estimates. These benefits include good agreement with ground based measurements and output units corresponding to physical properties of land cover that can be used directly as input to land surface process models.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the retrieval of the leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI) for precision agriculture application from hyperspectral data is significantly affected by data compression. This analysis was carried out using the hyperspectral data sets acquired by Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) over corn fields at L'Acadie experimental farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) during the summer of 2000 and over corn, soybean and wheat fields at the former Greenbelt farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) in three intensive field campaigns during the summer of 2001. Leaf chlorophyll content and LAI were retrieved from the original data and the reconstructed data compressed/decompressed by the compression algorithm called successive approximation multi-stage vector quantization (SAMVQ) at compression ratios of 20:1, 30:1, and 50:1. The retrieved products were evaluated against the ground-truth.
   In the retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (the first data set), the spatial patterns were examined in all of the images created from the original and reconstructed data and were proven to be visually unchanged, as expected. The data measures R-2, absolute RMSE, and relative RMSE between the leaf chlorophyll content derived from the original and reconstructed data cubes, and the laboratory-measured values were calculated as well. The results show the retrieval accuracy of crop chlorophyll content is not significantly affected by SAMVQ at the compression ratios of 20:1, 30:1, and 50:1, relative to the observed uncertainties in ground truth values. In the retrieval of LAI (the second data set), qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. The results show that the spatial and temporal patterns of the LAI images are not significantly affected by SAMVQ and the retrieval accuracies measured by the R-2, absolute RMSE, and relative RMSE between the ground-measured LAI and the estimated LAI are not significantly affected by the data compression either.

AB This paper uses three recently generated southern African satellite burned area products for the month of September 2000 in a sensitivity study of regional biomass burning emissions for a number of trace gases and particulates. Differences in the extent and location of areas burned among products generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Systeme Pour l'Observation de In Terre (SPOT-VEGETATION), and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) data are significant and result in different emissions estimates for woodland and grassland land cover types. Due to the different emission profiles in woodlands and grasslands, favoring relatively more products of incomplete combustion in woodlands compared with products of complete combustion in grasslands in the late dry season, these changes are not proportional to the differences in the burned area amounts. The importance of accurate burned area information not just in terms of the total area but also in terms of its spatial distribution becomes apparent from our modeling results. This paper highlights the urgent need for satellite data producers to provide accuracy assessments associated with satellite-derived products. Preferably, these accuracy data will be spatially explicit, or defined in a way that can be applied in a spatially explicit modeling context, to enable emissions uncertainties to be defined with respect to different landscape units in support of greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

AB Hyperspectral features in the red-edge region were tested as an index of plant stress responses to soil-oxygen depletion. The aim was to provide the basis for a warning system to identify natural gas leakage by the spectral responses of plants growing in the affected soil.
   Elevated concentrations of natural gas in the soil atmosphere were used to deplete oxygen concentrations around the roots of grass, wheat (Hordeum vulgare cv Claire) and bean (Vicia faba cv Clipper) growing in a field facility. Visible symptoms due to the natural gas included reduced growth of the plants and chlorosis of the leaves.
   Spectral responses included increased reflectance in the visible wavelengths and decreased reflectance in the near infra-red. Derivative analysis identified features within the red-edge at 720-730 and 702 nm. Ratios of the magnitude of the derivative at 725 to that at 702 nm were less in areas where gas was present. This ratio enabled identification of stress due to gas leakage up to 7 days before visible symptoms were observed and also at the edges of gassed plots where visible symptoms were not expressed. The technique was able to identify stress responses to long-term leaks in all the crops tested but to short-term leaks only in grass. This study therefore suggests that under appropriate conditions remote sensing could be used to detect pipeline gas leaks from decreases in the ratio of peaks within the red-edge.

AB I processed 9.6 years of TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter data and computed the time series of heat storage (HS) anomaly over the Kuroshio upstream regions. Coherence between the heat storage anomaly and the wind stress curl is significant (>0.8) at the annual component over the studied area. Using wavelet analysis, the semiannual component has significantly westward propagating signals at 19 and 27degreesN. The annual component is significantly strong at 11 and 27degreesN while westward-propagating signals can be found at the North Equatorial Current regions. The peaks of the annual components of heat storage anomalies occur in summer and the peaks of the annual components of wind stress curl exit in winter. However, generally, the wind stress curl lows are 1 month ahead of the peaks of heat storage anomalies at 1-year component. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The IKONOS spacecraft acquired images on July 3, 17, and 25, and August 13, 2001 of Brookings SD, a small city in east central South Dakota, and on May 22, June 30, and July 30, 2000, of the rural area around the EROS Data Center. South Dakota State University (SDSU) evaluated the Brookings scenes and the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) evaluated the other scenes. The images evaluated by SDSU utilized various natural objects and man-made features as identifiable targets randomly distribution throughout the scenes, while the images evaluated by EDC utilized pre-marked artificial points (panel points) to provide the best possible targets distributed in a grid pattern. Space Imaging provided products at different processing levels to each institution. For each scene, the pixel (line, sample) locations of the various targets were compared to field observed, survey-grade Global Positioning System locations. Patterns of error distribution for each product were plotted, and a variety of statistical statements of accuracy are made. The IKONOS sensor also acquired 12 pairs of stereo images of globally distributed scenes between April 2000 and April 2001. For each scene, analysts at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) compared derived photogrammetric coordinates to their corresponding NIMA field-surveyed ground control point (GCPs). NIMA analysts determined horizontal and vertical accuracies by averaging the differences between the derived photogrammetric points and the field-surveyed GCPs for all 12 stereo pairs. Patterns of error distribution for each scene are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization process is a major factor of change in the Mediterranean region where pre-urban cities and new urban settlements have raised over the past decades. Several cities rapidly became regional centres or international nodes according to economic and political pressures. Urbanization (and informal settlement) causes land cover changes which can lead to deeper social, economic and environmental changes. The main objective of this paper is to provide time-series information to define and locate the evolution trends of the Tunis Metropolitan Area. In a first step, satellite imagery has been used (1986-1996 SPOT XS) to extract the land cover, identify the urbanization processes and estimate the changes. One of the main aspects is to locate informal settlement areas that grow significantly along the roadway networks in the Tunisian capital. Results show a global progression of the built-up areas of 13% in 10 years. In a second step, the urban growth evolution has been approached by using a potential model that provides general trends of feasible urban expansion, taking into account protection laws of natural and agricultural land. This type of model has not been tested on developing cities and as such it corresponds to a new planning contribution for planners who have no concept of spatially how their urban areas have changed over time and where the growth is occurring. In this case, it has been calibrated over the period of 1986-1996, and then applied to predict the location of the built-up growth over the next 10 years (19962006). These results can provide local authorities and other stakeholders with information towards decision support documents for future planning and monitoring plans. Moreover, they can be updated systematically through the integration of remote sensing data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow cover represents an important water resource for the Upper Rio Grande River Basin of Colorado and New Mexico. Accuracy assessment of MODIS snow products was accomplished using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Daily snow cover maps produced from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were compared with operational snow cover maps produced by the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) and against in situ Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) measurements for the 2000-2001 snow season. Over the snow season, agreement between the MODIS and NOHRSC snow maps was high with an overall agreement of 86%. However, MODIS snow maps typically indicate a higher proportion of the basin as being snow-covered than do the NOHRSC snow maps. In particular, large tracts of evergreen forest on the western slopes of the San de Cristo Range, which comprise a large portion of the eastern margin of the basin, are more consistently mapped as snow-covered in the MODIS snow products than in the NOHRSC snow products. NOHRSC snow maps, however, typically indicate a greater proportion of the central portion of the basin, predominately in cultivated areas, as snow. Comparisons of both snow maps with in situ SNOTEL measurements over the snow season show good overall agreement with overall accuracies of 94% and 76% for MODIS and NOHRSC, respectively. A lengthened comparison of MODIS against SNOTEL sites, which increases the number of comparisons of snow-free conditions, indicates a slightly lower overall classification accuracy of 88%. Errors in mapping extra snow and missing snow by MODIS are comparable, with MODIS missing snow in approximately 12% of the cases and mapping too much snow in 15% of the cases. The majority of the days when MODIS fails to map snow occurs at snow depths of less than 4 cm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an original methodology to retrieve surface (< 5 cm) soil moisture over low vegetated regions using the two active microwave instruments of ERS satellites. The developed algorithm takes advantage of the multi-angular configuration and high temporal resolution of the Wind Scatterometer (WSC) combined with the SAR high spatial resolution. As a result, a mixed target model is proposed. The WSC backscattered signal may be represented as a combination of the vegetation and bare soil contributions weighted by their respective fractional covers. Over our temperate regions and time periods of interest, the vegetation signal is assumed to be principally due to forests backscattered signal. Then, thanks to the high spatial resolution of the SAR instrument, the forest contribution may be quantified from the analysis of the SAR image, and then removed from the total WSC signal in order to estimate the soil contribution. Finally, the Integral Equation Model (IEM, [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 30 (2), (1992) 356]) is used to estimate the effect of surface roughness and to retrieve surface soil moisture from the WSC multi-angular measurements. This methodology has been developed and applied on ERS data acquired over three different Seine river watersheds in France, and for a 3-year time period. The soil moisture estimations are compared with in situ ground measurements. High correlations (R-2 greater than 0.8) are observed for the three study watersheds with a root mean square (rms) error smaller than 4%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID WATERS; OCEAN
AB Input of freshwater from rivers is a critical consideration in the study and management of coral and seagrass ecosystems in tropical regions. Low salinity water can transport natural and manmade river-borne contaminants into the sea, and can directly stress marine ecosystems that are adapted to higher salinity levels. An efficient method of mapping surface salinity distribution over large ocean areas is required to address such environmental issues. We describe here an investigation of the utility of airborne remote sensing of sea surface salinity using an L-band passive microwave radiometer. The study combined aircraft overflights of the scanning low frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR) with shipboard and in situ instrument deployments to map surface and subsurface salinity distributions, respectively, in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. The goals of the investigation were (a) to assess the performance of the airborne salinity mapper; (b) to use the maps and in situ data to develop an integrated description of the structure and zone of influence of a river plume under prevailing monsoon weather conditions; and (c) to determine the extent to which the sea surface salinity distribution expressed the subsurface structure. The SLFMR was found to have sufficient precision (1 psu) and accuracy ( similar to 3 psu) to provide a useful description of plumes emanating from estuaries of moderate discharge levels with a salinity range of 16 to 32 psu in the open sea. The aircraft surveys provided a means of rapidly assessing the spatial extent of the surface salinity distribution of the plume, while in situ data revealed subsurface structure detail and provided essential validation data for the SLFMR. The combined approach allowed us to efficiently determine the structure and zone of influence of the plume, and demonstrated the utility of sea surface salinity remote sensing for studying coastal circulation in tropical seas.

AB The 1800 MW Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (DNPS), China's first nuclear power station, is located on the coast of the South China Sea. DNPS discharges 29 10 x 10(5) m(3) year(-1) of warm water from its cooling system into Daya Bay, which could have ecological consequences. This study examines satellite sea surface temperature data and shipboard water column measurements from Daya Bay. Field observations of water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a data were conducted four times per year at 12 sampling stations in Daya Bay during January 1997 to January 1999. Sea surface temperatures were derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting satellites during November 1997 to February 1999. A total of 2905 images with 1.1 x 1.1 km resolution were examined; among those images, 342 have sufficient quality for quantitative analysis. The results show a seasonal pattern of thermal plumes in Daya Bay. During the winter months (December to March), the thermal plume is localized to an area within a few km of the power plant, and the temperature difference between the plume and non-plume areas is about 1.5 degreesC. During the summer and fall months (May to November), there is a larger thermal plume extending 8-10 kin south along the coast from DNPS, and the temperature change is about 1.0 degreesC. Monthly variation of SST in the thermal plume is analyzed. AVHRR SST is higher in daytime than in nighttime in the bay during the whole year. The strong seasonal difference in the thermal plume is related to vertical mixing of the water column in winter and to stratification in summer. Further investigations are needed to determine any other ecological effects of the Daya Bay thermal plume. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Measurements of nearshore water currents are important for a number of reasons, including understanding sediment transport and beach erosion, planning and evaluation of littoral construction projects, and military operations in very shallow water. Because direct measurements are difficult and expensive to make, remote sensing techniques are of great interest. A digital camera system has been used to remotely measure ocean surface currents from an aircraft by estimating the Doppler shift of gravity waves. Navigational data are used to map each of a sequence of images to a geodetic reference frame at the level of the mean ocean surface. The 3-D frequency-wave number spectrum of the luminance modulations in subsets of these mapped data exhibits the dispersion relation for surface gravity waves, and the 2-D velocity vector is retrieved by estimating the Doppler shift of the higher frequency waves in this spectrum, wavelengths in the band of about 5 - 30 m. The relationship of this technique to that of tracking visible surface features between image pairs is examined with examples. Current retrievals in shallow water outside the surf on a quasi-linear beach and in an exposed tidal inlet channel are favorably compared with simultaneous in situ current measurements, with errors of similar to 10% in magnitude and similar to 5' in direction.

AB Forest represents a challenging problem for snow-cover mapping by optical satellite remote sensing. To investigate reflectance variability and to improve the mapping of snow in forested areas, a method for subpixel mapping of snow cover in forests (SnowFrac) has been developed. The SnowFrac method is based on linear spectral mixing modelling of snow, trees and snow-free ground. The focus has been on developing a physically based reflectance model which uses a forest-cover map as prior information. The method was tested in flat terrain covered by spruce, pine and birch forests, close to the Jotunheimen region of South Norway. Experiments were carried out using a completely snow-covered Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, aerial photos and in situ reflectance measurements. A detailed forest model was photogrammetrically derived from the aerial photos. Modelled and observed TM reflectances were compared. In the given situation, the results demonstrate that snow and individual tree species, in addition to cast shadows on the snow surface from single trees, are the most influencing factors on visible and near-infrared reflectance. Modelling of diffuse radiation reduced by surrounding trees slightly improve the results, indicating that this effect is less important. The best results are obtained for pine forest and mixed pine and birch forest. Future work will focus on deriving a simplified reflectance model suitable for operational snow-cover mapping in forests. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Retrievals of total sea ice concentration from four algorithms using the 85.5 GHz vertically and horizontally polarized channels of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) over the marginal ice zone in the Barents and Greenland Seas are compared with retrievals of total sea ice concentration from helicopter-borne linescan camera observations made during a cruise of the R/V Polarstern during May-June 1997. The goals are to evaluate (1) SSM/I 85.5 GHz retrievals of total sea ice concentration for climatological purposes, and (2) the ability of 85.5 GHz data to show the sea ice edge through cloud cover, for operational purposes. The SSM/I 85.5 GHz channels offer a spatial resolution of 12.5 km, which is sufficient to resolve ice edge features and small polynyas; however, there is generally more atmospheric contamination of the sea ice signal at 85.5 GHz than at the lower frequencies (19 and 37 GHz) traditionally used for sea ice remote sensing. A self-adjusting algorithm that performs a nonlinear correction for atmospheric moisture, without explicit atmospheric input data, yields the best accuracy over total sea ice concentrations greater than 30%. However, this algorithm can misclassify clouds over open water as sea ice, and is therefore unreliable for locating the sea ice edge. The best algorithm for locating the sea ice edge is found to be the SEA LION algorithm, which explicitly uses meteorological reanalysis data to correct for atmospheric contamination. For total sea ice concentrations in the range 20-70%, empirical 85.5 GHz hybrids of lower-frequency algorithms developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center can improve the accuracy of these algorithms.

AB Research conducted at the Great Sand Dunes National Monument (37degrees46.5' N, 105degrees32.5' W) thus far has focused on dune composition in order to explain formation, dune migration to monitor aeolian processes, and dune extent to detect encroachment in the eastern periphery, a region that contains several visitor services. These studies used a series of field techniques in conjunction with aerial photography; however, modern satellite data, such as temporal TM imagery, were not used to track changes of the dunes. In this study, I used two TM images from 1984 and 1998 to examine changes in dune extent. A series of image enhancements, including edge enhancements were applied, and a supervised classification was conducted. Overall classification accuracies, based on ground truth data, ranged from 89% (1998) to 91% (1984). Over the study period, the amount of sand in the entire complex decreased in area by 416.4 ha, dune grass decreased by 487.5 ha, and a semidesert scrub category containing a mixture of bushes, taller grasses, and desert pavement increased by 1457.3 ha. Few changes in the extent and orientation of the main dune complex were observed; however, notable changes were observed in the periphery. On the western side of the complex, dune grass is slowly being converted to scrub; as a result, the extent of exposed sand is decreasing. On the eastern side, dune grass and scrub are increasing, succeeding upon the dunes. These results demonstrate the stability of the main dune complex and suggest that dune migration in the periphery is no longer a concern. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) calculated from remotely sensed data are routinely used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in vegetation biophysical characteristics. The most commonly used SVI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has been criticized because of its sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and substrate reflectivity, as well as its insensitivity to increases in vegetation biomass past particular thresholds. Yet, the use of NDVI remains widespread and is attractive because of the ease with which it is calculated. This article examines the utility of NDVI for monitoring the biophysical characteristic of green vegetation fraction (GVF) in comparison to other SVIs suggested as improvements. Statistical relationships between spectral response, presented in the form of SVIs, and GVF of a native tallgrass prairie canopy are explored. Broadband spectra were gathered from close-range during the 1999 growing season at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS), located in the Flint Hills region of Kansas, USA. Through simple regression analyses, spectra were related to GVF estimates derived from digital color photographs. SVIs evaluated are the NDVI, the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and the square of scaled NDVI (N*(2)). Results show that NDVI and N*(2) were statistically related to GVF (R-2 for NDVI = .77, N*(2) = .78) throughout the growing season. The least-squares line defining the relationship between N*(2) and GVF approximated a 1:1 line. For June sample dates, all three SVIs were significant statistical predictors of GVF (R-2 for NDVI = .89, N*(2) = .91, SAVI = .89). Regression coefficients for late-season sample dates were weaker, yet still significant in statistical terms (R-2 for NDVI = 30, N*(2) = .70). While encouraging, these results suggest that further analyses are required to determine the usefulness of SVIs calculated from broadband devices for estimation of GVF when leaf litter dominates the scene.

AB The insights gained from present land cover classification activities suggest integration of multiangle data into classification attempts for future progress. Land cover types that exhibit distinct signatures in the space of remote sensing data facilitate unambiguous identification of cover types. In this two-part series, we develop a theme for consistency among cover type definitions, uniqueness of their signatures, and physics of the remote sensing data. In the First pail, Zhang et al.'s [Remote Sens. Environ., in press.] empirical arguments in support of the consistency principle were presented. This part provides a theoretical justification of the consistency requirements. Radiative transfer best explains the physics of the processes operative in the generation of the signal in the optical remote sensing data. Biome definitions given in terms of variables that this theory admits and the use of the transport equation to interpret biome signatures guarantee the consistency requirements. It is shown in this paper that three metrics of the biome angular signature in the spectral space-location, angular signature slope (ASSI), and length (ASLI) indices are related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transport equation. These variables allow a novel parameterization of canopy structure based on the partitioning of the incident radiation among canopy absorption, transmission, and reflection. Consistency between cover type definitions and uniqueness of their signatures with the physics of the remote sensing data is required not only to reduce ambiguity in land cover identification, but also to directly relate land cover type to biophysical and biogeochemical processes in vegetation canopies.

AB A simplified land surface dryness index (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index, TVDI) based on an empirical parameterisation of the relationship between surface temperature (T-s) and vegetation index (NDVI) is suggested. The index is related to soil moisture and, in comparison to existing interpretations of the T-s/NDVI space, the index is conceptually and computationally straightforward. It is based on satellite derived information only, and the potential for operational application of the index is therefore large. The spatial pattern and temporal evolution in TVDI has been analysed using 37 NOAA-AVHRR images from 1990 covering part of the Ferlo region of northern, semiarid Senegal in West Africa. The spatial pattern in TVDI has been compared with simulations of soil moisture from a distributed hydrological model based on the MIKE SHE code. The spatial variation in TVDI reflects the variation in moisture on a finer scale than can be derived from the hydrological model in this case. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studies are needed to evaluate the ability of present or future SAR data to extract forest attributes over various sites. This study focuses on large unmanaged pine plantations in a vast flat area of ca. 500,000 ha where the tree biomass ranges from 0 to 200 m(3)/ha corresponding to different forest canopy structures. Results show a good correlation between the backscattering coefficient ao (with a 6-dB dynamic range and R-2 greater than or equal to .8), the stand timber volume and the stand density. The trend is mainly driven by stand density and different relationships are observed according to age class, which explicitly points out the effects of canopy structure on the backscattering level. Stem volume is derived from the inversion of statistical and semiempirical models, which take these effects into account. Inversion results show that forest biomass attributes can be estimated with relatively small errors commensurate with those achieved by field measurements. Best overall accuracy of ca. 21 m(3)/ha is reached with the semiempirical model. Error decomposition as a function of age classes shows that, for the same biomass range. errors are higher for old stands than for young stands. Finally, the results indicate that (1) JERS-1 data can be used in an operational way for estimating the biomass of such plantations and (2) it is necessary to take forest stand structure into account- In order to develop reliable biomass-retrieval schemes, future research should focus on examining in a more mechanistic way the relationship between canopy structure and radar signature.

AB Gould and Arnone (Remote Sens. Environ. 61 (1997) 2901 characterized the spatial and temporal variability of inherent optical properties (water absorption and scattering coefficients) in a coastal region using in situ shipboard and moored optical data, and high-resolution aircraft ocean color imagery. Following atmospheric correction of the aircraft imagery, they applied a bio-optical model [Carder et al., 1999, J. Geophys. Res. 104 (C3) (1999) 5403] to the image data to produce surface maps of absorption and scattering coefficients. The results from the model were compared with in situ measurements and adjustments were made to two model parameters to force the model results to more closely match the in situ measurements. Hu and Carder [Remote Sens. Environ. (2001)] raise questions concerning (a) the atmospheric correction applied to the aircraft data and (b) the reason for adjusting the parameters of the bio-optical model. Here we respond to their comments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The recent paper by Simpson et al. [Remote Sens. Environ. 72 (2000) 191.] on failures to detect volcanic ash using the 'reverse' absorption technique provides a timely reminder of the danger that volcanic ash presents to aviation and the urgent need for some form of effective remote detection. The paper unfortunately suffers from a fundamental flaw in its methodology and numerous errors of fact and interpretation. For the moment, the 'reverse' absorption technique provides the best means for discriminating volcanic ash clouds from meteorological clouds. The purpose of our comment is not to defend any particular algorithm; rather, we point out some problems with Simpson et al.'s analysis and re-state the conditions under which the 'reverse' absorption algorithm is likely to succeed.

AB Radiometrically calibrated hyperspectral imagery contains information relating to the material properties of a surface target and the atmospheric layers between the surface target and the sensor. All atmospheric layers contain well-mixed molecular gases, aerosol particles, and water vapor, and information about these constituents may be extracted from hyperspectral imagery by using specialty designed algorithms. This research describes a total sensor radiance-to-ground reflectance inversion program. An equivalent surface-pressure depth can be extracted using the Non-Linear Least-Squares Spectral Fit (NLLSSF) technique on the 760-nm oxygen band. Two different methods, the Atmospheric Pre-Corrected Differential Absorption (APDA) and NLLSSF, can be used to derive total columnar water vapor using the radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4.0. Atmospheric visibility can be derived via the NLLSSF technique from the 400 - 700-nm, bands or using an approach that uses the upwelled radiance fit from the Regression Intersection Method from 550 to 700 nm. A new numerical approximation technique is also introduced to calculate the effect of the target surround on the sensor-received radiance. The recovered spectral reflectances for each technique are compared to reflectance panels with well-characterized ground truth. (C), 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landsat, with its wide swath and high resolution, fills an important mesoscale gap between atmospheric variations seen on a few kilometer scale by local surface instrumentation and the global view of coarser resolution satellites such as MODIS. In this important scale range, Landsat reveals radiative effects on the few hundred-meter scale of common photon mean-free-paths, typical of scattering in clouds at conservative (visible) wavelengths, and even shorter mean-free-paths of absorptive (near-infrared) wavelengths. Landsat also reveals shadowing effects caused by both cloud and vegetation that impact both cloudy and clear-sky radiances. As a result, Landsat has been useful in development of new cloud retrieval methods and new aerosol and surface retrievals that account for photon diffusion and shadowing effects. This paper discusses two new cloud retrieval methods: the nonlocal independent pixel approximation (NIPA) and the normalized difference nadir radiance method (NDNR). We illustrate the improvements in cloud property retrieval enabled by the new low gain settings of Landsat-7 and difficulties found at high gains. Then, we review the recently developed "path radiance" method of aerosol retrieval and clear-sky correction using data from the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site in Oklahoma. Nearby clouds change the solar radiation incident on the surface and atmosphere due to indirect illumination from cloud sides. As a result, if clouds are nearby, this extra side-illumination causes clear pixels to appear brighter, which can be mistaken for extra aerosol or higher surface albedo. Thus, cloud properties must be known in order to derive accurate aerosol and surface properties. A three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulation illustrates this point and suggests a method to subtract the cloud effect from aerosol and surface retrievals. The main conclusion is that cloud, aerosol, and surface retrievals are linked and must be treated as a combined system. Landsat provides the range of scales necessary to observe the 3D cloud radiative effects that influence joint surface-atmospheric retrievals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne remote sensing methods are needed to assess spatial patterns of stream temperature at scales relevant to issues in water quality and fisheries management. In this study, we developed an airborne remote sensing method to measure spatially continuous patterns of stream temperature and evaluated the physical factors that influence the accuracy of thermal remote sensing of Bowing waters. The airborne thermal infrared (TIR) system incorporated an internally calibrated thermal imager (8-12 mum) aligned with a visible band camera in a vertically mounted, gimbaled pad attached to the underside of a helicopter High-resolution imagery (0.2-0.4 m) covering the entire channel and adjacent floodplains was recorded digitally and georeferenced in-flight along 50- to 60-km river sections ranging from 2 to 110 m in width. Radiant water temperature corresponded to kinetic water temperature (5-27 degreesC) in a range of stream environments within +/-0.5 degreesC. Longitudinal profiles of radiant water temperature ti-om downstream to headwater reaches provided a spatial context for assessing large-scale patterns of thermal heterogeneity and fine-scale thermal features such as tributaries and groundwater inputs. Potential sources of error in remote measurements of stream temperature included reflected longwave radiation, thermal boundary layer effects at the water surface, and vertical thermal stratification. After taking into account the radiative properties of the surrounding environment and the physical qualities of the stream, thermal remote sensing proved highly effective for examining spatial patterns of stream temperature at a resolution and extent previously unattainable through conventional methods of stream temperature measurement using in-stream data recorders.

AB The feasibility of space-borne microwave radiometers for monitoring the evolution of snow cover in a drainage area is investigated. Four winter sets (1993/94, 1995/96, 1996/97, 1997/98) of SSM/I radiometer observations for the 51,000 km(2) River Kemijoki drainage area, Northern Finland, are used for analyses. The Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) of dry snow cover is estimated by employing the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) Snow Emission Model-based automatic inversion algorithm. For comparison, the SWE estimates are also determined by using a conventional empirical Spectral and Polarization Difference algorithm. The results indicate that the HUT Snow Emission Model-based automatic algorithm can estimate the regional SWE under dry snow conditions with an overall RMSE of about 30 mm without using any training reference data on SWE (e.g., in situ reference values). The retrieval error was found to vary considerably from year to year. At best, the annual SWE retrieval RMSE showed values as low as 20 mm. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

AB The Subtropical Front (STF) is a global front which extends around the Southern Ocean and is the boundary where the Subantarctic Surface Water mass (SAW) converges with the subtropical Surface Water mass (STW). The Southland Front (SF) is part of the STF, which lies off the east coast of the South Island, New Zealand. The SF is narrow, approximately 8 km, with a temperature difference of approximately 1.8 degrees C which can be detected using remote sensing Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data. The work presented here is an application of remote sensing for the first detailed study of the surface spatial and temporal variability of the SF. The variability of the SF was quantified using an algorithm developed to follow the Front using AVHRR SST imagery. The algorithm used a new approach to determine the position, mean SST, SST difference, width, and gradient across the Front. Three timescales of variability were examined: long-term (three years), annual, and seasonal. The algorithm efficiently followed the SF and consistently showed the three-year mean position was stable and constrained by the bathymetry of the continental slope. Seasonally, the front moved inshore during summer. The temperature gradient across the front was strongest and the front narrowest in winter. The decrease in SST gradient during the three-year data set coincided with the decrease in Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

TI The EOS prototype validation exercise (PROVE) at Jornada: Overview and
   lessons learned
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Tho forth Observing System (EOS) instrument teams must validate the operational products they produce from the Terra spacecraft data. As a pilot for future validation activities, four EOS teams (MODIS, MISR, ASTER, and Landsat-7) and community experts conducted an Il-dar field campaign in May 1997 near Las Cruces, NM. The goals of the Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) included (1) gaining experience in the collection and use of field data for EOS product validation; (2) developing coordination, measurement, and data-archiving protocols; and (3) compiling a synoptic land and atmospheric data set for testing algorithms. PROVE was held at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service's (ARS) Jornada Experimental Range, an expansive desert plateau hosting a complex mosaic of grasses and shrubs. Most macroscopic variables affecting the radiation environment were measured with ground air-borne (including AVIRIS and laser altimeter), and space-borne sensors (including AVHRR, Landsat TM SPOT, POLDER, and GOES). The Oak Ridge Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) then used campaign data sets to prototype Mercury, its Internet-based data harvesting and distribution system. This article provides general information about PROVE and assesses the progress made toward the campaign goat. Primary successes included the rapid campaign formulation and execution, measurement protocol development, and the significant collection, reduction, and sharing of data among participants. However, the PROVE data were used primarily for arid-la nd research and model validation rather than for validating satellite products, and the data were slow; to reach the DAAC and hence public domain. The lessons learned included: (1) validation campaigns can be rapidly organized and implemented if there are focused objectives and on-site facilities and expertise; (2) data needs, organization, storage, and access issues must be addressed at the onset of campaign planning; and (3) the end-to-end data collection, release, and publication environment may need to be readdressed by program managers, funding agencies, and journal editors if rapid and comprehensive validation of operational satellite products is to occur Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Immediate and accurate detection of airborne volcanic ash is an operational imperative of the aviation industry, especially jet aircraft. Ash encounters place passengers aboard these aircraft at severe risk and significantly impact, via forced rerouting, both the safety and profit margins of freight carriers due to their limited fuel supply. Moreover the airlines can suffer high economic costs for repair and -replacement of equipment. Operational detection. and tracking of volcanic ash by most national weather services has relied heavily on a split window differencing technique of thermal longwave infrared channels on currently operational satellites. Unfortunately, prior work on volcanic ash defection has not emphasised the dynamical interaction between the erupting volcano and the effects of overlying atmospheric Lr;ater vapor phreatic and phreatomagmatic water sources. Six volcanic ash eruptions from around the globe were chosen for study because they have wide variation in ambient atmospheric water vapor, available ground and surface water and different magma types. Results show that the present differencing technique is not uniformly effective in properly classifying volcanic ash pixels in the satellite scene and often falsely interprets meteorological clouds as volcanic ash clouds and conversely. Moreover it is not always a robust early detector, an operational aviation requirement. Seasonal variability in global integrated atmospheric water vapor coupled with the geographical distribution of currently active volcanoes, suggests the concerns discussed herein with regard to six specific eruptions, have applicability to the global aviation industry. Operational implications are discussed and a strategic proposal is presented on necessary steps to improve detection. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This study investigated the use of a semiempirical land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to derive surface spectral albedo and correct for angular effects on remotely sensed images. The Ambrals RossThick-LiSparse BRDF model has been applied to a 31-day multiangular data of daily global area coverage (GAC) images over South America in July 1987. A BRDF-based angle-corrected normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image was generated along with corresponding images of land surface albedo in the visible and near-infrared bands, computed from the BRDF model parameters retrieved. For comparison, the monthly maximum value NDVI image and the land surface visible and near-infrared albedo images were created based on the corresponding single reflectance observations. Visual evaluation and histogram analysis of these images shore evident differences between the surface spectral albedo images produced by the Ambrals BRDF nzodel and those by the Lambertian conventional approach, and between the angle-corrected NDVI image and the monthly composite NDVI image. These differences were further explored fur the area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) in Amazonia. Results indicate that 1) the angle-corrected NDVI is an improvement over the monthly maximum value NDVI with more consistency with surface properties, such as land cover type and vegetation height, and 2) the surface spectral albedo values calculated by the Ambrals BRDF model are In better agreement with these surface characterizations than the albedo values derived from a maximum-value composited reflectance. Due to limitations inherent in the AVHRR data, especially with respect to atl,atmospheric correction, the results obtained are considered primarily as indicative of what will be possible with the global data sets to be obtained by NASA's MODIS and MISR sensors in the near future, illustrating the potential of rising a surface BRDF model for advanced earth system studies.

AB The sea surface temperature (SST) variability over the tropical Indian Ocean is studied for the period January 1988 to December 1992 using the multichannel sea surface temperature (MCSST) from the NOAA series of satellites. The MCSST values were found to agree reasonably well with the Reynolds and Smith (1994) data for the same period, but the anomalies were found to differ significantly. An interesting result is the influence of the Somalia coast zonal anomaly of SST (SCZASST) and central Indian Ocean zonal anomaly of SST (CIOZASST) with the monsoon rainfall over different meteorological subdivisions of the Indian subcontinent. The SCZASST is negatively and significantly correlated with the monsoon rainfall over the western and central parts of India, while CIOZASST is positively and significantly correlated.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over part of the Yuma Desert in southwestern Arizona demonstrate the ability of C-band (5.7-cm wavelength), L-band (24.5 cm), and P-band (68 cm) AIRSAR signals to backscatter from increasingly greater depths reaching several meters in blow sand and sandy alluvium. AIRSAR images obtained within the Barry M. Goldwater Bombing and Gunnery Range near Yuma, Arizona, show a total reversal of C- and P-band backscatter contrast (image tone) for three distinct geologic units. This phenomenon results from an increasingly greater depth of radar imaging with increasing radar wavelength. In the case of sandy- and small pebble-alluvium surfaces mantled by up to several meters of blow sand, backscatter increases directly with SAR wavelength as a result of volume scattering front a calcic soil horizon at shallow depth and by volume scattering from the root mounds of healthy desert vegetation that locally stabilize blow sand. AIRSAR images obtained within the military range are also shown to be useful for detecting metallic military ordnance debris that is located either at the surface or covered by tens of centimeters to several meters of blow sand. The degree of detectability of this ordnance increases with SAR wavelength and is clearly maximized on P-band images that are processed in the cross-polarized mode (HV). This effect is attributed to maximum signal penetration at P-band and the enhanced PHV image contrast between the radar-bright ordnance debris and the radar-dark sandy desert. This article focuses on the interpretation of high resolution AIRSAR images but also compares these airborne SAR images with those acquired front spacecraft sensors such as ERS-SAR and Space Radar Laboratory (SIR-C/X-SAR).

AB Correction of time series of Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) short-wave reflectances for directional effects is investigated for four semiarid Australian sites. Two contrasting models for the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which satisfy the reciprocity condition, are fitted to all cloud-free observations within a sliding window centered on the current time. The window length is adaptive, but typically is between 10 and 20 days, corresponding to one or two repeat cycles of the polar orbiting meteorological satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Observations within the window include satellite elevations ranging from one horizon to the other, so that the parameters of the BRDF models are well determined. In cloudy conditions the algorithm allows the time window to be extended in small steps up to an upper limit in order to secure sufficient data to fix the parameters of the model. For the test sites examined, the algorithm appears to be robust. Once the BRDF has been estimated, times series of reflectances at the top of the atmosphere are calculated for an observer at zenith and the Sun at fixed elevation. The corrected time series of reflectances are consistent and reveal structure not apparent in the raw data. In particular, time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from the BRDF-corrected reflectances show the rapid response of the fitted BRDF is validated for one of the test sites by comparing reflectances observed by the visible channel of the Visible and Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) on the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) against reflectances predicted by the BRDF model. The correction between the two sets of reflectances is excellent. Because GMS samples regions of the angular domain not seen by AVHRR, the high correlation confirms that the BRDF is well represented by the model based on AVHRR data, even for geometries unsampled by AVHRR.

AB Valid estimates of sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite data [e.g., the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR)] are critically dependent upon the identification and removal of cloud from the data, but few cloud-screening algorithms for ATSR data have appeared in the literature. A new algorithm, the ATSR Split-and-Merge Clustering (ATSR/SMC) algorithm, for cloud masking ATSR data Is presented which evaluates every pixol in the image, is statistically reproducible, computationally efficient, and requires no knowledge of cloud type. Moreover it is effective in detecting multilayer cloud structures in a scene, which is a difficult task because such systems generally have bimodal statistical distributions, It also accurately detects glint radiance, which is quite common in at least one of the 1.6 mu m views, subpixel cloud contamination near-cloud boundaries and low-lying marine stratiform cloud. Historically, these issues have interfered with ATSR-based SST retrieval [see the work of Jones et al., (1996a,b) and the references cited therin]. The SSTs derived from. the cloud-free ocean pixels were validated with 96 buoy observations and the mean difference (buoy-SST) was +0.24 degrees C+/-0.51 degrees C. For the 103 pails of images (forward/nadir views) tested, the mean 11 mu m BTs that result from SADIST (standard ATSR processing) cs. ATSR/SMC cloud detection are 0.4 degrees C (daytime) and 0.6 degrees C (nighttime) colder for SADIST than for ATSR/SMC, even though the SADIST cloud masks generally overdetect clouds relative to ATSR/SMC cloud masks. These results, plus others discussed in the test, support the conclusion that the new procedure produces cloud masks which are superior to the standard ATSR operational, cloud mask product and it retains substantially more valid pixels. The algorithm can be used in tropical and midlatitude regions. It is not designed to detect sea ice, and consequently should not be used in polar regions. Finally, the approach call easily be adapted to ATSR-2 data and to other darn to be taken from soon to be launched sensors. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Because trees at-e geotropic (perpendicular to the geoid), topography has no control over the Sun-crown geometry. What topography does influence is the relative positioning of trees and thus the amount of shadowing cast by them within the canopy. As satellite sensors in general measure the collective radiance of many trees ino side their-instantaneous field of view, the overall canopy brightness at the pixel scale is strongly controlled by canopy shadowing and hence by the topography. The removal of or compensation for topographic effects on forest images should be based on the normalization of mutual shadowing at the subpixel scale, rather than on the normalization of Sun-terrain-sensor geometry at the pixel scale. The Sun-canopy-sensor (SCS) topographic correction model was developed to characterize and hence correct the topographic effects on forest images. Testing with simulated image data showed the SCS model to be accurate (root-mean-squared residual error <0.1) for forest canopies of 50% or higher closure, and testing with Landsat Thematic Mapper images showed;ecl that it consistently performs either slightly or significantly better than the widely applied cosine correction, the c-correction and the Minnaert correction models, for forests tinder different imaging conditions.

ID BIODIVERSITY
AB A thresholding technique was used to convert a prototype ''city lights'' data set from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center (NOAA/NGDC) into a map of ''urban areas'' for the continental United States. Thresholding was required to adapt the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS)-based NGDC data set into an urban map because the values reported in the prototype represent a a cumulative percentage lighted for each pixel extracted from hundreds of nighttime cloud-screened orbits, rather than any suitable land-cover classification. The cumulative percentage lighted data could not be used alone because the very high gain of the OLS nighttime photomultiplier configuration can bad to a pixel (2.7 x 2.7 km) appearing ''lighted'' even with very low intensity, nonurban Eight sources. We found that a threshold of greater than or equal to 89% yielded the best results, removing ephemeral light sources and ''blooming'' of light onto water when adjacent to cities while still leaving the dense urban core intact. This approach gave very good results wizen compared with the urban areas as defined by the 1990 U. S. Census; the ''urban'' area from our analysis being only 5% less than that of the Census. The Census was also used to derive population- and housing-density statistics for the continent-wide ''city lights'' analysis; these averaged 1033 persons/km(2) and 426 housing units/km(2), respectively The use of a nighttime sensor to determine the location and estimate the density of population based on light sources has proved feasible in this exploratory effort. However issues concerning the use of census data as a benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of remotely sensed imagery are discussed and potential improvements in the sensor regarding spatial resolution, instrument gain and pointing accuracy are addressed.

TI Modeling forest canopy heights: The effects of canopy shape
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AIRBORNE LASER DATA
AB Three-dimensional models that represent the top-of-canopy forest height structure were developed to simulate airborne laser profiling responses along forested transects. The simulator which produced these 3-D models constructed individual tree crowns according to a tree's total height, height to first branch, crown diameter, and crown shape (cone, parabola, ellipse, sphere, or a random assortment of these shapes), and then inserted these crowns into a fixed-area plot using mapped stand (x,y) coordinates. This two-dimensional array of forest canopy heights was randomly transected to simulate measurements made by an airborne ranging laser. These simulated laser measurements were regressed with ground reference measures to develop predictive linear relationships. The assumed crown shape had a significant impact on 1) simulated laser measurements of height and 2) estimates of basal area, woody volume, and above-ground dry biomass derived via simulation. As canopy shape progressed from a conic form to a more spheric structure, average canopy height, canopy profile area, and canopy volume increased, canopy height variation decreased, and coefficients of variability were stable or decreased. In Costa Rican tropical forests, simulated laser measurements of average height, canopy profile area, and canopy volume increased 8-10% when a parabolic rather than a conic shape was assumed. An elliptic canopy was 16-18% taller, on average, than a conic canopy, and a spheric canopy was 23-25% taller. The effect of these height increases and height variability changes can profoundly affect basal area, volume, and biomass estimates, but the degree to which these estimates are affected is study-area-dependent. Since canopy shape may significantly affect such estimates, canopy shapes should be noted when field data are collected for purposes of height simulation. If canopy shapes are not noted and are unknown, an assumption of an elliptical shape is suggested in order to mitigate potentially large errors which may be incurred using a generic assumption of a cone or sphere.

AB Temporal compositing of daily optical satellite data has become an accepted methodology for obtaining frequent images of large areas for studies of the land surface. However, such composite data sets sometimes contain large ''artifacts'' (i.e., errors due to sources unrelated to the land surface itself). The goal of this study was to develop a series of operations and algorithms that would identify and remove as many of these errors as possible. The specific objective was to obtain, every ten days, surface reflectance in advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) channels 1 and 2 and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-all referenced to a constant viewing geometry-and surface temperature. The processing steps of the resulting methodology, dubbed ''ABC3'' for atmospheric, bidirectional, and contamination corrections of the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS), includes atmospheric corrections; the identification of pixels ''contaminated'' by clouds, snow (including subpixel), and shadows from optically thick clouds; bidirectional reflectance and thermal emissivity corrections; and the replacement of the contaminated pixels in the composites through interpolation. The resulting procedures yield surface reflectance and NDVI fully corrected for bidirectional effects; a version of NDVI corrected for solar zenith only; and surface temperature corrected for atmospheric and surface emissivity effects. An evaluation of the resulting data set shows that the procedures provide significantly improved data products compared with the raw composites, but they do not approximate a single-date image sufficiently closely, especially for AVHRR channel 1, whose reflectance values are generally low. This is attributed to the limitations of the input data and knowledge of atmospheric (and partly bidirectional) characteristics applicable to each composite pixel. (C) Government of Canada, 1997.

AB This article reports observations made in a sea coastal zone by an airborne X-band SAR. This zone includes a basin connected to the sea and the vicinity of the Rhone river estuary. We present the experiment and the data processing procedures including, in particular, a method for removing speckle effects from image spectra of waves. Observations of slick patterns in the basin are reported and used to relate their spatial distribution to features of the circulation as predicted by modelling. Then, we present the wave phenomena observed at sea. Off-shore, the observation are found to be consistent with actual wine conditions. Differences in wave visibility between the images are discussed using the ocean wave SAR imaging theory. The significant wave height is calculated from the image presenting the best geometry for wave detection. Along the coast, the wave transformations observed are discussed on the basis of the results of a simple wave model initialized by the main wave parameters measured off-shore. The complicated refraction effects predicted by the model can only be partially detected on the radar images because of the geometry of the observations. Finally, a frontal event is detected and interpreted as the signature of the boundary of the river plume. The wave-current model of Skop and Leipold (1988) explains the brightness of the radar signature of the front. Among other results, the conclusion emphasizes the good adequation of airborne SAR systems for remote sensing of the coastal environment.

AB A synthetic aperture radar ERS-1 scene, used to complement a Landsat TM scene, allows better understanding of the structure of the active Ovacik fault, southwest of Erzincan (Turkey). The radar image shows that the Ovacik fault is interrupted at its crossing point with the Kemaliye fault. Recent compressive displacements have reactivated the Kemaliye fault, while a pull-apart basin has been generated along the Ovacik fault. Estimates of offsets of major rivers and analysis of the complex fault geometry give an estimated left-lateral strike slip displacement of 12.5-20 km along the Ovacik fault for the last 13 Ma, which is similar to the rate of movement along the East Anatolian fault located in the east and forming the boundary of the Turkish plate.

AB A two-stream description of the interaction of radiation with vegetation and soil is tested with experimental data for a corn canopy. The results indicate that the two parameters of the theory (reflectance of a dense canopy and the attenuation coefficient for radiation in the canopy) can be estimated for the Thematic Mapper spectral bands. A collection of soil reflectance data is used to develop relationships between near-infrared reflectance and visible reflectances. Jointly the canopy and soil formulations verify the potential for estimating leaf area index from radiation measurements in the visible and near-infrared.

AB a case study is presented for convective systems over the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. The study is carried out using Defense Meteorological Satellite program (DMSP) operational Line Scanner (OLS) data plus concurrent Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data as well as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data and concurrent TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) data. This example demonstrates some of the advantages and limitations of combing data from multiple satellites and sensors in describing meteorological phenomena in data sparse regions. Specifically, analysis of the DMSP OLS and SSM/I data show that cloud fronts precede moisture fronts by tens of kilometers and that regions of large cloud liquid water (>1.5 kg m-2) are located in the center of the tropical depressions where cloud top temperatures are less than -40-degrees-C. Regions of large cloud liquid water are also observed along the occluded front but are not closely associated with cold cloud-top temperatures. The total precipitable water vapor retrievals from the TOVS sensor are able to detect the extreme meteorological conditions associated with a developing tropical depression, but overall differ in both pattern and magnitude from those of the SSM/I.

AB The remote sensing of the land-surface energy balance and soil moisture using satellite surface 'skin' temperature measurements has long been a topic of investigation in the research community. Despite considerable progress in understanding and techniques, there are still serious limitations in the results obtainable using satellite measurements for both the surface fluxes and soil moisture which need to be addressed via improved measurements and methods. We detail in this work a simulation study investigating the remote sensing of the land-surface energy balance using information from the High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS), an instrument being considered for launch on a future series of geostationary satellites. The study is accomplished using simulated HIS data that are generated using atmospheric radiative transfer models specific to the HIS applied to the output of a forecast model of the planetary boundary layer, which predicts temporal changes in skin temperature and atmospheric structure based on the surface fluxes. In this study, we find that the ability of the instrument to measure temporal changes of radiances that arise from time changes in the structure of the planetary boundary layer, as well as skin temperature changes, mitigates some Of the problems associated with using skin temperatures alone to estimate the surface energy balance.

ID ERUPTION; SENSOR; FLOW
AB We investigate the influence of viewing geometry and dynamic range of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on detecting eruptions on Poorly monitored volcanoes. Numerical models of sun-warmed flows and typical active features associated with Hawaiian eruptions (overturning lava lakes, surface flows of three different sizes, and lava tubes with skylights) show that new lava flows at approximately 1000-degrees-C can be identified at all scan angles if the area of the activity exceeds approximately 60 m2 given a background temperature of 20-degrees-C. More difficult is the detection of small breakouts of lava flows or tube-fed flows when these features lie towards the edge of the swath; because of the dynamic range and gain setting of the sensor (Bands 3, 4, and 5 saturate at approximately 49-degrees-C) it is possible that similar thermal signatures may be produced when inactive flows are heated by the Sun. The ability of the AVHRR to detect on-going activity in Hawaii in July 1991 is tested by comparing Landsat Thematic Mapper and nadir AVHRR scenes obtained within approximately 3.5 hours of each other. For an active pahoehoe flow field with a well-developed tube system, this comparison shows that within the area of thermally alarmed AVHRR pixels < 5 % of the TM midinfrared pixels had elevated data values, indicating the relatively small size of the surface activity. An off-nadir AVHRR scene acquired 47.5 h later is used to illustrate the effect of increased pixel size when viewing subpixel hot spots.

ID ROUGH-SURFACE; SCATTERING
AB The boundary perturbation method is applied to a numerical comparison of active and passive microwave signatures for fully developed sea conditions described by a classical sea surface displacement spectrum with one degree of freedom, and for nonfully developed sea conditions described by a new displacement spectrum, with three degrees of freedom. It is shown that altimeters and scatterometers at low incidences are rather sensitive to the sea state development, and in particular to the significant slope, while scatterometers at high incidences and radiometers are much las, except for wave tank conditions.

AB Bright P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) returns from red pine forests were observed on SAR images taken in the area of Bangor, Maine. A plot of red pine trees in the University of Maine research forest was selected for the characterization and modeling. The purpose of this effort was to understand the cause of the high P-band returns. The red pine stand under study consisted of mature trees with an average height of 25 ms and diameters at breast height (DBH) of 28-38 cm. Soil moisture and soil bulk density measurements were made along with ground rough surface profiles. A tree was cut down in such a manner to keep its crown completely intact. Detailed biomass measurements of the needles, branches and trunks were also made. These site statistics have been used in a distorted Born approximation model of the forest stand. Computations indicate that the direct-reflected contributions from the ground are responsible for the high P-band HH observed returns. Tapered tree trunks have been used in the model to improve the accuracy of the direct-reflected calculation. The high P-band returns from red pine contrast with the results from previous studies of a hemlock forest in the area, which have lower P-band returns mainly due to backscattering from branches.

ID REFLECTANCES; ECOSYSTEM; FIFE
AB Calibrated radiance data were acquired with three airborne sensor systems on 8 September 1990 over a northern forest as part of the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Multisensor Aircraft Campaign. The spectral data were acquired nearly simultaneously under extremely clear sky conditions with NASA's AVIRIS and ASAS imaging spectroradiometers, and an SE-590 spectroradiometer mounted on a NASA UH-1B helicopter. After atmospheric corrections were applied to these data, intercomparisons Of nadir reflectance factor measurements from each of these sensors were made for four important vegetation communities including a bog and individual forest stands dominated by spruce (Picea sp.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and mixed northern hardwoods (dominated by Acer sp., Populus sp., and Betula sp.), respectively. The reflectance factor spectra from the different instruments were comparable for each of these cover types, suggesting the possible interchangeable use of the three datasets over comparable wavelength regions. These comparisons also serve to graphically illustrate the importance of applying atmospheric corrections to such data, even if acquired under extremely clear sky conditions. This remote sensing data set appears suitable for assessing the applicability of multistage, multisensor data in large-scale ecological research.

AB Induction kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence (the Kautsky effect) and delayed fluorescence (DF) of some cold climate species were studied in both laboratory and in situ experiments to assess their vlaue as indicators of plant health. Experiments included studies of natural variability of fluorescence in connection with the seasonal leaf maturation process, as well as the influence of environmental stress factors, such as ozone. It was found that parameters of induction curves (normalized variable fluorescence, time of its half decrease) could be used as indicators of plant health. No significant differences have been elicited between the information content of the Kautsky effect and induction curves of DF as tools for remote sensing. It is suggested that measurements of the single decay curves of DF are preferable for remote estimation of photosynthetic capacity.

AB Laser-induced red chlorophyll fluorescence spectra of rice leaves were studied using a Jobin Yvon double monochromator. An He-Ne laser was used as the excitation source, and in vivo fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 nm in the 650-800 nm range. The fluorescence spectra shows the broad band at 690 nm, with the usually observed broad band around 735 nm resolved into three prominent bands at 725 nm, 745 nm, and 750 nm. In addition, a new band has been observed at 705 nm. The fluorescence induction kinetics (Kautsky effect) were measured at 690 nm, 705 nm, and 725 nm, and the plant vitality index Rfd and the ratios Of fluorescence intensities F690/F705 and F690/F725 were determined for rice grown under normal and nutrient deficient conditions. The results show that the Rfd values and the fluorescence intensity ratios related to the 705 nm band also has great potential for remote sensing stress effects in plants.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Reflectance spectra at the boundary between the visible and near-infrared reflectance in the domain of the so-called ''red edge' (660-770 nm) were examined over triticale canopy in a two-factor field experiment. The objective was to study changes in the red edge position and shape as a function of developmental stage, cultivar, and plant density. The experimental design involved six cultivars and three plant densities with three replications. Eight spectrometric measurements with 10-nm steps were taken from the moment of breaking winter dormancy until soft dough stage at approximately 2-week intervals. Numerical differentiation of spectra (preapproximated by a cubic spline function) was used to locate the red edge. Three components corresponding to maxima in the rate of increase in reflectance have been resolved in the curve of the first derivative on the average at 700 nm, 715 nm, and 745 nm. The features of the components showed no dependence on the cultivar and sowing rate but varied with plant maturation. At the vegetative stage, the first two components moved to longer wavelengths (a shift of about 5 nm), at the reproductive stage to shorter ones. The peak at 745 nm showed the opposite direction Of movement: from 746-747 nm in early season to 743 nm at heading and towards the longer wavelengths by the late season.  Throughout the growing season this peak continued to be the highest one. The results have confirmed that the red edge of the vegetation reflectance spectrum is a complex contour composed of a number of components the peakedness and relative positions Of which vary according to the plant growth stage.

AB The spectral transmittance of pure liquid water was measured using reflectance spectroscopy to provide a physical standard of comparison for the spectral reflectance of leaves. The spectral reflectance of a white reference measured through a 356 mum ray pathlength of water compared favorably with values predicted for the same pathlength by the known absorption coefficients of water. Differences between predicted and measured reflectances were significant only near wavelengths of 1400 nm and in the 1965-2200 nm range. The maximum difference of 7% occurred at 1401 nm. Predicted reflectances indicated notable reflectance minima at wavelengths near 1450 nm, 1940 nm, and 2500 nm, even for a 5-mum ray pathlength. Predicted reflectances at wavelengths less than 900 nm remained approximately 100% for a 3160 mum pathlength. A method is provided by which leaf reflectance in the 1500-2500 nm range can be used to easily compute the radiative-equivalent water thickness (REWT) of leaves. The REWT is defined as the thickness (absorption pathlength) of pure liquid water that would be required to yield the same radiative properties as the leaf in the 1500-2500 nm range, and is a physical standard that may be used in the study of leaf infrared reflectance.

AB SPOT XS oblique data are compared with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) vertical data at two different times. Under the assumption that analogous spectral bands are equivalent, the differences in spectral responses observed over land cover classes are attributed to the effects of angular anisotropic reflection. This article shows that land cover classes cannot easily be characterized by their anisotropy. The magnitude of anisotropy varies strongly with the radiometric processing levels (i.e., absolute calibration or normalization) but has no significant impact on the overall classification results. The normalization method based on the use of pseudoinvariant objects is sufficiently effective as to correct most anisotropic disturbances and should facilitate an alternative use of SPOT and TM data.

ID REFLECTANCE; ABUNDANCE; DESERTS
AB An Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image collected over the jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, California on 20 September 1989 was analyzed using spectral mixture analysis. The scene was calibrated to reflectance assuming a homogeneous atmosphere. The image was modeled initially as linear mixtures of the minimum number of reference endmember spectra that accounted for the maximum spectral variability. Over 98% of the spectral variation was explained by linear mixtures of three endmembers: green vegetation, shade, and soil. Additional spectral variation appeared as residuals. Nonlinear mixing was expressed as variations in the fraction of each endmember when a linear mixing model was applied to spectral subsets of the entire spectrum. After the fractions of the endmember spectra were calculated for each pixel, different types of soil were discriminated by the residual spectra. Nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) (e.g., dry grass, leaf litter, and woody material), which could not be distinguished from soil when included as an endmember, was discriminated by residual spectra that contained cellulose and lignin absorptions. Distinct communities of green vegetation were distinguished by 1) nonlinear mixing effects caused by transmission and scattering by green leaves, 2) variations in a derived canopy-shade spectrum, and 3) the fraction of NPV. The results of the image analysis, supported by field observations in 1990 and 1991, indicate that the multiple bands of AVIRIS enhance discrimination of NPV from soil, and the separation of different types of green vegetation. The ability of the system to measure narrow absorption bands is one important factor, however, also important is the variation in continuum spectra expressed by the endmembers, and characteristic nonlinear mixing effects associated with green leaves.

AB Spectral-biophysical functional relations that hold across experiments and environments are needed for economically important crops. Thus, reflectance factors and leaf area index (LAI) measurements for sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] experiments conducted at Bushland, Texas (102.2-degrees-W, 35.2-degrees-N), Lubbock, Texas (101.8-degrees-W, 33.7-degrees-N), and Weslaco, Texas (98.0-degrees-W, 26.2-degrees-N) over a 7-year period were related using two-parameter power and exponential equations for four common vegetation indices (VI): normalized difference (NDVI), perpendicular (PVI), near-infrared to red ratio (RVI), and transformed soil-adjusted (TSAVI). The objective was to produce recommendable empirical equations for estimating LAI of sorghum from spectral vegetation indices using observations pooled across locations. During both the pre- and post-maximum leaf area index portions of the growing season, power and exponential forms were equally good for estimating LAI from TSAVI and NDVI and gave coefficients of determination, R2, that ranged from 0.76 to 0.83. However, for PVI and RVI the relations were not as nonlinear and the power form accounted for more of the variation (R2 = 0.74-0.82) than the exponential form (R2 = 0.69-0.78). Infinite reflectance for sorghum was estimated from the pooled data to be 4.0% in the RED band and 49.7% in the NIR band. Coefficients of exponential relations for sorghum were similar to those for corn reported earlier. Although soils, agronomic treatments, sun angles, and instruments differed among locations, it was possible to develop general relations for estimating leaf area of sorghum from four of the most commonly used spectral vegetation indices.

AB We tested the capabilities of high-ground-resolution satellite imagery data (10-20 m) in the scope of detailed geological mapping, at the 1:25,000 scale.  We present a geological map derived from SPOT 1 imagery, covering a part of a petroleum exploration permit area located in southeastern France.  The geological information is rich and more detailed than on the other maps existing for this area (derived from fieldwork or other remote sensing data, especially concerning small faults, dips, new subdivisions in the lithologic facies, and the like.
   This precise analysis enables to choose a new interpretation concerning the structure of the oil-bearing rocks.

TI NONPARAMETRIC MODELING OF RADIANCE IN HILL COUNTRY FOR DIGITAL
   CLASSIFICATION OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID REMOTELY SENSED DATA
AB This article presents a method to account for topographic, lens falloff, and hot-spot effects when digitally classifying an aerial photograph.  Nonparametric models of radiance have been used in conjuction with a Skidmore-Turner classifier to improve classification accuracy.  Without the nonparametric models, the Skidmore-Turner classifier achieves an overall 76% classification accuracy of a test image.  This is increased to 91% when nonparametric models, using independent variables, view vector, and cosine of incidence angle, are combined with the Skidmore-Turner classifier.  Although there is a significant improvement in accuracy, the predominant improvement seems to come from the nonparametric models effectively giving spatially local a priori probabilities rather than from a purely geometric modeling of radiance.

AB The leaf area index (LAI, total area of leaves per unit area of ground) of most forest canopies varies throughout the year, yet for logistical reasons it is difficult to estimate anything more detailed than an annual average LAI.  To determine if remotely sensed data can be used to estimate LAI at times throughout the year (herein termed seasonal LAI), field measurements of LAI were compared to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, derived using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, for 16 fertilized and control slash pine plots on three dates.  Linear relationships existed between NDVI and LAI with R2 values of 0.35, 0.75, and 0.86 for February 1988, September 1988, and March 1989, respectively.  Predictive relationships based on data from eight of the plots were used to estimate the LAI of the other eight plots with a root-mean-square error of 0.74 LAI, which is 15.6% of the mean LAI.  This demonstrates the potential use of Landsat TM data for studying seasonal dynamics in forest canopies.

AB Classifications of remotely sensed data contain misclassification errors that bias areal estimates.  Monte Carlo techniques were used to compare two statistical methods that correct or calibrate remotely sensed areal estimates for misclassification bias using reference data from an error matrix.  The inverse calibration estimator was consistently superior to the classical estimator using a simple random sample of reference plots.  The effects of sample size of reference plots, detail of the classification system, and classification accuracy on the precision of the inverse estimator are discussed.  If reference plots are a simple random sample of the study area, then a total sample size of 500-1000 independent reference plots is recommended for calibration.

TI ESTIMATION OF SOIL PROPERTIES AND WHEAT YIELDS ON COMPLEX ERODED HILLS
   USING GEOSTATISTICS AND THEMATIC MAPPER IMAGES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; REGION
AB Better assessment of large scale patterns in soil fertility, erosion, and crop productivity is needed to address environmental concerns in the steeply rolling dryland farming region of eastern Washington. Spatial variability of organic carbon, soil phosphorus, and wheat yields measured on several 655 m long transects in complex eroded hills of the Palouse region of eastern Washington was studied using classical statistics and geostatistics. In addition, Landsat Thematic Mapper images of bare soil at the study site were used to estimate organic matter content in blocks having an area of 28.5 m x 28.5 m. Classical statistical analysis showed moderate coefficients of variation in soil properties (25-50%) and wheat yields (30%). Spherical semivariograms of soil properties and wheat yields showed strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence on the order of from 70 m to 145 m. The semivariogram for Landsat estimated organic matter was almost identical to that for organic matter measured in the surface transects. The cross-semivariogram between measured organic matter and wheat yields also exhibited strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence of about 120 m. Organic matter, soil phosphorus, and wheat yield were interpolated at unsampled locations using block kriging and block cokriging techniques. Excellent agreement was obtained between kriged wheat yields and wheat yields cokriged from Thematic Mapper estimates of organic matter. Satisfactory agreement was obtained between kriged soil phosphorus and cokriged soil phosphorus based upon remotely sensed organic matter. Results of this study provided strong evidence for nonrandom spatial patterns in soil properties and crop yields. These spatial patterns are associated with changes in surface organic matter content across the landscape resulting from extensive erosion and exposure of subsoil. Geostatistical techniques provide a powerful tool for interpolating ground measurements of soil properties and crop yield over large areas in combination with estimates of organic matter obtained from Thematic Mapper images.

AB Linear approximations of apparent reflectance outside the atmosphere can be used to describe most of the observed atmospherically induced variation even at nominal optical depths of the order of unity. These approximations are employed to explicitly illustrate the information content of simulated (monochromatic) satellite reflectance measurements computed for a variety of urban and continental aerosol models. The aerosol models contain mixtures of absorbing soots, hydroscopic nitrate, and sulfate salts and nonhydroscopic dustlike particles. An inversion methodology for extracting generic aerosol parameters (scattering optical depth and single scattering albedo) as well as associated pollutant abundances (sulfates and carbonaceous soot) is evaluated and the error budget determined in terms of simple analytical expressions.

TI GROUND-BASED X-BAND (3-CM WAVE) RADAR BACKSCATTERING OF AGRICULTURAL
   CROPS .1. SUGAR-BEET AND POTATO - BACKSCATTERING AND CROP GROWTH
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Six years of ground-based radar observations were used to study backscattering influencing factors of agricultural crops.  The X-band, 3 cm wavelength, radar backscattering of the sugar beet and the potato was studied at vertical and horizontal like-polarization and at several angles of incidence.  For both crops the backscattering increased with crop growth until a saturation level was reached at about 80% soil cover.  The average radar backscattering of a closed sugar beet canopy varied between - 2 db and 0 dB at all angles of incidence.  The average backscattering of potato ranged from - 2 dB to 0 dB at 20-degrees incidence angle, to - 7 dB to - 5 dB at 70-degrees incidence angle.  The geometry of the crop-soil system was an important backscattering influencing factor.  In the potato, the orientation of the ridges with respect to the incident radar beam dominated the backscattering in the early growing season.  The architecture of individual beet plants and their distribution in space affected the radar backscatter of the sugar beet.  For both the beet and potato, changes in the canopy architecture due to strong winds affected the radar backscattering by 1-2 dB.

AB As the majority of active fire detection algorithms have been developed for worldwide applications using only satellite data without considering observing conditions and environmental factors, their performance varies regionally. This study investigates the viability of an adaptable active fire detection model that is applicable to diverse environmental and observing conditions by fusing numerical model data and satellite images. The model was developed for various land cover and climate types using commonly utilized brightness temperature-related variables (key variables) and supporting variables (sub-variables), including solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle (SAZ), relative humidity (RH), and skin temperature. A dual-module (DM) convolutional neural network (CNN) structure was adopted to consider the different properties of key variables and sub-variables, and a control without sub-variables was used to assess the impact of observing and environmental variables. The proposed model was further evaluated using existing polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite-based active fire products. The recall and precision of the control model were 0.80 and 0.98, respectively, and the standard deviation of recall for the five focus sites was 0.140. However, the DM CNN model was notable for its higher recall and robustness compared to the control model (recall of 0.84, precision of 0.97, and standard deviation of recall of 0.126). High RH and SAZ, and the day-night transition period contributed to the poor performance of the control model which was mitigated by the DM CNN model. In particular, the use of RH improved the recall of the model, and SAZ contributed to the reduction of performance variation. Our model also outperformed the two geostationary satellite-based active fire products in terms of detection capacity, resulting in a spatial distribution of active fires similar to that of polar-orbiting satellite-based active fire products.

AB Understanding the optical properties of leaves is of great importance for characterizing the relationships between leaf traits and remote sensing signals. The relationship between biochemical parameters and leaf spectral reflection has been widely established through PROSPECT, while surface structural parameters can be linked to leaf multi-angular reflection through Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) models. However, it's still challenging to characterize how leaf spectra response changes with different illumination and viewing geometries, in connection to both biochemical and surface structural traits. To address this challenge, we propose the model PROSPECULAR, which combines PROSPECT with a specular function determined by illuminationviewing geometry parameters, wavelength-dependent refractive index, and roughness. This model simulates spectral and multi-angular BRF and retrieves both leaf biochemical and surface structural parameters. The PROSPECULAR accounts for the wavelength dependence of the leaf surface refractive index in the specular function and separates the specular reflection from PROSPECT in the diffuse component calculation. The accuracy of PROSPECULAR's spectral simulation was assessed using a multi-angular dataset measured in the hemispherical space (42 viewing zenith angles (VZAs) at 20-50. source zenith angles (SZAs)). Then, the inversion accuracy of PROSPECULAR was validated using a multi-angular dataset measured in the principal plane (13 VZAs and 20-50 degrees SZAs). The results showed that PROSPECULAR was able to simulate multi-angular BRF (RRMSE = 16.27%) when SZA was <50 degrees and retrieve a unified set of biochemical parameters for each leaf sample using multi-angular BRF (RMSE of chlorophyll, water, dry matter, protein, and carbon-based constituents were 11.31 mu g/cm(2), 0.0029 g/cm(2), 0.0022 g/cm(2), 0.00096 g/cm(2), and 0.0028 g/cm(2), respectively). The agreement between the calculations and measurements of multi-angular BRF for various plant species indicated that PROSPECULAR is an effective leaf optical model. In contrast, the existing radiative transfer models (PROSPECT, PROCWT, PROCOSINE, and PROSDM) showed varying levels of accuracy in inverting biochemical parameters, depending on the VZA. The advantage of PROSPECULAR is its potential for characterizing both spectral and directional properties of leaves at arbitrary given illumination-viewing geometry and inverting leaf parameters using BRF data from several VZAs in the hemispherical space.

AB Satellite observations in the Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) domain provide valuable information on Land Surface Temperatures, Evapo-Transpiration and water use efficiency and are useful for monitoring vegetation health, agricultural practices and urban planning. By 2030, there will be 3 new high-resolution global coverage satellite TIR missions in space, all of them with fields of view larger than & PLUSMN; 30 degrees. Directional anisotropy in TIR can affect the estimation of key application variables, such as temperature, and are typically studied by means of field campaigns or physical modelling. In this work, we have evaluated directional effects using simultaneous measurements from Landsat-8 and the & PLUSMN; 45 degrees field of view MASTER airborne TIR sensor from NASA. Differences as high as 6 K are observed in the surface temperatures derived from these simultaneous observations. Those differences are attributed to directional effects, with the greatest differences associated with hotspot conditions, where the solar and satellite viewing directions align. Five well studied parametric directional models have then been fitted to the temperature differences, allowing the amplitude of the measured directional effects to be reduced below 1 K, with small variations between models. These results suggest that a simple correction for directional effects could be implemented as part of the ground segment processing for the upcoming missions.

AB Forest fragmentation has been increasingly exacerbated by deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. Monitoring the forest fragments via the lens of tree-crown scale leaf phenology is critical to understand tree species phenological responses to climate change and identify the fragment species vulnerable to environmental disturbance. Despite advances in remote sensing for phenology monitoring, detecting tree-crown scale leaf phenology in fragmented forests remains challenging. Simultaneous tracking of key spring phenological events that are crucial to ecosystem functions and climate change responses is also neglected. To address these challenges, we develop a novel tree-crown scale remote sensing phenological monitoring framework to characterize all the critical spring phenological events of individual trees of deciduous forest fragments, with Trelease Woods in Champaign, Illinois as a case study. The novel framework comprises four components: 1) generate high spatiotemporal resolution fusion imagery from multi-scale satellite time series with a hybrid deep learning fusion model; 2) calibrate PlanetScope imagery time series with fusion data using histogram matching; 3) model tree-crown scale phenology trajectory with a Beck logistic-based method; 4) detect a diversity of treecrown scale phenological events using several phenological metric extraction methods (i.e., threshold- and curve feature-based methods). Combined with weekly in-situ phenological observations of 123 individual trees across 12 broadleaf species from 2017 to 2020, the framework effectively bridges the satellite- and field-based phenological measures for the key spring phenological events (i.e., budswell, budburst, leaf expansion, and leaf maturity events) at the tree-crown scale, particularly for large individuals (RMSE <1 week for most events). Calibration of PlanetScope imagery using multi-scale satellite fusion data in consideration of landscape fragmentation is critical for monitoring tree phenology of forest fragments. Compared to curve feature-based methods, threshold-based phenometric extraction methods demonstrate enhanced capability in detecting spring leaf phenological dynamics of individual trees. Among the phenological events, full leaf out and early leaf expansion events are retrieved with high accuracy using calibrated PlanetScope time series (RMSE from 3 to 5 days and R-squared higher than 0.8). With both intensive satellite and field phenological efforts, this novel framework is at the forefront of interpreting tree-crown scale remotely sensed phenological metrics in the context of biologically meaningful field phenological events in fragmented forest setting.

ID SIGNALS
AB Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has shown a capability in recent years to be applied as a novel remote sensing technique to retrieve ocean wind speeds. The combination of GNSS-R observable delayDoppler maps (DDMs) and deep learning algorithms provides the possibility to build an end-to-end pipeline for improving wind speed estimations. Recent studies have proven that data-driven approaches can be applied to generate enhanced estimation products. However, these are usually trained with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which include inductive bias throughout the models. The inbuilt translation equivariance in CNNs represents an inexactitude for the feature extraction on DDMs. To address this issue, we propose Transformerbased models, named DDM-Former and DDM-Sequence-Former (DDM-Seq-Former), to exploit delay-Doppler correlation within and between DDMs, respectively. The advantages of our methods over conventional retrieval algorithms and other deep learning-based approaches are presented based on the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) version 3.0 dataset. In addition, a comprehensive study on the attention mechanism for our models is demonstrated. The proposed DDM-Former yields the best overall performance with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.43 m/s and a bias of -0.02 m/s over the nine months test period. Moreover, with an RMSE of 2.89 m/s and a bias of -1.88 m/s, the proposed DDM-Seq-Former can promisingly improve the estimations in the cases with wind speeds higher than 12 m/s. There are still opportunities for further enhancements in creating more robust models that could perform well in all wind regimes given a non-uniform wind distribution. We will make our code publicly available.

AB The slip-surface geometry and volume of landslides are fundamental for landslide modeling and mechanism interpretation. The movement of a landslide, which is generally controlled by the slip-surface geometry, can be obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. However, there is a lack of a general approach for inferring the slip-surface geometry and volume of landslides through the InSAR-derived deformation field. Here we developed a geometry-based method to determine the landslide slip-surface geometry and volume using InSAR measurements and applied it to the Jinsha River Basin, a landslide-prone area that poses a significant threat to residents and infrastructure. Through the InSAR-derived displacement, topography, and Google Earth images, 50 creeping landslides were identified in the study area. Based on the displacement field, the landslide slip-surface slope was inverted under the assumption that the landslide displacement was parallel to the slip-surface. Then the two-dimensional slip-surface depths and volumes of selected landslides were inferred using the slip-surface slope. Comparisons with the in-situ data suggest that the results obtained in this study are reliable. The mapped landslides in the study area have depths of approximately 16-160 m along the central axis and volumes ranging from 483,412 to 135,789,944 m(3). The derived volume-area relationship and 2D slip-surface depth suggest that deep-seated landslide is a major landslide type in the study area. We conclude that our method can infer the slip-surface geometry of creeping landslides based on InSAR observation and our results have improved the understanding of the landslide mechanisms in the Jinsha River Basin, China.

AB Recent research indicates an inverse relation between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal and near-surface soil moisture (SM) over very dry sediments, arid to hyper-arid soils resp., caused by subsurface scattering ef-fects. This phenomenon can lead to large errors when it comes to modelling and remote sensing-based estimation of SM. While the effect of subsurface scattering and its influence on SM estimates is well described and modelled in literature, its actual presence in recorded SAR data is largely unknown. Here we investigate the relation between C-Band SAR backscatter and SM in the hyper-arid environment of the Atacama Desert (Chile). Time series (2018-2020) of Sentinel-1 VV/VH intensities are compared to in situ SM, measured at 17 stations located across the Atacama Desert. Linear and non-linear regression modelling is applied to uncover the relationship between the SAR intensities and in situ SM, while, in addition, SM variations triggered by seasonal varying humidity (i.e., not by precipitation) are investigated. Results indicate (i) a very weak linear relationship between SM variations and SAR intensities (VV/VH) for most meteorological stations in the Atacama (R2 < 0.5). In particular, noticeable and significant exceptions are found for stations located in the northern uplands of the Coastal Cordillera and on sediments, which are characterized by thick atmospheric dust deposits on top of subsurface cemented crusts; (ii) over these sites a strong inverse linear relationship is present (R2 up to 0.84) and the observable seasonal variations in SAR intensity are linked to the seasonal variations in SM; (iii) remarkably low changes in SM (ranging from approx. 1 to 3%) lead to comparable high changes in SAR intensity (up to 5.5 dB in VH and up to 4.0 dB in VV); (iv) employing a non-linear regression modelling to the SAR time series allowed identifying the occurrence and the strength of seasonal variations over the central desert. This study contributes to a better understanding of SAR scattering over arid to hyper-arid soils, indicates a moisture -regulated complex interplay of surface and subsurface scattering, and proves the presence of subsurface scat-tering effects in Sentinel-1C-Band data to occur over large parts of the Atacama Desert.

AB Satellite-derived estimates of the Earth's radiation budget are crucial for understanding and predicting the weather and climate. However, existing satellite products measuring broadband outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave radiation (RSR) have spatio-temporal resolutions that are too coarse to evaluate important radiative forcers like aircraft condensation trails. We present a neural network which estimates OLR and RSR based on narrowband radiances, using collocated Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data. The resulting estimates feature strong agreement with the CERES data products (R2 = 0.977 for OLR and 0.974 for RSR on CERES Level 2 footprints), and we provide open access to the collocated satellite data and model outputs on all available GOES-16 ABI data for the 4 years from 2018-2021.

AB Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is critical to understand the water and energy cycles in the Earth system. Satellite-driven ET algorithms serve as an effective way to estimate the global ET. However, many algorithms have been designed independently of water balance constraints, which potentially limit their ability to estimate ET in water-limited and high interception regions. As ET remains one of the most uncertain terms in the global water budgets, incorporating water balance constraints into algorithms should improve the performance of ET estimates. In this study, we developed a general solution (denoted PEW) based on the proportionality hypothesis to incorporate available water control into the widely used Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm. Simulated performances of the PEW model and PT-JPL algorithm were evaluated against 106 FLUXNET eddy covariance (EC) towers data at the site scale. Meanwhile, model results were compared at the global scale with the means of the widely used ET products. We found that the PEW model has smaller errors than the original PT-JPL algorithm, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions and areas characterized by the high interception. Moreover, by incorporating the water balance constraints into the ET algorithm, the PEW model has the ability to distinguish variations in ET affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In summary, our study offers a convincing evidence regarding the incorporation of water balance constraints into remote sensing algorithms for more accurately mapping global terrestrial ET with an enhanced understanding of ET variation under climate change. This model is the first of its kind among remote-sensing models to provide global land ET estimation with the proportionality hypothesis-based water balance constraints.

AB Photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is an intriguing avenue for monitoring photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), which is a crucial physiological variable and the primary source of uncertainty in gross primary production (GPP) prediction. The correlations between PRI and LUE induced by the energy-dependent xanthophyll cycle are overall convincing at the leaf scale. However, their relationship becomes complicated and less reliable at the canopy scale due to several confounding factors, such as soil background, canopy structure and sun-observer geometry. A fundamental understanding of the interrelated effects of these factors is still missing. In this study, the roles of soil reflectance, canopy structure and sun-observer geometry were examined by investigating radiative transfer processes that determine canopy PRI. Theoretical analysis shows that the deviation between canopy- and leaf-level PRI is mainly attributed to soil background, namely the fraction of sunlit soil in the scene and the discrepancy between leaf and soil reflectance. Canopy structure and sun-observer geometry are not the direct drivers of variations in canopy PRI. They affect canopy PRI by altering the contribution of soil to canopy reflectance. Furthermore, several numerical experiments based on 1D and 3D radiative transfer models, which compare PRI of canopies with black soil (i.e., soil reflectance is zero) and non-black background, were conducted to confirm and validate the decisive role of soil background in explaining the deviation between canopy and leaf PRI. Multi-angular canopy PRI from PROBA-CHRIS data was employed to examine the angular dependency of canopy PRI changing with vegetation coverage. The numerical experiments demonstrate that canpy PRI differs from leaf PRI as large as 150% when canopy leaf area index (LAI) or the fraction of vegetation coverage is small. Canopy PRI is almost identical to soil PRI (i.e., PRI computed from soil reflectance) when the contribution of soil background to canopy reflectance is large. In contrast, when the soil reflectance is zero or LAI is greater than four, canopy PRI is almost identical to leaf PRI and independent of canopy structure and sun-observer geometry. Nonetheless, when leaf and soil reflectance are similar, canopy PRI is always close to leaf PRI regardless canopy structure and sun-observer geometry. The analysis of multi-angular PRI reveals that the angular dependency decreases with vegetation coverage due to weaker soil background effect. This study narrows down the causes of variation in canopy PRI to the fraction of observed soil background and soil reflectance. It suggests that estimating and accounting for the soil contribution to canopy PRI are necessary to mitigate angular and canopy structural effects on canopy PRI and eventually extract leaf physiological information from canopy PRI.

Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility to determine DOC in coastal waters from ocean color radiometry (OCR) based on its strong correlation with the absorption coefficient of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (acdom(lambda)). However, in the open ocean, the CDOM to DOC relationship is highly variable as they present different sources, sinks, and kinetics. Here we present a new approach to estimating DOC over the open ocean based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. This model accounts for i) Optical Water Classes (OWC) ii) sea surface tem-perature (SST), mixed layer depth (MLD), acdom(443), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and iii) different time lags depending on the input parameter. The satellite DOC estimated with this model is in good agreement with in situ measurements (MAPD = 7.04%), while the spatial patterns follow former observations and model outputs. A sensitivity analysis has shown that the main descriptors to assess satellite DOC at a given time for oligotrophic and mesotrophic open ocean waters are SST one week before, and acdom(443) two weeks before; with Chl-a one week before as an additional input parameter for more productive waters. This study allows for the first time the assessment of the contribution of the particulate organic carbon (POC) to the total organic carbon (TOC) over the global ocean. The POC/TOC ratio value varies between 1.31% and 9.07%, with a mean value of about 4.57 +/- 1.87%.

AB River patterns reflect complex geomorphological processes and affect ecosystems and human development along floodplains. Physical controls on anabranching development have been studied primarily at local scales on relatively small rivers (i.e., discharge <1000 m3 s-1). However, there has been little systematic quantification of river anabranching (development of stable multiple channels) for large rivers globally. Here, we use remote sensing, cloud computing, and geospatial analysis to explore the importance of water surface slope, floodplain topography, sediment supply, substrate lithology, and permafrost to anabranching throughout 20 of the world's largest river basins. We use Landsat-derived surface water extent to compute an anabranching index (Ai) for-1 M km of river reaches, and compare it with global datasets of water surface slope, available floodplain extent, substrate lithology, and permafrost. We find that-49 +/- 19% of large-river mainstems are anabranching, ranging from at least-17% (Mekong) to as much as-84% (Ob'). At the basin scale, anabranching channels comprise at least-17% (Yenisey) to as much as-55% (Kolyma) of all Landsat-observable river reaches, with a mean global value of 35 +/- 11%. Anabranching channel patterns are most commonly associated with low water surface slope (normalized slope < 0.2; absolute slope < 0.2 m km-1) accompanying wide floodplains (normalized floodplain width > 0.6; absolute width > 42 km). Cross-sectionally averaged channel width increases in the most intensely anabranching reaches, suggesting net sediment storage due to reduced stream power. Unconsolidated sedi-mentary substrates promote both the prevalence and intensity of anabranching, whereas the presence of permafrost enhances intensity only. Overall, our results identify pervasive channel anabranching and some important control mechanisms throughout the world's large river basins, with strong implications for satellite -based discharge retrievals. We conclude that global analyses afforded by remote sensing and cloud computing offer additional, complementary approaches to traditional field-based approaches for understanding large river geomorphic processes and channel forms.

AB Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is popularly used to infer ground-level PM2.5 concentration due to its wide coverage. The fact that aerosols are largely confined in the atmospheric boundary layer makes boundary layer height (BLH) an important scale factor for AOD-based PM2.5 estimates. Our recent ground-based lidar observations, nevertheless, indicate that aerosol particles are heterogeneously mixed within the boundary layer, and even frequently reside above BLH, forming the residual layers (RL)-like pattern. To better sort out the underlying mechanism behind the above-mentioned phenomenon and the impact on hourly ground-level PM2.5 estimates from satellite-based AOD, we firstly propose a novel notion of haze layer height (HLH), which is calculated from Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) profile. Combined analysis of 3.5-year ground-based lidar profiles, CE318 AOD, and PM2.5 measurements show that the coefficient of determination (R2) between PM2.5 and AOD normalized with HLH increases from 0.49 to 0.61 for 90% of the dataset. Second, we applied HLH to an Autoencoder-based Deep Residual Network (ADRN) and tested the effect on satellite AOD-based PM2.5 estimation within a 300 km range surrounding the MPL station. With the aid of the AOD imputation technique, a similar improvement of using HLH instead is found on the regional scale PM2.5 estimation, which can be demonstrated by the comparison with air quality measurements and other machine learning models. The results show that using ADRN with HLH achieves the highest performance (mean R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 10.12 mu g/m3) among 4 machine learning models. This new approach, largely combining active and passive remote sensing data through artificial neural networks (CAPTA), shows improved accuracy and coverage of hourly PM2.5 estimation with aerosol vertical information and AOD calculation under clouds. In addition, further analysis showed that the average difference between morning and daily PM2.5 concentration could equate to an accuracy of 0.19-2.57 yrs. in terms of life expectancy, indicating that our new approach to the determination of PM2.5 from space sheds new insight into the assessment of the aerosol impact on public health.

AB Large-scale land surface phenology (LSP) information has been developed from remote sensing-based vegetation indices (VIs) data. However, there are considerable discrepancies and uncertainties in the LSP data products for the start and end of growing seasons (SOS; EOS) as different vegetation indices and algorithms are used. Here, we used the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to estimate SOS and EOS in the Tibetan Plateau, a global hotspot of vegetation response to climate change. We compared SIF-based phenological metrics to those derived from VIs (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)), and gross primary production (GPP) simulated by the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). We found relatively small dis-crepancies in SOS between SIF and VIs, but large differences in EOS. Thus, the length of the growing season derived from VIs was as much as two months longer than that estimated by SIF. These results were consistent across three products, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted (MCD43), standard MODIS (MOD09), and TROPOMI products. The EOS discrepancy remained after excluding two mismatches (solar illu-mination and viewing angle) between satellite sensors. We also found that VIs-based EOS occurred below the freezing point, while SIF-based EOS occurred above the freezing point, suggesting that SIF-based EOS is more physiologically meaningful. Our study proposed that the late VIs-based EOS was caused in part by the effect of changes in soil background on VIs and VIs-based EOS. Our results highlight the need to re-evaluate current LSP data products derived from reflectance-based VIs and to develop new vegetation phenology data products using emitted energy such as SIF.

AB The Bayesian passive microwave retrievals of snowfall often rely on mathematical matching of the observed vectors of brightness temperature with an a priori database of precipitation profiles and their corresponding brightness temperatures. Mathematical proximity does not necessarily lead to consistent retrievals due to limited information content of passive microwave observations. This paper defines imposter (genuine) vectors of brightness temperature as those that are mathematically close but physically inconsistent (consistent) and characterizes them through the Silhouette Coefficient (SC) analysis. The Neyman-Pearson (NP) hypothesis testing is used to separate the imposter and genuine brightness temperatures based on their associated values of cloud ice (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP), given by coincidences of CloudSat Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). The study determines thresholds for IWP and LWP that allow optimal identification of imposter brightness temperatures of non-snowing and snowing clouds, which can mislead the passive microwave retrieval algorithms to falsely detect or miss the snowfall events. It is demonstrated that emission signal of supercooled liquid water in snowing clouds can lead to improved passive microwave retrieval of snowfall and conditioning the retrievals to the cloud IWP and LWP can result in marginal correction of the snowfall detection probability; however, reduce the probability of false alarm by 6%-8% over sea ice and open oceans.

AB Knowledge of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content is critical for environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality. With the development of remote sensing data and prediction models, the comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data based on a fusion approach and testing its effectiveness in SOC content prediction is an interesting and challenging topic. However, there is no evidence showing the role of different data sources in the SOC content prediction process. In this study, a total of 796 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected at Site 1, and 111 samples were collected at Site 2. The samples from Site 2 were used to verify the transferability of the prediction model established at Site 1. The discrete wavelet transform based on the regional energy weight (RW-DWT) and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal information of 10 scenes of Landsat multispectral image data from 2009 to 2019, the spatial information of topography data and the spectral information of GaoFen-5 hyperspectral images. Then, the SOC content prediction models were established by temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) information using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The results indicated that the optimal SOC content prediction model consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.49 g kg(-1), the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.86 and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) was 1.91. Next, the order of the effect was spectral > temporal > spatial information in terms of SOC content prediction, and their roles in improving the accuracy of the model were 26.79%, 19.64% and 14.29%, respectively, with the CNN model. In addition, the CNN yielded a higher prediction accuracy than PLSR and RF regardless of which group of input variables was used. The average RMSE of the CNN was 0.42 g kg (-1) lower than that of the RF, and the average R-2 and RPIQ were 9.25% and 0.14 higher, respectively, than those of the RF. The above conclusions were confirmed in the verification area, namely, the optimal SOC content prediction model at Site 2 consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model (RMSE = 1.01 g kg (-1), R-2 = 0.76 and RPIQ = 1.41). Therefore, the novel method proposed in this study is robust. This work provides a new idea for predicting soil properties by the comprehensive use of multisource remote sensing images and deep learning algorithms in the future.

AB The sustainable management of aquatic resources requires spatially explicit information on the water and vegetation presence of aquatic ecosystems. Previous Global Aquatic Land Cover (GALC) mapping has been focused on water bodies while lacking information on vegetation, and aquatic types have always been charac-terized by low accuracies in global land cover products, calling for specific attention to improve GALC mapping. The availability of a wealth of open Earth Observation (EO) data on cloud-computing platforms provides op-portunities to map aquatic land cover globally. This study aims to evaluate the potential of multi-source freely available EO data, including optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and various ancillary datasets, for improving the characterization of aquatic land cover comprising both water and vegetation types on a global scale. Using different combinations of features derived from these data, the classification performance of five land cover classes (i.e., trees, shrubs, herbaceous cover, bare/sparsely vegetated lands, and water bodies) in aquatic areas was cross-validated. Results showed that Sentinel-2 data alone achieved similarly good overall accuracy as those combining multi-source data. However, the single-sensor Sentinel-2 data cannot discriminate highly mixed and spectrally similar types, such as shrubs, trees, and herbaceous vegetation. Integrating SAR features from the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic and Sentinel-1 data with optical features provided by Sentinel-2 data could help address this limitation to some extent. Although with a lower spatial and temporal resolution, the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic had a stronger impact on GALC classification than Sentinel-1 data when they were syn-ergistically used. Features provided by ancillary datasets did not lead to significant improvement in the overall GALC classification. At class-level, topographic and soil features helped to reduce the commission error of shrubs, and climate variables were useful to improve the characterization of bare aquatic lands. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) forest canopy height dataset helped to characterize trees but also resulted in a decrease in accuracies of shrubs. By assessing multi-source earth observation data, this research represents an important step forward in the global mapping of comprehensive aquatic land cover types at high spatial reso-lution (i.e., 10 m).

AB Land disturbance can increase carbon emissions, cause detrimental environmental impacts, and threaten human life and property. Monitoring land disturbance in near-real-time is essential to mitigate their negative effects and prevent future losses. However, rapid and timely monitoring of land disturbance at a high spatial resolution is in its infancy. Here, we developed an algorithm for Near-Real-Time MOnitoring of laNd dIsturbance based on Time series of harmOnized Reflectance (NRT-MONITOR) from Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 data at 30-m spatial resolution. It incorporates an online recursive algorithm called Forgetting Factor to improve efficiency in the determination of land disturbance to get fast detection based on the harmonized data. This algorithm is developed and validated by using 1200 samples created from the harmonized Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 time series from 2015 to 2019 within the conterminous United States (CONUS). An overall accuracy of 70% has been achieved for monitoring a variety of land disturbance types. NRT-MONITOR improves the processing efficiency (11.5 times faster) compared to the COLD algorithm (Zhu et al., 2020). The mean time lag of NRT-MONITOR, defined as the delta days of confirming a land disturbance after its occurrence, is only 35 days, which is achieved by using the harmonized Landsats 7-8 and Sentinel-2 observations and reduced number of clear observations (from six to four) needed to confirm a land disturbance. Finally, NRT-MONITOR can be integrated into an alerting system to provide potential land disturbance probability maps that are updated every three days.

AB Blending data from thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) measurements is a promising solution for generating the all-weather land surface temperature (LST). However, owing to swath gaps in PMW data and the resolution inconsistence between TIR and PWM data, spatial details are often incomplete or considerable losses are generated in the all-weather LST using traditional methods. This study was conducted to develop a two-step deep learning framework (TDLF) for mapping gapless all-weather LST over the China's landmass using MODIS and AMSR-E LST data. In the TDLF, a multi-temporal feature connected convolutional neural network bidirectional reconstruction model was developed to obtain the spatially complete AMSR-E LST. A multi-scale multi-temporal feature connected generative adversarial network model was then designed to blend spatially complete AMSR-E LST and cloudy-sky MODIS LST, and generate gapless all-weather LST data. Gapless allweather LST data were evaluated using six in-situ LST data from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the gapless all-weather LST were 1.71-2.0 K with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.94-0.98 under clear conditions, and RMSEs of 3.41-3.87 K and R-2 of 0.88-0.94 were obtained under cloudy conditions. Compared to the existing PMW-based all-weather LSTs, the validation accuracy and image quality (such as spatial detail) of the generated gapless all-weather LSTs were superior. The TDLF does not require the use of any additional data and can potentially be implemented with other satellite TIR and PWM sensors to produce long-term, gapless, all-weather MODIS LST records on a global scale. Such a capability is beneficial for generating further gapless all-weather soil moisture and evapotranspiration datasets that can all be applied in global climate change research.

AB Over the past ~30 years, hyperspectral remote sensing of chemical variations in white mica have proven to be useful for ore deposit studies in a range of deposit types. To better understand mineral deposits and to guide spectrometer design, this contrib ution reviews relevant papers from the fields of remote sensing, spectroscopy, and geology that have utilized spectral changes caused by chemical variation in white micas. This contribution reviews spectral studies conducted at the following types of mineral deposits: base metal sulfide, epithermal, porphyry, sedimentary rock hosted gold deposits, orogenic gold, iron oxide copper gold, and unconformityrelated uranium. The structure, chemical composition, and spectral features of white micas, in this contribution defined as muscovite, paragonite, celadonite, phengite, illite, and sericite, are given. Reviewed laboratory spectral studies determined that shifts in the position of the white mica 2200 nm combination feature of 1 nm correspond to a change in Aloct content of approximately +/- 1.05%. Many of the reviewed spectral studies indicated that a shift in the position of the white mica 2200 nm combination feature of 1 nm was geologically significant. A sensitivity analysis of spectrometer characteristics; bandpass, sampling interval, and channel position, is conducted using spectra of 19 white micas with deep absorption features to determine minimum characteristics required to accurately measure a shift in the position of the white mica 2200 nm combination feature. It was determined that a sampling interval < 16.3 nm and bandpass <17.5 nm are needed to achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2 nm, whereas a sampling interval < 8.8 nm and bandpass <9.8 nm are needed to achieve a RMSE of 1 nm. For comparison, commonly used imaging spectrometers HyMap, AVIRIS-Classic, SpecTIR (R)'s AisaFENIX 1K, and HySpextm SWIR 384 have 2.1, 1.2, 0.96, and 0.95 nm RMSE in determining the position of the 2200 nm white mica combination feature, respectively. An additional sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the effect of signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the RMSE of the position of the white mica 2200 nm combination feature, using spectra of 18 white micas with deep absorption features. For a spectrometer with sampling interval and bandpass of 1 nm, we estimate that RMSEs of 1 and 1.5 nm are achievable with spectra having a minimum SNR of approximately 246 and 64, respectively. For a spectrometer with sampling interval and bandpass of 5 nm, we estimate that RMSEs of 1 and 1.5 nm are attainable with spectra having a minimum SNR of approximately 431 and 84, respectively. When using a spectrometer with a sampling interval 8.8 nm and a bandpass of 9.8 nm, a RMSE of 1 is only achievable with convolved, noiseless reference spectra. For the 8.8_9.8 nm spectrometer, spectra with SNR of 250 and 100 result in RMSE of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively. Therefore, fine spectral resolution characteristics achieve RMSEs better than 1 nm for high SNR spectra while spectrometers with coarse spectral resolution have larger RMSE, perform well with noisy data, and are useful for white mica studies if RMSE of 1.1 to 1.5 nm is acceptable.

AB Satellite altimetry is a radar remote sensing technology for the precise observation of the ocean surface and its changes over time. Its measurements allow the determination of geometric and physical parameters such as sea level, significant wave height or wind speed. This work presents a novel coastal retracking algorithm for SAR altimetry to estimate the significant wave height. The concept includes an adaptive interference masking scheme to sense and mitigate spurious interfering signals that typically arise from strongly reflective targets in the coastal zone. The described procedure aims at increasing the number of valid records in the coastal zone. The effec-tiveness of the novel retracking algorithm is validated using the methodology recently developed in the framework of the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative project. Several different metrics were extracted as functions of sea state and distance to the nearest coast: outliers, number of valid records, intrinsic noise, power spectral density, and correlation statistics for the comparison with wave model and in-situ data. Two coastal case study scenarios complement the validation. The results show that with the presented novel retracking algorithm, the number of valid 20-Hz records in the near coastal zone of less than 5 km off the coast is increased by more than 25% compared to the best competing coastal retracking algorithm with no degradation of quality of the estimated records. We emphasise the importance of the correct choice of the quality flag that is provided together with the significant wave height. Our findings suggest that the strategy for the significant wave height quality flag of the official baseline Level-2 product of the Sentinel-3 mission can be redefined to obtain more robust significant wave height estimates in the coastal zone.

AB Accurate and efficient simulation of remote sensing images is increasingly needed in order to better exploit remote sensing observations and to better design remote sensing missions. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer), developed since 1992 based on the discrete ordinates method (i.e., standard mode DART-FT), is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D radiative transfer models to simulate the radiative budget and remote sensing observations of urban and natural landscapes. Recently, a new method, called DART-Lux, was integrated into DART model to address the requirements of massive remote sensing data simulation for large-scale and complex landscapes. It is developed based on efficient Monte Carlo light transport algorithms (i.e., bidirectional path tracing) and on DART model framework. DART-Lux can accurately and rapidly simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and spectral images of arbitrary landscapes. This paper presents its theory, implementation, and evaluation. Its accuracy, efficiency and advantages are also discussed. The comparison with standard DART-FT in a variety of scenarios shows that DART-Lux is consistent with DART-FT (relative differences <1%) with simulation time and memory reduced by a hundredfold. DART-Lux is already part of the DART version freely available for scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

AB Dual-polarimetric (i.e., HH and VV) scattering responses at X-and C-bands from indigenously designed far-field bistatic specular (bi-spec) scatterometer acquired over the entire rice crop phenology have been analyzed using a modified parametric radiative transfer model (MRTM). The scattering responses are examined over a wideranging bi-spec incidence angle varying from 20 degrees to 60 degrees at 10 degrees intervals. Furthermore, optimization of the bispec scatterometer system showed high sensitivity at 40 degrees specular angle of incidence based on the correlation analysis between the measured value of bi-spec scattering coefficient (sigma(0)(Measured)) and vegetation biophysical parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) and plant water content (PWC). The MRTM implied to investigate the dominance of surface (sigma(0)(Surface)) and vegetation((sigma)(0)(Vegetation)) specular scattering components within the total value of simulated bi-spec scattering coefficient (sigma(0)(Simulated)) in forward scattering alignment (FSA) convention. The vegetation phase function (VPF) and a bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) are parameterized to approximate scattering responses from the vegetation volume layer and the surface beneath vegetation. In addition, empirical frequency-specific parameters (i.e., b(1 & nbsp;)and b(2)) are used to simulate temporal dynamics of sigma(0)(Simulated) using a linear relationship between vegetation optical depth (VOD) with LAI and PWC. The model and empirical frequency-specific parameters are calibrated using a constrained non-linear least square optimization algorithm, and the results are validated against the value of sigma(0)(Measured). According to the simulation findings, the total specular scattering decomposition offers a robust model for interpreting time-series microwave scattering scenarios through vegetation in the FSA convention. Moreover, as compared to C-band, the inverse modeling of MRTM showed high retrieval accuracies of LAI at VV polarization and PWC at HH polarization for the X-band.

AB The Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) operated onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are providing globally distributed Ocean Color Radiometry (OCR) data products of relevance for environmental and climate applications. This work summarizes results on the assessment of fundamental OCR data from the Operational Baseline 3 Collection OL_L2M.003.01 of OLCI-A and OLCI-B onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, respectively. Evaluated products are the satellite derived normalized water-leaving radiance L-WN(lambda), aerosol optical depth at 865 nm tau(a)(865) and angstrom ngstrom exponent alpha determined in the near-infrared spectral region. The analyses were performed relying on in situ reference data from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) from sites representative of diverse water types. The comparison of OLCI-A and OLCI-B with AERONET-OC L-WN(lambda) for oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters shows cross-mission consistent spectral median percent differences (i.e., biases) varying within +/- 6% at the blue-green center-wavelengths. The analysis of data from regions characterized by optically complex waters, however, displays systematic negative biases for both OLCI-A and OLCI-B further increasing for waters dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter, thus suggesting a dependence of the atmospheric correction on water type. The direct inter-comparison of OLCI-B and OLCI-A L-WN(lambda) from the Tandem Phase characterized by Sentinel-3B and Sentinel-3A flying 30 s apart on the same orbit, shows spectral median percent differences lower than +/- 1% in the 412-560 nm interval, of approximately +5% at 620 and 665 nm, and-7% at 400 nm. However, outside the Tandem Phase, the inter-comparison of OLCI-B and OLCI-A data products indicates large and systematic differences explained by a notable dependence on the viewing angle. The evaluation of tau(a)(865) and alpha across different geographic regions exhibits overestimated values between +48 and + 79% for the former and underestimated values between-28% and -41% for the latter. A complementary evaluation of OCR data products from the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (VIIRS-S), proposed as a further in-direct term of reference for OLCI-A and OLCI-B data, shows large underestimates of L-WN(lambda) with respect to the in situ reference data in the various water types at 410 nm. Nevertheless, opposite to OLCI-A and OLCI-B data products, absolute differences between VIIRS-S and in situ reference data do not reveal any large or systematic dependence on water type and satellite viewing angle. Overall results suggest the need for further developing the OLCI-A and OLCI-B atmospheric correction, possibly improving the capability to identify aerosol types and to model scattering processes.

AB Several forest change detection algorithms are available for tracking and quantifying deforestation based on dense Landsat and Sentinel time series satellite data. Only few also capture regrowth after clearing in an accurate and continuous way across a diversity of forest types (including dry and seasonal forests) and are thus suitable to address the need for better information on secondary forest succession and for assessing forest restoration activities. We present a new change detection algorithm that makes use of the flexibility of kernel density estimations to create a forest reference phenology, taking into account all historical phenological variations of the forest rather than smoothing these out by curve fitting. The AVOCADO (Anomaly Vegetation Change Detection) algorithm allows detection of anomalies with a spatially explicit likelihood measure. We demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm for three contrasting sites using all available Landsat time series data; ranging from tropical rainforest to dry miombo forest ecosystems, with different time series data densities, and characterized by different forest change types (e.g. selective logging, shifting cultivation). We found that the approach produced in general high overall accuracies (> 90%) across these varying conditions, but had lower accuracies in the dry forest site with a slight overestimation of disturbances and regrowth. The latter was due to the similarity of crops in the time series NDMI signal, causing false regrowth detections. In the moist forest site the low producer accuracies in the intact forest and regrowth class was due to its very small area class (most forest disappeared by the nineties). We showed that the algorithm is capable of capturing small-scale (gradual) changes (e.g. selective logging, forest edge logging) and the multiple changes associated to shifting cultivation. The performance of the algorithm has been shown at regional scale, but if larger scale studies are required a representative selection of reference forest types need to be selected carefully. The outputs of the change maps allow the estimation of the spatio-temporal trends in the proportions of intact forest, secondary forest and non-forest - information that is useful for assessing the areas and potential of secondary forests to accumulate carbon and forest restoration targets. The algorithm can be used for disturbance and regrowth monitoring in different ecozones, is user friendly, and open source.

AB Digital elevation models (DEMs) contain some of the most important data for providing terrain information and supporting environmental analyses. However, the applications of DEMs are significantly limited by data voids, which are commonly found in regions with rugged terrain. We propose a novel deep learning-based strategy called a topographic knowledge-constrained conditional generative adversarial network (TKCGAN) to fill data voids in DEMs. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data with spatial resolutions of 3 and 1 arc-seconds are used in experiments to demonstrate the applicability of the TKCGAN. Qualitative topographic knowledge of valleys and ridges is transformed into new loss functions that can be applied in deep learning-based algorithms and constrain the training process. The results show that the TKCGAN outperforms other common methods in filling voids and improves the elevation and surface slope accuracy of the reconstruction results. The performance of the TKCGAN is stable in the test areas and reduces the error in the regions with medium and high surface slopes. Furthermore, the analysis of profiles indicates that the TKCGAN achieves better performance according to a visual inspection and quantitative comparison. In addition, the proposed strategy can be applied to DEMs with different resolutions.

AB As the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean plays a key role in marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems, its assessment from satellite observations of the global ocean is of significant interest. To achieve a global multi-decadal data record of POC by merging observations from multiple satellite ocean color missions, we formulated a new suite of empirical POC algorithms for several satellite sensors. For the algorithm development we assembled a field dataset of concurrent POC and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), measurements collected in all major ocean basins encompassing tropical, subtropical, and temperate latitudes as well as the northern and southern polar latitudes. This dataset is characterized by a globally-representative probability distribution of POC with a broad range of values between about 10 and 1000 mg m(-3). This development dataset was created with the use of additional inclusion and exclusion criteria based on well-assured and documented consistency of measurement protocols as well as specific bio-optical and particle characteristics of seawater which are consistent with vast areas of open-ocean pelagic environments.
   To formulate the algorithms the development dataset was subject to parametric regression analysis. Overall we evaluated over seventy formulas for estimating POC from R-rs(lambda) using seven distinctly different algorithmic categories, each with a fundamentally different definition of independent variable involving R-rs(lambda). Through the goodness-of-fit analysis, we selected the best candidate POC algorithms, referred to as the hybrid algorithms, which are tuned specifically for the spectral bands of SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS, MERIS, and OLCI satellite sensors. These hybrid algorithms consist of two components, the MBR (Maximum Band Ratio)-OC4 cubic polynomial function and BRDI (Band Ratio Difference Index) quintic polynomial function. The MBR-OC4 uses four spectral bands and the BRDI three spectral bands from the blue-green spectral region. The MBR-OC4 algorithm is used for POC > 25 mg m(-3) and the BRDI for POC < 15 mg m(-3). In the transition region the weighting approach is applied to POC derived from the two algorithmic formulas. While the main role of the BRDI is to improve POC estimates in ultraoligotrophic waters where POC is very low, the MBR-OC4 provides improvements, compared with the predecessor algorithms, over a broader range of POC but especially for relatively high POC values. A preliminary analysis of field-satellite matchup datasets based on SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua observations shows improved performance of hybrid algorithms compared with current standard algorithms for both SeaWiFS and MODIS. In addition, a reasonable consistency is demonstrated between POC derived from hybrid algorithms applied to example satellite observations with SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP. The suite of newly developed algorithms provides the potential next generation version of global algorithms that better represents the spatial and temporal variability within a broader range of POC than the predecessor global algorithms, while also offering a capability to generate a long-term sensor-to-sensor consistent data record of POC that begins with the launch of SeaWiFS mission in 1997.

AB Remote sensing of nighttime light (NTL) offers a unique opportunity to monitor urban dynamics and human socioeconomic activities directly from space. However, angular observations lead to inconsistencies among observations over the same area on different days, introducing uncertainty into daily NTL time series. This study aims to investigate this angular effect and its drivers using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite/Suomi (VIIRS) Black Marble NTL dataset. First, we proposed a conceptual model of the angular effect and hypothesized the mechanism of how urban three-dimensional (3D) landscapes form the anisotropic characteristics of artificial light observations. Second, we quantified the spatial patterns of the angular effect within five representative cities, and identified three distinctive types of angular effects: negative, U-shaped, and positive. Subsequently, the contribution of landscape factors to the direction (i.e., the type) and magnitude (i.e., NTL change rate with angle) of the angular effect is quantified using multinomial logistic regression and mediation analysis, respectively. The results show that the direction of the angular effect is mainly controlled by building height which determines the blocked and visible parts of artificial light at different satellite viewing angles. The magnitude of the angular effect is determined by both NTL brightness and landscape factors. The mediation analysis shows that landscape factors can have a direct effect on the magnitude of the angular effect as well as an indirect effect on the magnitude by affecting NTL brightness. Among the landscape factors, both vegetation and buildings are indicated to be significantly influential factors with direct and indirect effects. The findings of this research deepen our understanding of the NTL angular effect, guide the development of technologies for reconstructing high-quality daily NTL time series by correcting the angular effect, and help us better monitor high-frequency socioeconomic activities.

AB Wildland fire smoke contains large amounts of PM2.5 that can traverse tens to hundreds of kilometers, resulting in significant deterioration of air quality and excess mortality and morbidity in downwind regions. Estimating PM2.5 levels while considering the impact of wildfire smoke has been challenging due to the lack of ground monitoring coverage near the smoke plumes. We aim to estimate total PM2.5 concentration during the Camp Fire episode, the deadliest wildland fire in California history. Our random forest (RF) model combines calibrated lowcost sensor data (PurpleAir) with regulatory monitor measurements (Air Quality System, AQS) to bolster ground observations, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16)'s high temporal resolution to achieve hourly predictions, and oversampling techniques (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, SMOTE) to reduce model underestimation at high PM2.5 levels. In addition, meteorological fields at 3 km resolution from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model and land use variables were also included in the model. Our AQS-only model achieved an out of bag (OOB) R-2 (RMSE) of 0.84 (12.00 mu g/m(3)) and spatial and temporal cross-validation (CV) R-2 (RMSE) of 0.74 (16.28 mu g/m(3)) and 0.73 (16.58 mu g/m3), respectively. Our AQS + Weighted PurpleAir Model achieved OOB R-2 (RMSE) of 0.86 (9.52 mu g/m(3)) and spatial and temporal CV R-2 (RMSE) of 0.75 (14.93 mu g/m(3)) and 0.79 (11.89 mu g/m(3)), respectively. Our AQS + Weighted PurpleAir + SMOTE Model achieved OOB R-2 (RMSE) of 0.92 (10.44 mu g/m(3)) and spatial and temporal CV R-2 (RMSE) of 0.84 (12.36 mu g/m(3)) and 0.85 (14.88 mu g/m(3)), respectively. Hourly predictions from our model may aid in epidemiological investigations of intense and acute exposure to PM2.5 during the Camp Fire episode.

AB ABS T R A C T Traditional optical remote sensing data have been widely used for snow cover detection and monitoring. However, they are limited to daytime detection and often suffer from large data gaps due to frequent cloud obscuration. This is in particular a serious challenge for high-latitude and polar regions where long nights prevail during the winter. Nighttime light sensors have a strong capability of sensing the low-level reflected moonlight. They potentially provide a new way to detect snow cover. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the moonlight intensity for snow detection and developed a Minimum Error Thresholding (MET) algorithm to detect snow cover from the data collected by Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (S-NPP VIIRS) satellite data. For the two case study sites, Abisko in the sub-Arctic zone and the Tibetan Plateau, our analysis results suggest that the moonlight provides sufficient illumination to map snow cover for approx-imately 10 days in a lunar month. Our nighttime snow cover detection method was quantitatively evaluated by comparing our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates with in situ station observations, Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover products, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products over Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau during the 2017-2018 snow season. The overall accuracy of S-NPP VIIRS snow cover estimates was approximately 80.3% in Abisko region and 76.7% in the Tibetan Plateau. The data gaps in our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates were smaller than those of the MODIS snow cover products by 22.1% and 5.1% over Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. Further, we found that nearly 92.8% and 74.6% of data gaps in the MODIS snow-cover product can be filled up by incorporating our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates in Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau. The total accuracy of daily MODIS snow cover products can be improved to 91.0% in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that S-NPP VIIRS DNB nighttime satellite data can provide reliable snow products over polar regions and mid-latitude mountainous areas, which is complementary to the standard MODIS snow cover products.

AB The aim of this paper is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite image time series. Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The threelevel label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km x 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116 ' 000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines, including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions. The hierarchical approach performs superior by at least 9.9 percentage points in F1-score.

AB Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant with negative health effects and a precursor of ozone and particulate matter responsible for photo-chemical smog and wintertime air pollution. To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69 mu g/m(3), performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 x 5.5 km(2)) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown presents a case study that offers new insights into the importance of satellite data that can partially re-mediate statistical models' unsusceptibility to unusual events (like changes due to political intervention) with regard to model training.

AB Solar-induced Fluorescence (SIF) has an advantage over greenness-based Vegetation Indices in detecting drought. This advantage is the mechanistic coupling between SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). Under water stress, SIF tends to decrease with photosynthesis, due to an increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), resulting in rapid and/or sustained reductions in the fluorescence quantum efficiency (phi F). Water stress also affects vegetation structure via highly dynamic changes in leaf angular distributions (LAD) or slower changes in leaf area index (LAI). Critically, these responses are entangled in space and time and their relative contribution to SIF, or to the coupling between SIF and GPP, is unclear. In this study, we quantify the relative effect of structural and photosynthetic dynamics on the diurnal and spatial variation of canopy SIF in a potato crop in response to a replicated paired-plot water stress experiment. We measured SIF using two platforms: a hydraulic lift and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to capture temporal and spatial variation, respectively. LAD parameters were estimated from point clouds and photographic data and used to assess structural dynamics. Leaf phi F estimated from PAM fluorescence measurements were used to represent variations in photosynthetic regulation. We also measured foliar pigments, operating quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), photosynthetic gas exchange, stomatal conductance and LAI. We used a radiative transfer model (SCOPE) to provide a means of decoupling structural and photosynthetic factors across the diurnal and spatial domains. The results demonstrate that diurnal variation in SIF is driven by photosynthetic and structural dynamics. The influence of phi F was prominent in the diurnal SIF response to water stress, with reduced fluorescence efficiencies in stressed plants. Structural factors dominated the spatial response of SIF to water stress over and above phi F. The results showed that the relationship between SIF and GPP is maintained in response to water stress where adjustments in NPQ and leaf angle co-operate to enhance the correlation between SIF and GPP. This study points to the complexity of interpreting and modelling the spatiotemporal connection between SIF and GPP which requires simultaneous knowledge of vegetation structural and photosynthetic dynamics.

AB Satellite observations of nighttime lights (NTL) from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Day/Night Band data have been widely used to estimate human activities. Long-term changes such as urban development and abrupt short-term changes such as power outages have been monitored from temporal NTL acquired by satellites. While high temporal NTL variation has been found across NTL data of varying temporal scale (e.g., daily, monthly, and annual composites), the sources of measurement error and uncertainty are poorly understood. This paper quantifies the sources of VIIRS-derived NTL uncertainty due to view-illumination geometry, surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo, and the effects of snow cover, lunar irradiance, aerosol loading, cloud mask, vegetation, geometry, and ephemeral artifacts (e.g., the Aurora Borealis). Based on this current assessment of NASA Black Marble retrievals (VNP46, Collection V001), we found that angular and atmospheric effects dominate retrieval uncertainty. Errors introduced by upstream data inputs (e.g., a coarser nighttime snow cover flag and misclassification errors in the existing VIIRS nighttime cloud mask) were also found to impact retrieval quality. Despite these challenges, a consistent daily NTL time series record can be routinely generated from top-of-atmosphere VNP46 radiances. Key recommendations include: (1) the use of lunar-BRDF adjusted and atmospherically corrected NTL (i.e., as identified as high-quality retrievals in the VNP46 QA fields), (2) development and improvement to the VIIRS snow cover and cloud masks algorithms to accurately reflect NTL retrieval conditions, (3) characterizing seasonal variations in NTL due to vegetation and snow, (4) reducing geometric effects due to the spatial mismatch of gridded pixel and observation footprint, (5) employing angularly-consistent NTL observations from multiple VIIRS instruments (i.e., Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20) to reduce pixel-based uncertainties and address persistent data gaps, and (6) being mindful of surface-reflected radiance from aurora events at mid-to-high latitudes.

AB Urban land surface temperature (ULST) is a key surface feature parameter in urban heat island studies. However, the geometry and adjacency effects are usually neglected in conventional land surface temperature (LST) retrieval methods. In this study, considering the geometry and adjacency effects, a new urban canopy multiple-scattering thermal radiative transfer (UCM-RT) model and an urban temperature-emissivity separation (UTES) algorithm were developed for ULST retrieval from Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite thermal infrared (TIR) images. The UCM-RT model and the UTES algorithm incorporate multiple scattering within the urban building canopy and consider the thermal radiance contribution from adjacent pixels and the atmosphere. Two schemes were designed to evaluate the geometry and adjacency effects quantitatively in this study: (1) evaluating their impact on ground temperature and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature for GF-5 four TIR bands from the simulation dataset, and (2) comparing the retrieval temperature difference between the UTES algorithm and conventional temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm (without considering geometry and adjacency effects). For a specific simulation situation, the magnitude of the geometric effects on urban ground temperatures were found to be approximately 3.2 K, 4.2 K, 4.0 K, and 3.9 K for the four GF-5 TIR bands, while the effects on the TOA brightness temperature reached 2.4 K, 3.3 K, 3.3 K, and 3.0 K for those bands, respectively. The results show that the geometry effects have a significant influence on the thermal radiative transfer process. The temperature error of the UTES algorithm was generally up to 0.8 K, much lower than that of the conventional TES algorithm (similar to 2.2 K) in urban surface. The results indicate that the UTES algorithm is suitable for ULST retrieval, and the retrieval temperature difference between the UTES algorithm and conventional TES algorithm ranges from 0.1 K to 2.1 K, especially for dense building pixels. Additionally, the thermal radiation from adjacent pixels in high-spatial-resolution TIR images has significant influence on ULST retrieval. The comparison between the ULST algorithm for urban land surface and the conventional TES algorithm for the flat surface indicated that the three-dimensional structure inside the pixel has a significant influence on the ULST retrieval. The findings of this study indicate that the geometry and adjacency effects must be considered in ULST retrieval for highly accurate results.

AB The PRISMA satellite mission launched on March 22nd, 2019 is one of the latest spaceborne imaging spectroscopy mission for Earth Observation. The PRISMA satellite comprises a high-spectral resolution VNIR-SWIR imaging spectrometer and a panchromatic camera. In summer 2019, first operations during the commissioning phase were mainly devoted to acquisitions in specific areas for evaluating instrument functioning, in-flight performance, and mission data product accuracy. A field and airborne campaign was carried out over an agriculture area in Italy to collect in-situ multi-source spectroscopy measurements at different scales simultaneously with PRISMA. The spectral, radiometric and spatial performance of PRISMA Level 1 Top-Of-Atmosphere radiance (LTOA) product were analyzed. The in-situ surface reflectance measurements over different landcovers were propagated to LTOA using MODTRAN5 radiative transfer simulations and compared with satellite observations. Overall, this work offers a first quantitative evaluation about the PRISMA mission performance and imaging spectroscopy LTOA data product consistency. Our results show that the spectral smile is less than 5 nm, the average spectral resolution is 13 nm and 11 nm (VNIR and SWIR respectively) and it varies +/- 2 nm across track. The radiometric comparison between PRISMA and field/airborne spectroscopy shows a difference lower than 5% for NIR and SWIR, whereas it is included in the 2-7% range in the VIS. The estimated instrument signal to noise ratio (SNR) is approximate to 400-500 in the NIR and part of the SWIR (<1300 nm), lower SNR values were found at shorter ( 700 nm) and longer wavelengths ( 1600 nm). The VNIR-to-SWIR spatial co-registration error is below 8 m and the spatial resolution is 37.11 m and 38.38 m for VNIR and SWIR respectively. The results are in-line with the expectations and mission requirements and indicate that acquired images are suitable for further scientific applications. However, this first assessment is based on data from a rural area and this cannot be fully exhaustive. Further studies are needed to confirm the performance for other land cover types like snow, inland and coastal waters, deserts or urban areas.

AB Land surface phenology (LSP) is a consistent and sensitive indicator of climate change effects on Earth's vegetation. Existing methods of estimating LSP require time series densities that, until recently, have only been available from coarse spatial resolution imagery such as MODIS (500 m) and AVHRR (1 km). LSP products from these datasets have improved our understanding of phenological change at the global scale, especially over the MODIS era (2001-present). Nevertheless, these products may obscure important finer scale spatial patterns and longer-term changes. Therefore, we have developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to retrieve complete annual sequences of LSP from Landsat imagery (1984-present), which has medium spatial resolution (30 m) but relatively sparse temporal frequency. Our approach uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to quantify individual phenometric uncertainty, which is especially important when considering long time series with variable observation quality and density, but has rarely been demonstrated. The estimated spring LSP had strong agreement with ground phenology records at Harvard Forest (R2 = 0.87) and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (R2 = 0.67). The estimated LSP were consistent with the recently released 30 m LSP product, MSLSP30NA, in its time period of 2016 to 2018 (R2 of 0.86 and 0.73 for spring and autumn phenology, respectively). Our Bayesian hierarchical model is an important step forward in extending medium resolution LSP records back in time as it accomplishes both critical goals of retrieving annual LSP from sparse time series and accurately estimating uncertainty.

AB The early detection of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) infections is critical to the management of this dangerous plan pathogen across the world. Recent studies with remote sensing (RS) sensors at different scales have shown that Xf-infected olive trees have distinct spectral features in the visible and infrared regions (VNIR). However, further work is needed to integrate remote sensing in the management of plant disease epidemics. Here, we research how the spectral changes picked up by different sets of RS plant traits (i.e., pigments, structural or leaf protein content), can help capture the spatial dynamics of Xf spread. We coupled a spatial spread model with the probability of Xf-infection predicted by a RS-driven support vector machine (RS-SVM) model. Furthermore, we analyzed which RS plant traits contribute most to the output of the prediction models. For that, in almond orchards affected by Xf (n = 1426 trees), we conducted a field campaign simultaneously with an airborne campaign to collect high-resolution thermal images and hyperspectral images in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-850 nm) and short-wave infrared regions (SWIR, 950-1700 nm). The best performing RS-SVM model (OA = 75%; kappa = 0.50) included as predictors leaf protein content, nitrogen indices (NIs), fluorescence and a thermal indicator (Tc), alongside pigments and structural parameters. Leaf protein content together with NIs contributed 28% to the explanatory power of the model, followed by chlorophyll (22%), structural parameters (LAI and LIDFa), and chlorophyll indicators of photosynthetic efficiency. Coupling the RS model with an epidemic spread model increased the accuracy (OA = 80%; kappa = 0.48). In the almond trees where the presence of Xf was assayed by qPCR (n = 318 trees), the combined RS-spread model yielded an OA of 71% and kappa = 0.33, which is higher than the RS-only model and visual inspections (both OA = 64-65% and kappa = 0.26-31). Our work demonstrates how combining spatial epidemiological models and remote sensing can lead to highly accurate predictions of plant disease spatial distribution.

AB Spectral vegetation index (VI) time series data from coarse resolution satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have been utilized in studying vegetation dynamics. Numerous studies have evaluated how well VI products capture variations in vegetation biophysical or physiological conditions. Equally important is to evaluate VI products over "zero vegetation" surfaces consisting of soils, litters, and/or rocks, as they define the lower bound for vegetation detection. VIs, however, vary over zero vegetation surfaces as a function of soil moisture content and surface roughness. In this study, we evaluated the behavior of VIs from Terra MODIS (T-MODIS), Aqua MODIS (A-MODIS), and Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (S-VIIRS) at Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada for a period from April 2013 to September 2019. The playa is a dried lakebed devoid of vegetation throughout the year. Long-term in situ reflectance measurements acquired over the 1 km-by-1 km Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) located on the playa were obtained from the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) portal and used as a reference. Three VIs were analyzed, including the normalized difference VI (NDVI), enhanced VI (EVI), and two-band EVI (EVI2). RadCaTS NDVI, EVI, and EVI2 of the playa surface increased and decreased occasionally for the time period examined in this study, and the satellite NDVIs, EVIs, and EVI2s had comparable temporal signatures to the RadCaTS counterparts. T-MODIS and A-MODIS NDVI and EVI2 values were comparable to the RadCaTS counterparts, whereas T-MODIS and A-MODIS EVI values were lower than the RadCaTS counterparts by similar to 0.006 and -0.01 EVI units, respectively. All the three VIs of S-VIIRS were consistently higher than their RadCaTS counterparts by-0.008 VI units, due to the higher near-infrared (NIR) reflectances of S-VIIRS than the RadCaTS NIR reflectance. The red and NIR, and red and blue reflectances each formed linear relationships (i.e., soil lines) for each of the three sensors. Variations in reflectance due to surface conditions and observation geometries all appeared as variations along these soil lines. The satellite red-NIR soil lines were comparable to the RadCaTS counterparts, whereas the satellite red-blue soil lines had steeper slopes than the RadCaTS counterparts due to a negative bias in the satellite blue reflectances. This translated into the T-MODIS and A-MODIS EVI behaviors different from those depicted by RadCaTS EVI, and the satellite NDVI and EVI2 behaving more comparably with the RadCaTS counterparts and across the three sensors than the satellite EVI.

AB Rice blast is considered as the most destructive disease that threatens global rice production and causes severe economic losses worldwide. A detection of rice blast infection in an early manner is vital to limit its expansion and proliferation. However, little research has been devoted to spectral detection of rice leaf blast (RLB) infection, especially at the asymptomatic or early stages. To fill the gap, this study aimed to examine the feasibility of detecting RLB infection from leaf reflectance spectra at asymptomatic, early and mild stages of disease development. Greenhouse experiments were conducted over two consecutive years to collect hyper spectral data (350-2500 nm) on various days after inoculation (DAIs) for the three infection stages. These hyperspectral data were processed to select disease specific spectral features (DSSFs). Such DSSFs were then used to feed the machine learning based sequential floating forward selection (ML-SFFS) methodology for determining the optimal feature combination (OFC) and overall accuracy (OA) in the detection of RLB at various infection stages.
   The results demonstrated that the rice plants displayed considerable biochemical and spectral variations and this pattern of variations existed consistently during plant-pathogen interactions. A multivariate pool of DSSFs comprising two reflectance bands, fourteen SIs, and five continuous wavelet coefficients, were determined for revealing the dynamic response of RLB infection across two years. The combination of 2 to 4 spectral features selected by the ML-SFFS algorithm was sufficient to identify infected leaves with classification accuracies over 65% and 80% for the asymptomatic and early infection stages, respectively. The OA could rise up to 95% for the mild stage. Compared to the use of all DSSFs with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the SVM-based SFFS (SVM-SFFS) algorithm prevailed in the classification accuracy up to 10% over the sampling period. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of accurate classification of RLB infected samples by ML-SFFS. This study suggests that reflectance spectroscopy has great potential in the pre-visual detection of RLB infection and airborne or spaceborne imaging spectroscopy is promising for the mapping of early occurrence and severity levels of RLB infection at large scales.

AB Changes in glacier facies (glacier zones), such as firn or superimposed ice (SI), are good indicators of glacier response to climate change. They are especially important for fast-warming Svalbard, where only a few glaciers are under glaciological mass balance monitoring. This paper presents a first study of changes of glacier facies extent for three tidewater glaciers located in southern Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and it is based on both satellite remote sensing and terrestrial data analysis, covering two time spans: 2007-2017 for Hansbreen and 2012-2017 for Storbreen and Hornbreen. Satellite remote sensing analysis include unsupervised classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from both decommissioned (ENVISAT ASAR) and modern satellite missions (RAD-ARSAT-2, Sentinel-1). The results of the SAR classification are compared to the information on glacier zones retrieved from terrestrial data, i.e. shallow cores and visual interpretation of 800 MHz Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiles. In addition, a novel application of the Internal Reflection Power (IRP) coefficient as an objective method of distinguishing glacier zones based on GPR data is discussed. Changes in glacier facies areas over time are analysed, as well as their correlation to Hansbreen's mass balance. The main finding of the study is that firn and SI of Hansbreen, Storbreen and Hornbreen significantly decreased over the study period. For example, due to continuous negative mass balance between 2010 and 2017, the contribution of firn area to Hansbreen's total area decreased ca. 14% (cumulative firn area loss during that time: similar to 45%) whereas since 2012 SI has not been distinguished as a vast area on this glacier. In addition, an east-west gradient of firn area loss was observed as a result of differences in local climate conditions. Therefore, for the common time span (i.e. 2012-2017) Hansbreen recorded a ca. 12% loss of firn contribution to glacier area whereas Hornbreen recorded ca. 9%. Finally, application of the IRP coefficient as an objective method of glacier zones discrimination by GPR data gave very good results, so the method is recommended for future analysis of glacier zones instead, or as a support, to popular visual interpretation of the GPR profiles.

AB Spectrally-based retrieval of bathymetry is challenging in inland/coastal waters due to variations in factors other than water depth across a water body, including bottom type, optically significant constituents, water surface roughness, and others. Optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) is the most widely used method to deal with these confounding effects to retrieve water depth. OBRA identifies the pair of bands that provides the highest accuracy among all possible pairs when using a log-transformed band ratio model. However, this approach fits a single ratio model to all training samples without fully accounting for the heterogeneity of the aforementioned complicating factors. To deal with this problem, we introduce a novel method called Sample-specific Multiple bAnd Ratio Technique for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SMART-SDB). The proposed SMART-SDB technique partitions the feature space of the spectral data and creates for every subspace a different band ratio model that performs better than the other models within that subspace. Bathymetry is then predicted based on the closest model/s in the feature space by performing a sample-specific k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) analysis. The depth estimates provided by the neighboring models are averaged with weights proportional to their inverse distance in the feature space. The proposed method can be used in both inland and coastal waters. Here, we thoroughly examine its effectiveness in the challenging and heterogenous environments of fluvial systems using a wide range of spectral data including radiative transfer simulations, an airborne hyperspectral image of the Snake River (USA), and a WorldView-3 satellite image of the Sarca River (Italy). The results of this study indicate a significant improvement in depth retrieval for estimations based on the SMART-SDB method relative to standard OBRA, either when a single model or multiple models are employed.

AB Land cover mapping in complex environments can be challenging due to their landscape heterogeneity. With the increasing availability of various open-access remotely sensed datasets, more images acquired by different sensors and on different dates tend to be used to improve land cover classification accuracy. Selecting an appropriate feature domain with the best landscape separability is therefore crucial in meeting the requirement of computational efficiency and model interpretability. Variable selection is widely used in pattern recognition to enhance model parsimony. This study focused on the variable selection process and proposed a series of methods to select the optimal feature domain to improve land cover classification in a complex urbanized coastal area. Two decision tree models (CART-Classification and Regression Tree and CIT-Conditional Inference Tree) and five variable importance measures (GINI, PVIM-Permutated Variable Importance Measure, MDMinimum Depth, IPM-Intervention of Prediction Measure, and CPVIM-Conditional Permutation Variable Importance Measure) based on random forests were considered. Variable importance measures were applied to a set of spectral, spatial and temporal features derived from medium-resolution satellite images. Backward elimination methods were used to select the optimal feature subset. It is found that compared to the traditional band-only model, the variable selection process can significantly improve the model parsimony and computational efficiency. The CPVIM based on CIT decision tree model was more reliable in selecting relevant features regardless their correlations, but CART tended to generate higher classification accuracy. Therefore, the combination of the CART model and the ranking from the CPVIM variable measure is recommended to achieve higher classification accuracy and better data interpretability. The novelty of our work is with the insight into the merits of integrating variable selection in the land cover classification process over complex environments.

AB Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) has been applied in permafrost environments to detect surface deformation caused by freeze-thaw processes in the active layer and underlying permafrost. The effectiveness of Sentinel-1 InSAR in monitoring ground surface deformation over continuous permafrost terrain above the treeline has been proven. The heterogeneous landscape and developed vegetation cover increase the difficulty of applying D-InSAR in sub-Arctic discontinuous permafrost terrain. The potential of Sentinel-1 InSAR in such an environment has not been fully explored. In this study, we explore the capabilities and limitations of applying Sentinel-1 time series data for monitoring surface deformation over discontinuous permafrost terrain. The interferometric coherence time series from September 2016 to April 2018 were analyzed over typical landscapes in discontinuous permafrost environments and their thaw subsidence curves are revealed by the small-baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technique. The seasonal thaw subsidence in the summer of 2017 was in the range of 15-80 mm in the study area. The land cover types with thaw subsidence magnitudes from low to high are exposed land, peatland, lichen-low shrub, lichen-dominated and wetland low vegetation. The difference in displacement pattern between lichen-dominated and wetland-low vegetation-dominated permafrost terrains is especially clear at the end of the thawing stage, in September and October. The differences in thaw subsidence magnitude and pattern reveal the influence of the soil water content in the active layer and permafrost properties on the thaw subsidence patterns. We also compared the Sentinel-1 retrieved cumulative displacement with the X-band TerraSAR-X and L-band ALOS PALSAR results. The difference of retrieved deformation magnitude using the three sensors is amplified when shrubs are more developed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-1 time series with a 6-day or 12-day span work well over discontinuous permafrost terrain above the tree line (i.e., tundra, tundra wetlands and less developed shrub-tundra environments) during the thawed season, but the results and accuracy are not promising over developed shrub-tundra and, especially forest-tundra environments.

AB Surface soil moisture is a vital variable in the process of energy exchange between the land and atmosphere. Monitoring the surface soil moisture at the local and global scales has become feasible due to the development of microwave remote sensing. With the new development of potential satellite missions, it is important to evaluate existing soil moisture retrieval algorithms, which will greatly contribute to the improvement of current soil moisture products and the development of new methodologies. This paper compared the performance of four well-known soil moisture retrieval algorithms with L-band radiometry at fixed incidence angles, including the single channel algorithm at horizontal polarization (SCA-H), the single channel algorithm at vertical polarization (SCA-V), the dual channel algorithm (DCA), and the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). The experimental data used for evaluation was from the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR), which consists of variable angular ground-based and airborne observations covering a wide range of incidence angles (22.5 degrees-55 degrees) at L-band. The microwave radiative transfer models are set to be consistent to guarantee that the four different algorithms are comparable. The results showed that the retrieval accuracy of the SCA-H and SCA-V is significantly affected by the input vegetation optical depth, and the calibration of vegetation parameters should be considered in the implementation of the SCA-H and SCA-V. The DCA does not rely on the auxiliary vegetation information and can also achieve good performance for both the soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. However, its retrieval requires a penalty on parameter constraints since the input brightness temperatures at horizontal and vertical polarization are correlated. The LPRM has a poor performance at incidence angles less than 30 degrees, as it analytically utilizes the polarization difference in the brightness temperature, which is quite small at lower incidence angles. The accuracy of four soil moisture algorithms achieve their best performances at intermediate incidence angles of 40 degrees to 45 degrees, and is slightly degraded when the incident angles increased to larger than 50 degrees, which is contributed to the increasing vegetation effects and depolarization that leads to an information loss. These findings provide quantitative evidence to help understand the differences in various current soil moisture algorithms and further promote the development of new methodologies for future soil moisture missions.

AB With less than a decade left to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this communication aims to improve understanding of the enabling environment that is essential for Earth observations (EO) to be fully adopted within the institutional settings that drive the implementation of the SDGs and the Global Indicator Framework, an effective review mechanism for tracking progress at global to national and local levels. This paper also serves as an introduction to the Remote Sensing of Environment's Special Issue (SI) on Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development Goals. The seventeen contributions published in this SI showcase the application of EO data, methods, and tools to support countries in target setting for the SDGs, including baseline determination, as well as tracking of progress on SDG implementation and informing sustainable development planning and decision making. The majority of published articles focus on Goals 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 14 (Life below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). We also present our own analysis of existing EO systems available to generate data for SDG indicators addressed via the SI contributions, including main resolution characteristics, and assess factors that hinder the full integration of EO solutions for the SDGs within country processes, institutions of government, and policies. We conclude that an urgent need exists for the EO community to work more closely with local and regional governments and other relevant stakeholders to promote the operationalization of EO solutions for implementing the 2030 Agenda at global to local levels. Our review also illustrates the need for transitioning towards new EO for SDG frameworks that are focused on the knowledge element of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom paradigm, rather than the data and information aspects.

AB A new aerosol component approach that infers aerosol species fractions from satellite observations was developed and incorporated by Li et al. (2019) into Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. In the current work we employ this aerosol component approach for derivation and analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of black and brown carbon (BC and BrC) concentrations in East and South Asia using POLDER/PARASOL satellite observations during 2005-2013. The inter-comparison of the satellite retrieved and in situ measured BC in China shows a reasonably good agreement for both monthly averaged and daily values. The distribution of light-absorbing carbon (BC and BrC) shows a significant temporal variation cycle with increases matching the months known for strong biomass burning or fossil fuels combustion emissions. The main concentrations of BC are found near the fire or anthropogenic emission regions, while concentrations of BrC are predominantly distanced from the emission sources. Seasonal means of BC/(BC + BrC) ratio in East and South Asia are also presented. High ratios (above 0.5) in Northeast India and North China during December, January, and February can be attributed to fossil fuels combustion and anthropogenic emissions. Medium ratios (around 0.2-0.3) over the Indo-China Peninsula and Northeast China during March, April, and May are associated with the biomass burning (e.g., forest fires, agriculture waste burning). The provided observationally-based retrievals of BC, BrC, and BC/(BC + BrC) are believed to be of high importance for constraining the aerosol modeling and reducing the uncertainties of the model estimations.

AB Accurate crop mapping provides important and timely information for decision support on the estimation of crop production at large scale. Most existing crop-specific cover products based on remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms cannot serve large agriculture production areas as a result of poor model transfer capabilities. Developing a generalizable crop classification model for spatial transfer across regions is greatly needed. A deep learning approach, named DeepCropMapping (DCM), has been developed based on long short-term memory structure with attention mechanisms through integrating multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data for large-scale dynamic corn and soybean mapping. Full cross validation of classification experiments were conducted in six sites each covering 2,890,000 pixels at 30 m resolution in the U.S. corn belt from Year 2015 to 2018. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were adopted as the input satellite observations and ground reference, respectively. Transformer, Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were built for comparison. The DCM model produced a mean kappa score of 85.8% in base sites and a mean average kappa score of 82.0% in transfer sites at the end of the growing season. It yielded a comparable performance to Transformer and better than RF and MLP at the local test. The DCM model significantly outperformed other three models with a 95% confidence interval in the spatial transfer analysis. The results demonstrated the capability of learning generalizable features by the DCM model from ARD time series. The computational complexity analysis suggested that the DCM model required a shorter training time than Transformer but longer than MLP and RF. The results of the in-season classification experiment indicated the DCM model captured critical information from key growth phases and achieved higher accuracy than other models after the beginning of July. By monitoring the classification confidence in each time step, the results showed that the increased length of seasonal remote sensing time series would reduce the classification uncertainty in all sites. This study provided a viable option toward large-scale dynamic crop mapping through the integration of deep learning and remote sensing time series.

AB There is a growing realization amongst policy-makers that reliable and accurate soil monitoring information is required at scales ranging from regional to global to support ecosystem functions and services in a sustainable manner under the amplifying climate change enabling countries in target setting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this line, the need of access to and integration of existing regional in situ Earth Observation (EO) data and different sources such as contemporary and forthcoming satellite imagery is highlighted. The current study puts major emphasis on leveraging existing open soil spectral libraries and EO systems and bridging them with memory-based learning algorithms that create more cost-efficient and targeted large scale mapping of soil properties. Relying mostly on contemporary capacities and open resources it can be readily applied to countries with differing capacities and levels of development. To test our methodology, the GEOCRADLE SSL developed in the Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa region and a hyperspectral airborne image were utilized to provide Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) maps of cropland fields over an agricultural region near the city of Netanya, Israel. Furthermore, simulated data of forthcoming space-borne satellite (EnMAP) and current super-spectral mission (Sentinel 2) were explored. The SOC content of the collected in situ soil samples was predicted using a novel local regression approach that combines spatial proximity and spectral similarities. These predictions were subsequently used to develop models using the airborne and simulated satellite spectra, achieving a fair prediction accuracy of R-2 > 0.8 and RPIQ > 2.

AB Habitat mapping is an essential descriptor to monitor and manage natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Habitats integrate both the environmental conditions and the related biodiversity. However, it remains challenging to map certain habitats such as inland wetlands due to spectral, spatial and temporal variability in the vegetation cover. Currently, no satellite constellations optimize the spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions required to map wetlands according to the habitats discriminated from in situ surveys. Our approach aims to combine satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to exceed their respective limitations. Both data sources were combined through a spectral unmixing algorithm with the hypothesis that endmembers from UAV data are pure enough to enhance plant community abundances estimated from satellite data. The experiment was conducted on the regional preserve of the Sougeal marsh, a wet grassland of 174 ha located upstream of the Mont-SaintMichel Bay. Two satellite data sources - Sentinel-2 and Pleiades - and three acquisition periods - November 2017, April 2018 and May 2018 - were considered. A reference map of plant community distribution was produced from UAV multitemporal data and floristic surveys to validate the unmixing of satellite data. This study shows innovative results and perspectives: while UAV can improve habitat discrimination, results vary among acquisition periods and habitats. Results illustrate well the great potential of combined UAV and satellite data but also demonstrate the influence of endmembers on the unmixing process and technical limitations (e.g. spectral mismatches between sensors), which can be overcome using domain adaptation.

AB Global surface water extent is changing due to natural processes as well as anthropogenic drivers such as reservoir construction and conversion of wetlands to agriculture. However, the extent and change of global inland surface water are not well quantified. To address this, we classified land and water in all 3.4 million Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scenes from 1999 to 2018 and performed a time-series analysis to produce maps that characterize interannual and infra-annual open surface water dynamics. We also used a probability sample and reference time-series classification of land and water for 1999-2018 to provide unbiased estimators of area of stable and dynamic surface water extent and to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. From the reference sample data, we estimate that permanent surface water covers 2.93 (standard error +/- 0.09) million km(2), and during this time period an estimated 138,011 (+/- 28,163) km(2) underwent only gain of surface water, over double the estimated 53,154 (+/- 10,883) km(2) that underwent only loss of surface water. The estimated area of 950,719 (+/- 104,034) km(2) that experienced recurring change between land and water states is far greater than the area undergoing these unidirectional trends. From a probability sample of high resolution imagery, an estimated 10.9% (+/- 1.9%) of global inland surface water is within mixed pixels at Landsat resolution indicating that monitoring of surface water changes requires improved spatial detail. We provide the first unbiased area estimators of open surface water extent and its changes with associated uncertainties and illustrate the challenges of tracking changes in surface water area using medium spatial and temporal resolution data.

AB Measurements of reflected solar radiation by imaging spectrometers can quantify water in different states (solid, liquid, gas) thanks to the discriminative absorption shapes. We developed a retrieval method to quantify the amount of water in each of the three states from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data, such as those from the German EnMAP mission. The retrieval couples atmospheric radiative transfer simulations from the MODTRAN5 radiative transfer code to a surface reflectance model based on the Beer-Lambert law. The model is inverted on a per-pixel basis using a maximum likelihood estimation formalism. Based on a unique coupling of the canopy reflectance model HySimCaR and the EnMAP end-to-end simulation tool EeteS, we performed a sensitivity analysis by comparing the retrieved values with the simulation input leading to an R-2 of 0.991 for water vapor and 0.965 for liquid water. Furthermore, we applied the algorithm to airborne AVIRIS-C data to demonstrate the ability to map snow/ice extent as well as to a CHRIS-PROBA dataset for which concurrent field measurements of canopy water content were available. The comparison between the retrievals and the ground measurements showed an overall R-2 of 0.80 for multiple crop types and a remarkable clustering in the regression analysis indicating a dependency of the retrieved water content from the physical structure of the vegetation. In addition, the algorithm is able to produce smoother and more physically-plausible water vapor maps than the ones from the band ratio approaches used for multispectral data, since biases due to background reflectance are reduced. The demonstrated potential of imaging spectroscopy to provide accurate quantitative measures of water from space will be further exploited using upcoming spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions like PRISMA or EnMAP.

AB The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) produces the latest generation of satellite precipitation estimates and has been widely used since its release in 2014. IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products.

AB The terrestrial carbon cycle is an important component of the global carbon budget due to its large gross exchange fluxes with the atmosphere and their sensitivity to climate change. Terrestrial biosphere models show large uncertainties in simulating carbon fluxes, which impact global carbon budget assessments. The land surface carbon cycle is tightly controlled by soil moisture through plant physiological processes. Accurate soil moisture observations thereby have the potential to improve the modeling of carbon fluxes in a model-data fusion framework. We employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) to assimilate six years of surface soil moisture provided by the SMOS satellite in combination with global-scale observations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that assimilation of SMOS soil moisture exhibits better performance on soil hydrology modeling at both global and site-level than only assimilating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and it improves the soil moisture simulation particularly in mid- to high-latitude regions where the plants suffer from water stress frequently. The optimized model also shows good agreements with inter-annual variability in simulated Net Primary Productivity (NEP) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from an atmospheric inversion (Jena CarboScope) and the up-scaled eddy covariance flux product (FLUXNET-MTE), respectively. Correlation between SIF (Solar Induced Fluorescence) and optimized GPP also shows to be the highest when soil moisture and atmospheric CO2 are simultaneously assimilated. In general, CCDAS obtains smaller annual mean NEP values (1.8 PgC/yr) than the atmospheric inversion and an ensemble of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), but larger GPP values (167.8 PgC/yr) than the up-scaled eddy covariance dataset (FLUXNET-MTE) and the MODIS based GPP product for the years 2010 to 2015. This study demonstrates the high potential of constraining simulations of the terrestrial biosphere carbon cycle on inter-annual time scales using long-term microwave observations of soil moisture.

AB Quantifying global photosynthesis remains a challenge due to a lack of accurate remote sensing proxies. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to be a good indicator of photosynthetic activity across various spatial scales. However, a global and spatially challenging estimate of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) based on satellite SIF remains unresolved due to the confounding effects of species-specific physical and physiological traits and external factors, such as canopy structure or photosynthetic pathway (C-3 or C-4). Here we analyze an ensemble of far-red SIF data from OCO-2 satellite and ground observations at multiple sites, using the spectral invariant theory to reduce the effects of canopy structure and to retrieve a structure-corrected total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal). We find that the relationships between observed canopy-leaving SIF and ecosystem GPP vary significantly among biomes. In contrast, the relationships between SIFtotal and GPP converge around two unique models, one for C-3 and one for C-4 plants. We show that the two single empirical models can be used to globally scale satellite SIF observations to terrestrial GPP. We obtain an independent estimate of global terrestrial GPP of 129.56 +/- 6.54 PgC/year for the 2015-2017 period, which is consistent with the state-of-the-art data- and process-oriented models. The new GPP product shows improved sensitivity to previously undetected 'hotspots' of productivity, being able to resolve the double-peak in GPP due to rotational cropping systems. We suggest that the direct scheme to estimate GPP presented here, which is based on satellite SIF, may open up new possibilities to resolve the dynamics of global terrestrial GPP across space and time.

AB The value of combining Landsat time series and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to produce regional maps of forest structure has been well documented. However, studies are often performed over single study areas or forest types, preventing a robust assessment of the approaches that produce the most accurate estimates. Here, we use Landsat time series data to estimate forest attributes across six Canadian study sites, which vary by forest type, productivity, management regime, and disturbance history, with the goal of investigating which spectral indices and time series lengths yield the most accurate estimates of forest attributes across a range of conditions. We use estimates of stand height, basal area, and stem volume derived from ALS data as calibration and validation data, and develop random forest models to estimate forest structure with Landsat time series data and topographic variables at each site. Landsat time series predictors, which were derived from annual gap-free image composites, included the median, interquartile range, and Theil Sen slope of vegetation indices through time. To investigate the optimal time series length for predictor variables, time series length was varied from 1 to 33 years. Across all six sites, increasing the time series length led to improved estimation accuracy, however the optimal time series length was not consistent across sites. Specifically, model accuracies plateaued at a time series length of similar to 15 years for two sites (R-2 = 0.67-0.74), while the accuracies continued to increase until the maximum time series length was reached (24-29 years) for the remaining four sites (R-2 = 0.45-0.70). Spectral indices that relied on shortwave infrared bands (Tasseled Cap Wetness and Normalized Burn Ratio) were frequently the most important spectral indices. Adding Landsat-derived disturbance variables (time since last disturbance, type of disturbance) did not meaningfully improve model results; however, this finding was largely due to the fact that most recently disturbed stands did not have predictions of forest attributes from ALS, so disturbed sites were poorly represented in the models. As model accuracies varied regionally and no optimal time series length was found, we provide an approach that can be utilized to determine the optimal time series length on a case by case basis, allowing users to extrapolate estimates of forest attributes both spatially and temporally using multispectral time series data.

AB Cropping intensity has undergone dramatic changes worldwide due to the effects of climate changes and human management activities. Cropping intensity is an important factor contributing to crop production and food security at local, regional and national scales, and is a critical input data variable for many global climate, land surface, and crop models. To generate annual cropping intensity maps at large scales, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with mixed land cover types within a pixel (mixed pixel), and Landsat images at 30-m spatial resolution suffer from low temporal resolution (16-day). To overcome these limitations, we developed a straightforward and efficient pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to generate annual cropping intensity maps over large spatial domains at high spatial resolution by integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series image data for 2016-2018 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In this pilot study, we report annual cropping intensity maps for 2017 at 30-m spatial resolution over seven study areas selected according to agro-climatic zones in China. Based on field-scale sample data, the annual cropping intensity maps for the study areas had overall accuracy rates of 89-99%, with Kappa coefficients of 0.76-0.91. The overall accuracy of the annual cropping intensity maps was 93%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. These cropping intensity maps can also be used to enable identification of various crop types from phenological information extracted from the growth cycle of each crop. These algorithms can be readily applied to other regions in China to generate annual cropping intensity maps and quantify inter-annual cropping intensity variations at the national scale with a greatly improved accuracy.

AB Structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms coupled with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a popular tool in the geosciences for modelling complex landscapes on-demand allowing for high-resolution topographic change-detection studies to be conducted at minimal cost. To identify the effects of UAV image orientation on the accuracy of SfM-MVS 3D surface models, we tested four different UAV image acquisition schemes that incorporated both nadir and oblique imagery of an agricultural field. The coupling of nadir and oblique imaging angles led to the highest surface model accuracy in the absence of ground control points (GCPs; vertical RMSE: 0.047 m, horizontal RMSE: 0.019 m), while with a normative distribution of GCPs the nadir-only image sets had similar accuracy metrics (vertical RMSE 0.028 m, hotizontal RMSE 0.017 m) to surface models generated with nadir and oblique imaging angles (vertical RMSE 0.028 m, horizontal RMSE 0.013 m). Homologous keypoint matching between nadir and oblique imagery was poor when the survey conditions were bright and the surface texture of the field was homogeneous, leading to broad-scale vertical noise in the generated surface models. Results indicate that a nadir-only image set accompanied with a dense deployment of GCPs is the most ideal for SfM-MVS agricultural 3D surface reconstructions. The diachronic analysis of surface models generated from nadir-only image sets were able to detect surface-change > 0.040 m in depth (i.e., rill and gully erosion, depositional zones) and were comparable to results obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner. Stable GCPs should be used where possible to ensure precise co-registration between subsequent UAV surveys.

AB The quantification of vegetation height for the circumpolar Arctic tundra biome is of interest for a wide range of applications, including biomass and habitat studies as well as permafrost modelling in the context of climate change. To date, only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time. The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents, but the high variability of near-surface soil moisture during the snow-free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose. We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C-band SAR data acquired in winter (close to zero liquid water content). To test our hypothesis, we used C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44 cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 54 cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TC). Retrieval from C-band SAR shows similar performance, but C-VV is more suitable than C-HH to derive vegetation height (RMSEs of 48 and 56 cm respectively). An exponential relationship with in situ height was evident for all tested parameters (NDVI, TC, C-VV and C-HH) suggesting that the C-band SAR and multi-spectral approaches possess similar capabilities including tundra biomass retrieval. Errors might occur in specific settings as a result of high surface roughness, high photosynthetic activity in wetlands or high snow density. We therefore introduce a method for combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to address the ambiguities related to Arctic wetlands and barren rockfields. Snow-related deviations occur within tundra fire scars in permafrost areas in the case of C-VV use. The impact decreases with age of the fire scar, following permafrost and vegetation recovery. The evaluation of masked C-VV retrievals across different regions, tundra types and sources (in situ and circumpolar vegetation community classification from satellite data) suggests pan-Arctic applicability to map current conditions for heights up to 160 cm. The presented methodology will allow for new applications and provide advanced insight into changing environmental conditions in the Arctic.

AB Preharvest crop yield prediction is critical for grain policy making and food security. Early estimation of yield at field or plot scale also contributes to high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. New developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multi-sensor/multimodal data collection at very high spatial and spectral resolutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multimodal information, such as canopy spectral, structure, thermal and texture features, was extracted and combined to predict crop grain yield using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), input-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F1) and intermediate-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F2). The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R-2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 15.9%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study. Furthermore, DNN-based models demonstrated consistent performance over space with less spatial dependency and variations. This study indicates that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAV within a DNN framework can provide a relatively accurate and robust estimation of crop yield, and deliver valuable insight for high-throughput phenotyping and crop field management with high spatial precision.

AB Since 2010, SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) retrievals of surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) have been produced through the inversion of the so-called Tau-Omega (TO) vegetation emission model. Tau-Omega is a 0th-order solution of the radiative transfer equations that neglects multiple scattering, conversely to 1st -order solutions as Two-Stream (2S). To date, very little is known about the compared retrieval performances of these emission models. Here, we inter-compared (SM, VOD) retrievals using the SMOS-IC algorithm running with the TO and 2S emission models. Retrieval performances obtained from TO and 2S were found to be relatively similar, except that a larger dry bias and a slightly lower SM unbiased RMSD were obtained with 2S and the VOD values of the two models vary over dense vegetation areas, both in terms of magnitude and seasonal variations. Considering this and the enhanced physical background of 2S that allows its implementation as a unified emission model for different applications, our study reveals the high interest of using Two-Stream in global retrieval algorithms at L-band.

AB Extensive high-latitude regions, such as northern deltaic ecosystems, are challenging to access due to remoteness and cold conditions during extended periods of the year. The hydro-ecological state of shallow water ecosystems can be influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g., flow regulation, water abstraction) and climate variability/change. Therefore, they need to be monitored to provide baseline and impact data. In this paper, we capitalize on the water - vegetation interaction to evaluate relative water level variations on wetlands of one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world between the years 2012 and 2016 by exploiting RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its differential interferometric configuration (D-InSAR). The influence of different terrain models on the topographic phase correction is also evaluated. Results revealed complex hydrodynamics in the water bodies studied and inferences of environmental processes taking place that modify local landforms and influence water level fluctuations. Comparison between D-InSAR derived water displacements and those measured at specific hydrometric stations indicates overall reliable results. The analysis proposed can be extended to study dynamics of deltaic lakes and wetlands in other areas of the globe.

AB Though urbanization is often linked to development gains, some regions in Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa have grown in urban population, while remaining bereft of basic services like reliable electricity. Daytime optical remote sensing has tracked urban land cover change for decades, but there have been few studies that have monitored whether infrastructure is keeping pace with demographic and land transitions. Here, we explore how fusing multi-temporal population and land data with nighttime lights data, derived from the Suomi-NPP VIIRS Day Night Band, can add to our understanding of urban infrastructural transitions. We classify urban changes in India and the US, using these three measures in tandem to create a typology of urban development processes. When compared against survey data, our results indicate the classification can track rural electrification and identify growing informal settlements with inadequate infrastructure, and is therefore useful for monitoring progress towards two Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 7.1 (ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) and Goal 11.1 (ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums). The classification results also illustrate the diversity of urban development processes, and how uni-dimensional measures of urbanization, greatly under-represent urban change, particularly in high-income countries.

AB The paper deals with development and validation of a VHF band airborne radar designed for subsurface exploration. The radar system is a pulsed one and transmits a chirp pulse at the central frequency of 165 MHz with 40 MHz bandwidth. A preliminary system validation has been performed by means of flight trials over Morocco desert in May 2018. An ad-hoc signal processing technique has been developed to produce focused images of the scene under investigation starting from raw and motion uncompensated data. In particular, the data processing technique is based on a microwave tomographic approach that has the novel feature to compensate the distortion effects produced by the non-rectilinear motion of the aircraft based on navigation data. The analysis and interpretation of the data is supported by comparison with electromagnetic simulations of the scene.

AB Plant functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that characterizes the variability of functional traits within a community, landscape, or even large spatial scales. It can influence ecosystem processes and stability. Hence, it is important to understand how and why FD varies within and between ecosystems, along resources availability gradients and climate gradients, and across vegetation successional stages. Usually, FD is assessed through labor-intensive field measurements, while assessing FD from space may provide a way to monitor global FD changes in a consistent, time and resource efficient way. The potential of operational satellites for inferring FD, however, remains to be demonstrated. Here we studied the relationships between FD and spectral reflectance measurements taken by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite over 117 field plots located in 6 European countries, with 46 plots having in-situ sampled leaf traits and the other 71 using traits from the TRY database. These field plots represent major European forest types, from boreal forests in Finland to Mediterranean mixed forests in Spain. Based on in-situ data collected in 2013 we computed functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of FD, using foliar and whole-plant traits of known ecological significance. These included five foliar traits: leaf nitrogen concentration (N%), leaf carbon concentration (%C), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA). In addition they included three whole-plant traits: tree height (H), crown cross-sectional area (CCSA), and diameter-at-breast-height (DBH). We applied partial least squares regression using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance measured in 2015 as predictive variables to model in-situ FDis measurements. We predicted, in cross-validation, 55% of the variation in the observed FDis. We also showed that the rededge, near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of Sentinel-2 are more important than the visible region for predicting FDis. An initial 30-m resolution mapping of FDis revealed large local FDis variation within each forest type. The novelty of this study is the effective integration of spaceborne and in-situ measurements at a continental scale, and hence represents a key step towards achieving rapid global biodiversity monitoring schemes.

AB The construction of hydropower dams is a common strategy to support a country's increasing need for electricity and river water management for industry and agriculture. Although the hydrological and geophysical impacts of water relocation are usually assessed prior to impoundment, their accuracy is generally limited due to the lack of in situ observations, especially in a remote area. This study presents a workflow to quantify the terrestrial water storage change ( TWS) and land subsidence induced by a reservoir's water impoundment using multiple satellite observations (GRACE, Landsat), land surface models (CABLE, GLDAS, NCEP, ECMWF), and GPS data. The study site is the Bakun Dam, located in Sarawak, Malaysia, which is the largest hydropower dam in Southeast Asia. Commencing operation in late 2010, the dam induced a change of water mass and lake surface area that was clearly observed by GRACE and Landsat observations, respectively. During the 17-month impounding period (from August 2010 to December 2011), GRACE observed a dramatic increase of approximately 200 mm equivalent water height, while Landsat detected an increased lake extent of around 600 km(2). In this paper, a forward model is developed to determine the increased water surface level corresponding to GRACE observations, estimated to be about 120 m. In contrast to GRACE, the TWS derived from land surface models cannot capture the increased TWS, due to the lack of reservoir routing algorithms in the models. In addition, the land subsidence was calculated using the disk load model constructed based on the GRACE-derived lake level and Landsat-derived lake extent; the result is validated with the GPS data from BIN1 station, located at the western coast of Borneo. The commencement stage of the Bakun Dam induces the large-scale land subsidence, which causes the GPS-BIN1 station to subside by similar to 9 mm, and move toward the Bakun Lake by similar to 4 mm. Computation of the surface displacements directly from GRACE spherical harmonic coefficient data fails to capture the subsidence feature, mainly due to the truncation error. Overall, this study demonstrates that evaluating GRACE in conjunction with Landsat, LSMs, and GPS data allows the exploitation of the gravity signal at a much smaller spatial scale than its intrinsic resolution. Benefiting from global coverage, the newly developed satellite-based algorithm is a valuable tool for assessing the impacts of reservoir operation on hydrological and geophysical changes from local to regional scales.

AB The sustainability of Angkor World Heritage site (Cambodia) has been of increasing concern due to rapid socioeconomic development of the surrounding region including the booming city of Siem Reap. We interpret findings from satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) motion fields for the period 2007-2017 to derive new insights into the dynamics of the relationship between land subsidence, groundwater extraction and monument stability. Evolution of motion trends along with hydraulic heads indicated that the surface in the archaeological zone was stable up to 2011, followed by a mild subsidence during 2011-2017, primarily impacted by unregulated tourism development. Spatially decline of groundwater table beneath Siem Reap City could, in the future, threaten the stability of monuments. We developed a model that predicted that surface subsidence in the central archaeological zone could reach up to -3.6 to -3.8 mm/yr by 2021 if a 6% annual increase of tourists and the resulting demand for groundwater resources continued. A tourism carrying capacity below 2.5 million per year may be sustainable to prevent the emergence of hydrological problems that could exacerbate the risk of significant land subsidence and consequences for monument stability. This study is a clear illustration of the value of InSAR space-eye combined with ground-based measurements for monitoring potential hazards and modelling conservation states of World Heritage sites in order to improve preparedness critical for mitigating future threats.

AB The SWIR-radiance FRP method is applied to the Along Track Scanning Radiometer series of sensors, and the follow-on Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) sensor to provide both the longest and the most recent assessment of global gas flaring activity to date. Our inventory covers more than two decades, and demonstrates that total flare site numbers peak in 2008 (similar to 14,000 global 1-arcminute grid cells containing flares) and that since then there has been an overall reduction to mid-2018 (similar to 10,400 cells) When considering radiant heat output (SWIR-radiance derived FRP), a downward global trend identified between 2000 (similar to 15.1 GW) and 2011 (similar to 12.4 GW) has stalled, with a slight increase observed by mid-2018 (similar to 13 GW). We also find through calibration against flared gas quantities derived from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP) satellites, that 131 billion cubic metres of natural gas has been flared globally between May 2017 and May 2018.

AB A physically-based framework to address the underestimation and missed detection errors in Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Precipitation Radar (PR) in regions of complex terrain is presented. The framework is demonstrated using GPM Ku-PR because of its wider swath. GPM Ku-PR precipitation estimates are evaluated against ground validation (GV) observations from the long-term ground-based rain-gauge network in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. The detection and estimation errors exhibit a diurnal cycle consistent with the diurnal cycle of low-level clouds and fog (LLCF), thus suggesting the importance of low-level orographic microphysical processes. Contamination of near-surface reflectivity profiles due to ground-clutter is the major source of error in the Ku-PR QPE with spatial features that mirror landform. In particular, GPM Ku-PR drop size distribution (DSD) retrieval algorithms systematically overestimate D-m (mass-weighted mean diameter), and underestimate N-w (normalized DSD intercept) and the precipitation-rate when low-level multilayer clouds and fog are present. Second, column simulations of rainfall dynamics constrained by reflectivity measurements show an emergent relationship in D-m-N-w phase-space that explains an increase in the frequency of D-m < 1 mm in disdrometer observations due to seeder-feeder interactions (SFI) not captured by current retrieval microphysical products. To resolve ambiguity in the detection and characterization of SFI regimes, we demonstrate a physically-based framework to improve GPM Ku-PR orographic QPE that relies on a coupled microphysics-radar rainfall forward model to estimate DSD parameters using initial and boundary conditions from Ku-PR DSD estimates (Method-1), Ku-PR corrected reflectivity measurements (Method-2), and LLCF microphysics from GV observations. Model simulations using Method-2 produce realistic surface DSDs confirming that representation of SFI processes is critical. Application of the framework to GPM overpasses shows potential for robust improvement in QPE and elucidates the physical basis for improved retrievals against ground observations corresponding to which N-w increases by 3-5 dBNw, D-m decreases by approximately 0.03 mm, and rain-rate increases up to ten-fold in the presence of SFI.

AB Plant photosynthetic traits may be indicative of stress tolerance and performance in the field, making their accurate assessment critical in phenotyping trials. The maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) is a key parameter for estimating CO2 assimilation (A), as it controls the CO2 fixation rate. This study demonstrates the utility of combining airborne- based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and hyperspectral imagery through the inversion of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) model to estimate Vcmax, using sensor resolutions available in precision agriculture technologies. Vcmax was quantified in three wheat phenotyping experimental fields during the 2015-2018 growing seasons, comprising both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Airborne campaigns were carried out with two hyperspectral sensors, covering the 400-850 nm (20 cm resolution) and 950-1750 nm (70 cm resolution) spectral regions, and with a thermal camera (25 cm resolution) in the 8-14 mu m region. Validation between model-estimated and field-measured Vcmax was statistically significant (r(2) = 0.77; p-value <= 2.2e - 16), and Vcmax was reliably associated with net assimilation both in irrigated and rainfed conditions (r(2) = 0.65 and 0.5, respectively). By contrast, simulated chlorophyll content (Cab) and airborne-derived structural and chlorophyll indicators (NDVI and PSSRb) lacked significant correlations with assimilation rate in irrigated plots, while the relationship between assimilation rate and the crop water stress index (CWSI) was not significant in rainfed plots. The superior sensitivity of remotely-sensed Vcmax under irrigated conditions was likely related to its robustness to distortions from high canopy densities observed in other indices. The remote sensing retrieval of Vcmax, and the methodology demonstrated in this study is directly relevant for high-throughput plant phenotyping and for precision agriculture applications.

AB Human activities have fundamentally changed Earth's climate and land surface in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to the proposal of a new geologic epoch known as the Anthropocene. One major ecological perturbation underway over the past several decades of the Anthropocene is extensive tree and shrub mortality, or forest die-off, triggered by elevated temperatures and prolonged drought, and/or insect and pathogen outbreaks. This increasingly common disturbance has affected forests and woodlands on all vegetated continents and may alter terrestrial carbon fluxes in the biosphere. Remote sensing has enabled mapping of the extent and ecological patterns of tree loss and damage, assessing potential carbon emissions and monitoring ecosystem trajectories after tree mortality. In this review article, we cover drought-induced changes in plant physiology, chemistry, and structure that occur as an individual tree progresses from healthy to stressed to standing dead or coarse woody debris, and corresponding responses in remotely sensed data that provide the opportunity and potential for observation and analysis at large spatial scales and early detection. The linkages between changes associated with tree mortality and remote sensing show exceptional promise for strategic and adaptive natural resource management as climate models project warmer and drier climates in the coming decades.

AB Coastal ecosystem studies using remote visible/infrared spectroscopy typically invert an atmospheric model to estimate the water-leaving reflectance signal. This inversion is challenging due to the confounding effects of turbid backscatter, atmospheric aerosols, and sun glint. Simultaneous estimation of the surface and atmosphere can resolve the ambiguity enabling spectral reflectance maps with rigorous uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate a simultaneous retrieval method that adapts the Optimal Estimation (OE) formalism of Rodgers (2000) to the coastal domain. We compare two surface representations: a parametric bio-optical model based on Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs); and an expressive statistical model that estimates reflectance in every instrument channel. The latter is suited to both land and water reflectance, enabling a unified analysis of terrestrial and aquatic domains. We test these models with both vector and scalar Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs). We report field experiments by two airborne instruments: NASA's Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) in an overflight of Santa Monica, California; and NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) in an overflight of the Wax Lake Delta and lower Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. In both cases, in situ validation measurements match remote water-leaving reflectance estimates to high accuracy. Posterior error predictions demonstrate a closed account of uncertainty in these coastal observations.

AB This paper presents a physically-based snow depth retrieval algorithm adapted for deep mountainous snowpack and airborne multifrequency (10.7, 18.7, 37.0 and 89.0 GHz) passive microwave (PM) radiance observations from a single flight. The algorithm employs a single forecast-analysis cycle of a traditional sequential assimilation scheme. It uses an ensemble of multi-layer snowpack model runs to resolve snow microstructure and melt-refreeze crusts, and microwave radiative transfer models to relate snow properties to microwave measurements. Snow depth was retrieved at a 120 m spatial resolution over three 1 km(2) Intensive Study Areas (ISA) within the Rabbit Ears Meso-Cell Study Area (MSA) from the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) in Colorado (United States) for one date in February 2003. When evaluated against in situ observations, root mean square error (RMSE) of the snow depth from the assimilation was 13.3 cm for areas with low (< 5%) forest cover, which was a reduction of 48% in the RMSE compared with the modeled snow depth when the PM observations were not assimilated, indicating a similar to 5% relative error of the posterior snow depth with respect to the average snow depth (200 cm) measured at these pixels. For pixels with forest cover ranging from 5 to 15% and 15-30%, results were improved (R-2 increased from 0.65 to 0.71 and from 0 to 0.38, respectively) by introducing a forest radiative transfer model during the assimilation.

ID ALTIMETRY; DRIFTER; EGGS
AB We have assessed the use of satellite derived currents to calculate oceanic surface drift, as an alternative to using currents from ocean models. Predicted trajectories are compared to observed trajectories of two types of drifting buoys, which are subject to different degree of wind and wave forcing, in addition to the ocean surface current. This variable degree of ocean-, wind- and wave forcing is highly relevant for the practical problem of predicting the drift of e.g. oil to aid cleanup operations, and the drift of floating objects to aid search and rescue operations. The calculated trajectories are evaluated in terms of separation distance, and a calculated skill score. For the submerged drifters (CODE/DAVIS), we find that a high resolution non-assimilated ocean model gives the best results, whereas a coarser scale assimilated model performs similarly to satellite derived surface currents from the GlobCurrent project (geostrophic + Ekman components). For the wind-exposed drifters (iSphere), the wind drift contribution is found to be dominating, and there is only a small impact of using any of the available information about ocean currents. The wind drift contribution to the iSphere drift is estimated to be 3% of the wind if Stokes drift is included in the calculations, and 4% if the Stokes drift is not included. Including Stokes drift in the calculations gives improvement for the submerged drifters, but shows no improvement for the wind exposed drifters.

AB To be fully operational for facilitating decisions made at any spatial level, models and indicators of soil ecosystem functions require the use of precise spatially referenced soil information as inputs. This study aimed at exploring the capacity for Sentinel-2A (S2A) multispectral satellite images to predict several topsoil properties in two contrasted pedoclimatic environments: a temperate region marked by intensive annual crop cultivation patterns and soils derived from loess or colluvium and/or marine limestone or chalk (Versailles Plain, 221 km(2)); and a Mediterranean region marked by vineyard cultivation and soils derived from lacustrine limestone, calcareous sandstones, colluvium, or alluvial deposits (Peyne catchment, 48 km(2)). Prediction models of soil properties based on partial least squares regressions (PLSR) were built from S2A spectra of 72 and 143 sampling locations across the Versailles Plain and Peyne catchment, respectively. Eight soil surface properties were investigated in both regions: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), texture fractions (Clay, Silt, Sand), Iron, Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content. Predictive abilities were studied according to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) tests, cross-validated coefficient of determination (R-cv(2)) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Intermediate prediction performance outcomes (R-cv(2) and RPD greater than or equal to 0.5 and 1.4, respectively) were obtained for 4 topsoil properties found across the Versailles Plain (SOC, pH, CaCO3 and CEC), and near-intermediate performance outcomes (0.5 > R-cv(2) > 0.39, 1.4 > RPD > 1.3) were yielded for 3 topsoil properties (Clay, Iron, and CEC) found across the Peyne catchment and for 1 property (Clay) found across the Versailles Plain. The study results show what can be expected from Sentinel-2 images in terms of predictive capacities at the regional scale. The spatial structure of the estimated soil properties for bare soils pixels is highlighted, promising further improvements made to spatial prediction models for these properties based on the use of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques.

AB Oceanic chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl, mg m(-3)) maps derived from satellite ocean color measurements are the only data source which provides synoptic information of phytoplankton abundance on global scale. However, after excluding data collected under non-optimal observing conditions such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles, only similar to 5% of MODIS ocean measurements lead to valid Chl retrievals, regardless of the fact that about 25-30% of the global ocean is cloud free. A recently developed ocean color index (CI) is effective in deriving relative ocean color patterns under most non-optimal observing conditions to improve coverage, but these patterns cannot be interpreted as Chl. In this study, we combine the advantage of the high-quality, low-coverage Chl and lower-quality, higher-coverage CI to improve spatial and temporal coverage of Chl through machine learning, specifically via a random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE) approach. For every MODIS scene, the machine learning requires CI, Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc (lambda = 469, 555, 645 nm), dimensionless), and high-quality low-coverage Chl from the common pixels where they all have valid data to develop an RFRE-based model to convert CI and R-rc (lambda) to Chl. The model is then applied to all valid CI pixels of the same scene to derive Chl. This process is repeated for each scene, and the model parameterization is optimized for each scene independently. The approach has been tested for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YSECS) where non-optima) observing conditions frequently occur. Validations using extensive field measurements and image-based statistics for 2017 show very promising results, where coverage in the new Chl maps is increased by similar to 3.5 times without noticeable degradation in quality as compared with the original Chl data products. The improvement in Chl coverage without compromising data quality is not only critical in revealing otherwise unknown bloom patterns, but also important in reducing uncertainties in time series analysis. Tests of the RFRE approach for several other regions such as the East Caribbean, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Mexico suggest its general applicability in improving Chl coverage of other regions.

AB This study explores the potential of vegetation indices (VIs) for crop leaf area index (LAI) estimation, with a focus on comparing red-edge reflectance based (RE-based) and the visible reflectance based (VIS-based) VIs. Seven VIs were derived from multi-temporal RapidEye images to correlate with LAI of two crop species having contrasting leaf structures and canopy architectures: spring wheat (a monocot) and canola (a dicot) in northern Ontario, Canada. The relationship between LAI and the selected VIs (LAI-VI) was characterized using a semi empirical model. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method was used to estimate the model parameters, including the extinction coefficient (K-VI) and VI value for dense green canopy (VI infinity). Results showed that crop-specific regression models were much closer to a generic regression model using the RE-based VIs than using the VIS-based VIs. Furthermore, the joint posterior probability distribution of the K-VI and VI infinity of the RE-based VIs tended to converge for the two crops. This suggests that the RE-based VIs are not as sensitive to canopy structure, e.g., the average leaf angle (ALA), as the VIS-based VIs. This is also demonstrated by the sensitivity analyses using both PROSAIL simulations and field measurements. Hence, the RE-based VIs can be used to develop a more generic LAI estimation algorithm for different crops. Further studies are required to assess the impact of soil reflectance and other factors, such as illumination-target-viewing geometries and atmospheric conditions, on LAI retrieval.

TI Cloud mask-related differential linear adjustment model for MODIS

LA English
DT Article
DE MODIS; Water vapor; Infrared; Cloud mask; Adjustment model
ID GPS METEOROLOGY
AB Water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas of the Earth-atmosphere system and plays a vital role in understanding climate change, if correctly measured from satellites. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can monitor water vapor retrievals at near-infrared (nIR) bands in the daytime as well as at infrared (IR) bands in both daytime and night time. However, the accuracy of IR retrievals under confident clear conditions (> 99% probability) is much poorer than that of nIR retrievals. Additionally, IR retrievals under unconfident clear conditions (> 95%, > 66% and <= 66% probabilities) are usually discarded because the possible presence of clouds would further reduce their accuracy. In this study, we develop a cloud mask-related differential linear adjustment model (CDLAM) to adjust IR retrievals under all confident clear conditions. The CDLAM-adjusted IR retrievals are evaluated with the linear least square (LS) adjusted nIR retrievals under confident clear condition and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations under different probabilities of clear conditions. Both case studies in the USA and global (65 degrees S similar to 65 degrees N) evaluation reveal that the CDLAM can significantly reduce uncertainties in IR retrievals at all clear-sky confidence levels. Moreover, the accuracy of the CDLAM-adjusted IR retrievals under unconfident clear conditions is much better than IR retrievals without adjustment under confident clear conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of the CDLAM in enhancing the accuracy of IR retrievals at all clear-sky confidence levels as well as the data availability improvement of IR retrievals after adjustment with the CDLAM (14% during the analyzed time periods). The most likely reason for the efficiency of the CDLAM may be that the deviation of the differential water vapor information derived by the differential process is significantly shrunken after the linear regression analysis in the presented model. Therefore, the CDLAM is a promising tool for effectively adjusting IR retrievals under all probabilities of clear conditions and can improve our knowledge of the water vapor distribution and variation.

AB Relatively little is known of how the world's largest vegetation transition zone the Forest Tundra Ecotone (FTE) is responding to climate change. Newly available, satellite-derived time-series of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across North America and Europe could provide new insights into the physiological response of evergreen trees to climate change by tracking changes in foliar pigment pools that have been linked to photosynthetic phenology. However, before implementing these data for such purpose at these evergreen dominated systems, it is important to increase our understanding of the fine scale mechanisms driving the connection between PRI and environmental conditions. The goal of this study is thus to gain a more mechanistic understanding of which environmental factors drive changes in PRI during late-season phenological transitions at the FTE including factors that are susceptible to climate change (i.e., air- and soil-temperatures), and those that are not (photoperiod). We hypothesized that late-season phenological changes in foliar pigment pools captured by PRI are largely driven by photoperiod as opposed to less predictable drivers such as air temperature, complicating the utility of PRI time-series for understanding climate change effects on the FTE. Ground-based, time series of PRI were acquired from individual trees in combination with meteorological variables and photoperiod information at six FTE sites in Alaska. A linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to determine the significance (alpha = 0.001) and effect size (i.e., standardized slope b*) of environmental factors on late-seasonal changes in the PRI signal. Our results indicate that photoperiod had the strongest, significant effect on late season changes in PRI (b* = 0.08, p < 0.001), but environmental variables susceptible to climate change were also significant (i.e., daily mean solar radiation (b* = 0.03, p < 0.001) and daily mean soil temperature (b* = 0.02, p < 0.001)). These results suggest that interpreting PRI time-series of late-season phenological transitions may indeed facilitate our understanding of how northern treeline responds to climate change.

AB Landsat time-series (LTS) imagery shows potential for dynamic mapping in urban areas. However, unclear observations (clouds, cloud shadows, snow/ice, and SLC-off data) in the dataset inevitably restrict the efficacy of many of the state-of-the-art classifiers. In this work, we present a novel co-training classification approach consisting of two steps to cope with the unclear observations. Firstly, we develop a method called the MCCR classifier that deals with the unclear observations in an error-recoverable way. The clear observations are utilized to recover the unclear ones in the training samples by the use of the matrix completion (MC) algorithm, and the collaborative representation (CR) classifier is exploited to handle unclear observations in the unlabeled data. Secondly, considering that the random forest (RF) classifier is able to cope with contaminated data in an error tolerant way, a co-training approach (CotrRM) based on the RF and MCCR classifiers is also proposed to further improve the classification efficacy. The CotrRM method is executed by iteratively constructing semi-labeled training sets based on the crisp and soft predictions of the two individual classifiers on the unlabeled data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCCR classifier and CotrRM method, LTS imagery of the city of Wuhan (a metropolitan city of China) from four years (11 images from 2000, 16 images from 2005, 13 images from 2010, and 15 images from 2015) was adopted. The experiments showed that the MCCR classifier performs as well as the RF classifier for the mapping of urban land cover with contaminated LTS imagery. Moreover, the proposed CotrRM method has the ability to further improve the classification performance. The proposed approach can not only work effectively in the classification, but can also recover the unclear observations in the LTS imagery, courtesy of the MC algorithm. The overall accuracies of the land-cover changes between each two adjacent periods are all over 85%. Given the effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could also be applied in other unclear data classification.

AB The estimation of land-surface evapotranspiration (ET) at high spatial and temporal resolutions is important for management and planning of agricultural water resources, but available remote sensing data generally have either high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated the use of a data fusion scheme, Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), to determine the surface parameters needed to estimate daily ET at a Landsat-like scale (100 m). In particular, we fused Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data in analysis of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), an arid region of Northwest China. The surface parameters were then used to drive the revised Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model to estimate daily ET at a spatial resolution of 100 m for this an arid irrigation area during the crop growth period (April to October) in 2012. The results showed that the daily ET estimates had a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 12% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.81 mm/day relative to ground measurements from 18 eddy covariance (EC) sites in the study area. The validation results indicated good accuracy for land cover types of maize and vegetables, a slight overestimation for residential and wetland sites, and a slight underestimation for orchard site. Our comparison of the input parameter fusion approach (IPFA) and the ET fusion approach (ETFA) with field measurements indicated the IPFA was superior than the ETFA for land surfaces with high spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, our high spatiotemporal ET estimates indicated that irrigation water efficiencies of the irrigation districts (mean: 70%) and villages (mean: 62%) had large spatial heterogeneity. These results point to the need for calculating ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution for monitoring and improving irrigation water efficiency at local scales. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework of estimating daily ET at a Landsat-like scale using multi-source data may also be applicable to other heterogeneous landscapes by providing a foundation for management of water resources at the basin or finer scales.

AB The ability to quantify understory vegetation structure in forested environments on a broad scale has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of wildlife habitats, nutrient cycling, wildland fire behavior, and wildland firefighter safety. Lidar data can be used to model understory vegetation density, but the accuracy of these models is impacted by factors such as the specific lidar metrics used as independent variables, overstory conditions such as density and height, and lidar pulse density. Few previous studies have examined how these factors affect estimation of understory density. In this study we compare two widely-used lidar-derived metrics, overall relative point density (ORD) and normalized relative point density (NRD) in an understory vertical stratum, for their respective abilities to accurately model understory vegetation density. We also use a bootstrapping analysis to examine how lidar pulse density, overstory vegetation density, and canopy height can affect the ability to characterize understory conditions. In doing so, we present a novel application of an automated field photo-based understory cover estimation technique as reference data for comparison to lidar. Our results highlight that NRD is a far superior metric for characterizing understory density than ORD (R-NRD(2) = 0.44 vs. R-OR(D)2 = 0.14). In addition, we found that pulse density had the strongest positive effect on predictive power, suggesting that as pulse density increases, the ability to accurately characterize understory density using lidar increases. Overstory density and canopy height had nearly identical negative effects on predictive power, suggesting that shorter, sparser canopies improve lidar's ability to analyze the understory. Our study highlights important considerations and limitations for future studies attempting to use lidar to quantify understory vegetation structure.

AB Reliable identification of clouds is necessary for any type of optical remote sensing image analysis, especially in operational and fully automatic setups. One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces - especially built-up structures - are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29-0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.

AB Clumping index (CI) is a measure of foliage aggregation relative to a random distribution of leaves in space. The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given leaf area index (LAI) value. Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observation data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the synergy between a MODIS-based CI and a MODIS LAI product is examined using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability ('p-theory'), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types. The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. We show that empirically-based CI maps can be integrated with the MODIS LAI product. Our results indicate that it is feasible to derive approximate p-values for any location solely from Earth Observation data. This approximation is relevant for future applications of the photon recollision probability concept for global and local monitoring of vegetation using Earth Observation data.

AB Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.

AB Surface incident shortwave radiation (ISR) is a crucial parameter in the land surface radiation budget. Many reanalysis, observation-based, and satellite-derived global radiation products have been developed but often have insufficient accuracy and spatial resolution for many applications. In this paper, we propose a method based on a radiative transfer model for estimating surface ISR from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) observations by optimizing the surface and atmospheric variables with a cost function. This approach consisted of two steps: retrieving surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and cloud optical depth (COD); and subsequently calculating surface ISR. Validation against measurements at seven Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites resulted in an R-2 of 0.91, a bias of -6.47 W/m(2), and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 84.17 W/m(2) (15.12%) for the instantaneous results. Validation at eight high-latitude snow-covered Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) sites resulted in an R-2 of 0.86, a bias of 21.40 W/m(2), and an RMSE of 84.77 W/m(2) (20.96%). These validation results show that the proposed method is much more accurate than the previous studies (usually with RMSEs of 80-150 W/m(2)). We further investigated whether incorporating additional satellite products, such as the MODIS surface broadband albedo (MCD43), aerosol (MOD/MYNA), and cloud products (MOD/MYD06), as constraints in the cost function would improve the accuracy. When the AOD and COD estimates were constrained, RMSEs were reduced to 62.19 W/m(2) (12.12%) and 71.70 W/m(2) (17.74%) at the SURFRAD and GC-Net sites, respectively. This algorithm could estimate surface ISR with MODIS TOA observations over both snow-free and seasonal/permanent snow-covered surfaces. The algorithm performed well at high-latitude sites, which is very useful for radiation budget research in the polar regions.

AB Light detection and ranging (lidar) is currently the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology for measuring the 3D structures of forests. Studies have shown that various lidar-derived metrics can be used to predict forest attributes, such as aboveground biomass. However, finding out which metric works best at which scale and under which conditions requires extensive field inventories as ground-truth data. The goal of our study was to overcome the limitations of inventory data by complementing field-derived data with virtual forest stands from a dynamic forest model. The simulated stands were used to compare 29 different lidar metrics for their utility as predictors of tropical forest biomass at different spatial scales. We used the process-based forest model FORMIND, developed a lidar simulation model, based on the Beer-Lambert law of light extinction, and applied it to a tropical forest in Panama. Simulation scenarios comprised undisturbed primary forests and stands exposed to logging and fire disturbance regimes, resulting in mosaics of different successional stages, totaling 3.7 million trees on 4200 ha. The simulated forest was sampled with the lidar model. Several lidar metrics, in particular height metrics, showed good correlations with forest biomass, even for disturbed forest. Estimation errors (nRMSE) increased with decreasing spatial scale from < 10% (200-m scale) to > 30% (20-m scale) for the best metrics. At the often used 1-ha scale, the top-of-canopy height obtained from canopy height models with fine to relatively coarse pixel resolutions (1 to 10 m) yielded the most accurate biomass predictions, with nRMSE < 6% for undisturbed and nRMSE < 9% for disturbed forests. This study represents the first time dynamic modeling of a tropical forest has been combined with lidar remote sensing to systematically investigate lidar-to-biomass relationships for varying lidar metrics, scales and disturbance states. In the future, this approach can be used to explore the potential of remote sensing of other forest attributes, e.g., carbon dynamics, and other remote sensing systems, e.g., spaceborne lidar and radar.

ID ERROR CHARACTERIZATION; PRECIPITATION; CALIBRATION; MODEL; SMOS
AB Microwave radiometry has a long legacy of providing estimates of remotely sensed near surface soil moisture measurements over continental and global scales. A consistent assessment of the errors and uncertainties associated with these retrievals is important for their effective utilization in modeling, data assimilation and end use application environments. This article presents an evaluation of soil moisture retrieval products from AMSR-E, ASCAT, SMOS, AMSR2 and SMAP instruments using information theory-based metrics. These metrics rely on time series analysis of soil moisture retrievals for estimating the measurement error, level of randomness (entropy) and regularity (complexity) of the data. The results of the study indicate that the measurement errors in the remote sensing retrievals are significantly larger than that of the ground soil moisture measurements. The SMAP retrievals, on the other hand, were found to have reduced errors (comparable to those of in-situ datasets), particularly over areas with moderate vegetation. The SMAP retrievals also demonstrate high information content relative to other retrieval products, with higher levels of complexity and reduced entropy. Finally, a joint evaluation of the entropy and complexity of remotely sensed soil moisture products indicates that the information content of the AMSR-E, ASCAT, SMOS and AMSR2 retrievals is low, whereas SMAP retrievals show better performance. The use of information theoretic assessments is effective in quantifying the required levels of improvements needed in the remote sensing soil moisture retrievals to enhance their utility and information content.

AB Lidar transforms how we map ecosystems, but its prospect for measuring ecosystem dynamics is limited by practical factors, such as variation in lidar acquisition and lack of ground data. To address practical use of multitemporal lidar for forest and carbon monitoring, we conducted airborne lidar surveys four times from 2002 to 2012 over a region in Scotland, and combined the repeat lidar data with field inventories to map tree growth, biomass dynamics, and carbon change. Our analyses emphasized both individual tree detection and area-based, grid-level approaches. Lidar-detected heights of individual trees correlated well with field values, but with noticeable underestimation biases (r = 0.94, bias = 1.5 m, n = 598) due to the increased probability of missing treetops as pulse density decreases. If not corrected for such biases, lidar provided unrealistic or wrong estimates of tree growth unless laser sampling rates were high enough (e.g., > 7 points/m(2)). Upon correction, lidar could detect sub-annual tree growth (p-value < 0.05). At grid levels, forest biomass density was reliably estimated from area-based lidar metrics by both Random Forests (RF) and a linear functional model (r > 0.86, RMSEcv < 21 Mg/ha), irrespective of laser sampling rates. But RF constantly overfit the data, often with poorer predictions. The better generality of the linear model was further confirmed by its transferability fitted for one year but applicable to other years a strength not possessed by RF but desired to alleviate the reliance on ground biomass data for model calibration. Resultant lidar maps of forest structure captured canopy dynamics and carbon flux at fine scales, consistent with growth histories and known disturbances. The entire 20-km(2) study area sequestered carbon at a rate of 0.59 0.4 Mg C/ha/year. Overall, our study describes robust techniques well suited for multitemporal lidar analysis and affirms the utility and potential of repeat lidar data for resource monitoring and carbon management; however, the full potential cannot be attained without the support of accompanying field surveys or modeling efforts in enhancing stakeholders' trustworthiness of lidar-based inference.

AB Satellite radar altimetry is one of the most powerful techniques for measuring sea surface height variations, with applications ranging from operational oceanography to climate research. Over open oceans, altimeter return waveforms generally correspond to the Brown model, and by inversion, estimated shape parameters provide mean surface height and wind speed. However, in coastal areas or over inland waters, the waveform shape is often distorted by land influence, resulting in peaks or fast decaying trailing edges. As a result, derived sea surface heights are then less accurate and waveforms need to be reprocessed by sophisticated algorithms. To this end, this work suggests a novel Spatio-Temporal Altimetry Retracking (STAR) technique. We show that STAR enables the derivation of sea surface heights over the open ocean as well as over coastal regions of at least the same quality as compared to existing retracking methods, but for a larger number of cycles and thus retaining more useful data. Novel elements of our method are (a) integrating information from spatially and temporally neighboring waveforms through a conditional random field approach, (b) sub-waveform detection, where relevant sub-waveforms are separated from corrupted or non-relevant parts through a sparse representation approach, and (c) identifying the final best set of sea surfaces heights from multiple likely heights using Dijkstra's algorithm. We apply STAR to data from the Jason-1, Jason-2 and Envisat missions for study sites in the Gulf of Trieste, Italy and in the coastal region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna estuary, Bangladesh. We compare to several established and recent retracking methods, as well as to tide gauge data. Our experiments suggest that the obtained sea surface heights are significantly less affected by outliers when compared to results obtained by other approaches.

AB Roughness effect parameterization is critical to accurately simulate brightness temperature (Tb) signals observed by a radiometer over bare soil surface. However, current roughness parameterization schemes usually suffer from severe error, which dominates the error budget in current Tb modeling over bare soil surface. In this study, uncertainty of soil roughness parameterization schemes is comprehensively assessed using data set collected during 2004 to 2006 at the Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir Experiment (SMOSREX) bare soil experimental site. To reduce uncertainty from sampling depth mismatch, the soil moisture profile with a 1 cm thickness from a calibrated Hydus-1D (HID) model is utilized to determine the optimal soil moisture inputs to soil emission model. Uncertainties of 15 literature-based roughness effect parameterization schemes developed for L-band Tb modeling are inter-compared. The "QM" model is further calibrated against multi-angle and dual polarization Tb observations at the SMOSREX bare soil site under different roughness conditions. Our results show that: (1) soil moisture sampling depth varies with soil moisture content and roughness condition. When soil is drier and rougher, the soil moisture sampling depth gets deeper. (2) The 15 roughness schemes generally perform better at vertical polarization than at horizontal polarization and better when soil surface is relative smooth than when soil surface gets rougher. The 15 roughness correction schemes have their own advantages and disadvantages with diverse error and bias characteristics. None of them has a superior performance at all conditions in terms of roughness, polarizations and incident angles. (3) A non-zero Q configuration is preferred in parameter retrieval experiments and the observed linear relationship between Delta N and root-mean-square height (sigma) or sigma(2)/L-c can only be reproduced when Qis non-zero in parameter retrieval. (4) The effective roughness parameters (Q, N-p, and h) generally increase when soil get rougher. The calibrated Q, N-h, and N-v, show exponential dependence on the effective parameter h. The calibrated h still shows dependence on surface soil moisture after accounting the impact from soil sampling depth and also shows strong power-law dependence on Tb at incident angle of 40 degrees. The non-zero-Q fitting models have comparable performance in Tb modeling with zero-Q models but may be more physically realistic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The "trapezoid" or "triangle" model constitutes the most popular approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain. The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing of soil moisture.

AB This paper presents the theoretical basis of the algorithm designed for the generation of leaf area index and diurnal course of its sunlit portion from NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). The Look-up-Table (LUT) approach implemented in the MODIS operational LAI/FPAR algorithm is adopted. The LUT, which is the heart of the approach, has been significantly modified. First, its parameterization incorporates the canopy hot spot phenomenon and recent advances in the theory of canopy spectral invariants. This allows more accurate decoupling of the structural and radiometric components of the measured Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF), improves scaling properties of the LUT and consequently simplifies adjustments of the algorithm for data spatial resolution and spectral band compositions. Second, the stochastic radiative transfer equations are used to generate the LUT for all biome types. The equations naturally account for radiative effects of the three-dimensional canopy structure on the BRF and allow for an accurate discrimination between sunlit and shaded leaf areas. Third, the LUT entries are measurable, i.e., they can be independently derived from both below canopy measurements of the transmitted and above canopy measurements of reflected radiation fields. This feature makes possible direct validation of the LUT, facilitates identification of its deficiencies and development of refinements. Analyses of field data on canopy structure and leaf optics collected at 18 sites in the Hyytiala forest in southern boreal zone in Finland and hyperspectral images acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion sensor support the theoretical basis.

AB In this study, the added utility of nonlinear rescaling methods relative to linear methods in the framework of creating a homogenous soil moisture time series has been explored. The performances of 31 linear and nonlinear rescaling methods are evaluated by rescaling the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture datasets to station-basedwatershed average datasets obtained over four United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) watersheds. The linear methods include first-order linear regression, multiple linear regression, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), whereas the nonlinear methods include cumulative distribution function matching (CDF), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GEN), and copula methods. MARS, GEN, SVM, ANN, and the copula methods are also implemented to utilize lagged observations to rescale the datasets. The results of a total of 31 different methods show that the nonlinear methods improve the correlation and error statistics of the rescaled product compared to the linear methods. In general, the method that yielded the best results using training data improved the validation correlations, on average, by 0.063, whereas ELMAN ANN and GEN, using lagged observations methods, yielded correlation improvements of 0.052 and 0.048, respectively. The lagged observations improved the correlations when they were incorporated into rescaling equations in linear and nonlinear fashions, with the nonlinear methods (particularly SVM and GEN but not ANN and copula) benefitting from these lagged observations more than the linear methods. The overall results show that a large majority of the similarities between the LPRM and watershed average datasets are due to linear relations; however, nonlinear relations clearly exist, and the use of nonlinear rescaling methods clearly improves the accuracy of the rescaled product.

AB The semi-empirical Interferometric Water Cloud Model, IWCM, is used to estimate above ground forest biomass, AGB, in northern Sweden, Krycklan (64 degrees N 20 degrees E). The results are based on separate analysis of 14 TanDEM-X ac-quisitions from 2011 to 2014 and a Lidar digital terrain model (DTM). 29 stands covering 272 ha and with AGB < 183 Mg/ha, and 619 stands with area > 1 ha covering 3166 ha and with AGB < 291Mg/ ha have been analyzed. In situ and airborne lidar scanning, ALS, data from the BioSAR 2008 experiment are used as reference. AGB and forest height are estimated using a new optimization method for determining IWCM parameters. Allometric equations are used to describe the inter-dependency between forest height, biomass, area-fill factor, and stem volume. No local training data from the investigated area are used to determine model parameters. For the 29 stands, the relative RMSE for biomass estimated using the proposed method varied between 15.8% and 21.2% (r(2) between 0.82 and 0.88) and between 9.9% and 16.0% for height (r(2) between 0.84 and 0.89). Dependence of model parameters on temperature and precipitation as well as height of ambiguity are investigated. A method based on look-up table for biomass estimation from phase height is proposed. The method is used over an area of 68 km(2) for one TanDEM-X acquisition from 2011-06-04 and the results are compared with an ALS biomass map from August 2008. Good agreement is observed, as well as high potential for clear-cut detection. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Studies of land cover dynamics would benefit greatly from the generation of land cover maps at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Fine spatial resolution images are usually acquired relatively infrequently, whereas coarse spatial resolution images may be acquired with a high repetition rate but may not capture the spatial detail of the land cover mosaic of the region of interest. Traditional image spatial-temporal fusion methods focus on the blending of pixel spectra reflectance values and do not directly provide land cover maps or information on land cover dynamics. In this research, a novel Spatial-Temporal remotely sensed Images and land cover Maps Fusion Model ( STIMFM) is proposed to produce land cover maps at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions using a series of coarse spatial resolution images together with a few fine spatial resolution land cover maps that pre-and post-date the series of coarse spatial resolution images. STIMFM integrates both the spatial and temporal dependences of fine spatial resolution pixels and outputs a series of fine spatial-temporal resolution land cover maps instead of reflectance images, which can be used directly for studies of land cover dynamics. Here, three experiments based on simulated and real remotely sensed images were undertaken to evaluate the STIMFM for studies of land cover change. These experiments included comparative assessment of methods based on single- date image such as the super-resolution approaches ( e.g., pixel swapping-based super-resolution mapping) and the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal fusion approach that used the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusionmodel (FSDAF) to predict the fine-resolution images, in which the maximum likelihood classifier and the automated land cover updating approach based on integrated change detection and classification method were then applied to generate the fine-resolution land cover maps. Results show that the methods based on single- date image failed to predict the pixels of changed and unchanged land cover with high accuracy. The land cover maps that were obtained by classification of the reflectance images outputted from ESTARFM and FSDAF contained substantial misclassification, and the classification accuracy was lower for pixels of changed land cover than for pixels of unchanged land cover. In addition, STIMFM predicted fine spatial-temporal resolution land cover maps from a series of Landsat images and a few Google Earth images, to which ESTARFM and FSDAF that require correlation in reflectance bands in coarse and fine images cannot be applied. Notably, STIMFM generated higher accuracy for pixels of both changed and unchanged land cover in comparison with other methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Characterising the highly variable temporal dynamics of landscape-scale fire activity is best achieved using geostationary satellites, and the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) now provides views of Asian and Australian fires at an unprecedented 10 min temporal resolution and 2 km nadir thermal channel spatial resolution. We here develop the first processing system to identify active fires and retrieve their fire radiative power (FRP) from AHI data, based on the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm and FRP retrieval method originally developed for use with Meteosat SEVIRI over Africa and Europe. This scheme detects active fires covering as little as 10(-3) to 10(-4) of an AHI pixel, and we compare performance to the same scheme applied to data from the forerunner geostationary MTSAT imager and the FengYun-2 (FY-2) Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR), and also to 1 km (at nadir) polar-orbiting MODIS active fire data. We find major benefits of Himawari-8 AHI over both MTSAT and FY-2, being able to detect a substantially greater proportion of fire activity and with little impact from sensor saturation. AHI-derived FRP retrievals of detected fires show a very strong agreement and a low (3 MW) bias with respect to near-simultaneous MODIS retrievals, though fires having FRP 5 40 MW are undercounted by AHI due to its 4x larger pixel area (at nadir) than MODIS. Large parts of Asia are characterised by smaller/lower FRP fires associated with e.g. agricultural residue burning, meaning many are at or below this AHI minimum FRP detection limit, and during June 2015 AHI fails to detect around 66% of the hotspots that MODIS detects when both sensors view the same area simultaneously. However, AHI provides 144 observation opportunities per day compared to 4 typical observations from MODIS, and shows a low (8%) active fire detection error of commission. We demonstrate the unique value of the geostationary FRP retrievals made from AHI data for full fire diurnal cycle assessment and for Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) calculations. We conclude that these FRP data demonstrate major benefits for studies of active fires over Asia and Australia, and expect them to become an important component of the global geostationary active fire observation system.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

   normalization; Zambia
ID CLOUD SHADOW; SNOW DETECTION; MODIS; RESOLUTION; REFLECTANCE
AB The need for operational monitoring of landscape processes on the national to global scale led to an increased demand for pixel-based composites using complete earth observation (EO) archives. Commonly, composites are generated without explicit consideration of temporal criteria but are rather based on optimizing band indices within a pre-defined temporal window. However, for certain applications phenology-adapted composites that represent the land surface as being in the same phenological stage are required, e.g. tree type discrimination where greening up or senescence dates are modified by terrain elevation. We developed a novel pixel-based compositing technique that dynamically adjusts the selection process to the underlying land surface phenology (LSP) of each pixel. By doing so, phenologically sound composites across large areas can be derived for regular intervals and different phenological points in time, e.g. peak, end or minimum of season. Various day-of-year (DOY) scoring functions were implemented to flexibly define the phenological target. The technique is general enough for global application and can be applied to any kind of gridded EO archive, herein demonstrated for MODIS and Landsat data. Multi-annual composites were successfully generated for Zambia for most seasons. As an exception, we found even very frequent MODIS observations to be insufficient for peak vegetation composites due to interference with the rainy season. The phenology-adaptive composites were compared to static ones, i.e. using a single target DOY. Results clearly indicated that biomass levels differ significantly between the techniques, and a phenological normalization across elevation gradients and land cover classes could be achieved. However, the implications are non-trivial and the characteristics of both methods need to be considered cautiously before deciding which approach is superior with regards to a specific thematic application. The quality of the MODIS and Landsat composites, as well as the performance of the phenology-adaptive and static compositing techniques were assured using a quantitative cross-comparison. A 12-year annual time series demonstrated the feasibility for land cover change and modification mapping. Several change processes were clearly discriminable. The resulting phenologically coherent composites are important to establish national, regional or even global landscape monitoring, reporting and verification systems.

AB The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Hemiptera: Adelges tsugae Annand) is an invasive insect causing damage to Eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L) Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlock trees in the eastern United States. Maine and New Hampshire are currently the northernmost front of HWA's range. Developing methods to locate newly infested stands is paramount in the effort to monitor HWA range expansion; presently, the most reliable method of detection requires extensive on-the-ground manual surveying. Field surveys for invasive pests like HWA consume multiple resources, limiting the amount of area that can be surveyed, and the results often misrepresent the true extent or patchiness of an invasion. Satellite based remote sensing, using vegetation indices, enables us to detect insect driven changes in forest health at a landscape scale. Our objectives were to classify HWA infested hemlock stands along the infestation front and demonstrate how the classification product could be used to improve HWA survey planning. Our workflow consisted of 1) modeling hemlock habitat suitability using a Maximum Entropy algorithm; 2) developing decision tree rules to classify likely infested stands from a Landsat time series, using the habitat suitability model to mask out non-hemlock areas; and 3) field check the final classification product.
   The hemlock habitat suitability model attained an overall accuracy of 68.2%. Partitioning of leaf-on multi-year (1995-2013) Landsat 5 and 8 data resulted in seven probability of infestation classes with a training R-2 = 0.782. Agreement between the classification and previously reported HWA infestations was 75.0% in conifer forests, 33.3% in mixed forests and 50.0% in deciduous forests. Agreement between the classification and test-survey locations was 78.6%; verified new infestations were detected as far as 19 km away from previously reported infestations. The methods presented outline how Landsat could be used to detect low-level HWA infestations. Classification products such as this ultimately could be used by federal and state agencies to target specific areas for efficient survey, suppression, and eradication efforts.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions have altered global climate significantly, increasing the frequency of drought, fire, and insect- and pathogen-related mortality in forests across the western United States. The accuracy of satellite-based estimates of canopy change has been limited by difficulties associated with discriminating overstory canopy from understory vegetation. To overcome this issue, we developed a method to quantify forest canopy cover using winter-season fractional snow covered area (F-SCA) data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm. The method utilizes time series of Fscp, data to identify images with continuous ground snow coverage and a snow-free overstory, effectively masking out the influence of understory vegetation. Using this method, we determined that MODSCAGretrieved viewable gap fraction (VGF; i.e. fraction of pixel sub-canopy viewable area) was significantly correlated with an independent product of yearly crown mortality caused by mountain pine beetles derived from Landsat imagery at 25 high-mortality sites in northern Colorado ((r) over bar = 0.96 +/- 0.03, p<0.03). Additionally, we determined the temporal lag between tree mortality and needlefall, showing that needlefall occurred an average of 2.6 +/- 1.2 years after year of attack. The canopy change detection method described herein is the first to utilize snow cover to mask understory impacts on overstory detection. The method can be applied anywhere in the seasonal snow zone and therefore has wide applicability given that 30% of the global land surface is seasonally snow covered. In this regard, the approach addresses significant limitations of previously published methods of canopy change detection and has broad implications with regard to understanding forest mortality and the representation of disturbance within hydrologic, land surface, and climate models.

AB NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), to be deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2018, will provide billions of measurements of ground elevation and forest vertical structure. GEDI will acquire data only along transects or tracks, with between-track spacing of about 500 m. To fill the gaps in between these tracks and potentially produce higher spatial resolution products, appropriate fusion strategies between GEDI observations and other spatially contiguous datasets should be explored. One source of global data on canopy structure comes from the TanDEM-X (TDX) mission, which uses the technique of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to estimate surface structure. The goal of this paper is to explore the fusion of GEDI data with TDX for canopy height retrievals. In particular we examined the improvement in TDX height retrievals from a widely used scattering model the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model using ancillary topographic data from simulated GEDI observations of surface elevation. Our study site is a mountainous, mixed-temperate forest: Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). We started with a wall-to-wall lidar data set acquired by the Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) that provides a close analogue to anticipated GEDI waveforms. We derived a reference canopy height map and a reference bare earth digital terrain model (DTM) using LVIS. We next simulated GEDI ground tracks over HBEF for the nominal one-year period and extracted these observations from the reference DTM. A series of experiments were then conducted to examine the impact of ancillary topographic information. Using two different sets of TDX acquisitions, we compared height from RVoG respectively using no external DTM, the full LVIS DTM, and the DTM derived from simulated GEDI data against reference canopy heights at 90 m spatial resolution. With no external DTM to remove the ground phase, the RVoG model estimated heights with the best RMSE error (of the two TDX acquisitions dates) of 4.3 m and a bias of 2.5 m. Using the full LVIS DTM, results improved to 3.5 m RMSE and a bias of 13 m. Using the simulated GEDI DTM, the RMSE was 4.6 m with a bias of 1.8 m. The agreement between predicted and actual heights was good, ranging from an r(2) of 039 (GEDI DTM) to 0.71 (p-value < 0.0001 for all r(2)) (full resolution DTM). We conclude that for our study area, TDX data used with the RVoG model was an effective means for estimating spatially continuous canopy structure. However, the large biases in height estimation require ancillary topographic data, such as those produced from GEDI, to reduce biases to acceptable levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa and the second largest in the world. In order to investigate the change of Lake Victoria over the past decades, this paper presents an approach for the long time series analysis of water volume by using a combination of multi-mission altimetry and remotely sensed images. The proposed approach consists of three main components. (i) Estimation of the lake surface area variations from 2000 to 2012 by the use of support vector machine (SVM) for remotely sensed imagery. (ii) Calculation of the lake surface height from 1991 to 2012 by the use of multi-mission altimetry data through an elimination of the bias between different satellite missions. (iii) Development of the relationship between the area-water level above lowest level (WLALL) and water volume above lowest level (WVALL) by the use of regression and integration analysis to estimate the volume variations over the past 22 years.
   Several new findings discovered through the experimental results: (i) Lake surface area, height, and volume have experienced significant fluctuations over the past 22 years as follows: (a) the relatively stable period from 1991 to 1997; (b) the significant increase period from 1998 to 1999; (c) the sharp drop period from 2000 to 2006; and (d) the gradual increase period from 2007 to 2012. (ii) The intra-annual analysis indicates that lake surface area, height, and volume show obvious seasonal patterns. (iii) The significant changes of Lake Victoria, which are detected from remotely sensed imagery and satellite altimetry data, coincide with the events responsible for these variations, which are excessive outflow, weather conditions, rapid population growth and land-cover changes.

AB At over 40 years, the Landsat satellites provide the longest temporal record of space-based land surface observations, and the successful. 2013 launch of the Landsat-8 is continuing this legacy. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM+ provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30 m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6317 Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM + TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0 NDVI 1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM + NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r(2) values > 0.7 for the reflectance data and >0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values < 0.0001).

AB Rivers act as a source of fresh water for terrestrial life, yet the discharges are poorly documented since the existing direct observations are inadequate and some observation stations have been interrupted or discontinued. Discharge estimates using remote sensing thus have a great potential to supplement ground observations. There are remote sensing methods established to estimate discharge based on single parameter derived relationships; however, they are limited to specific sections due to their empirical nature. In this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate daily discharges for continental rivers (with river channel widths >800 m (Birkett and Beckley, 2010)) using two satellite derived parameters. Multiple satellite altimetry data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to provide a time series of river stages and effective river width. The derived MODIS and altimetry data are then used to optimize unknown parameters in a modified Manning's equation. In situ measurements are used to derive rating curves and to provide assessments of the estimated results. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values for the estimates are between 0.60 and 0.97, indicating the power of the method and accuracy of the estimations. A comparison with a previously developed empirical multivariate equation for estimating river discharge shows that our method produces superior results, especially for large rivers. Furthermore, we found that discharge estimates using both effective river width and stage information consistently outperform those that only use stage data. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The newly developed semi-analytical scheme (Lee et al., 2015a) for remote sensing of the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD), m) was modified and applied to Landsat-8 data to obtain high-spatial-resolution map of water clarity. In order to implement the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) for the derivation of absorption and backscattering coefficients from Landsat-8 data, which are key optical properties for the estimation of Z(SD), the representative wavelengths of Landsat-8 bands in the visible domain are verified; so are the absorption and backscattering coefficients of pure water for these bands. This semi-analytical scheme was then applied to a dataset having both in situ measurements of Z(SD) (similar to 0.1-30 m) and remote-sensing reflectance and found that the estimated Z(SD) from remote sensing matches measured Z(SD) very well (R-2 = 0.96, average absolute percent difference similar to 17%, N = 197). This scheme was further applied to a Landsat-8 image collected in an estuary to obtain high-spatial resolution Z(SD) map, and the obtained spatial distribution of Z(SD) is found quite consistent with in situ measurements and visual observations. These results indicate an important application of Landsat data - to provide reliable high-resolution water clarity product of bays, estuaries, and lakes with a unified mechanistic system.

AB Two largest Siberian rivers - Ob and Yenisei inflow in the Arctic Ocean in the Kara Sea basin. Mixing of fresh river waters and saline sea waters leads to the formation of the large river plume with typical thickness about similar to 10 m, which can cover a considerable part of the basin. The paper is devoted to the study of interannual variability of the river plume dynamics in the Kara Sea using multi-satellite observations. First, satellite salinity (Aquarius) and chlorophyll-A (MODIS) data for 2011-2014 along with hydrological observations are used in order to identify areas covered by the plume and to validate the satellite measurements. It is shown that both types of satellite data are consistent with in situ observations and provide realistic information about propagation of fresh and turbid plume waters. Second, we introduce particle-tracking model for pathways calculation of the plume propagation that is based on satellite altimetry and wind data reanalysis. The model is successfully validated using Aquarius and MODIS data. Model calculations are used to describe the significant interannual variability of the river plume pathways over twenty-year period (1993-2013) and identify the driving mechanisms of its propagation. It is shown that the plume self-organizing geostrophic circulation, which is induced by the differences in the buoyancy of light plume water and dense ocean water, and changes of prevailing wind direction are the main factors controlling the plume dynamics and its interannual variability.

AB Detailed information about three-dimensional vegetation structure proves increasingly useful for studying species-habitat relationships in forest ecosystems. This particularly applies to species that make extensive use of the three-dimensional habitat space in forests, such as bats. Bats show considerable variation in flight morphology and echolocation traits that are shaped by habitat features, and are excellent model taxa for investigating relationships between vegetation structure and animal occurrence and movement. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship between the activity of bats and forest structure and (2) to compare the performance of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and terrestrial field surveys for measuring habitat features in a representative sample of mixed and deciduous forests in the Swiss lowlands. Leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR data were used separately, as well as in combination, to evaluate the relative strength of these datasets to describe 3D canopy architecture and vertical forest structure. Field measurements included structural variables such as leaf area index (LAI), vertical layering, snags, as well as shrub and ground vegetation cover. We recorded 145,433 echolocation call sequences from bats and assigned them into three echolocation guilds (short-, mid and long-range echolocators; SRE, MRE, LRE, respectively) treating separately the dominant species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus; Pp). We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and applied an information theoretic approach to assess relationships between guild-specific activity patterns of bats and forest structure in the forest interior, as well as in forest gaps. Standardized coefficients were used to evaluate variable effect sizes and relative importance. We found that guild-specific bat activity was clearly related to 3D forest structure. The activity of SRE, MRE and Pp bats was negatively affected by foliage height diversity, indicating that a large scatter of vegetation elements along 3D forest profiles may restrict accessibility for manoeuvrable bats. Outer canopy surface ruggedness was significantly and positively related to the activity of MRE and LRE bats, as well as Pp, all of which may profit from increased canopy surface ruggedness for foraging (food abundance) and commuting (cover) purposes. The highest variable effect sizes were obtained by combining leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR data. Leaf-off outperformed leaf-on data, particularly in describing foliage height diversity. LiDAR provided information about bat habitat structure in forests that is not readily available from field surveys. LiDAR thus increases the scope of inference for future investigations of how species respond to vegetation structure, which can now readily and contiguously be assessed at relevant grain sizes and across large areas.

AB We report on the operational use of remotely sensed data by national forest inventory (NFI) programmes in 45 countries representing approximately 65% of the world's forest area. The analysis is based on responses to a questionnaire prepared under the auspices of COST Action FP1001 "Improving Data and Information on the Potential Supply of Wood Resources: A European Approach from Multisource National Forest Inventories (USEWOOD)". Responses were received from NH remote sensing experts from both European and non-European countries. Three major conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) remote sensing now plays an essential role in many NH programmes and provides data that can be used to enhance estimates for the most meaningful and commonly reported forest resource parameters; (2) a wide spectrum of remote sensing methods are currently used by NH teams; and (3) although substantial effort and attention has been focused on the use of aerial photography and spaceborne sensor data for mapping and enhancing estimation, integration of uncertainly estimation requires additional attention.
   The operational use of remotely sensed data by NFI programmes is illustrated for three case studies: a case study for Switzerland focuses on digital aerial photography, a case study for Finland focuses on spaceborne sensor data for small area estimation, and a case study for the USA focuses on spaceborne sensor data for increasing the precision of large area estimates. Although use of remotely sensed data by NFI programmes may remain region-specific and some approaches are not readily transferable, generally applicable good practice guidelines were formulated on the basis of the questionnaire responses and the case studies. These guidelines are intended to promote better use of limited financial resources and to increase the accuracy and precision of NH estimates. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Ocean color measurements taken near cloud boundaries suffer from cloud adjacency effects (AEs). As a result, similar to 50% of the cloud-free ocean data are flagged as low quality. Quantitative assessment of such effects, as well as the methodology required to minimize, or correct for them, is rarely available. The goal of this study is to quantify such effects on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance and ocean color data products for MODIS/Terra, MODIS/Aqua, and SeaWiFS measurements. The AEs estimation was based on statistics and an objective method applied to carefully selected clear-water scenes (the number of cloud patches was >100,000 for each instrument) where ocean properties are relatively homogeneous, over both the North Atlantic and South Pacific. The AEs were quantified as the relative difference between the near-cloud pixels and pixels at least 20 km away from any cloud. Results show that the AEs on TOA radiance share similar patterns among the three missions. Specifically, the AEs decrease sharply as distance increases from cloud edges, and the AEs increase monotonically with increasing wavelengths because they were evaluated in relative rather than absolute terms. However, while discernable memory effects (MEs) are observed on cloud-adjacency pixels of both MODIS missions, they are insignificant on the SeaWiFS mission, and are found in measurements along the scan direction downstream of the clouds, representing >15% of the total AEs in TOA radiance. The AEs on the retrieved remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data products are different among the three missions possibly due to their differences in vicarious calibration and uncertainties in atmospheric correction, leading to different patterns in the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and normalized Florescence Line Height (nFLH) data products. Large AEs (>50%) are observed in nFLH of both MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua, likely due to the opposite AEs on Rrs between 667 and 678 nm. Finally, when the OCI Chl-a algorithm is used, the current MODIS stray-light masking window (7 x 5) used to mask the AE contaminated pixels may be relaxed to 3 x 3 without sacrificing data quality, leading to >40% of the previously masked low-quality data being recovered for clear waters.

AB The concentration of nitrogen (N) in foliage often limits photosynthesis and can influence a number of important biogeochemical processes. For this reason, methods for estimating foliar %N over a range of scales are needed to enhance understanding of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. High spectral resolution aircraft remote sensing has become an increasingly common tool for landscape-scale estimates of canopy %N because reflectance in some portions of the spectrum has been shown to correlate strongly with field-measured %N. These patterns have been observed repeatedly over a wide range of biomes, opening new possibilities for planned Earth observation satellites. Nevertheless, the effects of spectral resolution and other sensor characteristics on %N estimates have not been fully examined, and may have implications for future analyses at landscape, regional and global scales. In this study, we explored the effects of spectral resolution, spatial resolution and sensor fidelity on relationships between forest canopy %N and reflectance measurements from airborne and satellite platforms. We conducted an exercise whereby PLS, simple and multiple regression calibrations to field-measured canopy %N for a series of forested sites were iteratively performed using (1) high resolution data from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) that were degraded spectrally from 10 nm to 30 nm, 50 nm, 70 nm, and 90 nm bandwidths, and spatially from 18 m to 30 m and 60 m pixels; (2) data representing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) spectral bands simulated with data from AVIRIS; and (3) actual data from Landsat and MODIS. We observed virtually no reduction in the strength of relationships between %N and reflectance when using coarser bandwidths from AVIRIS, but instead saw declines with increasing spatial resolution and loss of sensor fidelity. This suggests that past efforts to examine foliar %N using broad-band sensors may have been limited as much by the latter two properties as by their coarser spectral bandwidths. We also found that regression models were driven primarily by reflectance over broad portions of the near infrared (NIR) region, with little contribution from the visible or mid infrared regions. These results suggest that much of the variability in canopy %N is related to broad reflectance properties in the NIR region, indicating promise for broad scale canopy N estimation from a variety of sensors.

AB During the last decade, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data has been used increasingly in numerous studies to assess e.g. bird habitats and biodiversity, but less often in studies focusing on ground dwelling mammals.
   Here, we utilized ALS data to study the role of forest structure in moose habitat use. The data consisted of 18 GPS-collared moose in western Finland. ALS data was extracted around the moose locations. The aim was to examine the habitat selection patterns of moose within a year. Special attention was given: 1) to winter to detect when moose-related forest damages occur (when moose favor young forests) and 2) to the calving period to examine the possible role of forest structure in determining where females give birth and where they move with the newborn calves.
   During calving, females were occupying forests with minimal amounts of vegetation below the height of five meters. Shortly after calving, the females and their calves moved to forests with dense vegetation under the height of five meters, which is explained by the increasing demand of food both for the growing calf and the lactating mother. In summer and autumn, all moose were found more often in mature forests with higher and denser canopies, which is explained by the fact that their most preferred food during autumn (e.g. berries and twigs) grows in mature forests. This trend diminished as autumn turned to winter and moose started to favor vegetation below five meters. In general, we were able to see clear patterns and differences in habitat use between sexes, as well as with calves, and we gained new and more accurate information about the role of the forest structure to calving females. The results show that ALS data alone can yield valuable additional information about wildlife ecology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing forest stress and tree mortality has been directly linked to combinations of drought and high temperatures. The climatic changes expected during the next decades - large increases in mean temperature, increased heat waves, and significant long-term regional drying in the western USA - will likely increase chronic forest stress and mortality. The aim of this research is to develop and apply a new forest vulnerability index (FVI) associated with drought and high temperatures across the Pacific Northwest region (PNW; Oregon and Washington) of the USA during the MODIS Aqua era (since 2003). Our technique incorporates the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET), and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data. With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly meanLST to calculate a monthly forest stress index (FSI). We then extract the pixel-specific (800-m resolution) statistically significant temporal trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October). The FVI is the slope of the monthly FSI across years, such that there is a FVI for each month. Statistically significant positive slopes indicate interannual increases in stress leading to expected forest vulnerability (positive FVI) for a given month. Positive FVI values were concentrated in the months of August and September, with peak vulnerability occurring at different times for different FTGs. Overall, increased vulnerability rates were the highest in drier FTGs such as Ponderosa Pine, Juniper, and Lodgepole Pine. Western Larch and Fir/Spruce/Mountain Hemlock groups occupy moister sites but also had relatively high proportion of positive FVI values. The Douglas-fir group had the second largest total area of increased vulnerability due to its large areal extent in the study area. Based on an analysis using imagery viewed in Google Earth, we confirm that areas with increased vulnerability are associated with greater amounts of stress and mortality. The FVI is a new way to conceptualize and monitor forest vulnerability based on first-order principles and has the potential to be generalized to other geographical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Several upcoming hyperspectral satellite sensor missions (e.g., the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager and the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) will greatly expand the opportunities for researchers to use imaging spectroscopy data for discriminating and mapping plant species and plant functional types (PFTs; defined in this study as combinations of leaf-type, leaf/plant duration and life form). Accurate knowledge of the spatial distribution of dominant plant species and PFTs is highly valuable to many scientific and management goals, including improved parameterization of ecosystem process and climate models, better invasive species distribution monitoring and forecasting, quantification of human and natural disturbance and recovery processes, and evaluations of terrestrial vegetation response to climate change. Most often, species-level discrimination has been achieved using fine spatial resolution (<= 20 m) airborne imagery, but currently proposed spaceborne imaging spectrometers will have coarser spatial resolution (-30 to 60 m). In order to address the impact of coarser spatial resolutions on our ability to spectrally separate species and PFTs, we classified dominant species and PFTs in five contrasting ecosystems over a range of spatial resolutions. Study sites included a temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, a brackish tidal marsh, a mixed conifer/broadleaf montane forest, a temperate rainforest and a Mediterranean climate region encompassing grasslands, oak savanna, oak woodland and shrublands. Data were acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over each site, and spatially aggregated to 20,40 and 60 m resolutions. Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) was used to classify species and PFTs at each site and across scales with overall accuracies ranging from 61 to 96% for species and 83-100% for PFTs. The results of this study show accuracy increases at coarser resolutions WO m) across ecosystems, supporting the use of imaging spectroscopy data at spatial resolutions up to 60 m for the purpose of discriminating among plant species and PFTs. In four of the five study sites, the best accuracies were achieved at 40 m resolution. However, at coarser resolutions, some fine-scale species variation is lost and classes that occur only in small patches cannot be mapped. We also demonstrate that spectral libraries developed from fine spatial resolution imagery can be successfully applied as training data to accurately classify coarser resolution data over multiple ecosystems.

AB Satellite remote sensing allows many hydrological variables to be retrieved at regional and global scales, and these retrievals can contribute to our knowledge of these quantities and their spatial and temporal variation. However, the availability and precision of measurements from remote sensing are still limited. Other important sources of information are represented by reanalysis products and simulations from land surface models (LSMs), which are continuously improving their ability to reproduce the terrestrial hydrological and energy cycles. Such global datasets are very informative and they can be used to integrate the data provided by remote sensing. Among these datasets, the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) provides many hydrological variables covering the period from 1979 to 2011 with hourly temporal resolution and similar to 0.3-degree spatial resolution. This paper addresses the frequent challenge arising from remote sensing data: how can we create a long-term, global dataset starting with remote sensing data that are sparse in space and time, and provided by sensors flown on different satellites? This was the challenge for creating a long-term Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset at an hourly resolution based on the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS). To this end, a methodology is presented that merges the continuous CFSR LST estimates with the HIRS retrievals that come from 11 different NOAA satellites. The goals of the analysis are to have a long-term LST dataset consistent with the HIRS retrievals, and to assess the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed data through a Bayesian uncertainty post-processing methodology. The result of this approach is a temporally and spatially continuous dataset, with no step changes associated to the different NOAA satellites, and a dataset described in terms of a probability distribution function whose expected value is unbiased with respect to the original HIRS LST retrievals.

AB The wet tropospheric correction (WTC) is still a significant error source in most altimetric products. For studies such as sea level change, as those performed in the scope of the ESA Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (SL_cci) project, the use of uniform and consistent WTC datasets are of major importance. For this purpose, a set of improved WTC, using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived Path Delay (GPD) algorithm, was envisaged for the main six altimetric missions: the so-called reference missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2) and the three ESA missions (ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat).
   The GPD methodology is based on the combination of wet path delays derived from zenith total delays calculated at a network of coastal GNSS stations and valid microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements at altimeter nearby points. At each altimeter point with an invalid MWR value, the Wit is estimated from the set of observations, along with the associated mapping error, using a linear space-time objective analysis technique that takes into account the spatial and temporal variability of the WTC field and the accuracy of each data set used. In the absence of observations, tropospheric delays from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ReAnalysis (ERA) Interim model are adopted.
   Originally designed to improve the WTC in the coastal zone, the GPD evolved to include the global ocean, correcting for land and ice contamination in the MWR footprint, or spurious measurements due to e.g. instrument malfunction.
   This paper presents an overview of the GPD implementation for the afore-mentioned six altimetric missions. The GPD products have been validated by comparison with the WTC adopted as the reference correction by the Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Data in Oceanography (AVISO): the so-called composite correction (Comp) for all missions except Jason-2, for which the version D of the Geophysical Data Records (GDR-D) Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR) WTC is adopted. Various sea level anomaly (SLA) statistical analyses have been performed, and are summarised in this paper: differences in SLA variance calculated along satellite tracks and at crossovers; SLA variance difference function of distance from the coast or function of latitude. Results show that the GPD WTC evidence a very significant improvement with respect to the Comp correction, particularly at polar and coastal regions, for all ESA and TOPEX/Poseidon missions. For the last, the impact is particularly significant in the second part of the mission, since detected anomalies present in the TOPEX Microwave Radiometer products are corrected by the algorithm. For Jason-1 and Jason-2, some improvements are observed in the coastal regions, although globally not very significant, particularly for Jason-2. This is attributed to the good performance of the WTC present in the most recent Jason-1 and Jason-2 products. The GPD WTC constitutes a coherent dataset of global and continuous corrections, for most missions a major improvement with respect to the baseline MWR and the Comp wet tropospheric corrections.

AB Many laboratory studies investigating chlorophyll fluorescence (F) of plants have provided sufficient evidence of the functional link between dynamic changes in photosynthetic activity and F emissions. Far fewer studies, however, have been devoted to detailed analysis of F emission under steady-state conditions, which may be amenable to measurement by passive spectroradiometers onboard airborne or satellite missions. Here, we provide a random-effects meta-analysis of studies using both passively (sun-induced) and actively (e.g. laser-induced) measured steady-state F for detecting stress reactions in terrestrial vegetation. Specifically, we review behaviour of F in red and far-red wavelengths, and also the red to far-red F ratio, for plants physiologically stressed by water deficit, temperature extremes, and nitrogen insufficiency. Results suggest that water stress is, in general, associated with a decline in red and far-red F signal intensity measured at both leaf and canopy levels, whereas the red to far-red F ratio displays an inconsistent behaviour. Chilling, for which only studies with active measurements at the leaf level are available, significantly increased red and far-red F, whereas heat stress produced a less convincing decrease in both F emissions, notably in canopies measured passively. The clearest indicator of temperature stress was the F ratio, which declined significantly and consistently. The F ratio was also the strongest indicator of nitrogen deficiency, revealing a nearly uniformly increasing pattern driven by predominantly declining far-red F. Although significant knowledge gaps were encountered for certain scales and F measurement techniques, the analyses indicate that future airborne or space-borne acquisitions of both red and far-red F signals would be beneficial for timely detection of plant stress events.

AB Atmospheric turbulence in both surface (SBL) and planetary (PBL) boundary-layers induce temporal fluctuations of surface temperature (T-s), with potentially important resulting errors on instantaneous satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR). Several experimental studies have been performed over different surfaces (pine forest, maize, bare soil) using TIR cameras, either ground based or helicopter borne, designed to evaluate (i) how the spatial resolution operates a smoothing of the temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature measurements from space, and (ii) the resulting uncertainty on these measurements. Additionally, a simulation of instantaneous surface temperatures of a maritime pine stand, performed using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) airflow model coupled with a canopy model, is presented for comparison. The results confirm that the impact of the SBL turbulence rapidly vanishes when spatial resolution decreases (i.e., pixel size increases) in the range of 50 to 100 m, while T-s fluctuations induced by the low frequency PBL turbulence remain. For these resolutions, the resulting uncertainty on T-s lies within a +/- 1 degrees C interval. The implications for designing the specifications of future high spatial resolution TIR missions, in particular NeDT and revisit are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accelerated warming of the Arctic climate may alter the local and regional surface energy balances, for which changing land surface temperatures (LSTs) are a key indicator. Modeling current and anticipated changes in the surface energy balance tequires an understanding of the spatio-temporal interactions between LSTs and land cover, both of which can be monitored globally by measurements from space. This paper investigates the accuracy of the MODIS LST/Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km V005 product and its spatio-temporal sensitivity to land surface properties in a Canadian High Arctic permafrost landscape. The land cover ranged from fully vegetated wet sedge tundra to barren rock. MODIS LSTs were compared with in situ radiometer measurements from wet tundra areas collected over a 2-year period from July 2008 to July 2010 including both summer and winter conditions. The accuracy of the MODIS LSTs was -1.1 degrees C with a root mean square error of 3.9 degrees C over the entire observation period. Agreement was lowest during the freeze-back periods where MODIS 1ST showed a cold bias likely due to the overrepresentation of clear-sky conditions. A multi-year analysis of LST spatial anomalies, i.e., the difference between MODIS LSTs and the MODIS 1ST regional mean, revealed a robust spatiotemporal pattern. Highest variability in LST anomalies was found during freeze-up and thaw periods as well as for open water surface in early summer due to the presence or absence of snow or ice. The summer anomaly pattern was similar for all three years despite strong differences in precipitation, air temperature and net radiation. Summer periods with regional mean ISTs above 5.0 degrees C showed the greatest spatial diversity with four distinct 2.0 degrees C classes. Summer anomalies ranged from -4.5 degrees C to 2.6 degrees C with an average standard deviation of 1.8 degrees C. Dry ridge areas heated up the most, while wetland areas and dry areas of sparsely vegetated bedrock with a high albedo remained coolest. The observed summer LST anomalies can be used as a baseline against which to evaluate both past and future changes in land surface properties that relate to the surface energy balance. Summer anomaly classes mainly reflected a combination of albedo and surface wetness. The potential to use this tool to monitor surface drying and wetting in the Arctic should therefore be further explored. A multi-sensor approach combining thermal satellite measurements with optical and radar imagery promises to be an effective tool for a dynamic, process-based ecosystem monitoring scheme.

AB Remote detection of pelagic Sargassum is often hindered by its spectral similarity to other floating materials and by the inadequate spatial resolution. Using measurements from multi-spectral satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS), Landsat, WorldView-2 (or WV-2) as well as hyperspectral sensors (Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean or HICO, Airborne Visible-InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer or AVIRIS) and airborne digital photos, we analyze and compare their ability (in terms of spectral and spatial resolutions) to detect Sargassum and to differentiate it from other floating materials such as Trichodesmium, Syringodium, Ulva, garbage, and emulsified oil. Field measurements suggest that Sargassum has a distinctive reflectance curvature of similar to 630 nm due to its chlorophyll c pigments, which provides a unique spectral signature when combined with the reflectance ratio between brown (similar to 650 nm) and green (similar to 555 nm) wavelengths. For a 10-nm resolution sensor on the hyperspectral HyspIRI mission currently being planned by NASA, a stepwise rule to examine several indexes established from 6 bands (centered at 555, 605, 625, 645,685,755 nm) is shown to be effective to unambiguously differentiate Sargassum from all other floating materials Numerical simulations using spectral endmembers and noise in the satellite-derived reflectance suggest that spectral discrimination is degraded when a pixel is mixed between Sargassum and water. A minimum of 20-30% Sargassum coverage within a pixel is required to retain such ability, while the partial coverage can be as low as 1-2% when detecting floating materials without spectral discrimination. With its expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs similar to 200:1), the hyperspectral HyspIRI mission may provide a compromise between spatial resolution and spatial coverage to improve our capacity to detect, discriminate, and quantify Sargassum.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms are increasingly posing a severe threat to inland waters, particularly at the land-sea interface where toxins can be transported downstream with subsequent impacts to both terrestrial and marine organisms. These blooms are relatively easy to detect optically because of the surface concentration of cells, the presence of phycocyanin pigments, and the elevated backscatter associated with cell size and the presence of gas vacuoles. Major challenges limiting the use of remote sensing have been, first, that many of these water bodies are small relative to the spatial resolution of ocean color satellites, and second, even with a bright algal target, the spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and repeat time for terrestrial satellites is often inadequate. The next generation of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors begin to address these issues with both increased spatial and spectral resolution. Weekly monitoring of Pinto Lake, California has demonstrated that this small water body provides an ideal testbed for development and application of algorithms applicable for legacy and next-generation sensors. Pinto Lake experiences seasonal nearly monospecific blooms with a pronounced species succession. Biomass (as chlorophyll) within Pinto Lake seasonally ranges from similar to 1 to 1000 mu g/L. Pinto Lake has been within the flight lines for several recent airborne missions, including the HyspIRI Preparatory Flight Campaign, and is often targeted for HICO acquisitions. Using these data we demonstrate that spectral-shape algorithms requiring minimal atmospheric correction can be used across a range of legacy sensors to detect cyanobacterial blooms and that, with the availability of high spectral resolution data and appropriate atmospheric correction, it is possible to separate the cyanobacterial genera Aphanizomenon and Microcystis. In California Aphanizomenon is typically non-toxic and blooms prior to toxin-producing Micro cystis, thus leading to the potential for an early warning system based on the identification of algal types.

AB In 2007, the NASA Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) mission was recommended in Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond (Decadal Survey) to address critical science questions in multiple areas, in particular ecosystems and natural hazards. HyspIRI is comprised of two instruments, a visible to short-wavelength infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a thermal infrared (TIR) multispectral imager, together with an Intelligent Payload Module (IPM) for onboard processing and rapid downlink of selected data. The VSWIR instrument will have 10 nm contiguous bands and cover the 380-2500 nm spectral range with 30 m spatial resolution and a revisit of 16 days. The TIR instrument will have 8 discrete bands in the 4-13 mu m range with 60 m spatial resolution and a revisit of 5 days. With these two instruments in low Earth orbit, HyspIRI will be able to address key science and applications questions in a wide array of fields, ranging from ecosystem function and diversity to human health and urbanization.

AB The surface radiation budget is characterized by the all-wave net radiation. Existing parameterization methods of estimating surface net radiation require the input of many surface and atmospheric parameters and rely heavily on the availability and accuracy of such data. Other methods involve retrieval of the shortwave (0.3-3.0 mu m) and longwave (3.0-100.0 mu m) components separately from visible and shortwave infrared (VSWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) data, respectively. The proposed HyspIRI mission will carry a VSWIR spectrometer and a TIR multispectral imager with a nadir spatial resolution of 60 m. The broad range of spectral information will provide a unique opportunity to directly estimate the surface net radiation from the high-resolution HyspIRI data. In this study, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the clear-sky instantaneous all-wave net radiation over the land surface by combining VSWIR and TIR remote sensing data. The new method is based on extensive modeling of atmospheric radiative transfer over the entire solar spectrum. The algorithm is first tested with MODIS data. Validation with 1-year measurements at seven Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites in 2013 demonstrates that the new method can accurately estimate clear-sky instantaneous all-wave net radiation with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 70.6 W/m(2), which is better than the method of separating shortwave and longwave components. MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) data from the HyspIRI preparatory airborne campaign are also used as a proxy to demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for data from the future HyspIRI mission.

AB Landsat imagery for northwest Alaska from 1 February to 31 August, 1985-2011 was used to map snow persistence at high spatial resolution. We analyzed 11,645 scenes covering 505,800 km(2), including five Arctic National Park units and the range of the Western Arctic caribou herd (85 Landsat path/rows). A cloud mask was created using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS). Terrain shadows were calculated from ASTER G-DEM2 and solar incidence angle. The presence of snow cover was determined using separate Snowmap algorithms for non-shadowed and shadowed pixels. Resulting snow cover data were reformatted into 562 30 x 30 km tiles, with an average sample size per pixel of 216 cloud-free observations. A binary classification tree was used to successfully determine the day of the year that best marked the change from snow to snow-free conditions for 99.8% of the study area. An internal consistency check evaluating the occurrence of snow-free data earlier than that day or snow data later than that day, showed that 98.7% of the land pixels were consistently classified >= 90% of the time. Comparison with MODIS end of snow season data showed an average difference of 42 days. The snow persistence map was strongly correlated with the few SNOTEL stations in the study area (r(2) = 0.856). Broadly, most snowmelt over the study area occurs from late April through early June, with timing delayed farther north and at higher elevations. Many local-scale snow patterns are evident in the detailed, 30-m product. The snow persistence map was co-registered to Landsat land cover mapping, creating a powerful, publicly available resource for ecosystem and land use analyses (https://irma.nps.gov/App/Reference/Profile/2203863).

AB Surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) is one critical component of the surface energy balance and is closely related to the surface temperature fields. The SULR with the moderate spatial resolution and appropriate precision in the Tibetan Plateau, a large and complex cryosphere, can enhance our understanding of the land surface processes, atmospheric circulations and even global climate change. The purpose of this paper is to estimate SULR from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). A hybrid method is proposed that combines extensive radiative transfer simulation and the Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) statistical model. For the sake of ensuring the availability of the simulation database, the eligible profiles from MODIS atmospheric profiles product were screened according to five criteria. And then the analyses on the important parameters of the simulation dataset were performed to check the integrality of this dataset Moreover, the variables' importance was analyzed, and TOA radiances of MODIS channels 29, 31, 32 and 33 (or VIIRS channels M14, M15 and M16) and sensor view zenith angle (VZA) were selected to retrieve SULR The ANN-based retrieval model was created finally based on this simulation dataset The evaluation showed good agreements for both MODIS and VIIRS training and testing datasets with R-2 greater than 0.98. The MODIS SULR was validated using two-year ground-measured data at seven sites in the Tibetan Plateau with R-2 of 0.886, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 26.985W m(-2) and mean bias error (MBE) of 10.812W m(-2) as a whole. And the relevance was obvious from the overall trend and distribution though the discrepancy was relatively large when directly comparing SULR from VIIRS and MODIS data. The validation results showed that the ANN model is a good nonlinear model to retrieve SULR with the TOA radiances and VZA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI Improving InSAR elevation models in Antarctica using laser altimetry,

AB Ice dynamics is closely related to climate change. However, a lack of digital elevation models (DEMs) of sufficient horizontal resolution and vertical precision has been a major issue in dynamic studies for years. Existing Antarctic DEMs are derived from satellite radar and laser altimetry as well as limited terrestrial data; these sparse datasets result in poor spatial resolution (hundreds of metres to 1 km). In this paper, we propose a method for generating high-accuracy and high-resolution DEMs using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry by reducing the influence of ice motion, satellite orbital errors and topographically correlated atmospheric delays. A case study in the Grove Mountains area shows that the InSAR DEM has a root-mean-square (RMS) error of 5.9 m, which is better than the Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) (21.1 m) and Bamber (8.5 m) DEMs. The new DEM is used to calculate ice velocity over the Grove Mountains area where GPS measurements have been collected for comparison. Compared to the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) InSAR-Based Antarctica Ice Velocity Map, ice velocity estimates from long-baseline interferogram and the new DEM have a smaller RMS error; this suggests that with the new DEM, baseline length is no longer a limiting factor for the accuracy of InSAR-based ice velocity mapping.

AB Nearshore bathymetry is likely to be the coastal variable that most limits the investigation of coastal processes and the accuracy of numerical models in coastal areas, as acquiring medium spatial resolution data in the near-shore is highly demanding and costly. As such, the ability to derive bathymetry using remote sensing techniques is a topic of increasing interest in coastal monitoring and research. This contribution focuses on the application of the linear transform algorithm to obtain satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) maps of the nearshore, at medium resolution (30 m), from freely available and easily accessible Landsat 8 imagery. The algorithm was tuned with available bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for a 60-km-long nearshore stretch of a highly complex coastal system that includes barrier islands, exposed sandy beaches, and tidal inlets (Ria Formosa, Portugal). A comparison of the retrieved depths is presented, enabling the configuration of nearshore profiles and extracted isobaths to be explored and compared with traditional topographic/bathymetric techniques (e.g., high- and medium-resolution LiDAR data and survey-grade echo-sounding combined with high-precision positioning systems). The results demonstrate that the linear algorithm is efficient for retrieving bathymetry from multi-spectral satellite data for shallow water depths (0 to 12 m), showing a mean bias of 02 m, a median difference of -0.1 m, and a root mean square error of 0.89 m. Accuracy is shown to be depth dependent, an inherent limitation of passive optical detection systems. Accuracy further decreases in areas where turbidity is likely to be higher, such as locations adjacent to tidal inlets. The SDB maps provide reliable estimations of the shoreline position and of nearshore isobaths for different cases along the complex coastline analysed. The use of freely available satellite imagery proved to be a quick and reliable method for acquiring updated medium-resolution, high-frequency (days and weeks), low-cost bathymetric information for large areas and depths of up to 12 m in clear waters without wave breaking, allowing almost constant monitoring of the submerged beach and the shoreface.

AB The presented adjacency correction algorithm is based on the use of the point spread function (PSF) which allows calculating the contribution of reflections from the nearby pixels to the apparent radiance of the target. The analytical expression of the PSF for an arbitrary stratified atmosphere is obtained in the approximation of primary scattering, whereas the full equation of radiative transfer is used for the estimation of the radiance reflected from the surface. The algorithm is sensor independent and can be applied for processing images of water basins with arbitrary shape of the shore line and under different geometries of observation. The program using this algorithm is included in Modular Inversion Program - MIP (Heege et al., 2014) for processing of satellite images on a routine basis. Examples of processing results are presented in the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) and its diurnal variation are important when evaluating climate change, the land-atmosphere energy budget, and the global hydrological cycle. However, the available satellite LST products have either a coarse spatial resolution or a low temporal resolution, which constrains their potential applications. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM) for the retrieval of high temporal and spatial resolution LST from multi-scale polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite observations. Compared with the traditional fusion methods for LST with two different sensors, the proposed method is able to fuse the LST from arbitrary sensors in a unified framework. The model was tested using LST with fine, moderate, and coarse-resolutions. Data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, and the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) were used. The fused LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility (LSA SAF) project. The final validation results indicate that the STITFM is accurate to within about 2.5 K. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long-wavelength Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite systems have the potential to increase the efficiency of forest mapping and monitoring, which today are based primarily on optical satellite systems. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of using L-band SAR satellite images to detect and delineate clear-cuts in Swedish boreal forest. A set of computationally efficient techniques are combined in a fully automated unsupervised bi-temporal change detection approach that detects changes in SAR backscatter intensities. For radiometric normalization and initial change classification, we propose an iterative procedure consisting of successive polynomial based histogram matching and thresholding. Recently proposed methods for automatic SAR amplitude ratio thresholding and final change classification are adopted. The latter is a Markov random field based change detection method that exploits both spectral and spatial information from one or multiple SAR polarization channels. The change detection approach was applied to SAR images from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) acquired in Fine Beam Dual (FBD) mode (HH- and HV-polarizations) with a pixel size of 20 m (path data). Clear-cuts that took place between image acquisitions were clearly detected, and most errors were due to imperfect delineations of clear-cut edges. Pixel-wise clear-cut detection accuracies above 90% could be reached, with false alarm rates of approximately 10% or less. The results indicate that ALOS PALSAR path data are well suited for operational clear-cut detection in Swedish boreal forest. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The study compares the accuracy of timber volume prediction based on four different three-dimensional remote sensing data sets in one study area in southern Norway: airborne laser scanning (ALS), stereo aerial photogrammetry (AP), satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on the TanDEM-X mission, and satellite radargrammetry based on the TerraSAR-X mission. We fitted linear mixed effects models with vegetation height and density metrics obtained from the remote sensing data sets as explanatory variables. The crossvalidated root mean squared error (RMSE) relative to the observed mean was used as the measure of goodness-of-fit. ALS provided the most accurate prediction at plot level with RMSE = 19%, followed by AP (31%), InSAR (42%), and radargrammetry (44%). At stand level the methods' performances were equally ordered, with RMSE values of 12-23%. Including the variables terrain slope and aspect in the models improved the accuracy of AP, InSAR, and radargrammetry slightly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an algorithm for estimating urban density from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and compare the urban density patterns of global megacities. SAR images are uniquely able to detect structural information of objects, but they are very sensitive to orientation angle. This issue has been an obstacle to applying SAR images to urban areas. Kajimoto and Susaki (2013b) proposed an algorithm to handle this issue. The effects of polarization orientation angle (POA) are removed by rotating the coherency matrix and then calculating the mean and standard deviation of scattering power by POA domain. The algorithm can estimate urban density from a single fully polarimetric SAR image but has the drawback that the generated urban density maps of multiple images are not comparable with each other because the algorithm generates a relative urban density valid only within the analyzed image. We therefore extend the method by calculating POA-domain statistics from all images of interest so that the generated maps can be compared. Estimated urban densities are assessed on two types of urban density generated from GIS data, building-to-land ratio and floor-area ratio. We demonstrate that the extended method can estimate urban density with reasonable accuracy. Finally, we generate two scattergrams of indices derived from urban density maps of global megacities. An analysis using the scattergrams indicates insightful information about the patterns of urban development. We conclude that the proposed algorithm and the analysis using the obtained results are beneficial to understanding the conditions in megacities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling canopy height in a savanna ecosystem using spacebome lidar
   waveforms

AB Although savanna ecosystems cover about 20% of the terrestrial land surface and can have productivity equal to some closed forests, their role in the global carbon cycle is poorly understood. As a result, these ecosystems are globally more important than generally appreciated in the earth observation and modeling communities. Remote sensing has been proposed as an efficient tool in assessing the physical structure of an ecosystem which in turn is closely related to its ecological functionality such as carbon storage. Studies using Light Detection and Ranging (Iidar) have demonstrated the technology's ability to measure canopy height and the strong relationship between canopy height and structural attributes such as aboveground biomass, but most of this work has focused on closed canopy forests. This study explored the applicability of spacebome lidar to estimate canopy height as a pre-requisite for aboveground biomass and carbon storage assessment in savannas. The research used a case study of the Oak Savannas of Santa Clara in California, USA. Discrete return airborne lidar data was used to extract height metrics in plots coincident with waveform data from the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)'s Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Detailed analysis of GLAS waveforms was followed by non-parametric regression modeling to estimate maximum canopy height and 80th and 90th percentile vegetation heights. Existing methods were adapted with the inclusion of NDVI (as a canopy cover proxy) and interaction terms to increase utility in savanna ecosystems. Our main findings were that merely adopting the methods derived for forests would not produce adequate results. Maximum canopy height was estimated with better accuracy compared to percentile height metrics. The inclusion of NDVI and interaction terms improved maximum canopy height modeling much more than it did for the 80th and 90th percentile height modeling. Taller stands on flat terrain had the best results while shorter stands on steep terrain had the worst. Our work has demonstrated the capability of waveform lidar to assess vegetation structural attributes in savannas. The challenge in canopy height modeling using this technique in such ecosystems not only is limited to terrain slope but also includes the interacting influence of low canopy cover and short height. As such, we need special models for savanna areas in an effort to do global assessments of terrestrial vegetation structure using lidar. For future studies we recommend a closer look at the non-significant influence of canopy cover on the percentile canopy height models especially its implication on the subsequent biomass modeling.

AB This study evaluates the suitability of the method HelioMont, developed by MeteoSwiss, for estimating solar radiation from geostationary satellite data over the Alpine region. The algorithm accounts for the influence of topography, clouds, snow cover and the atmosphere on incoming solar radiation. The main error sources are investigated for both direct and diffuse solar radiation components by comparison with ground-based measurement taken at three sites, namely Bolzano (IT), Davos (CH) and Payeme (CH), encompassing different topographic conditions. The comparison shows that the method provides high accuracy of the yearly cycle: the Mean Absolute Bias (MAB) is below 5 W m(-2) at the lowland station Payerne and below 12 W m(-2) at the other two mountainous stations for the monthly averages of global and diffuse radiation. For diffuse radiation the MAB is in the range 11-15 W m(-2) for daily means and 34-40 W m(-2) for hourly means. It is found that the largest errors in diffuse and direct radiation components on shorter time scales occur during summer and for cloud-free days. In both Bolzano and Davos the errors for daily-mean diffuse radiation can exceed 50 W m(-2) under such conditions. As HelioMont uses monthly climatological values of atmospheric aerosol characteristics, the effects of this approximation are investigated by simulating clear-sky solar radiation with the radiative transfer model (RTM) libRadtran using instantaneous aerosol measurements. Both ground-based and satellite-based data on aerosol optical properties and water vapor column amount are evaluated. When using daily atmospheric input the estimation of the hourly averages improves significantly and the mean error is reduced to 10-20 W m(-2). These results suggest the need for a more detailed characterization of the local-scale clear-sky atmospheric conditions for modeling solar radiation on daily and hourly time scales.

AB Using a spectral vegetation index (VI) is an efficient approach for monitoring plant phenology from remotely-sensed data. However, the quantitative biophysical meaning of most VIs is still unclear, and, particularly at high northern latitudes characterized by low green biomass renewal rate and snow-affected VI signals, it is difficult to use them for tracking seasonal vegetation growth and retrieving phenology. In this study we propose a physically-based new vegetation index for characterizing terrestrial vegetation canopy green leaf area dynamics: the plant phenology index (PPI). PPI is derived from the solution to a radiative transfer equation, is computed from red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, and has a nearly linear relationship with canopy green leaf area index (LAI), enabling it to depict canopy foliage density well. This capability is verified with stacked-leaf measurements, canopy reflectance model simulations, and field LAI measurements from international sites. Snow influence on PPI is shown by modeling and satellite observations to be less severe than on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), while soil brightness variations in general have moderate influence on PPI. Comparison of satellite-derived PPI to ground observations of plant phenology and gross primary productivity (GPP) shows strong similarity of temporal patterns over several Nordic boreal forest sites. The proposed PPI can thus serve as an efficient tool for estimating plant canopy growth, and will enable improved vegetation monitoring, particularly of evergreen needle-leaf forest phenology at high northern latitudes.

AB Unmanned airborne systems (UAS) technology opens new horizons in precision agriculture for effective characterization of the variability in crop state at high spatial resolution and high revisit frequency. Green area index (GAI) is a key agronomic variable involved in many processes and used for decision making. This paper describes a physically based algorithm for estimating GAI from UAS acquisitions. The UPS plane platform used here was equipped with four cameras in green (550 nm), red (660 nm), red-edge (735 nm) and near infrared (790 nm). It provided multiple views by overlapping images along and between the tracks. A lookup table was generated to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using the reflectances in the four bands and the specific view-sun angles for each individual image. The average of the ensemble of solutions corresponding to the individual images allows regularizing the solutions of the ill posed inverse problem. Around six images were required to get stable GAI estimates and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) value was used as a proxy for the associated uncertainties. Comparison with ground based measurements showed that the accuracy of UAS GAI estimates over wheat and rapeseed crops was around 0.2 in terms of RMSE. The use of normalized reflectances compared to absolute reflectances improved the performances of GAI estimates (0.17 compared to 0.26 GAI in terms of RMSE) particularly under unstable illumination conditions. High repeatability in the estimates from UPS flights at different acquisition times was observed. The use of the red-edge band normalized (absolute) reflectances brought 30% (10%) improvement of accuracy for the low to medium GAI values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The land-surface diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) and its model parameters characterize the thermal properties of the land surface. In this study, we propose a method to estimate the diurnal cycle of land surface temperature difference (Delta T-s) from the top-of-the-atmosphere brightness temperatures of MSG-SEVIRI channels 9 (10.8 mu m) and 10 (12.0 mu m). Fitting a DTC model to the diurnal cycle of AT, can directly determine the land-surface DTC model parameters without resorting to land surface temperature and emissivity. The performance of the DTC model was evaluated using MSG-SEVIRI pixels over different land cover types. The results show that the fitting accuracy (root mean square error) of the DTC model is better than 1 K for most pixels. The spatial patterns of diurnal temperature range, time of maximum temperature, and attenuation constant were analyzed, and the potential applications of these parameters are presented. These parameters are shown to be related to the physical properties of the land surface and may bring new insight into the estimation of thermal inertia and soil moisture.

AB This paper presents the application of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) algorithms for the precise monitoring of earth dams ground deformation. The test site selected for this study is the Conza Dam, located in the southern Apennines (Italy), very close to the epicenter of the big earthquake (M-w = 6.9) which took place on November 23th, 1980, striking the Irpinia region. Among the multiple advanced DInSAR techniques developed by the SAR community during the last decade, this work uses the so-called SUBSOFT software, developed by the Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab) group from the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), which is based on the use of Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) algorithm. The analysis is carried out using 51 ENVIronmental SATellite-Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT-ASAR) images, corresponding to the period from 29th of November 2002 to the 30th of July 2010. In this framework, ground displacements recorded by a network of conventional ground-based sensors are also available for the same temporal span. Indeed, the embankment dam is well instrumented to measure internal settlements by means of cross-arms placed in six different cross-sections, and superficial displacements by means of targets for precise leveling. A statistical analysis has been performed to carry out a better comparison between the measurements obtained with the conventional field sensors and the interferometric data. The high agreement between final DInSAR displacements and in-situ instrumental data, demonstrates the reliability of such technique for the precise monitoring of civil infrastructures, and concretely, in dams with a high exposure factor and its consequent risk.

AB This work focuses on the reconstruction of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) diurnal cycle through combination of numerical model analyses and geostationary satellite measurements. The approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the diurnal signal source to produce gap-free optimally interpolated (01) hourly SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing one to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day.
   The method is applied to reconstruct the hourly Mediterranean SST field during summer 2011 using SEVIRI data and Mediterranean Forecasting System analyses. A synthetic cloud reconstruction experiment demonstrated that the 01 SST method is able to reconstruct an unbiased SST field with a RMS = 0.16 degrees C with respect to SEVIRI observations. The OI interpolation estimate, the model first guess and the SEVIRI data are evaluated using drifter and mooring measurements. Special attention is devoted to the analysis of diurnal warming (DW) events that are particularly frequent in the Mediterranean Sea. The model reproduces quite well the Mediterranean SST diurnal cycle, except for the DW events. Due to the thickness of the model surface layer, the amplitude of the model diurnal cycle is often less intense than the corresponding SEVIR1 and drifter observations. The Diurnal 01 SST (DOISST) field, resulting from the blending of model and SEVIRI data via optimal interpolation, reproduces well the diurnal cycle including extreme DW events. The evaluation of DOISST products against drifter measurements results in a mean bias of -0.07 degrees C and a RMS of 0.56 degrees C over interpolated pixels. These values are very close to the corresponding statistical parameters estimated from SEVIRI data (bias = -0.16 degrees C, RMS = 0.47 degrees C). Results also confirm that part of the mean bias between temperature measured by moorings at 1 m depth and the satellite observations can be ascribed to the different nature of the measurements (bulk versus skin).

   waveform lidar to topography and survey characteristics
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Recently, Armston et al. (2013) have demonstrated that a new, physically-based method for direct retrieval of canopy gap probability P-gap from waveform lidar can improve the estimation of P-gap over discrete return lidar data. The success of the approach was demonstrated in a savanna woodland environment in Australia. The huge advantage of this method is that it uses the data themselves to solve for the canopy contrast term i.e. the ratio of the reflectance from crown and ground, rho(v)/rho(g). In this way the method avoids local calibration that is typically required to overcome differences in either rho(v) or rho(g). To be more generally useful the method must be demonstrated on different sites and in the presence of slope and different sensor and survey configurations. If it is robust to these things, slope in particular, then we would suggest it is likely to be widely useful. Here, we test the robustness of the retrieval of P-gap from waveform lidar using the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research dataset, over the Heihe River Basin region of China. The data contain significant canopy, terrain and survey variations, presenting a rather different set of conditions to those previously used. Results show that rho(v)/rho(g) is seen to be stable across all flights and for all levels of spatial aggregation. This strongly supports the robustness of the new P-gap retrieval method, which assumes that this relationship is stable. A comparison between P-gap estimated from hemiphotos and from the waveform lidar showed agreement with Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.91. The waveform lidar-derived estimates of P-gap agreed to within 8% of values derived from hemiphotos, with a bias of 0.17%. The new waveform model was shown to be stable across different off-nadir scan angles and in the presence of slopes up to 26 degrees with R >= 0.85 in all cases. We also show that the waveform model can be used to calculate P-gap using just the mean value of canopy returns, assuming that their distribution is unimodal. Lastly, we show that the method can also be applied to discrete return lidar data, albeit with slightly lower accuracy and higher bias, allowing P-gap comparisons with previously-collected lidar datasets. Our results show the new method should be applicable for estimating P-gap robustly across large areas, and from lidar data collected at different times and using different systems; an increasingly iinportant requirement.

AB Early warning monitoring systems in food-insecure countries aim to detect unfavourable crop and pasture conditions as early as possible during the growing season. This manuscript describes a procedure to estimate the probability of experiencing an end-of-season biomass production deficit during the on-going season based on a statistical analysis of Earth Observation data. A 15-year time series of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation from the SPOT-VEGETATION instrument is used to characterize the climatological development of vegetation, its variability and its current status. Forecasts of overall seasonal performances, expressed in terms of the probability of experiencing a critical deficit at the end of the growing season, are updated regularly whenever a new satellite observation is made available. Results and performances of the method are discussed for croplands and pastures in the Sahel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is among today's major tools for climate monitoring. After more than a decade of operation, there still remains considerable uncertainty about its performance in polar regions. We compare MODE LST to eight years of in situ observations of surface and air temperatures on Austfonna, an Arctic ice cap located on Svalbard. From measurements of longwave radiation and air temperature, an in situ cloud index is derived to quantify the cloudiness at the study site and assess the possibility for LST being affected by erroneous cloud detection. According to this cloud index, only 26% of satellite-derived LST values are acquired under clear-sky conditions. In situations, when the cloud index indicates clouds, about 40% of the scenes are classified as clear-sky by MODIS during winter, while it is only about 20% in the summer period. The shortcomings of the MODIS cloud detection are reflected by a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of LST compared to in situ surface temperatures of 7.0 K under actual cloudy conditions, in contrast to 3.0 K under actual clear-sky conditions. The overall RMSEs of LST compared to surface and air temperatures are 5.3 K and 6.2 K, respectively. The bias under actual clear-sky conditions displays a clear seasonality, with MODIS LST being strongly cold-biased during winter and slightly warm-biased during summer. The study exemplifies the challenges of thermal remote sensing over snow and ice surface in areas with frequent cloudiness, especially during polar night. Nevertheless, remotely sensed LST offers a great, but hitherto largely unexploited opportunity for environmental monitoring in regions with sparse observations, in particular if the cloud detection can be improved.

AB There is increasing need to characterize the distribution of snow in complex terrain using remote sensing approaches, especially in isolated mountainous regions that are often water-limited, the principal source of terrestrial freshwater, and sensitive to climatic shifts and variations. We apply intensive topographic surveys, multi-temporal LiDAR, and Random Forest modeling to quantify snow volume and characterize associated errors across seven land cover types in a semi-arid mountainous catchment at a 1 and 4 m spatial resolution. The LiDAR-based estimates of both snow-off surface topology and snow depths were validated against ground-based measurements across the catchment. LiDAR-derived snow depths estimates were most accurate in areas of low lying vegetation such as meadow and shrub vegetation (RMSE = 0.14 m) as compared to areas consisting of tree cover (RMSE = 0.20-0.35 m). The highest errors were found along the edge of conifer forests (RMSE = 0.35 m), however a second conifer transect outside the catchment had much lower errors (RMSE = 0.21 m). This difference is attributed to the wind exposure of the first site that led to highly variable snow depths at short spatial distances. The Random Forest modeled errors deviated from the field measured errors with-a RMSE of 0.09-0.34 m across the different cover types. The modeling was used to calculate a theoretical lower and upper bound of catchment snow volume error of 21-30%. Results show that snow drifts, which are important for maintaining spring and summer stream flows and establishing and sustaining water-limited plant species, contained 30 +/- 5-6% of the snow volume while only occupying 10% of the catchment area similar to findings by prior physically-based modeling approaches. This study demonstrates the potential utility of combining multi-temporal LiDAR with Random Forest modeling to quantify the distribution of snow depth with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of terrestrial ecosystems because it links the hydrological, energy, and carbon cycles. Several satellite-based ET models have been developed for extrapolating local observations to regional and global scales, but recent studies have shown large model uncertainties in ET simulations. In this study, we compared eight ET models, including five empirical and three process-based models, with the objective of providing a reference for choosing and improving methods. The results showed that the eight models explained between 61 and 80% of the variability in ET at 23 eddy covariance towers in China and adjacent regions. The mean annual ET for all of China varied from 535 to 852 mm yr(-1) among the models. The interannual variability of yearly ET varied significantly between models during 1982-2009 because of different model structures and the dominant environmental factors employed. Our evaluation results showed that the parameters of the empirical methods may have different combination because the environmental factors of ET are not independent. Although the three process-based models showed high model performance across the validation Sites, there were substantial differences among them in the temporal and spatial patterns of ET, the dominant environment factors and the energy partitioning schemes. The disagreement among current ET models highlights the need for further improvements and validation, which can be achieved by investigating model structures and examining the ET component estimates and the critical model parameters.

   (SSH)
AB ESA's Envisat mission carried a RA-2 radar altimeter since its launch in 2002 to sense sea state and especially measure sea surface height (SSH). The onboard processing combined multiple echoes incoherently to reduce Speckle noise and benefit from data compression. In fact, according to past literature the amplitudes were generally expected to be independent. Nevertheless, samples of complex data time series of individual echoes (IE) were down-linked and archived since 2004 for research studies. In this note we demonstrate that there is sufficient inter-pulse coherence for Doppler processing and we suggest that the archived data can be re-processed into improved SSH. This is of particular interest in challenging domains (e.g., coastal zone) where coherent processing can mitigate errors from ocean surface backscatter inhomogeneity and nearby land backscatter. A new method called zero-Doppler to process IEs is thus proposed and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   of the European Space Agency helped in downloading data through the GPOD
   service. We consulted several experts in the field after our initial
   analysis demonstrated what was initially an unexpected pulse-to-pulse
   coherence in IE data Walter Smith of NOAA brought the Walsh criterion to
   our attention and suggested a crucial test of comparing the measured
   Doppler velocity with the satellite vertical orbit velocity. Keith Raney
   of JHU/APL provided further interesting discussion and comments about
   Doppler processing. The results in this paper were first reported at the
   6th Coastal Altimetry Workshop, Riva del Garda, Italy, 20-21 September

The approach addresses the spatial enhancement and calibration of remote sensing (RS) data acquired from coarse-resolution TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission; similar to 26-km resolution) and MODIS images in the development of image-surfaces of in-mountain precipitation and surface air temperature at 250-m resolution for input to a new spatially-distributed monthly snow-accumulation and snowmelt model. Spatially-enhanced precipitation and air temperature surfaces were subsequently calibrated using either geographically-weighted regression or simple linear regression and point-data from climate stations. When point-extractions from the calibrated products were compared against a new set of independent climate-station data, their respective values were comparable, giving an overall r(2) of 0.87 for precipitation (RMSE = 10 mm month(-1)) and 0.96 for surface air temperature. With input from calibrated surfaces, monthly SCA and snow-water equivalence (SWE) in the Qilian Mountains were subsequently modeled over a 10-year period (2000-2009). Seasonal values of SCA and SWE were compared with MODIS-based (optical) and AMSR-E passive microwave-based estimates of SCA and SWE. In most cases, comparisons revealed suitable agreement across the various evaluations of SCA. Minor discrepancy between MODIS- and AMSR-E-based estimates of SCA resulted in a mean overlap of 73% when modeled SCA was compared to MODIS-based SCA and 84% overlap, when compared to AMSR-E-based SCA Modeled and AMSR-E-based estimates of SWE at lower- to upper-mountain elevations (<= 3900 m above mean sea level; AMSL) compared fairly well. At elevations >3900 m AMSL, discrepancies between estimates were largely attributed to an overestimation of local precipitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The euphotic depth (Z(eu)) is a key parameter in modelling primary production (PP) using satellite ocean colour. However, evaluations of satellite Z(eu) products are scarce. The objective of this paper is to investigate existing approaches and sensors to estimate Z(eu) from satellite and to evaluate how different Z(eu) products might affect the estimation of PP in the Southern Ocean (SO). Euphotic depth was derived from MODIS and SeaWiFS products of (i) surface chlorophyll-a (Z(eu)-Chla) and (ii) inherent optical properties (Z(eu)-IOP). They were compared with in situ measurements of Z(eu) from different regions of the SO. Both approaches and sensors are robust to retrieve Z(eu), although the best results were obtained using the IOP approach and SeaWiFS data, with an average percentage of error (E) of 25.43% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.10 m (log scale). Nevertheless, differences in the spatial distribution of Z(eu)-Chla and Z(eu)-IOP for both sensors were found as large as 30% over specific regions. These differences were also observed in PP. On average, PP based on Z(eu)-Chla was 8% higher than PP based on Z(eu)-IOP, but it was up to 30% higher south of 60 degrees S. Satellite phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a(ph)) derived by the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm at different wavelengths were also validated and the results showed that MODIS a(ph) are generally more robust than SeaWiFS. Thus, MODIS a(ph) should be preferred in PP models based on a(ph) in the SO. Further, we reinforce the importance of investigating the spatial differences between satellite products, which might not be detected by the validation with in situ measurements due to the insufficient amount and uneven distribution of the data.

AB Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the columnar atmospheric aerosol content. Satellite remote sensing has been used to retrieve AOD over land and ocean at spatial resolutions of several to several tens of km. In most cases, a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used to construct a look-up table (LUT) to act as a map between measurements and physical quantities. In the current study, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements were used to develop a Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) for use over Hong Kong at high (500 m) spatial resolution, without using a LUT. Instead, RTM calculations were applied directly to the MODIS data, with the aerosol properties derived from a local urban Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and surface reflectance from the MOD09GA level-2 daily surface reflectance product. For validation, the SARA AOD at 500 m, along with the operational MODIS aerosol product (MOD04 C005) at 10 km spatial resolution, was compared with data from a ground-based Microtops II sun photometer at the Hong Kong International Airport, a Sky-radiometer at the City University of Hong Kong, and an AERONET station at Hong Kong Hok Tsui. The 500 m AOD retrieved from the SARA showed a high consistency with ground-based AOD measurements, with average correlation coefficient similar to 0.964, root mean square error (RMSE) similar to 0.077, and mean absolute error (MAE) similar to 0.065. The SARA AOD showed a good agreement with MOD04 C005 AOD over both urban and rural areas of Hong Kong, with average correlation coefficient similar to 0.917, RMSE similar to 0.087, and MAE similar to 0.072. The results demonstrate that our simplified AOD algorithm is better able to represent aerosol conditions over Hong Kong than the MOD04 C005 standard product as well as other higher resolution algorithms which have been tested over Hong Kong.

AB We evaluated the potential of a multi-temporal Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) for invasive species mapping in Hawaiian rainforests. Earth Observing-1 Hyperion time series data were compiled in a single image cube and ingested into MESMA. While the temporal analysis provided a way to incorporate species phenology, a feature selection technique automatically identified the best time and best spectral feature set to optimize the separability among the native and invasive tree species in our study area. We initiated an alternative Separability Index (SI)-based feature selection approach in which a boundary condition reduced the amount of correlation in the selected spectral subset. We hypothesized that redundant spectral information could be avoided, and improved plant detection accuracy could be achieved, with reduced computational time due to the selection of fewer bands in the mixture analysis. Our analysis showed a systematic increase in the invasive species detection success when we compared the output of multi-temporal MESMA (Kappa = 0.78) with that of the traditional unitemporal approach (Kappa = 0.51-0.69). Even for unitemporal MESMA, in which only a single input image was used, the band selection strategy was beneficial both in plant detection accuracy and computational time. We could further demonstrate that, despite a lack of imagery covering all phenological events, a proper band selection strategy can emphasize subtle spectral and phenological differences between species and can thereby partly compensate for this lack of data. This creates opportunities for mapping in areas where cloud cover is a limiting factor for building extended spectral image time series. This approach is sufficiently general and inherently adaptive, thereby supporting species mapping using Hyperion and forthcoming space-borne imaging spectrometers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB A near-continuous time series of global mean, skin SST anomaly has been calculated for 1995 to 2011, based on the first consistently processed data set for the Along Track Scanning Radiometer(s) or ATSRs. The ATSR multi-mission Version 2.0 (ESA_V2) archive is used to derive level 3 averaged skin SSTs for ATSR-2 and AATSR consistently for both sensors using a standard operational-like processor. Data are then gridded, aligned between sensors and a final anomaly time series derived relative to a climatological average calculated, for each month, from the standard ATSR data for the same period; the process strongly reduces global mean and spatially varying biases. The ATSR-2 to AATSR SST relative bias is obtained by analysing the overlap period (July 2002 to June 2003) between the two sensors. Before alignment, the average relative bias between ESA_V2 SST data sets from the two instruments is +0.03 K for the dual-view, three channel SST, with a small but linear relation to water vapour in the differences between ATSR-2 and AATSR. Post-alignment, the residual average relative bias is +0.007 K The sampled area for the final time series using the ESA_V2 data extends from 60 degrees N to 65 degrees S; it is recommended that sampling areas be always provided for time series of data for climate. The uncertainty on the monthly mean global SST anomaly is estimated to be 0.014 K for ATSR-2 and 0.011 K for AATSR which are comparable to the uncertainties on monthly global average in situ data sets in the equivalent time period.

AB A fundamental parameter derived from satellite ocean color measurements is the spectral remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda) (sr(-1)), which is used as the input to all inversion algorithms to derive bio-optical properties (e.g., chlorophyll-a concentration or Chl in mg m(-3)) and water's inherent optical properties (IOPs). The accuracy and uncertainties of the satellite-derived R-rs have only been assessed through comparisons with in situ measurements that were often limited in both space and time. Here, a novel approach was developed and used to estimate R-rs uncertainties from SeaWiFS and MODIS/Aqua (MODISA) measurements over clear waters. The study focused on two oligotrophic ocean gyres in the North Atlantic and South Pacific, and used a recently developed new Chl algorithm to provide a constraint to determine the highest-quality R-rs data with minimal errors. These data were used as surrogates of "ground truth" or references (termed as R-rs,R-true) to estimate the R-rs error in each data point, with uncertainty estimates (in both relative and absolute forms) generated from statistical analyses. The study led to several findings: One, both SeaWiFS and MODISA have met their mission goals of achieving R-rs uncertainties and absolute accuracy (assuming that the R-rs,R-true values can represent the truth) to within 5% for blue bands and blue waters. As a comparison, nearly all previous in situ-based validation efforts reported mean (or median) percentage differences exceeding 10% between in situ and satellite R-rs in the blue bands. Two, for the green bands, R-rs uncertainties are significantly higher, often in the range of 10-15% for oligotrophic waters. Three, SeaWiFS R-rs uncertainties are generally higher than those of MODISA, possibly due to its lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Four, all R-rs errors are spectrally related in a monotonous way from the blue to the red wavelengths, suggesting that these errors are resulted primarily from the imperfect atmospheric correction algorithms as opposed to sensor noise or vicarious calibration. Such empirical relationships are shown to be useful in reducing the R-rs uncertainties for the North Atlantic Gyre and may also be useful for most of the ocean waters. Finally, the tabulated results provide lower bounds of R-rs(lambda) uncertainties for more productive waters. The findings may serve as references for future ocean color missions, and they have also significant implications for uncertainty estimates of other ocean color data products. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB C-band Radarsat-2 data were used to develop Multi-parameter algorithms to retrieve soil moisture across a chronosequence (recently burned, shrubby regrowth and mature forest) of fire-disturbed Alaskan boreal black spruce forests using polarized backscatter intensity, polarimetric decomposition and discriminator parameters as independent variables. To account for complex interactions of surface roughness, biomass and soil moisture, multiple polarimetric variables were evaluated empirically in algorithm development using a time series dataset that included the wet and dry extreme conditions. Results indicate that polarimetric discriminators, such as maximum degree of polarization, fractional polarization or coefficient of variation, may be instrumental in accounting for the type of scattering occurring or the complexity or heterogeneity of the distributed target. Using the maximum degree of polarization combined with one or more variables on scattered intensity (e.g. C-HV, C-HH, or maximum scattering intensity) improved multi-linear moisture retrieval algorithms by 27-33% over the single, dual and quad polarized backscatter intensity algorithms. For all sites combined, algorithms were developed with low SE (7.0% volumetric soil moisture), moderately high R-2 (0.77) and low RMSE (6.7% volumetric soil moisture). However, the best models were produced by separating the recently burned forests (strongest algorithm: R-2 0.94, SE 5.9, RMSE 7.4) from the shrubby and mature forests (best algorithm: R-2 0.85, SE 4.7, RMSE 73). Results are limited to sites with biomass below 3 kg/m(2). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of spatial resolution on the estimation of land surface heat fluxes from remote sensing is poorly understood. In this study, the effects of aggregation from fine (<100 m) to medium (approx. 1 km) scales are investigated using high resolution Landsat 5 overpasses. A temporal sequence of satellite imagery and needed meteorological data were collected over an agricultural region, capturing distinct variations in crop stage and phenology. Here, we investigate both the impact of aggregating the input forcing and of aggregating the derived latent heat flux. In the input aggregation scenario, the resolution of the Landsat based radiance data was increased incrementally from 120 m to 960 m, with the land surface temperature calculated at each specific resolution. Reflectance based land surface parameters such as vegetation height and leaf area index were first calculated at the native 30 m Landsat resolution and then aggregated to multiple spatial scales. Using these data and associated meteorological forcing, surface heat fluxes were calculated at each distinct resolution using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. Results indicate that aggregation of input forcing using a simple averaging method has limited effect on the land surface temperature and available energy, but can reduce evapotranspiration estimates at the image scale by up to 15%, and at the pixel scale by up to 50%. It was determined that the predominant reason for the latent heat flux reduction in SEBS was a decrease in the aerodynamic resistance at coarser resolutions, which originates from a change in the roughness length parameters of the land surface due to the aggregation. In addition, the magnitude of errors in surface heat flux estimation due to input aggregation was observed to be a function of the heterogeneity of the land surface and evaporative elements. In examining the response of flux aggregation, fine resolution (120 m) heat fluxes were aggregated to coarser resolutions using a range of common spatial interpolation algorithms. Results illustrate that a simple averaging scheme provides the best choice for flux aggregation compared to other approaches such as nearest neighbour, bilinear interpolation or bicubic interpolation, as it not only preserves the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration, but most importantly also conserves the mass balance of evaporated water across pixel and image scales.

AB There has been a progressive emergence of airborne longwave spectral sensing capabilities (e.g. spatially enhanced broadband array spectrograph system, SEBASS) of potential value for remote geological mapping in arctic and subarctic regions. However the presence of rock encrusting lichens can obscure spectral features diagnostic of minerals. This paper documents the longwave (3-14 mu m) spectral transmittance and reflectance properties of rock encrusting lichens as determined from lichen samples, from rock samples encrusted with lichens and observations from airborne SEBASS imagery. The samples and SEBASS airborne hyperspectral imagery were acquired over the 1.9 Ga Cape Smith greenstone belt of northern Quebec.
   Within the Restrahlen region (8-12 mu m), where silicate minerals display peaks in reflectance, the maximum reflectance observed for rock encrusting lichens is 1.6%. These lichens display low reflectance and spectral contrast and approach a blackbody behavior. For lichens detached from the rock substrate, spectra obtained on two backgrounds of contrasting reflectance are similar (<0.75% difference in reflectance) indicating that lichens transmit little or no light.
   Detailed observations reveal three features that can be attributed to organic compounds in lichens (3.41, 6.58, 8.13 mu m). The feature located near 8.13 mu m is a reflectance peak within the Restrahlen region of enhanced mineral reflectance. A measure of the strength of this feature and the mean reflectance in the Restrahlen region for laboratory data and SEBASS imagery reveals linear mixing trajectories between a lichen endmember and a suite of geological endmembers. This data representation enables the visualization of mixing lines, the delineation of geologically informative endmembers, and provides a means to mask pixels in imagery that encompass the greatest abundance of rock encrusting lichens therefore facilitating geological mapping. The implications for the detection of geological endmembers and mapping are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The error matrix is the most common way of expressing the accuracy of remote sensing image classifications, such as land cover. However, it and the measures that can be calculated from it have been criticised for not providing any indication of the spatial distribution of errors. Other research has identified the need for methods to analyse the spatial non-stationarity of error and to visualise the spatial variation in classification uncertainty. This research uses geographically weighted approaches to model the spatial variations in the accuracy of both (crisp) Boolean and (soft) fuzzy land cover classes. Remotely sensed data were classified using a maximum likelihood classifier and a fuzzy classifier to predict Boolean and fuzzy land cover classes respectively. Field data were collected at sub-pixel locations and used to generate soft and crisp validation data. A Geographically Weighted Regression was used to analyse spatial variations in the relationships between observations of Boolean land cover in the field and land cover classified from remote sensing imagery. A geographically weighted difference measure was used to analyse spatial variations in fuzzy land cover accuracy. Maps of the spatial distribution of accuracy were created for fuzzy and Boolean classes. This research demonstrates that data collected as part of a standard remote sensing validation exercise can be used to estimate mapped, spatial distributions of accuracy that would augment standard accuracy measures reported in the error matrix. It suggests that geographically weighted approaches, and the spatially explicit representations of accuracy they support, offer the opportunity to report land cover accuracy in a more informative way.

AB A new fast mapping approach based on an optical model was developed and applied to hyperspectral airborne HySpex images of Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). The aims were (1) to discriminate diatom biofilms (from the Bacillariophyceae class) constituting microphytobenthos on any mudflat and (2) to estimate their biomass expressed in mg Chl a.m(-2) by remote sensing of poorly accessible mudflats.
   Due to the distinct absorption peaks of certain pigments of different microalgae classes constituting microphytobenthos, the high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images was employed in order to detect the pigment assemblage characterizing diatom biofilms. Thus, the HySpex 1600 VNIR camera was used both in the laboratory for estimating biomass under controlled conditions and in an airborne setting. 1) The mapping approach used known spectral indices (NDVI and MPBI) and new ones (I-Diatom and I-Euglenid) to characterize quickly the key pigments of two main microphytobenthos classes, for a fast selection of diatom and euglenid biofilms by two different masks. 2) The inherent spectral properties of biofilms in the 700-900 nm range were also used to calculate an original estimate of the substrate/environmental effects in each mask. 3) Biomass quantification of the diatom biofilms was finally performed by application of the microphytobenthos optical model (MPBOM).
   This approach was first tested on laboratory HySpex images of synthetic biofilms for which the in vitro biomass measurements by chromatography (HPLC) were available. The comparison between estimated and measured biomass values showed the reliability of the mapping approach for biomass estimation. Finally, a map of diatom biomass was obtained at the scale of the entire Bourgneuf Bay. The range of biomass variation (0-35 mg Chl a.m(-2)) was in close agreement with the biomass maps presented in previous studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping savanna tree species is of broad interest for savanna ecology and rural resource inventory. We investigated the utility of (i) the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) hyperspectral data, and WorldView-2 and Quickbird multispectral spectral data and (ii) a combined spectral + tree height dataset (derived from the CAO LiDAR system) for mapping seven common savanna tree species or genera in the Sabi Sands Reserve and communal lands adjacent to Kruger National Park, South Africa. We convolved the 72 spectral bands of the CAO imagery to eight and four multispectral channels available in the WorldView-2 and Quickbird satellite sensors, respectively. A combination of the simulated WorldView-2 data and LiDAR tree height imagery was also assessed for species classification. First, the simulated WorldView-2 imagery provided a higher classification accuracy (77% +/- 3.1 (mean +/- standard deviation)) when compared to the simulated Quickbird (65% +/- 1.9) and CAO (65% +/- 1.2) data. Secondly, the combined spectral + height dataset provided a slightly higher overall classification accuracy (79% +/- 1.8) when compared to the WorldView-2 spectral only dataset. The difference was however, statistically significant (p<0.001; one-way analysis of variance for 30 bootstrapped replicates (n = 100) of the independent validation dataset). Higher classification accuracies were observed for trees with large crowns such as S. birrea, S. africana and A. nigrescens as compared to trees with small crowns. Species composition and diversity maps of trees with large crowns were consistent with established knowledge in the area. For example, the results showed higher tree diversity (number of different species per ha) in the Sabi Sands game reserve than in the communal areas. This study highlights the feasibility of remote sensing of tree species at the landscape scale in African savannas and the potential applicability of WorldView-2 sensor in mapping savanna tree species with a large crown.

AB In this study we used Landsat images to analyze land cover change processes since 1984 in the middle Ebro valley (Spain). The purpose was to identify abrupt changes suggesting modification of the land cover category, and gradual changes not associated with a change in the land cover type but potentially indicative of significant changes in natural areas. The results showed that: i) in analysis of land cover change the seasonality of vegetation cover is an important factor that must be taken into account in identifying the various change processes that may affect a region; ii) the major land cover changes in the study area were related to very diverse processes including urban expansion, industrial activities, the establishment of land irrigation, land extensification, natural revegetation following rural abandonment, forest fires, and changes in natural vegetated areas related to global warming and drought. With the exception of the occurrence of forest fires, the changes in natural areas (forest, shrubs and steppes) tended to be gradual with respect to both positive (forest colonization following rural abandonment and land extensification) and negative (land degradation and forest decline) processes. These areas showed rates of change that were lower in magnitude than those directly transformed by human activities. We found that time series of high spatial resolution satellite images and the application of change statistics provided a useful approach to the identification of abrupt changes, and gradual land cover change processes that are not commonly revealed using classical analytical approaches.

AB The East China Sea (ECS) is well known for its high concentration of total suspended matter (TSM). Some regions of the ECS have concentrations higher than 5000 g m(-3). exceeding the valid ranges of many TSM remote sensing algorithms. To overcome the limitation of the existing algorithms, a new TSM model, the "complex proxy TSM model" (CPTSM), is developed in this study. The model is established on the basis of a complex proxy of remote sensing reflectance. The proxy is designed to convert the non-linear relationship between reflectance and TSM to a quasi-linear function over the entire range of TSM concentrations. This proxy is deduced from four indices defined by combinations of the reflectance at different bands. The four indices take advantage of the different relationships between the band combinations of the reflectance and total TSM concentrations. The band selections and model parameters are based on correlation coefficients and regression analysis between the indices and TSM. The results show that the correlation coefficient of 0.912 between the proxy and TSM is higher than that between any individual index and TSM. To validate the CPTSM model, TSM, turbidity, and reflectance data were collected in the ECS during 4 cruises in 2006 and 2007. The actual TSM concentration was measured by weighing the samples collected on filter papers. Turbidity was measured by a Seapoint Turbidity Meter. The turbidity data with values higher than 750 FTU were re-calibrated using an empirical equation. All turbidity values were converted to TSM concentrations using a linear equation. The in situ reflectance was measured using the above-water method at 459 stations and the in-water method at 146 stations. A total of 87 pairs of reflectance measured by both methods were used for inter-comparison with a relative difference of 4.5%. The reflectance values were used to retrieve TSM concentrations using the CPTSM model. A comparison with in situ measurements gave a mean relative error of 23%. Applying the CPTSM model to the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data and analyzing the errors from a match-up dataset of SeaWiFS and in situ data, we found that the average relative error was 24.5%. We propose to use the CPTSM model to map TSM concentrations from satellite data in the ECS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) quantifies the photosynthetic uptake of carbon by ecosystems and is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Empirical light use efficiency (LUE) models and process-based Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (FvCB) photosynthetic models are widely used for GPP estimation. In this paper, the MODIS GPP algorithm using the LUE approach and the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) based on the FvCB model in which a sunlit and shaded leaf separai:ion scheme is evaluated against GPP values derived from eddy-covariance (EC) measurements in a variety of ecosystems. Although the total GPP values simulated using these two models agree within 89% when they are averaged for the conterminous U.S., there are systematic differences between them in terms of their spatial and temporal distribution patterns. The spatial distribution of MODIS GPP therefore differs substantially from that produced by BEPS. These differences may be due to an inherent problem of the LUE modeling approach. When a constant maximum LUE value is used for a biome type, this simplification cannot properly handle the contribution of shaded leaves to the total canopy-level GPP. When GPP is modeled by BEPS as the sum of sunlit and shaded leaf GPP, the problem is minimized, i.e., at the low end, the relative contribution of shaded leaves to GPP is small and at the high end, the relative contribution of shaded leaves is large. Compared with monthly and annual GPP derived from eddy covariance data at 40 tower sites in North America, BEPS performed better than the MODIS GPP algorithm. The difference between MODIS and BEPS GPP widens as with the fraction of shaded leaves increases. The simpler LUE modeling approach should therefore be further improved to reduce this bias issue for effective estimation of regional and temporal GPP distributions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Several models have been fitted in the past to smooth time-series vegetation index data from different satellite sensors to estimate vegetation phenological parameters. However, differences between the models and fine tuning of model parameters lead to potential differences, uncertainty and bias between the results amongst users. The current research assessed four techniques: Fourier analysis, asymmetric Gaussian model, double logistic model and the Whittaker filter for smoothing multi-temporal satellite sensor observations with the ultimate purpose of deriving an appropriate annual vegetation growth cycle and estimating phenological parameters reliably. The research used Level 3 Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, spatial resolution similar to 4.6 km) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) data over the years 2004 to 2006 composited at eight day intervals covering the Indian sub-continent. First, the four models were fitted to representative sample time-series of the major vegetation types in India, and the quality of the fit was analysed. Second, the effect of noise on model fitting was analysed by adding Gaussian noise to a standard profile. Finally, the four models were fitted to the whole study area to characterise variation in the quality of model fitting as a function of single and double vegetation seasons. These smoothed data were used to estimate the onset of greenness (OG), a major phenological parameter. The models were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The first test (fitting to representative sample time series) revealed the consistently superior performance of the Whittaker and Fourier approaches in most cases. The second test (fitting after the addition of Gaussian noise) revealed the superior performance of the double logistic and Fourier approaches. Finally, when the approaches were applied to the whole study, thus, including vegetation with different phenological profiles and multiple growing seasons (third test), it was found that it was necessary to tune each of the models according to the number of annual growing seasons to produce reliable fits. The double logistic and asymmetric Gaussian models did not perform well for areas with more than one growing season per year. The mean absolute deviation in OG derived from these models was a maximum (3 to 4 weeks) within the dry deciduous vegetation type and minimum (1 week) in evergreen vegetation. All techniques yielded consistent results over the south-western and north-eastern regions of India characterised by tropical climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work is the qualitative remote characterization (API gravity degree) of oil seepages on the ocean surface. In order to achieve this goal, multispectral data acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) sensor are employed. ASTER registered tracts of oil along oceanic sectors of the Campos Basin (Brazil) and the Bay of Campeche (Gulf of Mexico) in several occasions. Numerous evidences indicate that these oil patches bear a straight link to oceanic seepages. The delimitation and segmentation of these seepages in the ASTER imagery are accomplished making use of an unsupervised, neural network fuzzy-clustering algorithm. Spectra representative of the seepages are extracted from atmospherically-corrected ASTER data pixels (9 bands spanning from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths) contained in the classified segments. The ASTER spectra are checked against a predictive (o)API partial least square regression model. This model is established on the basis of oil spectra of known (o)API varying from 13 to 47 yielded by laboratory measurements. Considering this model, API gravity degrees of 19.6+/-1.37 and 15.9+/-2.9 are remotely estimated for the seepage in the Campos Basin and the Bay of Campeche, respectively. Oils produced from Campos and Campeche fields typically show (o)API varying from 17-24 and 12-16.5. correspondingly. These results indicate the potential of the methodology proposed and of ASTER data and alike to remotely infer physical-chemical properties of hydrocarbons, since a close match was verified between predicted and true API gravity degrees for both study areas. The data, methods and experience gained in this research can be operationally tested in offshore oil exploration and, likewise, be adapted to environmental monitoring of oil spills in coastal regions.

AB In this paper we compare three different methodologies to retrieve land surface emissivity (LSE) over urban areas: the NDVI thresholds method, the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm and the temperature independent spectral indices (TISI) algorithm. The methodologies were applied to the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) imagery acquired during the Dual-use European Security IR Experiment 2008 (DESIREX 2008) experimental campaign over the city of Madrid (Spain). The images have a spatial resolution of 4 m. The retrieved values are compared to in situ data measured during the campaign at 4 sites. Results show a good performance of the TISI and the TES algorithms over urban surfaces, while the NDVI threshold method does not appear to be capable to distinguish between different artificial surfaces. The land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved with a split window algorithm, using the three different LSE products. Differences of up to 3 K were realized in some surfaces when different LSE maps were used. Over artificial urban surfaces TES and TISI showed better agreement with in-situ data than NDVI. Finally, the TES is the algorithm that best reproduces the LST over an urban area, without the requirement of high temporal resolution of the sensor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of snow and its response to changes in climate were investigated from 1979 to 2005 in eastern Tibet. The Lhasa River basin, Niyang River basin and Changdu region cover an area of approximately 15 x 10(4) km(2) and ranges in elevation from 2000 to more than 7000 m. This large area necessitates innovative procedures for estimating potential spatial and temporal changes in snow cover. For this analysis we used the microwave long-term snow cover dataset of China with a spatial resolution of 25 km and temporal resolution of 1 day. After data validation between the microwave dataset and MODIS snow product, we defined two parameters for each pixel: (1) median date of the snow-free period (T-m) and (2) duration of the snow-free period (Delta T). After removing transient-snow dominated areas, we find that the duration of the snow-free period was inversely correlated with elevation (R = -0.651, p<0.001). TFPW-MK Trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall) was then used to examine and highlight the trend of Delta T with time. At lower-elevation sites, the length of the snow-free season increased. In contrast, at higher-elevations, it decreased. Mann-Kendall tests on monthly air temperature and annual precipitation for the period 1979 to 2005 from seven climate stations in the region operated by the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System show a significant increase in annual precipitation and an increase in monthly air temperatures for the fall through spring months. Thus, the length of the snow covered season appears to be decreasing at lower elevation because of the increase in air temperatures. However, at higher elevations the increase in precipitation appears to compensate for the increase in air temperature such that the snow-free period has decreased. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

DE SST; Diurnal warming; SEVIRI
ID SURFACE TEMPERATURE; UPPER OCEAN; SATELLITE
AB Five years of sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals from a geostationary platform are utilised to identify and characterise diurnal warming in the North and Baltic Seas. Observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second Generation satellite are proven valuable for quantifying the daily SST cycle in shallow and coastal waters at latitudes 48-60 N. Satellite minus in situ observations from moored buoys show biases ranging from -0.3 K to 0.1 K. A thorough analysis is carried out to obtain the optimal reference field used for calculating the daytime temperature anomalies. The best night-time reference field candidate is demonstrated to be an average of 3 days of satellite observations from local midnight to 0300. When compared against night-time in situ measurements from various locations, mean biases are found in the order of +/- 0.1 K and standard deviation (sigma) between 0.4 K and 0.9 K. The 5 year record with daytime temperature anomalies is used to derive robust statistical description of duration, spatial extent, proximity to coast and water depth of the diurnal warming events. Seasonal and inter-annual variations in the diurnal warming are also quantified. Daytime anomalies exceeding 2 K are identified during the spring and summer months of every year, peaking at 1500 LT. Events with daily anomalies exceeding 5 K are observed. Areas where diurnal variability is often observed coincide with areas of frequently observed low winds and turbid waters (high K-d(490) values). (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is the European programme to establish a European capacity for Earth Observation. GMES is designed to provide European policy makers and public authorities with accurate and timely information to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite mission specifically designed for GMES to ensure the long-term collection and operational delivery of high-quality measurements to GMES ocean, land, and atmospheric services, while contributing to the GMES, emergency and security services. Key Sentinel-3 measurement requirements, corresponding to identified GMES user needs, have been derived as follows:
   Sea surface topography (SSH), significant wave height (Hs) and surface wind speed derived over the global ocean to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by ENVISAT Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) but with enhanced surface topography measurements in the coastal zone, sea ice regions and over inland rivers, their tributaries and lakes.
   Sea surface temperature (SST) determined for oceanic and coastal waters globally to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by the ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) over the ocean (i.e. <0.3 K), at a spatial resolution of 1 km.
   Visible, and Short-Wave Infrared radiances for oceanic, inland and coastal waters at a spatial resolution of 03 km (simultaneously and co-registered with SST measurements), determined to an equivalent level of accuracy and precision as ENVISAT Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer with complete ocean coverage in 2-3 days.
   Visible and infrared radiances over global land-surfaces in 1-2 days, sea-ice and ice-sheets equivalent to those currently provided from ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR and Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation.
   The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating:
   A dual frequency, Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, a Precise Orbit Determination package including a GPS receiver, a DORIS instrument and a laser retro-reflector.
   A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multi-channel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces.
   A dual-view Sea and land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature.
   A collaborative ground segment providing management of the mission, management, development, production and access to core data products in an operational near real time delivery context.
   The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having 7-year lifetime, over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-3A in late 2013 and of Sentinel-3B in late 2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180 degrees.
   This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-3 mission including the mission background and user requirements, a technical description of the space segment, a brief overview of the ground segment concept, and a summary description of Sentinel-3 data products and their anticipated performance.

AB The ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5 P) is a low Earth orbit polar satellite to provide information and services on air quality, climate and the ozone layer in the timeframe 2015-2022. The S-5 P mission is part of the Global Monitoring of the Environment and Security (GMES) Space Component Programme. The payload of the mission is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) that will measure key atmospheric constituents including ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, CH4, CH2O and aerosol properties. TROPOMI has heritage to both the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as well as to the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY). The S-5 P will extend the data records of these missions as well as be a preparatory mission for the Sentinel-5 mission planned for 2020 onward. The mission is pre-operational and is the link between the current scientific and the operational Sentinel-4/-5 missions.
   This contribution describes the science and mission objectives, the mission and the instrument, and the data products. While building on a solid foundation of the heritage instruments, the S-5P/TROPOMI mission is an exciting step forward with a strong focus on the troposphere. This is achieved by a combination of a high spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise, as well as dedicated data product development. It is anticipated that the S-5 P mission will make a large contribution to the monitoring of the global atmospheric composition, as well as to the scientific knowledge of relevant atmospheric processes.

AB This paper addresses several aspects related to ultraviolet (UV) measurements from art upcoming geostationary orbit (CEO) satellite mission. First, using simulated cloud coverage based on the MTSAT (Multi-functional Transport Satellite 1R) 650 nm channel as a proxy, we find that CEO observations can increase clear-sky coverage by similar to 4 times. Secondly, we examine the feasibility of improved ozone detection with CEO observations, using synthetic GEMS spectra with CEO geometries along with the TOMS total ozone algorithm and an ozone profile algorithm based on the optimal estimation method. The sensitivity of ozone retrievals to the lower troposphere is limited at large solar and satellite zenith angles, especially above 70 under clear-sky conditions. Third, we evaluate two new ideas for improving ozone retrieval sensitivity in the troposphere at large angle geometries: (1) a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination-angle of 30 degrees, with smaller values of viewing zenith angles than those from a geostationary orbit: (2) a combination of UV measurements at multiple solar zenith angles to improve the accuracy of ozone profile retrievals.

AB Due to the high temporal sampling rate of ASAR Global Monitoring (GM) mode, it has a high application potential for analyzing the land surface freeze/thaw process in high latitudes. This study aims to develop effective methods of extracting freeze/thaw transition dates of permafrost areas from ASAR GM data sets. In order to use ASAR GM time-series for analyzing freeze/thaw states, a least square fitting of piecewise step function is introduced. The thawing date can be determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between measured backscattering time-series and a pre-defined step function. An experimental result for a Siberian permafrost region illustrates that it can be a promising approach in monitoring permafrost ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The TREES-3 project of the Joint Research Centre aims at assessing tropical forest cover changes for the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 using a sample-based approach. This paper refers to the 1990-2000 assessment. Extracts of Landsat satellite imagery (20 km x 20 km) are analyzed for these reference dates for more than 4000 sample sites distributed systematically across the tropical belt. For the processing and analysis of such a large amount of satellite imagery a robust methodological approach for forest mapping and change detection has been developed. This approach comprises two automated steps of multi-date image segmentation and object-based land cover classification (based on a supervised spectral library), followed by an intense phase of visual control and expert refinement. Image segmentation is done at two spatial scales, introducing the concept of a minimum mapping unit via the automated selection of a site-specific scale parameter. The automated segmentation of land cover polygons and the pre-classification of land cover types mainly aim at avoiding manual delineation and at reducing the efforts of visual interpretation of land cover to a reasonable level, making the analysis of 4000 sample sites feasible. The importance of visual control and correction can be perceived when comparing to the initial automatic classification result: about 20% of the polygon labels were changed through expert knowledge by visual interpretation. The component of visual refinement of the mapping results had also a notable impact on forest area and change estimates: for a set of sample sites in Southeast Asia (similar to 90% of all sites of SE-Asia) the rate of change in tree cover (deforestation) was assessed at 0.9% and 1.6% before and after visual control, respectively.

AB Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data sets from TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR are compared for their ability to detect ground movement over the continuous permafrost site of Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada. All three sensors maintain good coherence within a summer season and can be used to create summer displacement products. Stacking is advantageous for the TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data sets, although mottling, possibly an interaction of the SAR with vegetation, or residual tropospheric noise, is visible, reducing the reliability of the results. RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR provide the most promising results with the ability to form one year interval interferograms. PALSAR can also form two and three year interval interferograms. Long interval data sets spanning 2007 to 2010 identify a band of movement of 20 to 30 cm/year along the north-east coast, and a region of movement of up to 5 cm/year near the northern tip of the island. The ability to form long interval displacement products holds the most promise for permafrost monitoring, since long-term trends are of greater interest for permafrost stability than short-term seasonal changes. TerraSAR-X data have the disadvantage that year to year interferograms cannot be formed. InSAR is not the ideal monitoring technique for the large thaw slumps of Herschel Island. Although general areas of instability can be identified, specific slump detection is limited by radar look direction, and the large and abrupt slump movement, often accompanied by disintegration and collapse of slump sections, causes loss of coherence in the InSAR data. Thaw slumps may require a different interferometric approach, such as slump extent mapping from coherence loss, or the installation of corner reflectors and point target techniques. The frequent revisit and high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X provide the best chance of maintaining coherence over thaw slumps. In general, InSAR is more successful at identifying broad areas of subtle subsidence in gentle relief, areas of terrain instability, possibly due to permafrost thaw or ground ice melt and the removal of water volume, and prior to significant slumping.

AB The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) has been widely studied across different vegetation types. However, these studies generally report values for only one point in time. We were interested in the potential for seasonal and inter-annual variation in BRDF parameters. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on board the EOS satellites has now been collecting data for 10 years. Since BRDF parameters are reported for the individual spectral bands, these data can be used to examine intra-annual variation. However, MODIS BRDF parameters are not calculated for the various vegetation indices which are derived from the spectral bands. Our objective in this study was to use the 10 years of MODIS data now available to examine seasonal and inter-annual variation in the view angle sensitivity of three vegetation indices; the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) at 3 flux tower sites (Harvard Forest, Howland Forest and Morgan Monroe State Forest). For these 3 sites, only EVI was significantly affected by view angle. There was also a substantial variation in the view angle sensitivity of EVI across seasons and this variation was different for backscatter vs. forward scatter data. It is possible that differences in the scattering of radiation between the spring and the fall are responsible for the seasonal difference in view angle sensitivity. There were also complimentary variations in forward and backscatter view angle sensitivity of EVI across years. The greater view angle sensitivity of EVI, as opposed to NDVI, suggests that greater care must be taken to correct for BRDF effects when using this vegetation index. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB In order to prioritize the measurement requirements and accuracies of the two new lidar missions, a physical model is required for a fundamental understanding of the impact of surface topography, footprint size and off-nadir pointing on vegetation lidar waveforms and vegetation height retrieval. In this study, we extended a well developed Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) vegetation lidar model to take into account for the impacts of surface topography and off-nadir pointing on vegetation lidar waveforms and vegetation height retrieval and applied this extended model to assess the aforementioned impacts on vegetation lidar waveforms and height retrieval.
   Model simulation shows that surface topography and off-nadir pointing angle stretch waveforms and the stretching effect magnifies with footprint size, slope and off-nadir pointing angle. For an off-nadir pointing laser penetrating vegetation over a slope terrain, the waveform is either stretched or compressed based on the relative angle. The stretching effect also results in a disappearing ground peak return when slope or off-nadir pointing angle is larger than the "critical slope angle", which is closely related to various vegetation structures and footprint size. Model simulation indicates that waveform shapes are affected by surface topography, off-nadir pointing angle and vegetation structure and it is difficult to remove topography effects from waveform extent based only on the shapes of waveform without knowing any surface topography information.
   Height error without correction of surface topography and off-nadir pointing angle is the smallest when the laser beams at the toward-slope direction and the largest from the opposite direction. Further simulation reveals within 20 degrees of slope and off-nadir pointing angle, given the canopy height as roughly 25 m and the footprint size as 25 m, the error for vegetation height (RH100) ranges from -2 m to greater than 12 m, and the error for the height at the medium energy return (RH50) from -1 m to 4 m. The RH100 error caused by unknown surface topography and without correction of off-nadir pointing effect can be explained by an analytical formula as a function of vegetation height, surface topography, off-nadir pointing angle and footprint size as a first order approximation. RHSO is not much affected by topography, off-nadir pointing and footprint size. This forward model simulation can provide scientific guidance on prioritizing future lidar mission measurement requirements and accuracies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Research suggests that secondary forest structure and composition subsequent to human disturbance could be related to wind or vertebrate dependent seed dispersal mechanisms. This paper examines the capability of a waveform LiDAR system (LVIS: LiDAR Vegetation Imaging System) to detect the location of wind-dispersed or vertebrate-dispersed forest patches in a mosaic of a secondary Tropical Dry Forest in the Santa Rosa National Park, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Canopy-height estimations derived from LVIS data were used to identify and locate two types of dispersal-dependent arrangements of canopy heights: flat-topped (windborne seed dispersed) or dome-shaped (vertebrate-dispersed) fragments. Following identification, a Ripley's K indicator was used to compare the locations for each confirmed canopy type to those reported in existing maps. Results indicated that dome-shaped patches tended to be arranged in clusters at the middle of former pastures (far from older forests), and that flat-topped patches tended to be located adjacent to older forests, forming extensions from the old growth patches and at the downwind side of the slope. Such characteristics agree with the theoretical observation of the spatial configuration of vertebrate- and wind-dispersed fragments reported in the study site. Our findings demonstrate that processes controlling forest regeneration in the TDF can be successfully identified through LiDAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Earth Observation (EO) sensors play an important role in quantifying biomass burning related fuel consumption and carbon emissions, and capturing their spatial and temporal dynamics. Typically, biomass burning emissions inventories are developed by exploiting either burned area (BA) or active fire (AF) measures of fire radiative energy (FRE). These approaches have both advantages and limitations. For example, methods based on burned area data typically require hard-to-obtain estimates of fuel load and combustion completeness, and the accuracy of the BA algorithm may deteriorate for small fires or those in densely forested terrain. Conversely, 'raw' FRE-based methods are typically low-biassed due to the non-detection of low intensity fires, and are also hindered by cloud cover. Here we develop a methodology integrating these two EO data types to deliver a high temporal resolution emissions inventory, maximising the benefit of each data type without requiring additional information. We focus on Africa, the most fire affected continent, and combine daily FRE observations provided by Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) with BA measures delivered by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). For individual fires detected by both types of data, we estimate fuel consumption per unit area (FCA: g.m(-2)) via the ratio of FRE-derived total fuel consumption (FCT) to BA. These values are then extrapolated to fires that were mapped using the BA data but which remained undetected in the SEVIRI AF product, thus correcting for the low spatial resolution bias' inherent in geostationary AF datasets. Calculated daily continental scale FCT for Africa varies between 0.3 and 20 Tg for the period February 2004-January 2005. We estimate annual continental FCT to be 1418 Tg, far closer to the 2272 Tg provided by the widely used Global Fire Emissions Database (version 3: GFEDv3) than is obtained when using 'raw' FRE data alone. This synergistic approach has substantially narrowed the gap between GFEDv3 and FRE-derived emissions inventories, whilst the geostationary FRP observations offer the advantage that the daily emissions estimates can be distributed more accurately over the diurnal fire cycle if required for linking to atmospheric transport models.

AB Recent retrievals of multiple satellite products for each component of the terrestrial water cycle provide an opportunity to estimate the water budget globally. In this study, we estimate the water budget from satellite remote sensing over ten global river basins for 2003-2006. We use several satellite and non-satellite precipitation (P) and evapo-transpiration (ET) products in this study. The satellite precipitation products are the GPCP, TRMM, CMORPH and PERSIANN. For ET, we use four products generated from three retrieval models (Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)) with data inputs from the Earth Observing System (EOS) or the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) products. GPCP precipitation and PM (ISCCP) ET have less bias and errors over most of the river basins. To estimate the total water budget from satellite data for each basin, we generate merged products for P and ET by combining the four P and four ET products using weighted values based on their errors with respect to non-satellite merged product. The water storage change component is taken from GRACE satellite data, which are used directly with a single pre-specified error value. In the absence of satellite retrievals of river discharge, we use in-situ gauge measurements. Closure of the water budget over the river basins from the combined satellite and in-situ discharge products is not achievable with errors of the order of 5-25% of mean annual precipitation. A constrained ensemble Kalman filter is used to close the water budget and provide a constrained best-estimate of the water budget. The non-closure error from each water budget component is estimated and it is found that the merged satellite precipitation product carries most of the non-closure error. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The RST approach (robust satellite technique) is a multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis already successfully used to monitor volcanoes at different geographic locations. In this work, the results of a long-term validation analysis of RST-based hot spot products are presented. This study was performed processing fourteen years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) records acquired over Mt. Etna area between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2008, at different overpass times (day/night), and analyzing hundreds of volcano bulletins reporting information on Mt. Etna eruptive activity, provided by visual observations and ground-based measurements. An optimized configuration of the RST approach, named RSTVOLC, is also, for the first time, presented and discussed here. This method, thanks to a better tradeoff between reliability and sensitivity, may be particularly suitable to support operational systems for volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.

AB Knowledge of the proportion of live and dead herbaceous fuel in grasslands is important in determining fire danger. This paper examines the Relative Greenness approach for quantifying these live and dead proportions. Relative Greenness places the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the context of a time series of measurements. The parameters used to describe the temporal distribution of NDVI and the time interval over which this distribution is assessed impact Relative Greenness and the inferred characteristics of the vegetation. In this paper, the Relative Greenness approach was investigated using different NDVI distribution parameters derived from eight-day composites of surface reflectance from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We assessed the accuracy of Relative Greenness for predicting the degree of curing (equivalent to the dead proportion of herbaceous fuel) measured at 25 grassland sites in Australia from 2005 to 2009. Results showed that Relative Greenness explained a greater proportion of the variance and provided a more accurate estimate of the degree of curing than linear regression against NDVI Relative Greenness was further improved using alternative parameters of the NDVI distribution and by selecting an appropriate time interval over which this distribution was assessed.

AB Canopy leaf area index (LAI), defined as the single-sided leaf area per unit ground area, is a quantitative measure of canopy foliar area. LAI is a controlling biophysical property of vegetation function, and quantifying LAI is thus vital for understanding energy, carbon and water fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. LAI is routinely available from Earth Observation (EO) instruments such as MODIS. However EO-derived estimates of LAI require validation before they are utilised by the ecosystem modelling community. Previous validation work on the MODIS collection 4 (c4) product suggested considerable error especially in forested biomes, and as a result significant modification of the MODIS LAI algorithm has been made for the most recent collection 5 (c5). As a result of these changes the current MODIS LAI product has not been widely validated. We present a validation of the MODIS c5 LAI product over a 121 km(2) area of mixed coniferous forest in Oregon, USA, based on detailed ground measurements which we have upscaled using high resolution EO data. Our analysis suggests that c5 shows a much more realistic temporal LAI dynamic over c4 values for the site we examined. We find improved spatial consistency between the MODIS c5 LAI product and upscaled in situ measurements. However results also suggest that the c5 LAI product underestimates the upper range of upscaled in situ LAI measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite-based estimates of the fire radiative power (FRP) and energy (FRE) emitted from open biomass burning are affected by the spatiotemporal resolution of polar-orbiting and geostationary sensors. Here the impacts of the MODIS sampling design on estimates of FRE are characterized by superimposing the timing and extents of the Terra and Aqua granules onto the SEVIRI active fire product. Results for different land-cover types across Africa indicate that the FRE measured by SEVIRI during eight days is linearly related to the sum of FRP measured by SEVIRI within the MODIS granules. These relationships are least variable during the height of the fire season when diurnal cycles of FRP measured by SEVIRI are most consistent. Relationships between FRE and the sum of FRP developed using the SEVIRI active fire product are directly applied to the sum of FRP retrieved from the MODIS Terra and Aqua Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) fire products. Estimates of FRE from MODIS herein agree within 5% of those obtained from previously published methods, but remain a factor of 0.72 times those obtained by adjusting SEVIRI measurements of FRE to account for low spatial resolution detection biases. An examination of the MODIS scan geometry suggests that the latter underestimation is attributed to the coupling between a MOWS imaging artefact referred to as the "bow-tie" effect and the typical calculation used to retrieve the sum of FRP from the MODIS CMG fire products. Depending on the availability of MODIS scan angle information, we offer rigorous and simplified calculations to account for the bow-tie effect. Applying the simplified adjustment to the MODIS CMG fire products yields national estimates of monthly FRE that are 1.44 times greater than originally predicted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is used as an indicator of leaf and plant canopy photosynthetic efficiency. However, the photosynthetic efficiency-PRI relationship has been shown to be inconsistent over time, likely due to changes in foliar pigment content.
   We measured reflectance spectra and biochemical properties from 24 leaves of two deciduous tree species and acquired pigment and reflectance data from the Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment database for an additional nine species. These data were used as inputs for the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. We found measurements of PRI to be significantly (p<0.05) correlated with chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio. However, only the PRI-carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio relationship was consistent across all analyses. Two predictive equations were derived from PROSPECT-5 simulations: a curvilinear PRI model (PRI(clm)) predicted the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (r(2) = 0.99), and a linear model using the chlorophyll index (CI(lm)) predicted chlorophyll content (r(2) = 0.98). Multiplying PRI(clm) with Cl (lm) canceled the influence of chlorophyll content on PRI(clm) and thus allowed for prediction of carotenoid content from 11 deciduous tree species (r(2) = 0.83). Our results confirm that the PRI is significantly influenced by chlorophyll and carotenoid pools and demonstrate a new approach for non-destructive estimation of leaf carotenoid content using the PRI. Because variation in foliar physiological status is known to relate to leaf carotenoid content and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio, convolving the PRI with a chlorophyll index is likely to be useful for understanding the photosynthetic performance of deciduous vegetation across a wide range of temporal periods, ranging from daily to seasonal time scales.

AB Fall foliage coloration is a phenomenon that occurs in many deciduous trees and shrubs worldwide. Measuring the phenology of fall foliage development is of great interest for climate change, the carbon cycle, ecology, and the tourist industry; but little effort has been devoted to monitoring the regional fall foliage status using remotely-sensed data. This study developed an innovative approach to monitoring fall foliage status by means of temporally-normalized brownness derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. Specifically, the time series of the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was smoothed and functionalized using a sigmoidal model to depict the continuous dynamics of vegetation growth. The modeled temporal NDVI trajectory during the senescent phase was further combined with the mixture modeling to deduce the temporally-normalized brownness index which was independent of the surface background, vegetation abundance, and species composition. This brownness index was quantitatively linked with the fraction of colored and fallen leaves in order to model the fall foliage coloration status. This algorithm was tested by monitoring the fall foliage coloration phase using MODIS data in northeastern North America from 2001 to 2004. The MODIS-derived timing of foliage coloration phases was compared with in-situ measurements, which showed an overall absolute mean difference of less than 5 days for all foliage coloration phases and about 3 days for near peak coloration and peak coloration. This suggested that the fall foliage coloration phase retrieved from the temporally-normalized brownness index was qualitatively realistic and repeatable. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An ongoing limitation of common regression-based infrared (IR) satellite sea surface temperature (SST) algorithms has been the lack of sufficient in situ skin temperature measurements for derivation of the algorithm coefficients. Since IR brightness temperatures respond to the skin temperature, use of the more numerous subsurface observations to tune the algorithms introduces uncertainty into the resulting SST products. Coincident in situ skin and subsurface SST measurements from three years of cruises are used to derive parallel skin and subsurface multichannel SST (MCSST)-type regression algorithms to determine the extent to which improved accuracy can be obtained using the skin measurements. Through use of only coincident measurements, the advantage offered by the greater volume of available subsurface observations is eliminated. Surprisingly, we find no accuracy improvement using skin SST algorithms relative to algorithms derived from the research-grade ship-borne subsurface temperature measurements used in our analysis. However, better accuracy was found relative to algorithms derived from subsurface observations whose accuracy was degraded to that of buoys. The results are robust with regard to satellite resolution, collocation criteria, geographical regions, and time of day.
   The accuracy differences are found to be generally consistent with the effects of: (1) increased measurement uncertainty of radiometric measurements relative to research-grade subsurface observations, and (2) differences in spatial variability between the skin SST and temperature-at-depth. The subsurface algorithms are regenerated after degrading the subsurface measurements by adding increasing levels of Gaussian white noise to determine the amplitude of the additional variability required to ensure equal accuracy between the skin and subsurface products. The required supplemental noise ranges between 0.10 and 0.17 K for all data combined and generally decreases with tighter collocation windows and higher-resolution satellite observations. Variogram analysis and filtering of the in situ measurements suggest that differences in measurement uncertainty between the infrared radiometers and the subsurface sensors can explain 0.07-0.10 K of the required noise, while differences in spatial variability with depth can account for up to 0.07-0.10 K of the residual noise. A key consequence is that spatial averages of the skin temperature over satellite footprints of 2 km or more, while potentially biased in the mean, may exhibit less variance relative to point samples of the subsurface temperature than to the actual radiometric skin temperature.

AB Remote detection of the Trichodesmium spp cyanobacteria blooms on the west Florida shelf (WFS) has been problematic due to optical complexity caused by sediment resuspension, coastal runoff, and bottom interference By combining MODIS data measured by the ocean bands and land bands, an approach was developed to identify surface mats of Trichodesmium on the WFS. The approach first identifies possible bloom patches in MODIS FAI (floating algae index) 250 m resolution imagery derived from the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 667, 859, and 1240 nm. Then, spectral analysis examines the unique reflectance characteristics of Trichodesmium at 469, 488, 531, 551, and 555 nm clue to specific optical properties (absorption, backscattering, and fluorescence) of the unusual pigments in Trichodesmium. These spectral characteristics (i.e., high-low-high-low-high reflectance at 469-488-531-551-555 nm, respectively) differentiate Trichodesmium mats unambiguously from other features observed in the FAI imagery, such as Sargassum spp. Tests in other coastal locations show that the approach is robust and applicable to other optically complex waters. Results shown here can help study Trichodesmium bloom dynamics (e.g., initiation and bloom formation) and may also help design future sensors to better detect and quantify Trichodesmium, an important N-2 fixer in the global oceans.

AB In this study we evaluated the potential of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) for monitoring gross primary productivity (GPP) across fifteen eddy covariance towers encompassing a wide variation in North American vegetation composition. The across-site relationship between MTCI and tower GPP was stronger than that between either the MODIS GPP or EVI and tower GPP, suggesting that data from the MERIS sensor can be used as a valid alternative to MODIS for estimating carbon fluxes. Correlations between tower GPP and both vegetation indices (EVI and MTCI) were similar only for deciduous vegetation, indicating that physiologically driven spectral indices, such as the MTCI, may also complement existing structurally-based indices in satellite-based carbon flux modeling efforts.

AB In the framework of ESA's SMOS mission (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), many studies have been carried out over different land surface types to model their microwave emission at L-band (1.4 GHz). Results of these studies have been integrated in the emission model L-MEB (L-Band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere), which is the core of the SMOS Level 2 soil moisture retrieval algorithm. The Mediterranean Ecosystem L-Band characterisation EXperiment (MELBEX-I) was carried out at the SMOS validation site near Valencia in autumn 2005. The main objective of MELBEX-I was to calibrate L-MEB over Mediterranean shrub land, as no data were available over this biome. For that purpose, multi-angular and dual polarimetric measurements (H, V) were obtained by the EMIRAD L-band radiometer from a 14-m tower. Results of this study indicate a small and constant impact of vegetation on the microwave emission of shrub land, and L-MEB parameters for shrub land were obtained. In addition, the study highlights the need for calibrating microwave soil roughness, which was found to be constant at the site. Depending on the number of retrieved parameters, soil moisture (SM) near the surface could be estimated with errors between 0.035 m(3) m(-3) (if only SM was retrieved) and 0.057 m(3) m(-3) (if SM, optical depth and a roughness parameter were simultaneously retrieved). Finally, no modelling improvements were observed when coarse estimates of the fraction of exposed rocks were accounted for in the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The correlative analysis of the ground-based measurement indicates that, (a) the correlation between AOT and the aerosol extinction coefficient at surface level (k(a,0)) is improved as a result of the vertical correction, with the coefficient of determination R-2 increasing from 0.35 to 0.56; (b) the correlation between k(a,0) and PM concentrations can be significantly improved by the RH correction with the R-2 increasing from 0.43 to 0.77 for PM10, and from 0.35 to 0.66 for PM2.5. Based on the in-situ measurements in Beijing, two linear correlative models between the ground-based AOT and PMs (e.g. PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations were developed. These models are used to estimate the regional distribution of PM10 and PM2.5 using the satellite-retrieved AOT in Beijing area. Validation against the in-situ measurements in Beijing shows that both of the correlations of the satellite-estimated PM10 and PM2.5 with the measurements are R-2 = 0.47, and the biases are 26.33% and 6.49% respectively. When averaged in the urban area of Beijing, the R-2 between the estimated PM 10 and the measurements increased to 0.66. These results suggest that by using the vertical-and-RH correcting method we can use the MODIS data to monitor the regional air pollution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since 1978, satellite passive microwave data have been used to derive hemispheric-scale snow cover maps. The seasonal and inter-annual variability of the microwave snow maps compares reasonably well with simultaneous maps of snow cover derived from satellite-based, visible-wavelength sensors. In general, the microwave-derived maps tend to underestimate snow extent during fall and early winter, due to a weak signal from shallow and intermittent snow cover. During the early snow season the microwave may underestimate by as much as 20%, decreasing to a few percent during mid-winter and spring. The Tibet Plateau is the only large geographic region where microwave retrievals tend to consistently overestimate snow-covered area compared to the visible data. This has been noted in limited case studies comparing visible and microwave snow data. The persistence of the microwave overestimate is also demonstrated in multi-year climatologies. Current microwave algorithms used to derive snow cover are based on ground or aircraft measurements that are later fine-tuned to match satellite retrievals. In this way, the algorithms have implicitly accounted for the presence of an atmosphere, because the surface or scene brightness values applied in the algorithms have actually passed through the atmosphere along their path to reach the satellite sensor. These methods are reasonably accurate when applied as a global algorithm to most snow-covered regions. However, a thinner atmosphere between the surface and satellite is likely the source of the consistent snow extent overestimate on the Tibet Plateau, where elevations range from 3200 to 5000 m. Wang and Manning (2003) have suggested that adjustments to ground or aircraft microwave measurements are needed to compare with satellite-based measurements. Based on their work, we propose a methodology to adjust satellite-based microwave brightness temperatures as a function of the observed surface elevation, thereby reducing the microwave snow cover overestimate on the Tibet Plateau. We include comparisons to snow maps derived from selected visible-wavelength products. We estimate that the adjusted microwave algorithm reduces the Tibet Plateau area of disagreement with the visible products by approximately 17% (468,000 km(2)) over the snow season.

AB Imaging Spectroscopy (IS) is a promising tool for studying soil properties in large spatial domains. Going from point to image spectrometry is not only a journey from micro to macro scales, but also a long stage where problems such as dealing with data having a low signal-to-noise level, contamination of the atmosphere, large data sets, the BRDF effect and more are often encountered. In this paper we provide an up-to-date overview of some of the case studies that have used IS technology for soil science applications. Besides a brief discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of IS for studying soils, the following cases are comprehensively discussed: soil degradation (salinity, erosion, and deposition), soil mapping and classification, soil genesis and formation, soil contamination, soil water content, and soil swelling. We review these case studies and suggest that the 15 data be provided to the end-users as real reflectance and not as raw data and with better signal-to-noise ratios than presently exist. This is because converting the raw data into reflectance is a complicated stage that requires experience, knowledge, and specific infrastructures not available to many users, whereas quantitative spectral models require good quality data. These limitations serve as a barrier that impedes potential end-users, inhibiting researchers from trying this technique for their needs. The paper ends with a general call to the soil science audience to extend the utilization of the IS technique, and it provides some ideas on how to propel this technology forward to enable its widespread adoption in order to achieve a breakthrough in the field of soil science and remote sensing.

AB National park units and protected areas face critical management challenges because of changing land-cover types and variability of landscape contexts within and adjacent the park boundaries. In this study we developed and implemented a multi-scale protocol for detecting and monitoring land-cover change in and adjacent to National Parks and ten segments of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail (AT) in the northeastern United States. We used Landsat imagery from 1970 to 2002 and recent ground-based photography to evaluate changes within park boundaries and within 0.5. 1, and 5 km buffers. The study concluded that all of the studied park units, except one segment of AT in Maine, experienced increases of urban land and declines of forest cover in the immediately adjacent areas and extended buffer zones. Over 30 years and across all parks and trail segments, urban land increased 172% and 181% within 0.5 and 1 km, respectively, of the park boundary or trail centerline. Over the same time period, forested area decreased by 5% and 6% within 0.5 and 1 km, respectively, of the park boundary or trail centerline, with more loss of forest near the parks (18%) than the trail segments (2%). This study provided baseline data demonstrating landcover alteration over the past three decades and a foundation for a land-cover change and landscape context protocol suitable for monitoring future changes of National Parks and protected areas.

AB This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project on soil carbon and phytomass dynamics of boreal and arctic permafrost landscapes. The 45 ha study area was a catchment located in the forest tundra in northern Siberia, approximately 100 km north of the Arctic Circle.
   The objective of this study was to estimate aboveground carbon (AGC) and assess and model its spatial variability. We combined multi-spectral high resolution remote sensing imagery and sample based field inventory data by means of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) technique and linear regression.
   Field data was collected by stratified systematic sampling in August 2006 with a total sample size of n=31 circular nested sample plots of 154 m(2) for trees and shrubs and 1 m(2) for ground vegetation. Destructive biomass samples were taken on a sub-sample for fresh weight and moisture content. Species-specific allometric biomass models were constructed to predict dry biomass from diameter at breast height (dbh) for trees and from elliptic projection areas for shrubs.
   Quickbird data (standard imagery product), acquired shortly before the field campaign and archived ASTER data (Level-1B product) of 2001 were geo-referenced, converted to calibrated radiances at sensor and used as carrier data. Spectral information of the pixels which were located in the inventory plots were extracted and analyzed as reference set Stepwise multiple linear regression was applied to identify suitable predictors from the set of variables of the original satellite bands, vegetation indices and texture metrics. To produce thematic carbon maps, carbon values were predicted for all pixels of the investigated satellite scenes. For this prediction, we compared the kNN distance-weighted classifier and multiple linear regression with respect to their predictions.
   The estimated mean value of aboveground carbon from stratified sampling in the field is 15.3 t/ha (standard error SE=1.50 t/ha, SE%=9.8%). Zonal prediction from the k-NN method for the Quickbird image as carrier is 14.7 t/ha with a root mean square error RMSE=6.42 t/ha, RMSEr=44%) resulting from leave-one-out cross-validation. The k-NN-approach allows mapping and analysis of the spatial variability of AGC. The results show high spatial variability with AGC predictions ranging from 4.3 t/ha to 28.8 t/ha, reflecting the highly heterogeneous conditions in those permafrost-influenced landscapes. The means and totals of linear regression and k-NN predictions revealed only small differences but some regional distinctions were recognized in the maps. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urban vegetation cover is a critical component in urban systems modeling and recent advances in remote sensing technologies can provide detailed estimates of vegetation characteristics. In the present study we classify urban vegetation characteristics, including species and condition, using an approach based on spectral unmixing and statistically developed decision trees. This technique involves modeling the location and separability of vegetation characteristics within the spectral mixing space derived from high spatial resolution Quickbird imagery for the City of Vancouver, Canada. Abundance images, field based land cover observations and shadow estimates derived from a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surface model are applied to develop decision tree classifications to extract several urban vegetation characteristics. Our results indicate that along the vegetation-dark mixing line, tree and vegetated ground cover classes can be accurately separated (80% and 94% of variance explained respectively) and more detailed vegetation characteristics including manicured and mixed grasses and deciduous and evergreen trees can be extracted as second order hierarchical categories with variance explained ranging between 67% and 100%. Our results also suggest that the leaf-off condition of deciduous trees produce pixels with higher dark fractions resulting from branches and soils dominating the reflectance values. This research has important implications for understanding fine scale biophysical and social processes within urban environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The performance improvements that can be achieved by classifier selection and by integrating terrain attributes into land cover classification are investigated in the context of rock glacier detection. While exposed glacier ice can easily be mapped from multispectral remote-sensing data, the detection of rock glaciers and debris-covered glaciers is a challenge for multispectral remote sensing. Motivated by the successful use of digital terrain analysis in rock glacier distribution models, the predictive performance of a combination of terrain attributes derived from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) digital elevation models and Landsat ETM+ data for detecting rock glaciers in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado, USA, is assessed. Eleven statistical and machine-learning techniques are compared in a benchmarking exercise, including logistic regression, generalized additive models (GAM), linear discriminant techniques, the support vector machine, and bootstrap-aggregated tree-based classifiers such as random forests. Penalized linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) yields mapping results that are significantly better than all other classifiers, achieving a median false-positive rate (mFPR, estimated by cross-validation) of 8.2% at a sensitivity of 70%, i.e. when 70% of all true rock glacier points are detected. The GAM and standard linear discriminant analysis were second best (mFPR: 8.8%), followed by polyclass. For comparison, the predictive performance of the best three techniques is also evaluated using (1) only terrain attributes as predictors (mFPR: 13.1-14.5% for best three techniques), and (2), only Landsat ETM+ data (mFPR: 19.4-22.7%), yielding significantly higher mFPR estimates at a 70% sensitivity. The mFPR of the worst three classifiers was by about one-quarter higher compared to the best three classifiers, and the combination of terrain attributes and multispectral data reduced the mFPR by more than one-half compared to remote sensing only. These results highlight the importance of combining remote-sensing and terrain data for mapping rock glaciers and other debris-covered ice and choosing the optimal classifier based on unbiased error estimators. The proposed benchmarking methodology is more generally suitable for comparing the utility of remote-sensing algorithms and sensors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite-derived NDVI time series are fundamental to the remote sensing of vegetation phenology, but their application is hindered by prevalent noise resulting chiefly from varying atmospheric conditions and sunsensor-surface viewing geometries. A model-based empirical comparison of six selected NDVI time series noise-reduction techniques revealed the general superiority of the double logistic and asymmetric Gaussian function-fitting methods over four alternative filtering techniques. However, further analysis demonstrated the strong influence of noise level, strength, and bias, and the extraction of phenological variables on technique performance. Users are strongly cautioned to consider both their ultimate objectives and the nature of the noise present in an NDVI data set when selecting an approach to noise reduction, particularly when deriving phenological variables.

AB We present a dryland irrigation mapping methodology that relies on remotely sensed inputs from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, globally extensive ancillary Sources Of gridded climate and agricultural data and on an advanced image classification algorithm. The methodology involves four steps. First, we use climate-based indices Of surface Moisture status and a map of cultivated areas to generate a potential irrigation index. Next, we identify remotely-sensed temporal and spectral signatures that are associated with presence of irrigation defined as full or partial artificial application of water to agricultural areas under dryland conditions excluding irrigated pastures, paddy rice fields, and other semiaquatic crops. Here, the temporal indices are based on the difference in annual evolution of greenness between irrigated and non-irrigated crops, while spectral indices are based on the reflectance in the green and are sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll content associated with moisture stress. Third, we combine the climate-based potential irrigation index, remotely sensed indices, and learning samples within a decision free supervised classification tool to make a binary irrigated/non-irrigated map. Finally, we apply a tree-based regression algorithm to derive the fraction of irrigated area within each pixel that has been identified as irrigated. Application of the proposed procedure over the continental US in the year 2001 produces an objective and comprehensive map that exhibits expected patterns: there is a strong east-west divide where the majority of irrigated areas is concentrated in the and west along dry lowland valleys. Qualitative assessment of the map across different climatic and agricultural zones reveals a high quality product with sufficient detail when compared to existing large area irrigation databases. Accuracy assessment indicates that the map is highly accurate in the western US but less accurate in the east. Comparison of area estimates made with the new procedure to those reported at the state and County levels shows a strong correlation with a small bias and an estimated RMSE of 2500 km(2), or little over 2% of the total irrigated area in the US. As a result, the future application of the new procedure at a global scale is promising but may require a better potential irrigation index, as well as the use of remotely sensed skin temperature measurements.

AB A protocol is developed for calculation of phytoplankton production from remotely-sensed data in the operational mode. The key element is an objective assignment, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, of the parameters required to implement a primary production model (parameters of the photosynthesis-response function and of the vertical distribution of pigment biomass). In a regional context, the assignment is made by searching the archived data on these parameters according to the (remotely-sensed) chlorophyll concentration and surface temperature. We refer to this approach as the Nearest-Neighbour Method. The procedure is justified on the basis of the known variation of bio-optical properties of phytoplankton with chlorophyll and temperature as well as through consideration of the seasonal variation of watercolumn stratification and its effect on the vertical pigment profile. We illustrate the method, and its justification, using data from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Using data from an oceanographic expedition not included in the archive, we find that the parameters estimated in this way are not significantly different from those obtained by direct measurement. We estimate the error associated with parameter assignment on the calculated phytoplankton production to be about 27%. Some potential limitations of the method are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The increase of nutrient loads such as nitrogen and phosphorus to a river due to land cover changes in surrounding areas has been one of the major sources of water pollution or eutrophication. Monitoring the influent nutrient load from river basins to rivers is now crucial in the management of river basin environments. The monitoring is not easy, however, because it requires spatial and temporal measurement tools for land cover changes in the river basin and water qualities, and also it requires models relating them. In this study, we first analyzed the relation between the land cover types estimated from monthly maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery calculated from NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery and the annual total nitrogen load discharged from river basins. We found that the runoff load factor from urban areas is higher than those of forested areas. We also found that the impacts of land cover such as plantation and field weed communities on the total nitrogen load of each river are higher than the impacts of other land cover types such as Beech and Camellia japonica community type.
   Finally, we produced two advanced maps of the potential annual total nitrogen load (PTNL) index and the potential annual total nitrogen load for each river basin area (PTNL/area) index by considering the relationship between the land cover types and the annual total nitrogen load discharged from river basins in Japan. The PTNL map will be useful for the risk assessment of total nitrogen load impact on lakes and the sea through rivers from each basin. The PTNL/area index, which considers the effects of river basin areas, will allow evaluation of the state of river basins. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Phytoplankton are the base of the ecosystem food chain for many higher trophic organisms, so identifying phytoplankton biomass distribution is the first step in understanding the dynamic environment for effective management of the GMR. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and hyperspectral surface acquisition system derived chlorophyll, in-situ chlorophyll fluorescence, nitrate, salinity, and temperature were collected from March 2005 to the onset of a mild El Nino in November 2006. Islands in the eastern GMR, such as San Cristobal and Espanola, are the first to experience impacts of El Nino and southern migration of the Equatorial Front. Productive habitats were defined as surface waters with salinities > 34, temperatures < 24 degrees C, and chlorophyll a > 0.4 mg m(-3). Six temporally variable productive habitats identified were: west of Isabela Island, southwest of Floreana Island, south of Santa Cruz, between Santiago and Santa Cruz Islands, and on the eastern side near San Cristobal Island. Model results coupled with surface acquisition system derived chlorophyll indicated productive habitats may also occur for short periods and at a distance from islands such as when the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and South Equatorial Current (SEC) collide over the seamounts north of Isabela Island. All productive habitats were related to topographic upwelling from the EUC into surface waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite imagery can be used to identify suitable habitat for mosquitoes in areas inaccessible or lacking sufficient ground-based information about the environment but current applications are limited by the spatial and spectral resolution of the sensors. Here, models used to compare prediction of the presence of Anopheles punctipennis larvae in Connecticut wetlands were built using stepwise logistic regression and compared by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Vegetation indices were extracted from three satellite sensor scenes (Hyperion, ASTER and Landsat-TM) at three scales (pixel, wetland perimeter, and wetland area). The best models were developed using ASTER (ROC=0.80, p=0.01, AIC 65.37) and Hyperion (ROC=0.81,p<0.01, AIC 66.40) at the wetland area level. The Disease Water Stress Index (DWSI), a measure of leaf water content, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significant in many of the models. This comparison of satellite based models demonstrates higher spatial and spectral resolution of ASTER and Hyperion resulted in more parsimonious models than Landsat-TM models. The need for continued research and development into sensors with increased spatial and spectral resolution and the development of mosquito specific indices is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest information over a landscape is often represented as a spatial mosaic of polygons, separated by differences in species composition, height, age, crown closure, productivity, and other variables. These polygons are commonly delineated on medium-scale photography (e.g., 1: 15,000) by a photo-interpreter familiar with the inventory area, and displayed and stored in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer as a forest cover map. Forest cover maps are used for multiple purposes including timber and habitat supply analyses, and carbon inventories, at a regional or management unit level, and for parks planning, operational planning, and selection of stands for many purposes at a local level. Attribute data for each polygon commonly include the variables used to delineate the polygon, and other variables that can be measured or estimated using these medium-scale photographs. Additional measures that can only be obtained via expensive ground measures or possibly on high resolution photographs (e.g., volume per unit area, biomass components per unit area, tree-list of species and diameters) are available only for a sample of polygons, or may have been gathered independently using a sample survey over the land area. Improved linkages over a variety of data sources may help to support landscape level analyses. This study presents an approach to combine information from a systematic (grid) ground survey, forest cover (polygon) data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery using variable-space nearest neighbor methods to 3 estimate (i) mean ground-measured attributes for each polygon, in particular, volume per ha (M-3/ha), stems per ha, and quadratic mean diameter for each polygon; and (ii) variation of these ground attributes within polygons. The approach was initially evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations with known measures of these attributes. Nearest neighbor methods were then applied to an approximate 5000 ha area (about 1000 polygons) of high productivity, mountainous forests located near the Pacific Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Based on the simulation results, the use of Landsat pixel reflectances to estimate volume per ha, average tree size (i.e., quadratic mean diameter), and stems per ha did not show great promise in improving estimates for each polygon over using forest cover data alone. However, in application, the use of remotely sensed data provided estimates of within-polygon variability. At the same time, the estimated means of these three imputed variables over the entire study area were very similar to the representative sample estimates using the ground data only. Extensions to other variables such as ranges of diameters and numbers of snags may also be possible providing useful data for habitat and forest growth analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Model-data fusion offers considerable promise in remote sensing for improved state and parameter estimation particularly when applied to multi-sensor image products. This paper demonstrates the application of a 'multiple constraints' model-data fusion (MCMDF) scheme to integrating AMSR-E soil moisture content (SMC) and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data products with a coupled biophysical model of surface moisture and energy budgets for savannas of northern Australia. The focus in this paper is on the methods, difficulties and error sources encountered in developing an MCMDF scheme and enhancements for future schemes. An important aspect of the MCMDF approach emphasized here is the identification of inconsistencies between model and data, and among data sets.
   The MCMDF scheme was able to identify that an inconsistency existed between AMSR-E SMC and LST data when combined with the coupled SEB-MRT model. For the example presented, an optimal fit to both remote sensing data sets together resulted in an 84% increase in predicted SMC and 0.06% increase for LST relative to the fit to each data set separately. Thai: is the model predicted on average cooler LST's (similar to 1.7 K) and wetter SMC values (similar to 0.04 g cm(-3)) than the satellite image products. In this instance we found that the AMSR-E SMC data on their own were poor constraints on the model. Incorporating LST data via the MCMDF scheme ameliorated deficiencies in the SMC data and resulted in enhanced characterization of the land surface soil moisture and energy balance based on comparison with the MODIS evapotranspiration (ET) product of Mu et al. [Mu, Q., Heinsch, F.A, Zhao, M. and Running, S.W. (in press), Development of a global evapotranspiration algorithm based on MODIS and global meteorology data, Remote Sensing of Environment.]. Canopy conductance, gc, and latent heat flux, lambda E, from the MODI S ET product were in good agreement with RMSEs for g(C)=0.5 mm s(-1) and for lambda E=18 W m(-2), respectively. Differences were attributable to a greater canopy-to-air vapor pressure gradient in the MCMDF approach obtained from a more realistic partitioning of soil surface and canopy temperatures.

AB An improved algorithm is developed based on support vector regression (SVR) to estimate horizonal water vapor transport integrated through the depth of the atmosphere (Theta) over the global ocean from observations of surface wind-stress vector by QuikSCAT, cloud drift wind vector derived from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and geostationary satellites, and precipitable water from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). The statistical relation is established between the input parameters (the surface wind stress, the 850 mb wind, the precipitable water, time and location) and the target data (Theta calculated from rawinsondes and reanalysis of numerical weather prediction model). The results are validated with independent daily rawinsonde observations, monthly mean reanalysis data, and through regional water balance. This study clearly demonstrates the improvement of Theta derived from satellite data using SVR over previous data sets based on linear regression and neural network. The SVR methodology reduces both mean bias and standard deviation compared with rawinsonde observations. It agrees better with observations from synoptic to seasonal time scales, and compare more favorably with the reanalysis data on seasonal variations. Only the SVR result can achieve the water balance over South America. The rationale of the advantage by SVR method and the impact of adding the upper level wind will also be discussed.

AB This paper presents a new technique for mapping regional salt sources that has major implications for salinity management in southeastern Australia. This was achieved by analyzing a regional mosaic of airborne gamma-ray emission derivatives and verified by existing airborne electromagnetic and drilling data. A significant correlation was found between aeolian (windblown) materials, upland salts and gamma-ray signatures. This is consistent with the conceptual model that much of the salt in the upland areas of the Murray-Darling Basin is sourced from deposited aeolian materials that have been derived from deflationary events in salt-bearing landscapes in the western and part of the basin. From gamma-ray emissions, and based on an observed relationship with borehole salinity, concentrated aeolian salt source deposits contained about 0.7% potassium and 10 ppm thorium. Using this signature on normalized data, an Euclidean distance algorithm provided mapping and information relating to salt-mobility pathways over a wide region. The resulting gamma-ray salt source model (GSM) facilitates focussed management of salinity infiltration zones in catchments across the basin. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a method for evaluating land surface temperature (LST) algorithms over heterogeneous areas is presented. The evaluation was made for a set of 12 algorithms derived by using the split-window (SW) and dual-angle (DA) techniques for estimating sea and land surface temperature (SST and LST) from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data. A validation of the proposed algorithms was carried out over a heterogeneous region of Morocco in the framework of the WATERMED (WATer use Efficiency in natural vegetation and agricultural areas by Remote sensing in the MEDiterranean basin) project. AATSR data and in situ measurements over this heterogenous region were compared by implementing a classification based strategy over a higher spatial resolution Landsat image. Three reference classes were considered when performing the classification from the Landsat image. Ground based measurements where then used to assign an effective surface radiometric temperature to each of these three classes. Finally, an averaging procedure based on class proportion was implemented for deriving surface radiometric temperature at the AATSR pixel scale. For this heterogeneous site, the results showed that LST can be obtained with a root mean-square error (RMSE) lower than 1.7 K from the split-window algorithms. Dual-angle algorithms, on the other hand, provided greater RMSE due to the different surfaces observed in the nadir and forward views. The results suggest that to retrieve LST from 1 km pixels over heterogeneous surfaces spatial averaging is required to improve accuracy on temperature estimation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Knowledge of sea ice thickness is critical for the prediction of future climate, and for assessing the significance of changes in thickness. Sea ice thickness can be calculated from radar or laser satellite altimetry measurements of freeboard. However, a lack of knowledge of snow depth introduces significant uncertainties into these calculations.
   This paper compares the first coincident airborne laser and radar altimetry data over sea ice, collected during the Laser Radar Altimetry (LaRA) field campaign. LaRA was a flight of opportunity that provided valuable data to explore techniques to validate satellite measurements of ice freeboard, and the possibility of combining laser and radar measurements over snow covered sea ice to calculate the snow depth. Two new methods were created to analyse these data sets: a new radar retracker and a radar power simulator, which models radar returns from the laser data.
   We present the first quantitative analysis of data from the LaRA laser and radar altimeters, and demonstrate the potential of combining laser and radar altimetry to estimate snow depth. LaRA elevation estimates compare well with elevations from the radar altimeter onboard ERS-2 at the sub-meter level and the study provides lessons for future validation of satellite altimetry data over sea ice. Laser elevations are consistently higher than the radar elevations over snow covered sea ice. As LaRA was a flight of opportunity, no coincident in-situ measurements were available. Nevertheless, the difference between the reflecting surface of the laser and radar is consistent with snow depth from climatology and the analysis techniques developed in this paper will be useful for future radar and laser altimetry comparisons.

AB In this study we examine the critical linkages between thermophysical properties and microwave emissions of landfast snow-covered first-year sea ice during spring melt. For this we analyzed the temporal evolution of radiation fluxes, electro-thermophysical properties and microwave emissions, and perform model simulations to evaluate the observations. The results show five major microwave signature events: brine-rich, blowing snow, melt onset, the onset of funicular regime, and freezing. A brine-rich snow basal layer can considerably increase the snow wetness in the upper and mid layers, resulting in a significant increase in complex permittivity that in turn increases in polarization difference (delta p) at 19 and 37 GHz. A dense (similar to 0.40 g cm(-3)) wind-packed snow surface layer, during a blowing snow event, was found to increase the permittivity (i.e., surface reflectivity) that in turn increases delta p in microwave emissions. Melt onset caused by sustained warming (above -5 degrees C) corresponded to increased delta p of similar to 9 K at 19 GHz. The most dramatic increase in delta p (up to 17 K at 19 GHz) coincided with the occurrence of a rainstorm. During a freezing, melt-freeze events enlarged snow grains and led to formation of ice lenses and layers within the snow, thereby significantly decreasing microwave emissions. We found that these five factors state above were critical to the melt indicators (i.e., Delta T-B(H) (T-B(19H)-T-B(37H)) and XPGR ([T-B(19H)-T-B(37V)]/[T-B(19H)+T-B(37V)])) commonly used in the satellite melt detection algorithms. The results suggests that the absolute value of TB(19H) (brightness temperature of horizontal polarization at 19 GHz) would be a good indicator along with Delta T-B(H) (or XPGR) to delineate the melt onset from ambiguous factors (i.e., a brine-rich slush layer or wind-packed layer), and that the funicular stage of snow melt on sea ice could be unambiguously detected by either Delta T-B(H) or XPGR.

AB The parameterization of sea ice albedo during summer, when fluctuations in the fractional coverage of melt ponds change on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, represents a significant challenge for both the modelling and remote sensing communities. Ubiquitous cloud cover in summer inhibits the use of optical sensors for providing large-scale estimates of sea ice surface albedo. C-band (5.3 GHz) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from ENVISAT-ASAR is compared to coincident surface climatological albedo (alpha) estimates derived from high-resolution Quickbird VIS-NIR imagery in order to demonstrate the utility of high-resolution, dual-polarized (VV, HH) SAR for detecting variations in alpha of melt pond covered landfast first-year sea ice (FYI) adjacent to Hudson Bay. Variations in ice alpha are detected from SAR imagery using the co-polarization ratio (gamma), shown to be significantly correlated (- 0.81) with alpha when melt ponds are in liquid form. Results show the use of gamma represents a substantial increase in correlation to alpha when compared to conventional like-polarized SAR backscattering coefficients. A regression model demonstrates that gamma can be used as an estimator for landfast-FYI alpha to within +/- 5.2% provided: (1) The SAR images at a shallow enough incidence angle to induce separation between like-polarized channels; and (2) the conditions of Bragg surface scattering, characteristic of relatively shallow FYI melt ponds, is met.

AB During its lifetime, a space-borne ocean color sensor provides world-wide information about important biogeochemical properties of the upper ocean every 2 to 4 days in cloudless regions. Merging simultaneous or complementary data from such sensors to obtain better spatial and temporal coverage is a recurring objective, but it can only be reached if the consistency of the sensor-specific products, as delivered by the various Space Agencies, has first been carefully examined. The goal of the present study is to provide a procedure for establishing a coherency of open ocean (Case-1 waters) data products, for which the various data processing methods are sufficiently similar. The development of the procedure includes a detailed comparison of the marine algorithms used (after atmospheric corrections) by space agencies for the production of standard products, such as the chlorophyll concentration, [Ch1], and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d. The MODIS-Aqua, SeaWiFS and MERIS [Ch1] products agree over a wide range, between similar to 0.1 and 3 mg m(-3), whereas increasing divergences occur for oligotrophic waters ([Ch1] (from 0.02 to 0.09 mg m(-3)). For the K-d(490) coefficient, different algorithms are in use, with differing results. Based on a semi-analytical reflectance model and hyperspectral approach, the present work proposes a harmonization of the algorithms allowing the products of the various sensors to be comparable, and ultimately, meaningfully merged (the merging procedures themselves are not examined). Additional potential products, obtained by using [Ch1] as an intermediate tool, are also examined and proposed. These products include the thickness of the layer heated by the sun, the depth of the euphotic zone, and the Secchi disk depth. The physical limitations in the predictive skill of such downward extrapolations, made from information concerning only the upper layer, are stressed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed and tested a method for mapping above-ground forest biomass of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands in northern boreal forests of eastern Canada. The method uses QuickBird images and applies image processing algorithms to extract tree shadow fraction (SF) as a predictive variable for estimating biomass. Three QuickBird images acquired over three test sites and 108 ground sample plots (GSP) were used to develop and test the method. SF was calculated from the fraction of tree shadow area over the area of a reference square overlaid on the images. Linear regressions between biomass of GSP and SF from the images for each test site resulted in R-2 in the range from 0.85 to 0.87 (except one case at 0.41), RMSE of 11 to 18 t/ha and bias of 2 to 5 t/ha. Statistical tests demonstrated that local regressions for the three test sites were not statistically significantly different. Consequently, a global regression was calculated with all GSP and produced R-2, RMSE, and bias of 0.84, 14.2 t/ha and 4.2 t/ha, respectively. While generalization of these results to extended areas of the boreal forest would require further assessment, the SF method provided an efficient means for mapping biomass of black spruce stands for three test areas that are characteristic of the northern boreal forest of eastern Canada (boreal and taiga shield ecozones).

AB The aim of this study is to generate a quality-controlled sub-kilometer dataset of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) across Scandinavia from satellite. FAPAR is required for estimating the amount of PAR absorbed (APAR) by vegetation, which in turn allows for estimation of carbon uptake. In this study, FA-PAR was modeled from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which was obtained from the MODIS VI product(MOD13Q1) at 250 m spatial resolution. Modeled FAPAR was evaluated against in-situ measurements of fractional interception of PAR (FIPAR) and FAPAR at nine plots in six forested sites across Sweden and Denmark from 2001 to 2005. High resolution remote sensing data were used to investigate the representativeness of the measurement areas. Furthermore, FAPAR from the MODIS LAI/FPAR product at 1 km spatial resolution (MOD 15A2) was investigated and compared the measured and modeled FAPAR. There was good agreement between modeled and measured FAPAR (6.9% average RMSE of the means). A linear relationship between daily values of NDVI and FAPAR was found (R-2=0.82), and it is concluded that seasonally adjusted NDVI can be used for accurate FAPAR estimations over forested areas in Scandinavia. However, it was found that the error was correlated with average FAPAR and that it is important to take the understory vegetation into account when measuring FAPAR in open canopies. The observed difference between FIPAR and FAPAR was 2.3 and 1.4 percentage units for coniferous and deciduous stands, respectively. MODIS FAPAR performed well although a few unrealistic values were present, highlighting the necessity to filter out low quality values using the quality-control datasets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB There is a critical need for spatially and temporally extensive information on the trophic status of lakes to assist in scientifically sound forest management decisions. To meet this need, this study examined the utility of Landsat TM imagery in deriving indicators of trophic status in remote and relatively undisturbed lakes on the Boreal Plain of northern Alberta. Based on data collected during a survey of lakes in 2001, normalized exoatinospheric reflectance values of the red band explained 68, 82, and 47% of the variance in chlorophyll a, turbidity, and Secchi disk depth, respectively. To understand the natural variation in trophic status in the lakes, we applied the linear regression equations to images collected during late summer (i.e., August) for 18 out of 20 years from 1984 to 2003 and performed a two-way analysis of variance to decompose the total variation into space, time, and space x time interaction factors. We found that temporal factors accounted for 10% and spatial factors accounted for 50% of the total variation in trophic status, with a minimum of 10 years and 20 lakes needed to reach stability in the contributions of these factors. This study suggests that regional factors that are external to the lake explained the majority (60%) of the variation in trophic status of the lakes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Imaging spectrometers operating in the solar spectrum measure the upwelling reflected solar radiation, and are an important tool in the bio/geochemical characterization of the Earth system. Surface reflectance is usually the starting point for the retrieval of biophysical parameters from remote measurements. Reliable radiometric and spectral calibrations and accurate atmospheric correction are mandatory in the interpretation of the surface reflectance. A complete surface reflectance retrieval scheme specifically designed for ultra-fine spectral resolution (bandwidth from 10 to 2 nm) and spatial resolution (pixel size less than 10 m) imaging spectrometers is presented in this work. The assessment of the spectral calibration is coupled to the removal of the atmospheric distortion so that maps of surface reflectance are derived, as well as columnar water vapor (CWV) maps, estimations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and updated sensor gain coefficients and spectral calibration. Radiative transfer calculations are performed by an optimized version of the MODTRAN4 code, which is run before processing each image. The method is tested against Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) 1500 images acquired during the ESA SENtinel-2 and FLuorescence EXperiment (SEN2FLEX) campaigns held in the Barrax (La Mancha, Spain) study site during June and July 2005. A peak-to-peak spectral shift variation of up to 2.3 nm is detected in CASI. Concerning atmospheric products and surface reflectance retrievals, an extensive validation is performed using ground-based measurements. A good correlation between ground measurements and CASI-derived AOT and C W is found, with a Pearson correlation coefficient r(2) up to 0.71 and 0.74, respectively. The subsequent surface reflectance retrievals also hold a good correspondence with ground-based measurements. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Seven years of data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) were used to characterize the average diurnal fire cycle in 15 regions of the tropics and sub-tropics. Bias errors in the resulting diurnal cycles were either avoided or removed through a combination of judicious region selection and the application of corrections to compensate for cloud obscuration and time-dependent "blind spots" in the fire-detection capability of the VIRS sensor. Supplementary data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA's Terra satellite aided this process. In all regions, the local time of peak burning fell between 13:00 and 18:30, with fire activity peaking distinctly earlier for the heavily forested regions. The time period of the central 50% of total daily fire activity varied from a minimum of 1.3 h in North Central Africa to a maximum of 5.5 h in Eastern Australia. In general, shorter periods of burning were associated with greater tree cover. Using the diurnal cycles obtained for each region, an analysis of the drift in the local overpass times of the NOAA-7 through NOAA-14 afternoon satellites was performed. Results show that very large, spurious trends are likely to occur in a long-term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) fire record due to differences in diurnal sampling over time.

AB The Radiometric Camera-by-Camera Cloud Mask (RCCM) is archived at the NASA Langley Distributed Active Archive Center as one of the standard products from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) mission. The RCCM algorithm applied over land surfaces uses an Automated Threshold Selection Algorithm (ATSA) to derive thresholds that are applied to a cloud masking test to determine whether a given image pixel is clear or contains cloud. In this article, we established a framework for the selection of ATSA and the cloud masking tests, which is not only suitable for the RCCM over land, but cloud detection for other satellite missions. Using this framework, we have under-taken the largest comparison of existing histogram-based ATSAs (16 in total) and applied them to four cloud masking tests that can be constructed from the MISR radiances, namely the red channel bidirectional reflectance function (BRF), the standard deviation (STDV) of the red channel BRF, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a parameter D that is constructed by optimizing the information from NDV1 and red channel BR-F for cloud detection. The cloud masking tests and ATSAs are applied to 35 MISR scenes from six snow-free land surface types. To evaluate their performances reference cloud masks are constructed for the 35 scenes using interactive, supervised learning, visualization software. Independent of the ATSA and as a single cloud masking test, D performed the best in terms of having the lowest misclassification rate using the best possible threshold, the highest bimodal rate in the shape of the histograms derived from the 35 scenes, and the least sensitivity to errors in the choice of threshold. Of the 16 ATSAs, the methods of Li and Lee [Li, C.H., and Lee, C.K., (1993). Minimum cross-entropy thresholding. Pattern Recognition, 26(4), 617-625.] and Pal and Bhandari [Pal, N. R., and Bhandari, D., (1993). Image thresholding: some new techniques. Signal Processing, 33, 139-158.] performed the best when applied to D, with essentially unbiased performance and a root mean square of 15% when compared to cloud masks using the best possible thresholds. It is recommended that increased perfon-nance of the RCCM-land algorithm can be had through an increase in the space-time sampling used to generate histograms of D and the addition of a STDV cloud masking test to improve the detection of small cumulus clouds.

AB Rangeland carbon fluxes are highly variable in both space and time. Given the expansive areas of rangelands, how rangelands respond to climatic variation, management, and soil potential is important to understanding carbon dynamics. Rangeland carbon fluxes associated with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) were measured from multiple year data sets at five flux tower locations in the Northern Great Plains. These flux tower measurements were combined with 1-km(2) spatial data sets of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, seasonal NDVI metrics, and soil characteristics. Flux tower measurements were used to train and select variables for a rule-based piece-wise regression model. The accuracy and stability of the model were assessed through random cross-validation and cross-validation by site and year.
   Estimates of NEE were produced for each 10-day period during each growing season from 1998 to 2001. Growing season carbon flux estimates were combined with winter flux estimates to derive and map annual estimates of NEE. The rule-based piece-wise regression model is a dynamic, adaptive model that captures the relationships of the spatial data to NEE as conditions evolve throughout the growing season. The carbon dynamics in the Northern Great Plains proved to be in near equilibrium, serving as a small carbon sink in 1999 and as a small carbon source in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Patterns of carbon sinks and sources are very complex, with the carbon dynamics tilting toward sources in the drier west and toward sinks in the east and near the mountains in the extreme west. Significant local variability exists, which initial investigations suggest are likely related to local climate variability, soil properties, and management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Annual, inter-annual and long-term trends in time series derived from remote sensing can be used to distinguish between natural land cover variability and land cover change. However, the utility of using NDVI-derived phenology to detect change is often limited by poor quality data resulting from atmospheric and other effects. Here, we present a Curve fitting methodology useful for time series of remotely sensed data that is minimally affected by atmospheric and sensor effects and requires neither spatial nor temporal averaging. A two-step technique is employed: first, a harmonic approach models the average annual phenology; second, a spline-based approach models inter-annual phenology. The principal attributes of the time series (e.g., amplitude, timing of onset of greenness, intrinsic smoothness or roughness) are captured while the effects of data drop-outs and gaps are minimized. A recursive, least squares approach captures the upper envelope of NDVI values by upweighting data values above an average annual Curve. We test this methodology oil several land cover types in the western U.S., and find that onset of greenness in an average year varied by less than 8 days within land cover types, indicating that the curve fit is consistent within similar systems. Between 1990 and 2002, temporal variability in onset of greenness was between 17 and 35 days depending on the land cover type, indicating that the inter-annual curve fit captures substantial inter-annual variability. Employing this curve fitting procedure enhances our ability to measure inter-annual phenology and could lead to better understanding of local and regional land cover trends. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission has provided high spatial resolution digital topographic data for most of Earth's volcanoes. Although these data were acquired with a nominal spatial resolution of 30 in, such data are only available for volcanoes located within the U.S.A. and its Territories. For the overwhelming majority of Earth's volcanoes not contained within this subset, DEMs are available in the form of a re-sampled 90 m product. This has prompted us to perform an assessment of the extent to which volcano-morphologic information present in the raw 30 in SRTM product is retained in the degraded 90 m product. To this end, we have (a) applied a simple metric, the so called dissection index (di), to summarize the shapes of volcanic edifices as encoded in a DEM and (b) using this metric, evaluated the extent to which this topographic information is lost as the spatial resolution of the data is reduced. Calculating di as a function of elevation (a di profile) allows us to quantitatively summarize the morphology of a volcano. Our results indicate that although the re-sampling of the 30 m SRTM data obviously results in a loss of morphological information, this loss is not catastrophic. Analysis of a group of six Alaskan volcanoes indicates that differences in di profiles calculated from the 30 m SRTM product are largely preserved in the 90 m product. This analysis of resolution effects on the preservation of topographic information has implications for research that relies on understanding volcanoes through the analysis of topographic datasets of similar spatial resolutions produced by other remote sensing techniques (e.g., repeat-pass interferometric SAR; optical stereometry).

AB Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) has created an unparalleled data set of global elevations that is freely available for modeling and environmental applications. The global availability (almost 80% of the Earth surface) of SRTM data provides baseline information for many types of the worldwide research. The processed SRTM 90 in digital elevation model (DEM) for the entire globe was compiled by Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) and made available to the public via internet mapping interface. This product presents a great value for scientists dealing with terrain analysis, thanks to its easy download procedure and ready-to-use format. However, overall assessment of the accuracy of this product requires additional regional studies involving ground truth control and accuracy verification methods with higher level of precision, such as the global positioning system (GPS).
   The study presented in this paper is based on two independent datasets collected with the same GPS system in Catskill Mountains (New York, USA) and Phuket (Thailand). Both datasets were corrected with differential base station data. Statistical analysis included estimation of absolute errors and multiple regression analysis with slope and aspect variables. Data were analyzed for each location separately and in combination. Differences in terrain and geographical location allowed independent interpretation of results.
   The results of this study showed that absolute average vertical errors from CGIAR dataset can range from 7.58 +/- 0.60 m in Phuket to 4.07 +/- 0.47 m in Catskills (mean S.E.M.). This is significantly better than a standard SRTM accuracy value indicated in its specification (i.e. 16 m). The error values have strong correlation with slope and certain aspect values. Taking into account slope and aspect considerably improved the accuracy of the CGIAR DEM product for terrain with slope values greater than 10 degrees; however, for the terrain with slope values less than 10 degrees, this improvement was found to be negligible.

AB In Kolkata City, India potential land subsidence, due to over-drafting of groundwater under confined condition, has been reported by a number of previous workers and by the local media. The presence of a thick surface clay layer with an average thickness of more than 40 in over the aquifer sand layer raises questions on the possibility and doubtfulness of land subsidence in Kolkata City. In this work, D-InSAR based study has been undertaken to detect and measure land subsidence phenomenon in Kolkata City. For detecting slow land subsidence phenomenon in Kolkata City occurring primarily due to piezometric fall consequent to groundwater overdrafting, we have chosen the InSAR data pairs acquired during post-monsoon (t(1))-pre-monsoon (t(2)) periods when the lowering of piezometric head was the maximum and therefore land subsidence would be more prominent than that of pre-monsoon (t(1))-pre-monsoon (t(2)) and postmonsoon (t(1))-post-monsoon (t(2)) periods of similar time intervals. For detecting slow land subsidence phenomenon essentially from long temporal baseline data pairs (usually in years), temporal clecorrelation and atmospheric artefacts have been found to pose serious difficulties. Adaptive filtering of the noisy interferograms followed by summing of the independent interferograms was performed in complex domain in order to suppress noise from the fringes and highlight the deformation fringes over atmospheric artefacts respectively. Results indicate that an area in Kolkata City surrounded by Machhua Bazar, Calcutta University and Raja Bazar Science College had been undergoing subsidence during the observation period, i.e., 1992-1998 with an estimated rate of 5 to 6.5 imn/year.

AB The impact of needle clumping within shoots on radiative canopy modeling is investigated using discrete homogenous numerically generated vegetation canopies together with a forward ray-tracing model (PARCINOPY). Three numerical shoot designs including one detailed and two simplified (decahedron and flat) shoots were considered. The detailed shoot used measurements of Scots Pine shoots used in previous ray-tracing studies. The simplified shoots dimensions preserved the hemispherically averaged interaction cross-section of the detailed shoot, while the optical properties of their surfaces were assigned using those of the detailed shoot. At shoot scale, our simulations confirm previous studies that shoot albedo is relatively insensitive to the ratio of needle transmittance to reflectance within observed ranges. However, the peak of the BRDF in the hot-spot direction was enhanced with increasing leaf area index (LAI) as needle reflectance increased relative to needle transmittance at fixed needle albedo. The shape of the decahedron shoot scattering phase function more closely resembled that of the detailed shoot simulation than did the flat shoot. At canopy scale, the shoot simplification induces reduction of the leaf area index of 4 STAR where STAR corresponds to the hemispherically averaged silhouette to needle area ratio. Both simplified shoot parameterizations were similar to the detailed shoot parameterization when considering canopy scale Near Infra Red reflectance, transmittance, albedo and BRDF. However, the BRDF for RED wavelengths is better described by a flat shoot parameterization than the decahedron shoot canopy, especially with increasing LAI. Notwithstanding these agreements between parameterizations, the partitioning between single and multiple scattered photons is not conserved with simplified shoot canopies. This divergence tends to be higher for the flat leaf simulation, especially in the single scattering at large view zenith angles. The results described in this work indicate that the simple flat leaf model can be substituted for the detailed shoot model when modeling the total bidirectional reflectance and the canopy hemispherical reflectance and transmittance within homogeneous canopies. Taking into account this parameterization might improve considerably the reflectance and radiative transfer models, which to date do not consider the effect of clumping within the shoot. Further work to upscale these results for complex canopy architecture such as branches and crowns is required. However, this set of simulations could serve as a useful initial set of cases for testing of radiative transfer models over needleleaf canopies. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Despite the intensive research effort directed at predicting the effects of climate change on plants in the Arctic, the impact of environmental change on species' distributions remains difficult to quantify. Predictive habitat distribution models provide a tool to predict the geographical distribution of a species based on the ecological gradients that determine it, and to estimate how the distribution of a species might respond to environmental change. Here, we present a model of the distribution of the dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala L. around the fjord Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. The model was built from field observations, an Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image, a GIs database containing environmental data at a spatial resolution of 20 m, and relied on generalized linear models (GLMs). We used a logistic GLM to predict the occurrence of the species and a Gaussian GLM to predict its abundance at the sites where it occurred. Temperature and topographical exposure and inclination of a site appeared to promote both the occurrence and the abundance of D. octopetala. The occurrence of the species was additionally negatively influenced by snow and water cover and topographical exposure towards the north, whereas the abundance of the species appeared lower on calciferous substrates. Validation of the model using independent data and the resulting distribution map showed that they successfully recover the distribution of D. octopetala in the study area (kappa = 0.46, AUC =0.81 for the logistic GLM [n - 200], r(2) = 0.29 for the Gaussian GLM [n - 36]). The results further highlight that models predicting the local distribution of plant species in an Arctic environment would greatly benefit from data on the distribution and duration of snow cover. Furthermore, such data are necessary to make quantitative estimates for the impact of changes in temperature and winter precipitation on the distribution of plants in the Arctic.

AB Multi-temporal JERS SAR data were studied for forest biomass mapping. The study site was located in South-eastern Finland in Ruokolahti. Pre-processing of JERS SAR data included ortho-rectification and radiometric normalization of topographic effects.
   In single-date regression analysis between backscatter amplitude and stem volume, summer scenes from July to October produced correlation coefficients (r) between 0.63 and 0.81. Backscatter level and the slope of the (linear) regression line were stable from scene to scene. Winter scenes acquired in very cold and dry winter conditions had a very low correlation. One winter scene acquired in Conditions where snow is not completely frozen produced a correlation coefficient similar to summer scenes.
   Multivariate regression analysis with a 6-date JERS SAR dataset produced correlation coefficient of 0.85. A combined JERS-optical regression analysis improved the correlation coefficient to 0.89 and also alleviated the saturation, which affects both SAR and optical data.
   The stability of the regression results in summer scenes suggests that a simple constant model could be used in wide-area forest biomass mapping if accuracy requirements are low and if biomass estimates are aggregated to large areal units. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the utility of high spectral and spatial resolution imagery for the automated species-level classification of individual tree crowns (ITCs) in a tropical rain forest (TRF). Laboratory spectrometer and airborne reflectance spectra (161 bands, 437-2434 nm) were acquired from seven species of emergent trees. Analyses focused on leaf-, pixel- and crown-scale spectra. We first described the spectral regions and factors that most influence spectral separability among species. Next, spectral-based species classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum likelihood (ML) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifiers applied to combinations of bands from a stepwise-selection procedure. Optimal regions of the spectrum for species discrimination varied with scale. However, near-infrared (700-1327 nm) bands were consistently important regions across all scales. Bands in the visible region (437-700 nm) and shortwave infrared (1994-2435 nm) were more important at pixel- and crown scales. Overall classification accuracy decreased from leaf scales measured in the laboratory to pixel- and crown scales measured from the airborne sensor. Leaf-scale classification using LDA and 40 bands had 100% overall accuracy. Pixel-scale spectra from sunlit regions of crowns were classified with 88% overall accuracy using a ML classifier and 60 bands. The highest crown-scale (ITC) accuracy was 92% with LDA and 30 bands. Producer's accuracies ranged from 70% to 100% and User's accuracies ranged from 81% to 100%. The SAM classifier performed poorly at all scales and spectral regions of analysis. ITCs were also classified using an object-based approach in which crown species labels were assigned according to the majority class of classified pixels within a crown. An overall accuracy of 86% was achieved with an object-based LDA classifier applied to 30 bands of data. Object-based and crown-scale ITC classifications were significantly more accurate with 10 narrow-bands relative to accuracies achieved with simulated multispectral, broadband data. We concluded that high spectral and spatial resolution imagery acquired over TRF canopy has substantial potential for automated ITC species discrimination. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thousands of scientific publications and dozens of textbooks include data from instruments derived from NASA's Seasat. The Seasat mission was launched on June 26, 1978, on an Atlas-Agena rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was the first Earth-orbiting satellite to carry four complementary microwave experitnents-the Radar Altimeter (ALT) to measure ocean surface topography by measuring spacecraft altitude above the ocean surface; the Seasat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS), to measure wind speed and direction over the ocean; the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) to measure surface wind speed, ocean surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor content, rain rate, and ice coverage; and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), to image the ocean surface, polar ice caps, and coastal regions. While originally designed for remote sensing of the Earth's oceans, the legacy of Seasat has had a profound impact in many other areas including solid earth science, hydrology, ecology and planetary science.

AB Remote sensing cannot provide a direct measurement of evapotranspiration (ET) but it can provide a reasonably good estimate of Evaporative Fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of ET and available energy. Recent studies have successfully estimated EF using a contextual interpretation of radiometric surface temperature (TO) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) such as from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard NOAA-14 satellite. To provide a continuous monitoring capability for EF, it is important to explore the utility of such an approach to recently launched sensors with better spectral resolution. Here, we explore the utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard EOS Terra satellite, sensors to estimate EF over large areas. We compare and contrast EF estimates from AVHRR and MODIS sensors over South Florida. We also explore the sensitivity of NDVI and T-0 to sensor response functions (SRFs) and atmospheric variables. Our results show that NDVI-T-0 space, when using T-0 from a single channel derived temperature, is affected by the SRFs and overpass times. Despite differences in NDVI and T-0 estimates from AVHRR and MODIS sensors, it appears that they capture similar contextual information of energy partitioning and the EF estimates are comparable. Our results suggest that the proposed EF estimation is relatively insensitive to changes in absolute values of T-0, induced by local atmospheric conditions and sensor viewing angles, and EF is primarily determined by the overall contextual space of NDVI-T-0 diagram.

AB With increased availability of satellite data products used in mapping surface energy balance and evapotranspiration (ET), routine ET monitoring at large scales is becoming more feasible. Daily satellite coverage is available, but an essential model input, surface temperature, is at I km or greater pixel resolution. At such coarse spatial resolutions, the capability to monitor the impact of land cover change and disturbances on ET or to evaluate ET from different crop covers is severely hampered. The effect of sensor resolution on model output for an agricultural region in central Iowa is examined using Landsat data collected during the Soil Moisture Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). This study was conducted in concert with the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02). Two images collected during a rapid growth period in soybean and corn crops are used with a two-source (soil + vegetation) energy balance model, which explicitly evaluates soil and vegetation contributions to the radiative temperature and to the net turbulent exchange/surface energy balance. The pixel resolution of the remote sensing inputs are varied from 60 in to 120, 240, and 960 in. Model output at high resolution are first validated with tower and aircraft-based flux measurements to assure reliability of model computations. Histograms of the flux distributions and resulting statistics at the different pixel resolutions are compared and contrasted. Results indicate that when the input resolution is on the order of 1000 in, variation in fluxes, particularly ET, between corn and soybean fields is not feasible. However, results also suggest that thermal sharpening techniques for estimating surface temperature at higher resolutions (similar to 250 in) using the visible/near infrared waveband resolutions could provide enough spatial detail for discriminating ET from individual com and soybean fields. Additional support for this nominal resolution requirement is deduced from a geostatistical analysis of the vegetation index and surface temperature images. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Our study compares data on burn severity collected from multi-temporal Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) with similar data from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Two AVIRIS and ETM+ data acquisitions recorded stir-face conditions immediately before the Hoover Fire began to spread rapidly and again the following year. Data were validated with 63 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The relationship between spectral channels and burn severity was examined by comparing pre- and post-fire datasets. Based on the high burn severity comparison, AVIRIS channels 47 and 60 at wavelengths of 788 and 913 nm showed the greatest negative response to fire. Post-fire reflectance values decreased the most on average at those wavelengths, while channel 210 at 2370 nm showed the greatest positive response on average. Fire increased reflectance the most at that wavelength over the entire measured spectral range. Furthermore, channel 210 at 2370 nm exhibited the greatest variation in spectral response, suggesting potentially high information content for fire severity. Based on general remote sensing principles and the logic of variable spectral responses to fire, dNBR from both sensors should produce useful results in quantifying burn severity. The results verify the band-response relationships to burn severity as seen with ETM+ data and confirm the relationships by way of a distinctly different sensor system. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The backscattering and emission measured simultaneously by radar and radiometer show promise for the estimation of surface variables such as near-surface soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. In this paper, the 10.7 GHz Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) microwave imager (TMI) channel and 13.8 GHz precipitation radar (PR) observations are simultaneously used for the estimation of the near-surface soil moisture and vegetation properties. The Fresnel model for soil and a simple model for vegetation are used to simulate the passive microwave emission at 10.7 GHz. To determine the PR backscatter signal from a land surface, a theoretical approach is used based on the Geometric Optics Model for simulating bare soil and a semi-empirical water-cloud model for vegetation. The model parameters required in specifying the nature of the soil and vegetation are calibrated on the basis of in situ soil moisture data combined with remotely sensed observations. The calibrated model is subsequently used to retrieve near-surface soil moisture and leaf area index for assumed values of surface roughness and temperature. Algorithm assessment using synthetic passive and active microwave data shows a nonlinearity effect in the system inversion, which results in a varying degree of error statistics in soil wetness and vegetation characteristics retrieval. The technique was applied on TRMM radar/radiometer observations from three consecutive years and evaluated against in situ near-surface (5 cm) soil moisture measurements from the Oklahoma Mesonet showing a consistent performance.

AB The lack of information on the vegetation status before the use of fire as a management tool in protected areas leads to drastic destruction of the natural vegetation and biodiversity. This paper describes the use of spectral indices and simulation of savanna burning to assess risk of intensive fire propagation in a National Park (Niokolo Koba, Senegal, 'West Africa). Spectral parameters corresponding to thematic information (wetness, brightness, and greenness) were retrieved using an orthogonal transformation, the Tasseled Cap approach on LANDSAT-ETM images. Wetness and brightness indices were normalized (sigma = 1 and mean = 0) and then combined in a simple semiempirical algorithm of fire risk levels discrimination. These two indices are proven to reflect qualitatively both fuel moisture and its distribution, which constitute the most foreseen determinants of fire propagation in savanna areas. The fire risk assessment algorithm (FIRA algorithm) was used to produce a fire risk map at the beginning of the management fire implement period. In parallel, a fire area simulator (FARSITE) developed by USDA was used with randomly spaced fire sources to determine areas which can be potentially burned in the study site. These simulated burned areas and the FIRA algorithm results were cross-compared to a real fire scars dated at the end of the same burning period and to land cover map. A great consistency was found between the different sources of information. More than 85% of fire prone areas identified by the FIRA algorithm or simulated by FARSITE were located in trees-shrub, woodland, and shrub savannas. These cover types included also 95% of real fire scars. Almost 88% and 84% of real fire scars were found in the risk zones determined by the FIRA algorithm and the simulated burned areas by FARSITE, respectively. The method used is simple and suited for an operational use for management fire implementation in savanna ecosystems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses a model to predict the normalized hemispherical-directional reflectance function for soil or rocky surfaces of a given roughness under conditions of outdoor illumination. These surfaces are simulated by geometrical shapes similar to beads merging into each other, characterized by three parameters. In addition, the shape of the surface is characterized by the directivity factor D-R, expressing the differences between the maximum and the minimum deviations of its height, calculated along all possible directions. The surface is illuminated by a hemispherical light source created by a number of point sources of given light intensities. The light energy is scattered from the surface, in accordance the quasi-Lambertian function. The distribution of the surface reflectance, as viewed from all the possible directions, can be described for all the possible illumination conditions expressed by the solar zenith and the horizontal angles for a given hemisphere light distribution of a definite optical thickness. This represents the hemispherical-directional reflectance distribution function, HDRDF, of the surface. The HDRDF function is normalized to the nadir viewpoint and visualized for a given illumination condition. The model assumes that the HDRDF of a surface contains information about the directivity of the surface shape, as described by the directivity factor of the surface hemispherical-directional reflectance function D-HDRDF. This factor, expressing the asymmetry of the HDRDF with respect to the solar principal plane (SPP), is strongly correlated with the D-R. The use of both factors, the D-R and D-HDRDF, enables us to understand the distinctions between soil surface images with height irregularities of directional character that create a furrow microrelief, and irregularities spread non-directly, randomly, depending on whether the soil has been cultivated or not. The model was tested on directional reflectance data measured in the visible, the near and the middle infrared spectra for cultivated surface with furrows, as well as for three uncultivated desert loess and rocky surfaces situated in Israel.

AB Valid measures of map accuracy are critical, yet can be inaccurate even when following well-established procedures. Accuracy assessment is particularly problematic when thematic classes lie along a land-cover continuum, and boundaries between classes are ambiguous. In this study, we examined error sources introduced during accuracy assessment of a regional land-cover map generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in Rond (o) over cap nia, southwestern Brazil. In this dynamic, highly fragmented landscape, the dominant land-cover classes represent a continuum from pasture to second growth to primary forest. We used high spatial resolution, geocoded videography as a reference, and focused on second-growth forest because of its potential contribution to the regional carbon balance. To quantify subjectivity in reference data labeling, we compared reference data produced by five trained interpreters. We also quantified the impact of other error sources, including geolocation errors between the map and reference data, land-cover changes between dates of data collection, heterogeneous reference samples, and edge pixels.
   Interpreters disagreed on classification of almost 30% of the samples; mixed reference samples and samples located in transitional classes accounted for a majority of disagreements. Agreement on second-growth forest labels between any two interpreters averaged below 50%, while agreement on primary forest was over 90%. Greater than 30% of disagreement between map and reference data was attributed to geolocation error, and 2.4% of disagreement was attributed to change in land cover between dates. After geocorrection, 24% of remaining disagreements corresponded to reference samples with mixed land cover, and 47% corresponded to edge pixels on the classified map. These findings suggest that: (1) labels of continuous land-cover types are more subjective and variable than commonly assumed, especially for transitional classes; however, using multiple interpreters to produce the reference data classification increases reference data accuracy; and (2) validation data sets that include only non-mixed, non-edge samples are likely to result in overly optimistic accuracy estimates, not representative of the map as a whole. These results suggest that different regional estimates of second-growth extent may be inaccurate and difficult to compare. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multidirectional remotely sensed optical and thermal images acquired within a row cotton crop in Montpellier (France) were used to test the opportunities and limitations of an existing water stress index, the Water Deficit Index (WDI, based on the trapezoid approach). The WDI was applied with multidirectional crop surface temperatures (T-s) and reflectance data acquired on a row-cotton crop with different water and cover conditions from 11 different view angles in the east/west plane. This data set allowed a biophysical analysis of this index both inside and outside its validity domain, initially limited in terms of T-s measurements in a [ - 20degrees, + 20degrees] view angles interval around nadir. Results showed that the WDI was a robust approach, since its calculation is based on the relationship between crop cover and T,. However, it yielded some directional errors in the case of sparse crops even in its validity domain where the relative variation of WDI between oblique angles and nadir could reach 14% (and more than 40% for larger view angles). The same degree of variability was observed between WDI values estimated on a same plot at two different times in a given day from a nadir observation. In a large range of crop heterogeneity, hourly sunlit soil fraction presented a stronger influence on T, than the total soil fraction. However, by adapting the view angle to daytime measurements and crop structure, it seemed possible to overcome sunlit soil effects.
   These experimental results were tested and extrapolated using a 3D crop energy balance model (Thermo). It allowed simulations of directional T measurements according to various sun/sensor angular configurations, crop structure, and water status characteristics. This confirmed the limitations of the trapezoid method both within and outside its validity domain. Moreover, Thermo allowed the computation of a "directional" WDI accounting for angular and hourly sunlit soil effects variability on Ts. The interest of adapting the view angle to daytime measurements and crop structure was confirmed by comparing this "directional" WDI with the "theoretical" one (based on the original trapezoid approach). These results should encourage further development of water stress indices based on bidirectional thermal infrared and optical measurements to quantify and thus overcome sunlit soil fraction effects.

AB In this paper, we propose equations for narrowband-to-broadband (NTB) albedo conversion for glacier ice and snow for four types of satellite sensors: thematic mapper (TM), advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR). We do this on the basis of spectral albedos and incident spectral irradiances generated with radiative-transfer models of the (sub-)surface (a two-stream model) and the atmosphere, respectively. First, we establish equations for reference values of atmospheric components and the surface elevation. These equations describe measurements with root-mean-square differences of similar to 0.016. We then show that the "reference equations" also perform well when total ozone and aerosol optical depth are changed with respect to the reference. The negative effect of humidity and elevation variations on the performance of the equations can be eliminated by adding a correction term. We argue that narrowband albedos are much less sensitive to variations in the incident spectral irradiance than broadband albedos. Hence, our conclusions about the effects of variations in atmospheric composition and elevation are also valid for equations for NTB conversion proposed in other papers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB The development of vegetation cover is one of the primary indicators for land degradation, stability, or regeneration in regions threatened by overgrazing. This paper addresses the problem how spatially explicit information about degradation processes in European Mediterranean rangelands can be derived from long time series of satellite data. The selected test site in central Crete, Greece, is considered to be representative for the highly heterogeneous character of such landscapes. The monitoring approach comprises the time period between 1977 and 1996, covered by nine Landsat TM and four Landsat MSS images.
   Special emphasis has hence been put on the evaluation of potentials and drawbacks when coupling Landsat TM and MSS based results. The data sets were geometrically and radiometrically pre-processed in a rigorous fashion, followed by a linear spectral unmixing approach and a time series analysis of vegetation fraction images. Based on the resulting map, the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation cover changes are explained. Even a test site such as central Crete, with its limited spatial extend, exhibits heterogeneous patterns of change, supporting the hypothesis that long time series of EOS data from Landsat-like sensors are mandatory to identify the relevant changes at landscape level.

AB The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has been widely used to monitor moisture-related vegetation condition. The relationship between vegetation vigor and moisture availability, however, is complex and has not been adequately studied with satellite sensor data. To better understand this relationship, an analysis was conducted on time series of monthly NDVI (1989-2000) during the growing season in the north and central U.S. Great Plains. The NDVI was correlated to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a multiple-time scale meteorological-drought index based on precipitation. The 3-month SPI was found to have the best correlation with the NDVI, indicating lag and cumulative effects of precipitation on vegetation, but the correlation between NDVI and SPI varies significantly between months. The highest correlations occurred during the middle of the growing season, and lower correlations were noted at the beginning and end of the growing season in most of the area. A regression model with seasonal dummy variables reveals that the relationship between the NDVI and SPI is significant in both grasslands and croplands, if this seasonal effect is taken into account. Spatially, the best NDVI-SPI relationship occurred in areas with low soil water-holding capacity. Our most important finding is that NDVI is an effective indicator of vegetation-moisture condition, but seasonal timing should be taken into consideration when monitoring drought with the NDVI.

AB A pertinent interpretation of thermal infrared (TIR) information to characterize crop water status requires at least to consider the fraction of crop cover. Even if the crop cover is known, such an interpretation remains difficult and the current issues to be overcome in the field of TIR remote sensing applications stands on bare soil effects. An experiment was conducted during summer 1999 in Montpellier (France) on a row-cotton crop in order to acquire a data set relating thermal and optical multidirectional measurements to crop structure and water status. The crop was monitored all along its development. Three plots were delimited: a reference plot with no water limitation and two plots without water supply respectively at flowering and cutout stage. On three dates, directional TIR and optical images were acquired both on the reference plot and on the one with limited water supply. Directional averaged temperatures (Ts) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed a strong dependence on canopy gap fraction. Ts appeared particularly influenced by directional sunlit soil fraction variability, depending on both sun/sensor angle configuration, crop structure and water status. Leaves at different levels in the canopy (with different ages and spectral properties) could be observed by the sensor, but the impact of the sunlit/shaded leaves ratio on directional temperature measurements was weak in comparison to soil effects.
   The different directional influence of sunlit soil fractions on Ts and NDVI values explains in a large part the limits encountered by water stress indices approaches, aiming at relating linearly such variables, when applied to partially covering crops. Such results provide an exhaustive experiment-based biophysical analysis of very high resolution multidirectional TIR signal. They point out further ways of investigations to be explored in the field of water stress indices improvement or performing. This comes as a preamble of an experiment-based analysis of the limits and opportunities of water stress indices methods, complemented with a 3D model-based analysis that allows confirmation and extrapolation of the results to larger ranges of crop characteristics and directional configurations.

AB Hyperspectral remotely sensed data are useful for studying ecosystem processes and patterns. However, spatial characterization of such remotely sensed images is needed to optimize sampling procedures and address scaling issues. We have investigated spatial scaling in ground-based and airborne hyperspectral data for canopy- to watershed-level ecosystem studies of southern California chaparral and grassland vegetation. Three optical reflectance indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Band Index (WBI) and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) were used as indicators of biomass, plant water content and photosynthetic activity, respectively. Two geostatistical procedures, the semivariogram and local variance, were used for the spatial scaling analysis of these indices. The results indicate that a pixel size of 6 m or less would be optimal for studying functional properties of southern California grassland and chaparral ecosystems using hyperspectral remote sensing. These results provide a guide for selecting the spatial resolution of future airborne and satellite-based hyperspectral sensors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Radiometric analysis of SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) images acquired over Australia was carried out as a basis for the development of an algorithm to map burnt areas in woodland savannas. We analysed the variability of daily ground reflectance and its relationship with illumination and viewing geometry. Finding that the geometrical effects can be parameterised by the phase angle (angle between the illumination and the viewing directions) and the viewing zenith angle (VZA), we fit a simple linear model to the observations. The results show that about 60-70% of the variability in the daily reflectance is caused by geometrical effects. The residual 30-40% of the variability is probably due to changes in vegetation condition, such as senescence, and residual atmospheric contamination. We tested temporal compositing as a practical method of reducing the variability in the reflectance whilst retaining the burnt area signal. We inspected the radiometric and geometrical effects of four different compositing criteria and showed that minimum near infrared (NIR) is the most appropriate for burnt area mapping over the study area. In order to analyse the sensitivity of the VGT spectral bands and derived indices to changes induced by fire, we extracted burnt area spectral signatures for different vegetation types. The persistence of the burnt signal, as observed with each band and index, was analysed. Among the bands, NIR is shown to be the most sensitive to fire occurrence. There is a clear drop in the reflectance immediately after the fire and it remains very low during subsequent weeks, On the other hand, the burnt signal in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band is showed to be strongly dependent on the vegetation cover type and on the age of the burnt area, Among the indices, the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) is identified as the most suitable for detecting changes induced by fire on the vegetation cover.

TI Conventional and fuzzy accuracy assessment of the New York Gap Analysis
   Project land cover map
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The accuracy of a regional-scale thematic map of land cover was assessed using conventional and fuzzy methods. The mapping process integrated Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with expert knowledge to map land cover for a 12 million-ha area. Accuracy assessment was based on a stratified random sample of 113 sampling areas. Paired observed and predicted land cover types for 9745 polygons for conventional accuracy and 933 polygons for fuzzy accuracy were collected. Overall map accuracies using conventional methods ranged from 74% to 42% for maps with increasing taxonomic resolution. Fuzzy map accuracies were assessed at low and high taxonomic resolutions resulting in an improvement in map accuracy of 19% and 23%, respectively. The nature, magnitude, and frequency of errors associated with mapping land cover types for large land areas at different levels of taxonomic resolution are reported, and two accuracy assessment methods are compared with respect to information content and opportunities for improving map quality.

AB Land cover and vegetation classification systems are generally designed for ecological or land use applications that are independent of remote sensing considerations. As a result, the classes of interest are often poorly separable in the feature space provided by remotely sensed data. In many cases, ancillary data sources can provide useful information to help distinguish between inseparable classes. However, methods for including ancillary data sources, such as the use of prior probabilities in maximum likelihood classification, are often problematic in practice. This paper presents a method for incorporating prior probabilities in remote-sensing-based land cover classification using a supervised decision-tree classification algorithm. The method allows robust probabilities of class membership to be estimated from nonparametric supervised classification algorithms using a technique known as boosting. By using this approach in association with Bayes' rule, poorly separable classes can be distinguished based on ancillary information. The method does not penalize rare classes and can incorporate incomplete or imperfect information using a confidence parameter that weights the influence of ancillary information relative to its quality. Assessments of the methodology using both Landsat TM and AVHRR data show that it successfully improves land cover classification results. The method is shown to be especially useful for improving discrimination between agriculture and natural vegetation in coarse-resolution land cover maps. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The absolute radiometric accuracy of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared (TIR) data was evaluated with in situ data collected in a vicarious calibration field campaign conducted in Lake Titicaca, Bolivia during May 26 and June 17, 2000. The comparison between MODIS TIR data produced by the version 2.5.4 Level-1B code and the band radiances calculated with atmospheric radiative transfer code MODTRAN4.0 based on fake surface kinetic temperatures measured by five IR radiometers deployed in the high-elevation Lake Titicaca and the atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles measured by radiosondes launched on the lake shore on June, 15 2000, a calin clear-sky day, shows good agreements in bands 31 and 32 (within an accuracy of 0.4%) in the daytime overpass case. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the changes on the measured atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles result in negligible or small effects on the calculated radiances in the atmospheric window bands (bands 20-23, 29, and 31-32). Therefore, comparisons for these bands were made for cases when lake surface temperature measurements were available but no radiosonde data were available and in subareas of 10 x 16 pixels where there was no in situ measurement but MODIS brightness temperatures in band 3 1 vary within +/- 0.15 K by using the validated band 31 to determine lake surface temperatures through the MODTRAN4.0 code. Comparisons and error analysis show that the specified absolute radiometric accuracies are reached or nearly reached in MODIS bands 21, 29, and 31-33 and that there is a calibration bias of 2-3% in bands 20, 22, and 23. The error analysis also shows that the radiosondes cannot provide accurate atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles to estimate the calibration accuracies in the atmspheric sounding bands (bands 24-25, 27-28, and 34-36) at the specified 1% level and that the calibration accuracy in the ozone band 30 cannot be estimated without in situ measurements of ozone.

ID SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; VEGETATION; RESOLUTION; IMPACT
AB Our objectives were to: (1) investigate the sensitivity of multitemporal image data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data for detecting land-use/land-cover changes primarily associated with urbanization and (2) test the effectiveness of a misregistration compensation model on the same data set, Empirical analyses were conducted using to near-anniversary, single-date NOAA AVHHR images of a rapidly urbanizing region of southern and Baja California. Analyses were facilitated by reference data from detailed GIS data layers of land-use land-cover types for the 2 years corresponding to image acquisition dates (1990 and 1995). Almost all AVHRR pixels containing land-use, land-cover changes were mixed with nonchange areas, even when the extent of change features was greater than the nominal 1 km(2) ground sampling area. The strongest signals of image brightness change ere detected by temporal differences of NDVI and Channel 4 surface temperature. "Undeveloped to urban" and "undeveloped to water" were the land-use/land-cover transition sequences with the most definitive AVHRR change signals. Mean magnitudes of misregistration errors were estimated to be around 0.2 pixel units in x and y directions. Mean values for misregistration noise equivalent in brightness change (MNEDeltaB) were 0.02, 0.02, and 1.96 K for image differences of Channel 1 reflectance, NDVI, and Channel 4 surface temperature, respectively. The misregistration compensation model reduced false detection of change, but improvements in detection of land-use/land-cover changes were not conclusive. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The mean heights of dominant trees and the stem numbers of 39 plots of 200 m(2) each were derived from various canopy height metrics and canopy density measured by means of a small-footprint airborne laser scanner over young forest stands with tree heights < 6 in. On the average, the laser transmitted 12,019 pulses ha(-1). Ground-truth values were regressed against laser-derived canopy height metrics and density. The regressions explained 83% and 42% of the variability in ground-truth mean height and stein number, respectively. Cross-validation of the regressions revealed standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of mean height and stem number of 0.57 m (15%) and 1209 ha(-1) (28.8%), respectively. A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of mean height of dominant trees in forest stands was tested. One hundred and seventy-four sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha forest area. Twenty-nine of the plots were sited in young stands with tree heights < 11.5 m. In the first stage, mean height of dominant trees of the 29 plots were regressed against laser-derived canopy height metrics and density. In the second stage, the;;elected regression was used to predict mean height of 12 selected test stands. The prediction revealed a bias of 0.23 m (3.5%) (P>.05) and a standard deviation of the differences between predicted and ground-truth mean height of 0.56 to (8.4%). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

   seasonality; cloud avoidance
AB The Landsat-7 Long-Term Acquisition Plan (LTAP) automates the selection of Landsat scenes to periodically refresh a global archive of sunlit, substantially cloud-free land images. Its automatic nature reduces the workload on both operations and science office management, and makes the best use of limited resources both on board the satellite and in the ground-processing systems. The core of the LTAP is the definition of seasonality for each scene of interest, where seasonality is defined as the occurrence of change over time. When significant change is occurring, acquisition frequencies are high. Conversely, if little change is occurring, acquisition frequencies are low. This definition of seasonality was augmented with suggested acquisition frequencies from the various science community niches that have historically relied on Landsat data to support their research goals. Cloud climatology for each scene was determined, as monthly historical averages, so it could be compared during scheduling with the daily cloud-cover predictions to discriminate between scenes cloudier than usual (less worthy of acquisition) and scenes clearer than normal (more worthy of acquisition). A scheduler system executes the LTAP and builds the daily schedule by evaluating many factors for each scene, including seasonality, acquisition history, cloud cover, and availability of resources. The result of this evaluation is a list of the "best" 250 scenes to be acquired that day. An important tool in the development of the scheduling system and in the evaluation of the LTAP performance is a modeling capability that allows "what if" analyses to be made and proposed changes to the LTAP or the scheduling software to be evaluated. This modeling capability has proven key to understanding the impacts of potential changes in strategy or software. By considering cloud climatology and current cloud-cover predictions, Landsat 7 has acquired imagery with less cloud contamination than previous Landsat data. After 16 months of operations, a relatively cloud-free global archive exists that captures land-cover change where and when it occurs. Additional user requests have been low, suggesting users are finding suitable data already in the archive. Short-term science campaigns and special requests can be accommodated in the LTAP without perturbing the seasonality of the archive or exceeding the available resources.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing is a promising tool for the analysis of vegetation and soils in remote sensing imagery. The purpose of this study is to ascertain how well hyperspectral remote sensing data can retrieve vegetation cover, vegetation type, and soil type in areas of low vegetation cover. We use multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), high-quality field spectra, and AVIRIS data to determine how well full-range spectral mixture analysis (SMA) techniques can retrieve vegetation and soil information. Using simulated AVIRIS-derived reflectance spectra, we find that, in areas of low vegetation cover. MESMA is not able to provide reliable retrievals of vegetation type when covers are less than at least 30%. Overestimations of vegetation are likely, but vegetation cover in many circumstances can be estimated reliably. Soil type retrievals are more than 90% reliable in discriminating dark-armored desert soils from blown sands. This simulation comprises a best-case scenario in which many typical problems with remote sensing in areas of low cover or desert areas are minimized. Our results have broad implications for the applicability of full-range SMA techniques in analysis of data from current and planned hyperspectral sensors. Several phenomena contribute to the unreliability of vegetation retrievals. Spectrally indeterminate vegetation types, characterized by low spectral contrast, are difficult to model correctly even at relatively high covers. Combinations of soil and vegetation spectra have the potential of generating mixtures that resemble an unmixed spectrum from different material, further confounding vegetation cover and soil type retrievals. Intraspecies spectral variability and nonlinear mixing produce uncertainties in spectral endmembers much larger than that only due to instrumental noise modeled here. Having established limits on linear spectral unmixing in areas of low cover through spectral simulations. we evaluate AVIRIS-derived reflectance data from the Mojave Desert, California. We show that MESMA is capable of mapping soil surface types even when vegetation type cannot be reasonable retrieved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall Estimation fron passive microwave satellite data has been used widely over oceans but has been less successful over land. This is because over land surfaces, the high spatial and temporal variability in emissivity, coupled with relatively low contrast between surface and rain cloud microwave emissions, make the rainfall signal moo-e difficult to extract. The variability of emissivity is mainly due to variations in vegetation cover and soil moisture. Major improvements in reliability of rainfall estimates are possible if emissivities could be measured routinely at appropriate scales. The possibility of estimating emissivity at the frequencies relevant to rainfall from vegetation and soil moisture measurements is explored in this paper using data from airborne sensors over a semi-arid area in Spain. Results show a good correlation between vegetation cover (represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and emissivity in dry conditions. This relationship is not significantly affected by vegetation type. Under wet conditions, the correlation is greatly reduced possibly due to the difficulty in accounting for cloud effects at higher frequencies. Attempts to quantity the effect of soil moisture using the Antecedent Precipitation Index were partially successful but more accurate measurements would be needed for reliable retrieval of emissivities. The use of a soil-adjusted vegetation index produced a higher correlation with emissivity than did the nonadjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB In summer 1997 the largest Oder River flood of this century occurred from drainage area in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. The spread of floodwater, which reached the Pomeranian Bight of the Baltic Sea end of July, was monitored and investigated by satellite data, shipborne measurements, and coupled biophysical modeling to documented impacted coastal waters and to assess changes in water quality and influences on the ecosystem. This paper presents the spatial and temporal floodwater distribution patterns as determined from satellite data with different spectral ranges and spatial resolutions and the relationships of these flooding patterns to meteorological conditions and river discharge rates. The flooding patterns were observed using approximately 80 sea surface temperature (SST) maps, derived from infrared data of the Advanced Very Nigh Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) operating on weather satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The flood period teas characterized by dominant easterly-ly winds transporting the floodwater along the German coast into the Arkona Sea. In situ measurements and data of the visible spectral range from NOAA weather satellites and the Indian satellites IRS-P3 and IRS-1C with ocean color sensors were used to study the distribution of renter constituents in the Szczecin Lagoon and Pomeranian Eight and to verify results from the SSTs. The maximum horizontal extent of discharged river water covered an area larger than 3,000 km(2) in the Pomeranian Bight and the southern Arkona Sea by 20 August. The eastern part of the Szczecin Lagoon was directly influenced by the floodwaters, leading, to lower concentrations of water constituents and verifying the diluting effect. The in situ measurements in combination with the satellite observations provided an added assessment of potential impacts from floodwaters on the affected coastal ecosystem.

AB Boosted by the 1997/98 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena, uncontrolled fires have destroyed huge areas of rainforest and bush land in Indonesia. Thick smoke covered large areas over SE Asia for months. Due to their cloud and haze penetrating capability SAR sensors could complement existing fire monitoring systems based on NOAA-AVHRR data, providing a 900 times higher spatial resolution. This article describes results of the combined synergistic use of NOAA-AVHRR hotspot data received and processed by the IFFM/GTZ project and multitemporal ERS-2 SAR images for burned scar mapping in the province of East Kalimantan. Burned areas detected by ERS were verified using AVHRR sensor hot spot data and extensive field surveys during the fire season in April 1998. Furthermore, a vegetation classification discerning five classes was derived from the ERS-2 SAR images and compared to the mapped burned scars. The total burned area of the test site is estimated to be 1.3 mil ha out of 1.85 mil ha (71%). (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

TI Microwave emission model of layered snowpacks
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID DRY SNOW; TEMPERATURE; SIGNATURES; SCATTERING; HEAT
AB A thermal microwave emission model of layered snow-packs (MEMLS) was developed for the frequency range 5-100 GHz. It is based on radiative transfer using six-flux theory to describe multiple volume scattering and absorption, including radiation trapping due to total reflection and a combination of coherent and incoherent superpositions of reflections between layer interfaces. The scattering coefficient is determined empirically from measured snow samples, whereas the absorption coefficient, the effective permittivity, refraction, and reflection at layer interfaces are based on physical models and on measured ice dielectric properties. The number of layers is only limited by computer time and memory. A limitation of the empirical fits and thus of MEMLS is in the range of observed frequencies and correlation lengths (a measure of grain size). First model validation for dry winter snow was successful. An extension to larger grains is given in a companion article (Matzler and Wiesmann, 1999). The objective of the present article is to describe and illustrate the model and to pave the way for further improvements. MEMLS has been coded in MATLAB. If forms part of a combined combined land-surface-atmosphere microwave emission model for radiometry from satellites (Pulliainen et al., 1998). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB The recent algorithms developed for biophysical variables assessment require accurate surface reflectance measurements. This article describes algorithms used for atmospheric correction of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Atmospheric corrections include Rayleigh scattering gaseous absorption, and aerosol scattering in three visible channels (480 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm), and the near-infrared channel (830 nm). Atmospheric constituents such as water vapor and ozone are extracted from climatology data sets, while aerosol optical depths (AODs) are derived from the TM scene itself by adopting the dark target approach. The dark target pixels are identified, and their reflectances in the visible channels are estimated using TBI Channel 7 (2.1 mu m). Atmospheric transmittance and aerosol optical depth are derived for 16 grid points equally distributed over the scene, then interpolated to match the TM spatial resolution. This technique considerably reduces the computing time without decreasing the accuracy. These algorithms were tested using 11 TM scenes over a wide variety of sites, including forest, crop, ann semiarid areas. The AOD in the blue, green, and red channels retrieved using the dark target technique was validated using sunphotometer measurements. The absolute error associated with AOD assessment was less than 0.15. A statistical analysis teas also conducted to evaluate the atmospheric correction method. Based on data from the FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment) experiment, the absolute error between ground measurements and TM reflectance was less than 0.015 in the visible channels, and less than 0.08 in the near-infrared channel.

AB Monitoring functioning of forest ecosystems with remote sensing depends on canopy BRF (bidirectional reflectance function) sensitivity to biophysical parameters and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) regime. Here, we studied the 3-D PAR regime of tropical (Sumatra) and boreal (Canada) forests, with the DART (dis crete anisotropic radiative transfer) model. We considered rc;ide ranges of Sun off-nadir angles (theta(s)), leaf area index (LAI), and leaf clumping. The BRF of these forests is analyzed in a companion article. Here, we also investigated the possibility to derive simple analytical expressions of PAR vertical profiles: We fitted DART simulated PAR (absorbed PAR) profiles with a modified Goudriaan late; (1977) the extinction coefficient of which is multiplied by a factor a that accounts for canopy architecture. Similarly to BRF, the PAR regime is very influenced by canopy structure: for theta(s)=50 degrees, a approximate to 0.40 for tropical forest, a approximate to 0.56 for coniferous boreal forest (OBS), and a approximate to 0.86 for deciduous boreal forest (OA). Moreover, a strongly depends on theta(s) and LAI for example, for tropical forest a decreases from 0.44 to 0.12 if theta(s) varies from 0 degrees to 80 degrees, and from 0.70 to 0.38 if LAI increases from 3 to 10. a decreases slightly with the increase of leaf clumpiness. The NDVI of tropical and boreal forest sites was rather related to the LAI and fAPAR of the upper canopy than to those of total canopy. Finally, we studied the impact of forest architecture on canopy photosynthesis with the coupling of DART with a leaf functioning model. Neglect of architecture can lend to errors as large as 25% in relative on forest CO2 assimilation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB As a part of North American Landscape Characterization (NALC) project, 75 change-detection techniques and variations were systematically tested and evaluated using both visual and statistical methods. These change-detection experiments were conducted in the Washington, D.C. region using a standard NALC Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data set. While more testing of the NALC data is needed in geographically diversified regions, our initial results suggest that the automated scatter-gram controlled regression normalized image differencing and normalized difference vegetation index differencing outperform most other change-detection techniques. These techniques are worthy of further testing and of large-scale applications for NALC data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The concept and description of a remote sensing aerosol monitoring network initiated by NASA, de;eloped to support NASA, CNES, and NASDA's Earth satellite systems under the name AERONET and expanded by national and international collaboration, is described. Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75% of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90% in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database.

AB This article introduces the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation which is based on the established canonical correlations analysis. It also proposes using postprocessing of the change detected by the MAD variate using maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) analysis. The MAD and the combined MAF/MAD transformations are invariant to linear scaling. Therefore, they are insensititve, for example, differences in gain settings in a measuring device, or to linear radiometric and atmospheric correction schemes. Other multivariate change detection schemes described are principal component type analyses of simple difference images. Case studies with AHVRR and Landsat MSS data using simple linear stretching and masking of the change images show the usefulness of the new MAD and MAF/MAD change detection schemer. Ground truth observations confirm the detected changes. A simple simulation of a no-change situation shows the accuracy of the MAD and MAF/MAD transformations compared to principal components based methods. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1988.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) currently may be derived from remotely sensed data with limited accuracy. This research addresses the need for increased accuracy in the estimation of LAI through integration of texture to the relationship between LAI and vegetation indices. The inclusion of texture, which acts as a surrogate for forest structure, to the relationship between LAI and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased the accuracy of modeled LAI estimates. First-order, second-order, and a newly developed semivariance moment texture are assessed in the relationship with LAI. The ability to increase the accuracy of LAI estimates was demonstrated over a range of forest species, densities, closures, tolerances, and successional regimes. Initial assessment of LAI from spectral response over the full range of stand types demonstrated the need for stratification by stand type prior to analysis. Stratification of the stands based upon species types yields an improvement in the regression relationships. For example, deciduous hardwood stands, spanning an LAI range from approximate to 1.5 to 7, have a moderate initial bivariate relationship between LAI and NDVI at an r(2) of 0.42. Inclusion of additional texture statistics to the multivariate relationship between LAI and NDVI further increases the amount of variation accounted for, to an R-2 of 0.61, which represents an increase in ability to estimate hardwood forest LAI from remotely sensed imagery by approximately 20% with the inclusion of texture. Mixed forest stands, which are spectrally diverse, had an insignificant initial r(2) of 0.01 between LAI and NDVI, which improved to a significant R-2 of 0.44 with the inclusion of semivariance moment texture.

ID LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS; MICHIGAN; MODELS; RADAR
AB A significant large-scale question in ecology and earth systems science pertains to the amount of carbon (C) stored in terrestrial vegetation. In this paper, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based methodology is developed and evaluated for quantification of several key vegetative C components-both natural and human induced-of the northern forest. Specifically, the methodology provides estimates of C stored in living forest vegetation, above-ground C gain from annual growth (aboveground net primary productivity, or ANPP), and C removal due to managed forest disturbance in the form of clear-cutting. The inputs are shuttle imaging radar (SIR)-C/X-SAR-derived terrain classifications, SIR-C/X-SAR-derived biomass estimation, and allometric relations and equations developed for the northern hardwood and conifer forest in general and from local test stand data. Results are mapped quantitatively in the image domain for above-ground C storage, below-ground C storage, above- to below-ground ratios, total C in living woody vegetation, and forest absolute and relative ANPP rates. Numeric estimates also are extracted from each of these in tabular form; for example, results show that the forested parts of the sampled area contain 2.73X10(9) kg of aboveground C and 4.86X10(8) kg of below-ground C in 51,448 ha. When combined with a SAR-derived classification, similar quantifications can be extracted for each of the several forest communities present in the region. Estimates of forest ANPP show that it ranges from 0.5 kg/m(2)/yr of biomass to 2.7 kg/m(2)/yr in the test site, with an average of 1.09 kg/m(2)/yr. Estimation of C removal due to clear-cutting is done by suing multidate classifications of SAR imagery and a procedure including image differencing and decision rules. Clear-cuts that were made between SIR-C/X-SAR Shuttle Radar Laboratory (SRL)-1 (April) and SRL-2 (October) are identified by differencing the classified imagery. When combined with the SAR-derived biomass image, results show that an estimated 300 ha of forest with 6.02X10(6) kg of C were removed in this 6-month period. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
AB Monitoring regional and global changes in agricultural land use requires coarse spatial resolution imagery in order to keep data volumes reasonable and to allow sufficiently frequent temporal coverage. The viability of coarse spatial resolution data for monitoring the status of agricultural lands is evaluated using degraded multitemporal TM imagery. Areal estimates of productive land in Egypt's Western Desert are slightly underestimated at spatial resolutions of 120 m ad 240 m. Although error increases at 480 m and 960 m, estimates are within 10% of the original 30-m estimations. The area of old agricultural lands is more accurately estimated while reclaimed lands (cultivated after June 1985) show greater underestimation errors. These results suggest that the areal extent of these lands can be estimated accurately using multitemporal data with intermediary spatial resolutions such as the 250 m Bands 1 and 2 of the upcoming MODIS instrument. While overall map accuracies are good, the location of the reclaimed lands are poorly mapped. Fine spatial resolution data will still be needed to map the location of the fields. Also, the multitemporal maximum NDVI threshold differentiating productive and non-productive lands, identified in the original TM data, is relatively stable across the four coarse resolutions tested.

AB Seven Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) scenes in central Africa were coregistered with 8 km resolution data from the 1987 AVHRR Pathfinder Land data set. Percent forest cover in each 8 km grid cell was derived from the classified MSS scenes. Linear relationships between percent forest cover and 30 multitemporal metrics derived from all AVHRR optical and thermal channels were determined Correlations were strongest for the mean annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mean annual brightness temperature (AVHRR Channel 3) and weakest for those metrics, besides NDVI, based on near-infrared reflectances (AVHRR Channel 2). The relationships were used to estimate percent forest cover in various locations in the study area using multiple linear regression and regression trees. Overall, the multiple linear regression provided more accurate results. Predicted percent forest cover estimates were within 20% of the ''actual'' percent forest cover (derived front the MSS data) for approximately 90% of the grid cells. The RMS error for the prediction was 12% forest cover. RMS errors above 18% forest cover were obtained when using AVHRR data from a single month to derive predictive relationships. The results demonstrate that multitemporal data reflecting vegetation phenology can be used to estimate subpixel forest cover at coarse spatial resolutions. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID INDEXES; COVER
AB Soil erosion is very dependent on the protection effect of residue cover. We investigated hew remote sensing could be used to estimate the crop residue cover fraction. Laboratory reflectance measurements performed over corn residues in various moisture level show that, for any two wave bands, a residue line similar to that for bare soils can be defined. However it depends on the aging state of the residues, particularly in the near-infrared and middle-infrared domains. Field reflectance measurements performed over a range of crop cover fraction and soil backgrounds shore that a linear mixing model accurately describes the reflectance of the soil residue complex.
   An algorithm called CRIM (crop residue index multiband) is proposed. It is based on the linear mixing model of the soil-residue complex and on soil and residue lines. It can be used with any set of wave bands. Comparison with field measurements performed in Thematic Mapper (TM) bands TM2, TM3, TM3, TM4, and TM5 shows reasonably good estimates of the crop residue cover fraction compared with previously proposed indices (Normalized Difference Index and Soil Adjusted Corn Residue Index). The GRIM is a linear algorithm that is resistant to any linear transforms of the reflectance. It can therefore be used with ground-level reflectance, satellite radiance, or digital counts and should not strongly depend on view or sun geometry or on the spatial scale.
   The conditions for the GRIM computation and limits of its use are discussed. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID SATELLITE DATA; CLASSIFICATION
AB The concept of a vegetation vector has been developed to better visualize and characterize land-cover at regional scales. The vegetation vector is derived from long time-series multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data sets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) by means of principal component analysis (PCA). The vegetation vector can characterize vegetation cover based upon both the spatial variation of the magnitude of NDVI and the seasonal variation of NDVI. The PCA study showed that the area under analysis must exhibit a variety of dissimilar vegetation communities in terms of density and phenology to successfully derive these two factors. When the PCA was applied to the entire state of Arizona, these two factors were derived as the first two principal components (PCs). However, when the PCA was applied to subset areas extracted from the entire study area by overlaying a vegetation map compiled through bioclimatological and ecological studies, the first two PCs did not always represent these two factors. This indicated that these two factors were not always the major cause of variation in NDVI for some vegetation communities. In this study the vegetation vector was constructed utilizing the first two PCs derived from the entire study area. Analysis of histograms of the direction of the vegetation vector for each community found in the vegetation map could be used to characterize most of the communities in terms of photosynthetic activity and phenology. A profile of the histogram could be interpreted as characteristic of the community. In addition, the range exhibited by the histogram could be used as a measure of the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the community based upon photosynthetic activity and phenology. Graphical projection of the mean vegetation vectors could be used to visualize characteristics and relationships between communities. The position of the plot represents the mean characteristics of the community. The difference in the mean vegetation vector between communities represents the similarity/dissimilarity of the characteristic between communities. These techniques represent a simple means of visualizing many vegetation communities and should facilitate characterizing land cover at global scales. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB Several studies have confirmed that the radiometric calibration of AVHRR instruments changes following launch, and drifts over time. These changes cause spurious trends to appear in NDVI data that confound the reliable detection of vegetation change. It has previously been established that approximate additive corrections can be applied to an entire NDVI image, if the postlaunch calibration coefficients are known. However the results of postlaunch calibration studies published in the literature vary, leading to different NDVI corrections depending on which coefficients are used. We acquired ten years (1981-1991) of monthly NDVI images covering Western Australia (Latitude 13 degrees S to 36 degrees S) in which the NDVI had been derived using prelaunch calibration coefficients. To address the calibration issue, we have computed theoretical corrections to the NDVI based on the prelaunch coefficients used to compute the NDVI in our data set, and postlaunch calibration coefficients reported by Che and Price (1992) and kauffman and Holben (1993). Large differences were found in the NDVI corrections, depending on which set of postlaunch calibrations was adopted. To resolve the differences, we assumed that the entire image was a seasonally invariant target, and that the trend in the mean NDVI time series was solely due to changes in sensor calibration. The results obtained using this ''time series'' approach agreed with those computed in theoretical simulations using the calibration coefficients of Kaufman and Holben (1993). It is concluded that the time series technique described in this article can be used to remove sensor-induced trends from a time series of NDVI data without any knowledge of the postlaunch calibration coefficients. To apply the time series calibration technique, the dates of any changes in the sensor prelaunch calibration coefficients (including changes in the satellite platform) must be known. No other information is necessary, offering a significant advantage over existing methods for users of NDVI time series image data.

AB The evaluation and prediction of changes in carbon dynamics at the ecosystem level is a key issue in studies of global change. An operational concept for the determination of carbon fluxes for the Belgian territory is the goal of the presented study. The approach is based on the integration of remotely sensed data into ecosystem models in order to evaluate photosynthetic assimilation and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Remote sensing can be developed as an operational tool to determine the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR). A review of the methodological approach of mapping fPAR dynamics at the regional scale by means of NOAA11-AVHRR/2 data for the year 1990 is given. The processing sequence from raw radiance values to fPAR is presented. An interesting aspect of incorporating remote sensing derived fPAR in ecosystem models is the potential for modeling actual as opposed to potential vegetation. Further work should prove whether the concepts presented and the assumptions made in this study are valid.

TI Classification of ASAS multiangle and multispectral measurements using
   artificial neural networks
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

ID ART
AB Because the anisotropy of the Earth's surface reflectance is strongly influenced by vegetation cover, multidirectional remotely sensed data can be highly effective in discriminating among Land cover classes. This article explores the use of multiangle and multispectral data from the Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) in land cover mapping using artificial neural networks. A multilayer feed-forward neural network is trained to identify five land cover classes in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Multiangle data achieve 89% of accuracy when applied to a single band (774-790 nm), 7-directional imagery and 88% accuracy when applied to multispectral nadir data. Analysis of error using the confusion matrix indicates that the higher classification accuracy is obtained primarily for three classes: deciduous forest, wetlands, and water. The results suggest that 1) directional radiance measurements contain much useful information for discrimination among land cover classes, 2) the incorporation of more than one spectral multiangle band improves the overall classification accuracy compared to a single multiangle band, and 3) neural networks can successfully learn class discriminations from directional radiance data and/or multidomain data.

TI Applicability of airborne profiling radar to forest inventory
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID 8-CHANNEL RANGING SCATTEROMETER; LASER DATA; SYSTEM
AB In this work the applicability of airborne profiling radar to forest inventory was studied in detail. The radar stand profiles were collected by using a helicopter-borne ranging scatterometer, HUTSCAT (Helsinki University of Technology SCATterometer), which can probe the forest canopy from the top to the bottom due to its ranging capability. Several radar variables were analyzed from stand profiles, and compared with field-measured characteristics of 20 m by 20 m sample plots, by applying multivariate data analysis methods. It was shown that mean and dominant height, height of the crown base line, and stem volume per hectare can be obtained with good accuracy. Furthermore, the ranging radar can measure mean and dominant tree heights more accurately than is usually obtained with conventional field measurements. As possible direct application, it is proposed that radar measurements would be employed with helicopter-borne ocular inventories in order to improve the estimation accuracy and to speed up the measurements.

AB A new structural image-texture technique, termed the triangulated primitive neighborhood method (TPN), is employed to investigate the variable spatial characteristics of high-resolution forest objects, as modeled by a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager data set. Based on current psychophysical texture theory, this technique incorporates location-specific primitives and a variable-sized and shaped moving kernel to automatically provide object- and area-specific regularized images. These object-rich, but variance-reduced images allow a traditional classifier to be used on a complex high-resolution forest data set with improved accuracy. The robustness of this technique is evaluated by comparing the maximum likelihood classification accuracy of nine forest classes generated from a combination of the grey level cooccurrence matrix method, semivariance, and customized filters, against those derived from the TPN method. By including into the classification scheme an object-specific channel that models crown density, the highest overall classification accuracy (78 %) from all techniques is achieved with the TPN method.

ID BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; SPECTRAL RESPONSE; LANDSAT DATA
AB An investigation is made of the errors induced in the normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI) by topographic variation. The Advanced RAdiometric RAy Tracer (ARARAT) is used to simulate AVHRR imagery for various viewing and illumination conditions at 1.1-km and 50-m resolution. Topographic error is calculated as the difference between the variable terrain simulation and a flat plane simulation. Correlation between this error and various topographic factors such as shadowing and adjacement hill illumination are examined. The importance of sky occlusion as a topographic factor is highlighted. While topographic errors of 13.5% are found in the 50-m resolution simulations, these errors are reduced markedly in the 1.1-km dataset to approximately 3%.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AVHRR; FIFE
AB Although orbits of the NOAA TIROS-N satellites are designed to be sun-synchronous, epheremis data shows that the afternoon, ascending node satellites currently cross the equator hours later than they did upon launch. This delay results in different illumination conditions for measurements made by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The effects of illumination on two standard AVHRR products-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and sea surface temperature (SST)-are modeled here. Combining orbital data with model results, the effects of the NOAA-II orbital drift on NDVI are quantitatively assessed for three earth targets: an equatorial Africa site (0 degrees N), the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) site (39 degrees N), and the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) site (55 degrees N). Top-of-atmosphere NDVI corrections for solar zenith angle are developed for a dense, deciduous forest. Orbital drift effects on SST are given for an equatorial site. Although results vary with season, latitude, atmosphere and time since launch, NDVI differences of up to 0.23 and SST differences of up to 0.5 K may occur due strictly to orbital drift.

AB SSM/I and AVHRR sea ice mapping capabilities are analyzed using Antarctic data acquired during November 1990 over the Ross Sea. Quantitative comparisons between sea ice concentrations obtained from SSMI/I and AVHRR data show differences of -10% to + 50% with average differences between. 9% and 17%. These differences are mainly attributed to: a) sea ice reflectance and emissivity spatial variations occurring during the melting season, which reduce the accuracy of concentrations obtained with global tie points, and b) colocation inaccuracy between SSMI/I and AVHRR grids.

AB Bidirectional reflectances for a pecan orchard have been studied using Advanced Solid-state Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) data acquired in the solar principal plane and perpendicular to it at altitudes of 2300 m and 5300 m above ground. In particular, the angular dependency of the bidirectional reflectance of two targets, sunlit portions of the Pecan tree and composite (tree crowns and orchard floor), have been studied for viewing directions between -45-degrees and +45-degrees. The results generally indicate an increasing reflectance from the forward scattering direction to the backscattering direction for image sequences acquired in the solar principal plane and a symmetrical behavior about nadir with decreasing reflectance towards the extreme viewing angles for site passes perpendicular to the solar principal plane. These off-nadir effects vary with solar zenith angle, target type (composition and structure), and spatial scale. The largest variations were usually observed in the backscatter directions. It was also found that a combination of these factors, especially with the target characteristics, had a significant impact on the surface's bidirectional reflectance. In addition, these reflectance changes are wavelength-dependent, with the largest difference in relative reflectance occuring between the visible and infrared bands. In general, the overall behavior of the bidirectional reflectance derived from airborne data follows the trends observed in ground-based investigations.

AB A simple algorithm to retrieve soil moisture and vegetation water content from passive microwave measurements is analyzed in this study. The approach is based on a zeroth-order solution of the radiative transfer equations in a vegetation layer. In this study, the single scattering albedo accounts for scattering effects and two parameters account for the dependence of the optical thickness on polarization, incidence angle, and frequency. The algorithm requires only ancillary information about crop type and surface temperature. Retrievals of the surface parameters from two radiometric data sets acquired over a soybean and a wheat crop have been attempted. The model parameters have been fitted in order to achieve best match between measured and retrieved surface data. The results of the inversion are analyzed for different configurations of the radiometric observations: one or several look angles, L-band, C-band or (L-band and C-band). Sensitivity of the retrievals to the best fit values of the model parameters has also been investigated The best configurations, requiring simultaneous measurements at L- and C-band, produce retrievals of soil moisture and biomass with a 15% estimated precision (about 0.06 m(3)/m(3) for soil moisture and 0.3 kg/m(2) for biomass) and exhibit a limited sensitivity to the best fit parameters.

ID ARCTIC LEADS; EXCHANGE; SCALE
AB The release of heat from sea ice fractures (''leads'') is an important component of the heat budget in the Arctic, but their impact on regional scale climate is difficult to assess without more information on their distribution in both space and time. Remote sensing of leads using satellite data, specifically AVHRR thermal and Landsat visible-band imagery, is examined empirically with respect to lead width, orientation, and area fraction. The geometrical aspects of the sensor are simulated so that of sensor field-of-view on retrieved lead width statistics can be assessed. This is done using Landsat data and simulated lead networks degraded to AVHRR pixel sizes. The analyses illustrate how leads of sufficiently high contrast tend to ''grow'' with increasing pixel size and how small or low contrast leads disappear. The relationship between lead contrast and the width/field-of-view ratio is also examined in order to determine the limits of lead detectability, and illustrates the multivalued nature of the problem of lead width retrieval. To help quantify the importance of changes in lead statistics, turbulent heat flux is calculated as a function of lead width and lead fraction. It is shown that pixel size has a substantial effect on estimates of turbulent heat transfer from leads to the atmosphere.

AB Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is an active sensing technique capable of capturing immediate and specific indications of changes in plant physiology and metabolism as they relate to the concentration and photosynthetic activity of the plant pigments. Reflectance is a passive sensing technique that can capture differences in the concentration of the primary plant pigments. Fluorescence and reflectance were compared for their ability to measure levels of plant stress that are of agronomic importance in corn (Zea mays L.) crops. Laboratory LIF and reflectance spectra were made on excised leaves from field grown corn. Changes in the visible region of the spectrum were compared between groups of plants fertilized with seven different levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. A pulsed nitrogen laser emitting photons at a wavelength of 337 nm was used as a fluorescence excitation source. Differences in maximum intensity of fluorescence occurred at 440 nm, 525 nm, 685 nm, and 740 nm. Significant separations were found between levels of N fertilization at several LIF wavelength ratios. Several reflectance algorithms also produced significant separations between certain levels of N fertilization.

AB The spatially averaged reflectance of partially vegetated land surface can be modeled as an area-weighted mixture of the reflectances of different components or classes of objects (plants, shadow) on a background (soil, grass). We sampled the spectral reflectance of the shaded and unshaded components of Chihuahuan desert plant communities (shrubs, soil, subshrubs, and perennial grasses) in the SPOT wavebands using a hand-held radiometer. We examined the mean reflectance differences between components to evaluate their spectral separability. Shrub canopy and shaded components have similar reflectance in the visible wavebands. However, in the near-infrared band, which is strongly scattered by green plant canopies, the shaded canopy and shaded background components were similar to each other and lower than either sunlit background or sunlit canopy. When reflectance measurements were transformed to normalized ratio (NDVI, SAVI) and orthogonal green vegetation indices, the shaded and sunlit portions of each component (canopy and soil) were similar but the shaded components were intermediate between their sunlit counterparts. Different soil types and plant species with different life forms (e.g., shrubs, grasses) and phenologies exhibited different reflectance characteristics. However the broadband reflectances of the three dominant shrub species were similar at the end of the growing season, in spite of their differences in morphology.

TI MODELING BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE OF MULTICOMPONENT VEGETATION CANOPIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LEAF CANOPIES; SCATTERING; TRANSPORT
AB By combining geometrical optics and transport theory, a bidirectional reflectance model for multicomponent vegetation canopies is explicitly developed in this article. A precise expression of the overlap function, is derived for vertically cylindric phytoelements randomly distributed in the canopy, and a mathematical model for describing the vertical distribution of leaf area density is presented and fitted with measured data. In addition, the size, shape, orientation, and nonrandom distribution of leaves and vertical inhomogeneity of the canopy are properly taken into account in this model. The model also reproduces the measured distributions of reflectance from a wheat canopy quite well. The significant effect of stems on the canopy reflectance is identified by comparison with the result of the corresponding leaf canopy model. The results of sensitivity analysis prove that, even for crop canopies like wheat in this study, the influence of stems cannot be neglected if the ratio of stem silhouette area to the total foliage area is greater than 10%. Since this multicomponent model is a hybrid one, it could serve as a primary model to develop more accurate reflectance model for inhomogeneous vegetation canopies, such as forest, in further studies.

AB Spatial dependence is a fundamental structure of spatial data that can be readily measured. Change in landscapes can be monitored effectively using measures of spatial dependence. Scale of fluctuation analysis estimates the dimensional extent to which data are significantly autocorrelated by observing the behavior of sample variance under extended local averaging. Algorithms to estimate the one-dimensional scale of fluctuation (correlation length) and two-dimensional scale fluctuation (correlation area) in image data are described. The approach is demonstrated with an analysis of a 9-year TM image series of a tallgrass prairie preserve, Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, to assess the impact of bison on the spatial patterning of vegetation.

AB A linear mixing model is used to model the spectral variability Of an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) scene from the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada and calibrate these radiance data to reflectance. Five spectral endmembers from the AVIRIS data, plus an ideal ''shade'' endmember were required to model the continuum reflectance of each pixel in the image. Three of the endmembers were interpreted to model the surface constituents green vegetation, dry grass, and illumination. These are the main transient surface constituents that are expected to change with shifts in land use or climatic influences and viewing conditions (''shade'' only). The spectral distinction between the other three endmembers is very small, yet the spatial distributions are coherent and interpretable. These distributions cross anthropogenic and vegetation boundaries and are best interpreted as different soil types. Comparison of the fraction images to the bedrock geology maps indicates that substrate composition must be a factor contributing to the spectral properties Of these endmembers. Detailed examination of the reflectance spectra of the three soil endmembers reveals that differences in the amount of ferric and ferrous iron and/or organic constituents in the soils is largely responsible for the differences in spectral properties of these endmembers.

TI INTERPRETATION OF SAR IMAGERY OF THE GREENLAND ICE-SHEET USING
   COREGISTERED TM IMAGERY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images are coregistered with a Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image of the margin of the Greenland ice sheet and used in the interpretation of features in the SAR data. A winter TM image is used to provide topographic information while a summer TM image provides information on the pattern of melt and the location of lakes. Many previous hypotheses are confirmed, and some are rejected. It is shown that: 1) The snow line is easily detectable in SAR imagery; 2) areas of higher radar backscatter in the bare-ice zone most Often correspond to areas full of crevasses too small to resolve in the SAR image; 3) subsurface scattering causes significant blurring of features in SAR imagery; 4) the band of surface lakes occurring above the snow line corresponds to at least a portion of the wet-snow zone, 5) water is the cause of reduced radar backscatter above the snow line; and 6) the fact that water causes reduced radar backscatter above the snow line permits the use of backscatter variations as a proxy indicator Of surface topography in snow-covered regions experiencing melt.

AB Reflectance factors and biophysical plant measurements for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) experiments conducted at Lubbock, Texas, Manhattan, Kansas, Phoenix, Arizona, Sidney, Montana, and Weslaco, Texas were fit by various equation forms for six currently used vegetation indices (VI): n-space greenness (GVI), perpendicular (PVI), NIR/RED ratio (RVI), soil adjusted (SAVI2), normalized difference (NDVI), and transformed soil adjusted (TSAVI). The objective was to produce relations from the data pooled across all locations that could be recommended for general use for wheat. Data were analyzed by premaximum leaf area (pre-L(max)), post-maximum leaf area (post-L(max)), and whole season portions of the growing season. Leaf area index (L) was best estimated from RVI and TSAVI by linear equations, from NDVI and TSAVI by exponential equations, and from the orthogonal indices GVI and PVI equally well by power and quadratic equation forms. These equation forms gave coefficients of determination (R2) that ranged from 0.72 to 0. 86, and root mean square errors (RMSE) in estimating L that ranged from 0.63 to 0.90 across locations and measurements that differed in soils, sun angles, cultivars, agronomic treatments, and radiometers. The single best equation form for estimating L from VI across all VI was the power form. The orthogonal indices GVI and PVI were more responsive to canopy architecture than the ratio vegetation indices, and GVI ranked as the best single index. Equations for estimating fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR)from VI given herein agree well with empirical and semitheoretical equations and their coefficients found in the literature. Our results demonstrate the robustness of vegetation indices across experiment variables and measurement conditions, and provide general functional relations that should be useful for wheat.

AB Different methods for estimating land surface temperature for NOAA satellites data are presented.  All these methods use the infrared channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).  The single channel method using radiosounding data and a radiative transfer model is compared to the split window method and to other methods using additional High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) data.  The results show the superiority of the split window method when the spectral variation of the surface emissivity between the two channels 4 and 5 of the AVHRR is negligible.

AB Absorption and fluorescence changes of yellow substance in the presence of pH and heavy metal excursions were examined for water samples collected in the deltaic area of the Po river (Sacca di Goro) and for solutions of natural humic and fulvic acids isolated from lake waters and podsol soils, respectively.  An important effect on the light absorption and induced fluorescence was found for the pH variations that occur during the mixing of fresh and saline waters.  For this reason, correction factors are required to normalize the absorption and fluorescence values for use in remote-sensing water quality of estuarine / coastal areas.  If the factor is chosen to equal 1 at pH 7, the percentage error in the uncorrected estimate of the yellow substance absorption varies from 0% to 18% with a mean of 5% relative to a set of samples collected in Sacca di Goro.  Among the heavy metals Cu2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+ present as pollutants in trace levels in estuarine environments, only Cu2+ and Pb2+ in high concentration (> 15-mu-g/L for Pb and > 10-mu-g/L for Cu) have been found to depress the induced fluorescence response of water samples containing yellow substance and humic acid solutions.

AB The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Habitats Directive aim to improve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Both policies require enormous monitoring, which can be facilitated by remote sensing. Use intensity, measured by mowing frequency is an important indicator of biodiversity in permanent grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing can be determined using satellite remote sensing because photosynthetically active biomass changes rapidly in response to mowing. However, the rapid regrowth of grasses requires very dense satellite time series for reliable detection. Radar time series can complement optical time series and fill in cloud-related gaps to overcome this problem. Additional weather data can support the detection of grassland mowing events, as mowing events are associated with specific meteorological conditions. However, previous studies have not fully exploited both potentials or different machine learning approaches for mowing event detection.This study presents a new transferable two-step approach to detect grassland mowing events using combined optical and SAR data and additional weather data. First, we filled cloud-related gaps in optical time series using a supervised machine learning regression with optical and SAR data. We then classified time series sequences of optical, SAR and weather data into mown and unmown using four different machine learning algorithms. We used time series of NDVI and EVI (combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), SAR backscatter, six-day interferometric coherence, backscatter radar vegetation index, backscatter cross-ratio (Sentinel-1), and temperature and precipitation sums. Our test sites are distributed across Germany and cover the entire gradient of grassland use intensities.Mowing events could be detected with F1 values of up to 89%, first cut with up to 94%. Our results show no structural advantage of infilling time series with machine learning over linearly interpolated time series. The combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time series provided dense time series with mostly median gaps less than 20 days, which proved sufficient to reliably detect mowing events. SAR data were not essential for mowing event detection in our study, but weather data improved classification results for models trained on all areas and years. However, when the model was transferred to unknown years or areas that were not used for training, SAR data improved detection accuracy, whereas weather data degrade it. Models trained on all years but not all study sites detected mowing events with an accuracy of up to F1 = 76%. Models trained with all regions but not all years detected mowing events in untrained years with F1 up to 80%.

AB The simultaneous remote estimation of biogeochemical parameters (BPs) and inherent optical properties (IOPs) from hyperspectral satellite imagery of globally distributed optically distinct inland and coastal waters is a complex, unsolved, non-unique inverse problem. To tackle this problem, we leverage a machine-learning model termed Mixture Density Networks (MDNs). MDNs outperform operational algorithms by calculating the covariance between the simultaneously estimated products. We train the MDNs on a large (N = 8237) dataset of co-aligned, in situ measured, hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), BPs, and absorbing IOPs from globally representative optically distinct inland and coastal waters. The estimated IOPs include absorption due to phytoplankton (a(ph)), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(cdom)), and non-algal particles (a(nap)). The estimated BPs include chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and phycocyanin (PC). MDNs dramatically reduce uncertainty in the retrievals, relative to operational algorithms, when using a 50/50 dataset split, where the MDNs are trained on a randomly selected half of the in situ dataset and validated on the other half. Our model is shown to have higher, or equivalent, generalization performance than the calculated operational algorithms available for all BPs and IOPs (except PC) via a leave-one-out cross-validation assessment. The MDNs are sensitive to uncertainties in the hyperspectral satellite R-rs, resulting from instrument noise and atmospheric correction; there is a difference of similar to 37.4-62.8% (using median symmetric accuracy) between the MDNs' estimates derived from co-located satellite-derived R-rs and in situ R-rs. Of the IOPs, acdom and anap are less sensitive to uncertainties in hyperspectral satellite imagery relative to aph, with remote estimates of a(ph) exhibiting incorrect spectral shape and magnitude relative to in situ measured IOPs. Despite the uncertainties in satellite derived R-rs, the spatial distributions of BPs and IOPs in MDN-derived product maps of Lake Erie and the Curonian Lagoon, based on imagery taken with the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), are confirmed via co-aligned in situ measurements and agree with the literature's understanding of these well-studied regions. The consistency and accuracy of the model on HICO and PRISMA imagery, despite radiometric uncertainties, demonstrate its applicability to future hyperspectral missions, such as the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, where the simultaneous estimation model will serve as a key part of phytoplankton community composition analysis.

AB The great Zhangbei-Bohai fault (ZBF) is an important seismic active zone in Northeastern China, which intersects with another great fault, namely Tancheng-Lujiang fault (TLF), in the Central Bohai Sea. Most of the previous studies only investigated the earthquakes (EQs) happened in the west section of ZBF and anomalies appeared in the land area, but few researchers focused on the EQs happened in the east section of ZBF and studied the anomalies appeared above the Bohai Sea. Recently, we have investigated the disturbances on and above the Bohai Sea associated with the Zhangbei Mb5.6 EQ in 1998, whose epicenter located in the west section of ZBF, and found that there was seismicity induced gas release from submarine TLF. To study further the multiparameter anomalies of EQs near ZBF during past decades and their relationship with ZBF and TLF, a scrutiny strategy for seismic anomaly in the sea area was proposed in this study. After comprehensive screening of EQs occurred near ZBF from 1998 to 2022 using multi-source remote sensing data, potential seismic anomalies including the anomalies of microwave brightness temperature and sea surface roughness on Bohai Sea were found correlated with 6 of the 23 investigated EQs, and there were commonly anomalies of CO and CH4 concentration in the atmosphere. All these seismic anomalies were found developing mainly along the TLF in Bohai Sea, and started usually before shocking, appeared co-seismically and in the next few days. Regional inconsistencies among the distribution of CO and CH4 anomalies could be owning to the specific underwater reservoir in the Bohai Bay Basin. Though analyzing the focal mechanism solutions of the selected EQ cases, we found that the seismic anomaly existed only when the TLF was in a stress state of tensile relaxation.

AB Traditional satellite-based detection of dawn sea fog/low stratus (SFLS) is difficult because of the weak reflec-tivity in the visible at low solar elevation angles and the contamination of the reflected sunlight in the mid-infrared. Here, based on single geostationary satellite measurements acquired by China's Fengyun 4A (FY-4A), we propose a dawn SFLS detection algorithm using the joint Fully Convolutional Network and Conditional Random Field (FCN-CRF), which are well known for image semantic segmentation under low contrast conditions. We train the FCN-CRF detection algorithm using FY-4A measurements over the Yellow Sea, where some dawn SFLS events are long-lived, providing relatively time-invariant dawn SFLS samples for training. We design a SFLS labelling technique using the satellite observations before and after dawn to train the FCN-CRF detection for dawn SFLS. A test against buoy visibility observations shows that the FCN-CRF detection is able to detect dawn SFLS with satisfactory accuracy, with a probability of detection (POD) of 84.9%, a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 8.7%, a critical success index (CSI) of 78.5% and a hit rate score (HR) of 87.4%.

AB In preparation for active microwave-based data assimilation into a crop modeling system, the mapping of daily 1-km AquaCrop model (v6.1) biomass and surface soil moisture to backscatter was optimised, using two forward operators, i.e. the Water Cloud Model (WCM) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). Both forward operators were calibrated (2014-2018) with 1-km Sentinel-1 backscatter (gamma degrees) observations in VV and VH polarisation, for three different study domains in Europe. For the validation period (2019-2021), the gamma degrees simulations showed reasonable performances around Czech Republic and the Iberian Peninsula, to good performances over Belgium, but with strong variations within each domain. The domain-averaged root mean square difference between the model and Sentinel-1 gamma degrees remained below 2 dB for both forward operators and all three study domains, and the mean bias for VV remained close to 0 dB, and close 0.5 dB for the VH polarisation. The WCM and SVR performed better in VV than VH and overall the SVR performed slightly better in mapping the AquaCrop soil moisture and vegetation to backscatter than the WCM. Additionally, the assumed linear relationship in the WCM between soil moisture and soil gamma degrees holds better for VV than for VH. The remaining differences between WCM or SVR simu-lations and Sentinel-1 observations are mainly caused by AquaCrop model errors.

AB A simple geometric-optical model is used to show that shadow in optical remote sensing imagery contains information about surface roughness. The use of MODIS albedo products for the purpose of estimating surface roughness so that these products may aid in dust emission modeling has been proposed in previous studies (Chappell et al. 2010; Chappell and Webb 2016; Chappell et al. 2018). This approach is evaluated through geometric-optical modeling and by analysis of existing MODIS data. Little support is found for the utility of this approach for dust emission modeling. However, because there is clearly information about surface roughness in optical satellite imagery, some suggestions for the proper use of optical data to estimate surface roughness are made.

TI Surface Biology and Geology imaging spectrometer: A case study to
   optimize the mission design using intrinsic dimensionality
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB The information content that can be derived from spectroscopic imagery tends to increase with finer ground sampling distance, finer spectral sampling, more frequent revisit, and higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, these parameters are not independent, and it is thus impossible to design a space-borne imaging spectrometer to maximize all of them simultaneously. We present an instrument model and simulation environment that enable us to find the optimal combination of these four mission design parameters, using intrinsic dimensionality (ID) as the metric. ID is the size of the signal subspace - the maximum degrees of freedom when noise can be disregarded - and is a metric that is independent of any one particular algorithm or application area. This study is important for upcoming missions such as NASA's Earth System Observatory mission to study the Earth's Surface Biology and Geology (SBG), which will comprise a visible to shortwave infrared spectrometer in addition to a multi-channel thermal radiometer on a separate platform. When evaluating a desert site and a tropical forested site, we find that spectral resolution drives information content, with a significant drop in normalized ID (15-45% decrease) when simulating 15 nm spectral sampling as opposed to 10 nm spectral sampling. However, there was some variation between sites, with the forested site benefiting from 5 nm spectral sampling, whereas the desert site had poorer results at this resolution, due to the impact on noise. At 10 nm spectral sampling, ground sampling distances in the range 30-50 m provided the optimal balance between spatial resolution and SNR, although more frequent revisit, potentially by combining data from multiple missions, would maximize total information content.

AB Pelagic Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean is an important habitat for marine animals, yet frequent and massive beaching events around the Caribbean Sea have caused many problems. Currently, both retrospective assessment and near real-time monitoring over synoptic scales rely on medium-resolution multi-band satellite imagery and algorithms based on the alternative floating algae index (AFAI) or its alternatives. Despite the success in assessing long-term bloom patterns and providing synoptic information in near real-time, two weaknesses still exist: 1) due to spatial resolution limitations and optical complexity from the ocean, there are often false positive detection in nearshore waters (up to 30 km from shoreline). These waters are currently masked to avoid providing false information, thus leading to data gaps in nearshore waters; 2) due to perturbations by cloud-adjacent straylight and cloud shadows, both false positive and false negative detections are often encountered. The current solution is to dilate the cloudmask to make the adjacent pixels invalid, thus leading to data loss. In this work, a computer deep-learning model based on the Res-UNet architecture, namely U-net, was developed to overcome these difficulties. The model was trained and validated using a total of 8518 medium-resolution "ground truth" images carefully prepared from data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. After accounting for subpixel Sargassum coverage, the over accuracy of the DL model, as measured by its F1 score, is similar to 92.5% (without masking nearshore waters or cloud-adjacent pixels), which is higher than that of the current AFAI model (86.2% after masking nearshore waters and cloud-adjacent pixels). Application of the DL model to the 2021 MODIS data (a major Sargassum year) showed substantially improved valid data coverage (monthly increases of 20-34%) in both nearshore waters and offshore waters, and increased Sargassum biomass during the summer months (by 10-20%) from the entire Sargassum belt extending from the west Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. In the minor Sargassum year of 2016, the DL model led to an average increase of about 7% in Sargassum biomass. The DL model also appears to be applicable to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3A and 3B satellites. Merging multi-sensor observations (including MODIS) resulted in substantially improved valid data coverage in daily to weekly composites, thus improving near real-time monitoring.

AB Cyanobacteria blooms are recurrent in the Baltic Sea with frequency and intensity increasing with temperature. By relying on autonomous multispectral measurements from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), this study exploited an unprecedented dataset of in situ remote sensing reflectance RRS(lambda) spectra (with wavelength lambda in the interval 400-667 nm) acquired during filamentous cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea. The study investigated the temporal evolution of the in situ RRS(lambda) during these blooms with particular emphases on those spectral features that may show potential to identify cyanobacteria and their development stages. Additionally, it assessed operational satellite Ocean Colour RRS(lambda) products from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the presence of cyanobacteria, for which only qualitative evaluations are available from previous studies. To ascertain to what extent satellite operational data products could be used for cyanobacteria detection in the Baltic Sea, the comparison of in situ and satellite derived RRS(lambda) showed poor agreement with differences particularly pronounced at the blue centre-wavelengths. Nevertheless, band-differences in the green-red spectral region for OLCI and for MODIS exhibited less dependence on atmospheric correction issues with mean absolute relative differences between 8.3% and 9.6% for OLCI and between 12.6% and 12.9% for MODIS in the presence of cyanobacteria. Additionally, they showed potential to indicate the presence and development stage of cya-nobacteria blooms in Baltic Sea waters while not being sensitive to other algal blooms.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can represent gross primary productivity (GPP) in many types of terrestrial vegetation. In principle, the chlorophyll-a fluorescence signal responds to the amount of light absorption and the fraction of energy distribution in photosystems. Therefore, it is mechanistically linked with CO2 assimilation. Recently, radiative transfer models have traced the processes of emission, interception and reabsorption within a canopy in heterogeneous tree stands. These processes influence the expected relationship between SIF and GPP. We inferred that the vertical profile of SIF could reveal those processes. In addition, the sum of SIF emission from different pathways within the canopy must be equivalent to the total SIF emission from all leaves. The purposes of this study were: (1) to clarify the seasonal and diurnal variations of ground-based SIF observed above the overstory, midstory and understory layers (strata); (2) to examine whether the sum of SIF observed from the three layers could represent total SIF emissions, and (3) to examine whether SIF above the understory could reveal the photosynthetic activity within the vertical profile of a forest. To estimate how much SIF was present after its emission from leaves within the canopy, we conducted spectral radiation observations in three vertical layers: above the understory, midstory and overstory (8, 14 and 18 m from the ground, respectively) to retrieve the red and far-red SIF in a deciduous broadleaf forest ecosystem in Japan from April to November 2020. We found that SIF above the overstory and the sum of SIF from the three layers increased sharply at the leaf-onset of the overstory and was correlated with each season's GPP. The sum of far-red SIF from the three layers was proportional to the total SIF estimated using the escape ratio approach for SIF above the overstory. In this study we demonstrated that SIF above the understory could detect the increased photosynthesis of the understory in spring, compared with the GPP and the vertical profile of the CO2 concentrations. In summary, SIF observed in three forest layers detected the seasonal change of GPP within the canopy. Thus, a multi-layer approach can be used to understand the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis within the canopy.

AB Aerosol optical properties are among the most fundamental parameters in atmospheric environmental studies. Satellite aerosols retrievals that are based on deep learning or machine learning approach have been widely discussed in remote sensing studies, but the flexible random forest (RF) model has not received much attention in the retrieval of geostationary satellite, like Himawari-8. Thus, the Himawari-8 aerosol retrieval achieved by RF model requires further investigation and optimization. Based on the radiative transfer equation, this study proposed a RF model driven by a differential operator, which quantifies a simple linear relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance enhancement. The spectral information of aerosols is achieved by independent TOA reflectance comparison between images rather than one result from multiple band synthesis. The method allows simple feature inputs and shows weak dependence on auxiliary data. It also achieves simultaneous retrievals over different surfaces and maintains mathematical correlation between spectral AODs and Angstrom Exponents (AE). The model performance was evaluated using a series of compre-hensive temporal and spatial validation analyses. A sample-based tenfold cross-validation (10-CV) shows that the new method can simultaneously improve the estimation of aerosol properties, with considerably high correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.85 for AODs at the 0.50 mu m wavelengths, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.08, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13 and >70% of the samples fell within the AOD expected error (EE). The high ac-curacy of the spectral AOD retrievals also exhibits good performance on AE calculations, with at least 2/3 of the samples falling within the EE. The site based 10-CV also evaluates the spatial predictions on AODs at the 0.50 mu m wavelength, with R2 of 0.67, MAE of 0.12 and RMSE of 0.18. It also has outperformed the Himawari operational aerosol products and appeared to be comparable to other popular machine learning models with better AE re-trievals in some typical regions. Two typical regional pollution cases also highlight the advantages of the new aerosol monitoring approach. The 5 km resolution aerosol retrievals exhibit good spatial coverage and perfor-mance when describing the regional pollution levels and types. The proposed method improves the performance of RF in retrieving aerosol properties from geostationary satellites and also offers a new prospective for aerosol remote sensing using machine learning approaches.

AB Although rice cultivation is one of the most important agricultural sources of methane (CH4) and contributes similar to 8% of total global anthropogenic emissions, large discrepancies remain among estimates of global CH4 emissions from rice cultivation (ranging from 18 to 115 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) due to a lack of observational constraints. The spatial distribution of paddy-rice emissions has been assessed at regional-to-global scales by bottom-up inventories and land surface models over coarse spatial resolution (e.g., > 0.5 degrees) or spatial units (e.g., agro-ecological zones). However, high-resolution CH4 flux estimates capable of capturing the effects of local climate and management practices on emissions, as well as replicating in situ data, remain challenging to produce because of the scarcity of high-resolution maps of paddy-rice and insufficient understanding of CH4 predictors. Here, we combine paddy-rice methane-flux data from 23 global eddy covariance sites and MODIS remote sensing data with machine learning to 1) evaluate data-driven model performance and variable importance for predicting rice CH4 fluxes; and 2) produce gridded up-scaling estimates of rice CH4 emissions at 5000-m resolution across Monsoon Asia, where similar to 87% of global rice area is cultivated and similar to 90% of global rice production occurs. Our random-forest model achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.59 and 0.69 for 8-day CH4 fluxes and site mean CH4 fluxes respectively, with land surface temperature, biomass and water-availability-related indices as the most important predictors. We estimate the average annual (winter fallow season excluded) paddy rice CH4 emissions throughout Monsoon Asia to be 20.6 +/- 1.1 Tg yr(-1) for 2001-2015, which is at the lower range of previous inventory-based estimates (20-32 CH4 Tg yr(-1)). Our estimates also suggest that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in this region have been declining from 2007 through 2015 following declines in both paddy-rice growing area and emission rates per unit area, suggesting that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in Monsoon Asia have likely not contributed to the renewed growth of atmospheric CH4 in recent years.

AB Wetlands in drylands are vulnerable to degradation and disappearance due to the combined effects of increasing anthropogenic disturbances and climatic extremes. Such influences may drive non-linear shifts in surface re-sponses that require long-term monitoring approaches for their study. Here, we used a piece-wise regression model to characterize long-term Ecosystem Change Types (ECT) in the surface water and vegetation dynamics of the Inner Niger Delta wetlands in Mali between 2000 and 2019. We also examined the added benefits of using a dense Landsat time series for such segmented trend analysis in comparison with MODIS products that are regularly used for ecosystem trends assessment. Our approach has found statistically significant (p < 0.05) long-term changes in wetland ecosystems, as calculated from Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image series on both the MODIS and the Landsat scales. The class-specific accuracies of the detected ECTs were evaluated through the validation of temporal trajectories based on the TimeSync logic at selected probability sample locations. Results showed higher user's, producer's, and overall accuracies (OA) when using a dense Landsat time series (OA = 0.89 +/- 0.01), outperforming the MOD09A1 time series (OA = 0.37 +/- 0.03). Our study provides a robust framework for long-term wetland monitoring that demonstrates the benefits of applying dense Landsat time-series imagery for accurate quanti-fications of linear and non-linear ecosystem responses in vast highly dynamic floodplain systems. Delivering such an improved assessment, in a spatial resolution that better resolves the characteristics of wetlands ecosystems, has the potential to support the information needs of global conservation and restoration efforts.

AB Biomass burning influences atmospheric composition and regional air quality. The hourly biomass-burning emissions are usually required by air quality models, yet most available emission inventories provide daily or monthly estimates in 0.1 degrees or coarser grids, limiting the prediction accuracy. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites - R Series (GOES-R) observes fires across the conterminous United States (CONUS) every 5 min at a spatial resolution of 2 km, which allows for characterizing fires and emissions on diurnal scale. In this study, we developed a new operational algorithm to generate regional hourly 3 km fire emission across the CONUS by fusing temporally resolved ABI fire radiative power (FRP) and fine spatial-resolution (375 m) FRP from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites. To do this, ABI FRP was first calibrated against and fused with VIIRS FRP in 3 km grids. Then, FRP diurnal cycles at an interval of 5 min were reconstructed using the fused ABI-VIIRS FRP and the land cover-ecoregion-specific FRP diurnal climatologies. The reconstructed FRP diurnal cycles were applied to estimate hourly emissions of eight species (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter with di-ameters <2.5 mu m (PM2.5)). The accuracy was verified by comparing with CO observations from the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, and with PM2.5 emissions from eight other inventories. The results of the ABI-VIIRS estimates during one year from April 2020 to March 2021 indicate that fires burned 221 Tg dry matter and emit 2.25 Tg PM2.5 emissions across the CONUS. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of emissions vary with land cover types. The largest and smallest seasonal variations are shown in forest and agriculture fire emissions, respectively. The diurnal emission patterns of different land cover types share similar shapes but differ largely in magnitude. Moreover, the diurnal pattern of forest fire emissions suggests that emissions are dominated during daytime in the eastern U.S. but strong during both daytime and nighttime in the western U.S. The evaluation shows that the fused ABI-VIIRS based CO agrees well with the TROPOMI CO, with a difference of 11%. However, the agreement between fused ABI-VIIRS emissions and other inventories varies for different fire events.

AB Two machine learning (ML) models are investigated for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from passive microwave (PMW) satellite observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and auxiliary data, such as ERA5 reanalysis data. The first model is the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XBG) model and the second is a multilayer perceptron neural network (NN). The performance of the two ML algorithms is compared to that of an existing state-of-the-art regression (RE) retrieval algorithm. The performance of the three algorithms is assessed using independent in situ SSTs from drifting buoys. Overall, the three models have similar biases; 0.01, 0.01 and -0.02 K for the XGB, NN and RE, respectively. The XGB model performs best with respect to standard deviation; 0.36 K. While the NN model performs slightly better than the RE model with respect to standard deviation, 0.50 and 0.55 K, respectively, the RE model is found to be more sensitive to changes in the in situ SST. Moreover, the XGB model is the least sensitive with an overall sensitivity of 0.78, compared to 0.90 for the RE model and 0.88 for the NN model. The good performance of the two ML algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art RE algorithm in this initial study demonstrates that there is a large potential in the use of ML algorithms for the retrieval of SST from PMW satellite observations.

AB Space-based light detection and ranging (lidar) instruments can provide important measurements of ocean ecosystems that both complement passive ocean color observations and address some of the limitations of this latter traditional technology. To this end and despite being designed for atmospheric research, significant progress has been made in retrieving ocean properties with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) sensor and using these data for new ocean science applications. Over the course of these developments, data processing approaches have matured and product validation efforts have expanded. The purpose of this manuscript is to summarize characteristics of the CALIOP sensor and historical events leading to its use for ocean retrievals, to provide a consolidated synthesis of the current ocean data processing approach, and to summarize product validation status. In addition, we provide here an update on the current status of data processing for the CALIOP record, information on how to access data, processing code, and relevant documents, and recommen-dations on key areas for future developments.

AB Seasonal soil freeze/thaw (FT) state transition plays a critical role in the range of ecosystem, hydrological and biogeochemical processes. A thorough and large-scale validation of remote-sensed or model-based FT products is therefore quite important. Previous validation studies have applied categorical triple collocation (CTC) as a cross-validation method to estimate the relative performance ranking of various FT datasets, including in situ observations. While CTC has proven useful for qualitatively evaluating FT datasets, quantitative estimates of classification accuracy, which has not yet been assessed against direct validation results, would be even more valuable. To fill this gap, we compare CTC estimated performance rankings and quantitative classification ac-curacies with those obtained from dense soil temperature and sparse surface temperature observations from April 2015 through December 2019. CTC estimated classification accuracies are found to be strongly correlated (r > 0.927) with dense ground observations, along with very low bias (< 0.038) and RMSE (< 0.086). However, the bias and RMSE of CTC-estimated freeze accuracies are significantly inflated when sparse surface temperatures are used instead as the benchmark. Small errors are found with low absolute values (<0.317) of CTC-estimated class imbalance and a sample size of at least 365. CTC can generally provide the correct performance ranking for each product within a triplet -with low risk of incorrectly ranking all three products. In addition, a sample size of 10-160 is adequate for CTC to provide the correct ranking for the highest-or lowest-ranked product. This im-proves our knowledge and understanding of the reliability of the CTC method.

AB High mountain glaciers (HMGs), called the water towers of the world, are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and thus are rapidly shrinking. Monitoring and evaluating large-scale glacier and snow (GS) mass changes are critical for humans and ecosystems. Although modern gravity satellites monitor GS on a global scale, the contemporary Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE FO) missions are only able to do so at coarse spatial resolutions and are restricted by their limited observation periods. Moreover, because of the complex mechanism behind a glacier's mass balance, existing reconstruction methods for GRACE-like mass anomalies, including machine learning approaches and statistical models, cannot be applied to HMGs. Here, we propose a precipitation and temperature data-driven statistical model combining hydrology and GS processes to reconstruct GRACE-like mass anomalies of HMGs, from which the hydrological and GS signals can be further separated. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method was consistent with the GRACE/GRACE FO observations (the median correlation coefficient/Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency: similar to 0.92/0.85). Additionally, the separated GS signals agreed with the independent external data used for comparison. Compared with machine learning methods, this method better reconstructed the long-term trend of GRACE-like mass anomalies. Our study provides an acceptable method for expanding mass anomaly time series on HMGs, thereby assisting in the sustainable management and protection of water resources in their downstream areas.

AB Oil spills in the ocean pollute and harm the marine environment. Remote sensing has been widely used to examine and analyze marine oil spills. Refractive index is an important parameter for monitoring, evaluating, and mitigating marine oil spills, but its quantitative detection through remote sensing is still in the exploratory stages. In this study, we developed a quantitative inversion model at a pixel-scale to determine the equivalent refractive index (ERI) of the sea surface. The proposed model involved two important steps. First, we performed simulation experiments and found that the multi-angle Fresnel reflection coefficient ratio is not sensitive to the refractive index, which was further verified via real image geometry. Second, we proposed a sun glitter (SG) correction method by reanalyzing wind data and seawater refractive index in the background seawater area as constraints. High-resolution multi-angle sun glitter (MSG) images of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer sensor were used to estimate the ERI. The ERI images with the resolution same as that of the original images (15 m) exhibited significant spatial variability. The estimated ERI exhibited a reasonable range as compared to the existing oil spill refractive index data in relevant literature, which were derived from laboratory measurements and through remote sensing inversion. Finally, the sensitivities of the SG correction model and multi-angle Fresnel ratio model were dis-cussed. The results show that the MSG images can estimate high-resolution ERI of sea surface that plays a sig-nificant role in the observations of marine oil spills.

AB Advances in earth observation science in recent years have contributed to improving the quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) at field, regional and global scales. Many studies have stressed the need for a high temporal and spatial resolution ET product that minimizes the bias between modeled and actual water use for proper water accounting. We present a hybrid single-source energy balance (HSEB) model that calculates evapotranspiration at the field-scale based on the synergistic use of Sentinel-2, Landsat, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) MODIS land surface temperature products. The model operates in Google Earth Engine as a time series using global atmospheric variables and 100-m Copernicus Land cover data. Evaluation of HSEB for calculating evaporation over 29 flux tower sites within an extensive range of climatic conditions and biomes over the US, Europe and Australia for 2018-2020 shows that the model significantly improves the temporal and spatial components of ET mapping. Overall, HSEB performed well in all considered biome types and climatic conditions (r = 0.81, 0.74, and 0.8, a Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.6, 0.74, 0.8, and a bias of 4%, 1%, and - 0.9% at the daily, weekly, and monthly scales, respectively). Root Mean Square Error averaged at 1.31 mm/day. Comparison of instantaneous latent heat fluxes of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) against tower data shows that HSEB produces acceptable results, although ECOSTRESS had a slightly lower bias (3.8% for HSEB vs. -0.8% for ECOSTRESS). HSEB performed better over croplands. We also discuss comparisons of sharpened LST from VIIRS VNP02, VNP21, MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-3, and LST from ECOSTRESS versus ground LST measurements, and briefly discuss the sensitivity of HSEB to the thermal data used. Both ECOSTRESS and Landsat showed better performance at different LST ranges and time of day when compared to LST observation collected over a small potato field in Lebanon. The analysis of impact of LST product used in HSEB on ET results at US-ARM site showed that HSEB with MODIS LST outperforms HSEB ET from VNP02 (an overestimate) and VNP21 (an underestimate). We conclude that HSEB can be used as an operational global model for monitoring evaporative stress and evaporation at the small-agriculture field level with higher temporal and spatial resolution utilizing the wide suite of available satellite data.

AB It has been over ten years since the successful launch of the first-ever dedicated satellite for global soil moisture monitoring; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS). Looking towards the future, P-band (0.3-1 GHz) is a promising technique to replace or enhance the L-band (1.4 GHz) SMOS and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) missions because of an expected reduction in roughness and vegetation impact, leading to an improved soil moisture accuracy over rougher soil surfaces and more densely vegetated areas. Accordingly, this investigation evaluated the tau-omega model at P-band (0.75 GHz) using a tower-based experiment in Victoria, Australia, where brightness temperature observations were collected concurrently at P-and L-band over bare and wheat covered flat and periodic soil surfaces. The potential to retrieve soil moisture without discriminating periodic and flat surfaces was investigated by applying the roughness and vegetation parameters calibrated for flat soil to retrieve the moisture of periodic soil. Results showed that P-band had a comparable RMSE across different roughness configurations (variations less than 0.016 m(3)/m(3)) for both bare and wheat-covered soil, while the L band RMSE was only comparable for wheat-covered soil, indicating that periodic surfaces did not need to be discriminated in such scenarios. Conversely, a difference of 0.022 m(3)/m(3) was observed for L-band with bare soil. A reduced vegetation impact was also demonstrated at P-band, with an RMSE of 0.029 m(3)/m(3) achieved when completely ignoring the wheat existence with under 4-kg/m(2) vegetation water content, whereas at L-band the RMSE increased to 0.063 m(3)/m(3). This study therefore paves the way for a successful P-band radiometer mission for obtaining more accurate global soil moisture information.

AB The unprecedented availability of optical satellite data in cloud-based computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), opens new possibilities to develop crop trait retrieval models from the local to the planetary scale. Hybrid retrieval models are of interest to run in these platforms as they combine the advantages of physically-based radiative transfer models (RTM) with the flexibility of machine learning regression algorithms. Previous research with GEE primarily relied on processing bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance data, which requires atmospheric correction. In the present study, we implemented hybrid models directly into GEE for processing Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data into crop traits. To achieve this, a training dataset was generated using the leaf-canopy RTM PROSAIL in combination with the atmospheric model 6SV. Gaussian process regression (GPR) retrieval models were then established for eight essential crop traits namely leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water content, leaf dry matter content, fractional vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf variables (i.e., canopy chlorophyll content, canopy water content and canopy dry matter content). An important pre-requisite for implementation into GEE is that the models are sufficiently light in order to facilitate efficient and fast processing. Successful reduction of the training dataset by 78% was achieved using the active learning technique Euclidean distance-based diversity (EBD). With the EBD-GPR models, highly accurate validation results of LAI and upscaled leaf variables were obtained against in situ field data from the validation study site Munich-North-Isar (MNI), with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) from 6% to 13%. Using an independent validation dataset of similar crop types (Italian Grosseto test site), the retrieval models showed moderate to good performances for canopy-level variables, with NRMSE ranging from 14% to 50%, but failed for the leaf-level estimates. Obtained maps over the MNI site were further compared against Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) vegetation estimates generated from the ESA Sentinels' Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor, proving high consistency of both retrievals (R2 from 0.80 to 0.94). Finally, thanks to the seamless GEE processing capability, the TOA-based mapping was applied over the entirety of Germany at 20 m spatial resolution including information about prediction uncer-tainty. The obtained maps provided confidence of the developed EBD-GPR retrieval models for integration in the GEE framework and national scale mapping from S2-L1C imagery. In summary, the proposed retrieval workflow demonstrates the possibility of routine processing of S2 TOA data into crop traits maps at any place on Earth as required for operational agricultural applications.

AB Spatially continuous estimates of forest canopy height at national to global scales are critical for quantifying forest carbon storage, understanding forest ecosystem processes, and developing forest management and restoration policies to mitigate global climate change. Spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) platforms, especially the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), can measure forest canopy height in discrete footprints globally. Their coverage provides a promising data source for national to global-scale forest canopy height estimates. However, previous studies usually used a regression-based approach to develop spatially continuous forest canopy height distribution through the aid of optical images, which cannot take full advantage of the dense spaceborne lidar footprints and may still suffer from the saturation effect of optical images. In this study, we developed a novel neural network guided interpolation (NNGI) method to map forest canopy height by fusing GEDI, ICESat-2 ATLAS, and Sentinel-2 images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed NNGI method, we generated a 30-m forest canopy height product of China for the year 2019. More than 140 km2 drone-lidar data were collected across the country to train and validate the NNGI method. The results showed that the average forest canopy height of China is 15.90 m with a standard deviation of 5.77 m. We evaluated the interpolated forest canopy height product of China by over 1,100,000 GEDI validation footprints (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 5.32 m), about 33 km2 drone-lidar validation data (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 4.93 m), and over 59,000 field plot measurements (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 4.88 m). Benefiting from the interpolation-based mapping strategy, the resulting product had almost no saturation effect in areas with tall forest canopies. The high mapping accuracy demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed NNGI method for monitoring spatially continuous forest canopy height at national to global scales by integrating multi-platform spaceborne lidar data and optical images, enabling opportunities to provide more accurate quantification of terrestrial carbon storage and better understanding of forest ecosystem processes.

AB Soybean is among the most important crops for food and feed production worldwide. Sustainable and local production in regions with marginal climates requires cold-adapted varieties that create high yield and protein content in a short vegetation period. Drone-based high-throughput field phenotyping methods allow monitoring the success and the developmental speed of genotypes in such target environments. This study exemplifies that such frequent and precise analyses of remotely sensed canopy growth traits can be used to derive the optimal genotype, a so-called ideotype, for a given mega-environment. For the case example of Switzerland, a country with a temperate oceanic climate, the results indicate that image-derived traits allow predicting yield and protein content from the dynamics of vegetative growth. Genotypes with early canopy cover produce high yield, whereas genotypes that show a prolonged duration until they have reached their final maximum of leaf area index are characterized by a high protein content. Analyses of early performance trial stage material indicate that there are genotypes that combine both features of growth dynamics. Whether these genotypes are then indeed successful in breeding programs remains to be investigated, since this also depends on disease resistance and other traits of those genotypes. Yet, overall, this study provides strong indications of the high value of high-throughput field phenotyping in the context of physiological and breeding-related analyses of crops.

AB Land surface temperature (LST), retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) bands of remote sensing satellites, is an important parameter for various climate and environmental models. TIR bands detect a range of low-energy wavelengths, resulting in a coarser spatial resolution than other multispectral bands, and limiting applicability in heterogeneous urban regions. In this study, a new nonlinear method for LST downscaling, called Three Layers Composition (TLC), was proposed. The TLC integrates large-scale temperature variations, re-constructed detailed characteristics of LSTs, and strong boundary information. The performance of TLC is compared with disaggregation of radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad), thermal imagery sharpening (TsHARP), and random forest (RF) for a complex landscape in Beijing city, which has agriculture, forest, and massive impervious surfaces. The scale effects on the downscaled LSTs (DLST) were analyzed from the aspects of spatial resolution and spatial contexts. The experimental results indicate that the nonlinear algorithms (TLC and RF) perform better than linear methods (DisTrad and TsHARP). Indicated by coefficient of determination (R-2), centered root-mean square error (CRMSE), and correlation coefficient (CC), TLC (R-2 = 0.901, CRMSE = 0.319, CC = 0.951) was the most effective and workable technique for predicting LSTs, followed by RF (0.768, 0.502, 0.874), TsHARP (0.544, 0.652, 0.734), and DisTrad (0.518, 0.751, 0.719). Larger experimental regions and larger ratios between initial and target resolution weaken the accuracy of DLST. TLC indicated a stronger ability to resist the influence of such scale effects. Traditional downscaling methods (DisTrad, TsHARP, and RF) are trained with global LSTpredictor relationships and predict the DLST point by point, which can result in significantly biased estimates for very high or very low temperatures. Addressing this issue, TLC advantageously preserves the texture similarity between LST and its predictors, and yields more precise DLST, which showed higher consistency with the reference LST. Considering high accuracy and low computation time, TLC may be a safe technique for LST downscaling in other regions and different remote sensing sensors.

AB On 17 October 2015, a large landslide entered the marine waters of Taan Fiord, Alaska, and generated a displacement wave with a 193 m runup. The wave scoured the surrounding hillslopes of soil and vegetation and deposited significant volumes of material into the fjord, onto hillslopes on the opposite side of the fjord, and on top of Tyndall Glacier. For this study, we generated six, 2-m posting Digital Surface Models (DSMs) using DigitalGlobe/Maxar satellite imagery acquired near-annually between 2012 and 2019, and the Surface Extraction with TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) high-performance computing algorithm. We aligned the DSMs to exposed bedrock in the 01 March 2014 DSM acquisition, and then used them to characterize topographic and volumetric changes from before and after the 2015 Taan Fiord rock avalanche. We find that the landslide mobilized roughly 77. 0 +/- 0.9 Mm3 of material, of which approximately 56.3 Mm3 were deposited in the fjord waters. Furthermore, we quantified an additional 27.2 +/- 3.8 Mm3 of material scoured from fjordadjacent hillslopes and deposited in the fjord waters, providing new constraints on the subaqueous deposition. This is the first time that DSMs have been used to estimate the volume of scour caused by a tsunami and the subsequent changes in extent and volume with time. Our results for the landslide and runout are consistent with field measurements published previously. This study offers improved estimates of both subaerial and subaqueous deposition for the 2015 Taan Fiord landslide and describes additional regional environmental conditions. We identify precursory motion prior to the 2015 landslide, characterize several smaller-scale landslides in the larger Taan Fiord region, delineate terminus positions and associated ice dynamics of the Tyndall Glacier, and detail seasonal changes in vegetation growth and snow melt/accumulation. This work provides important new insights into the geomorphic features and dynamics of this landslide and subsequent tsunami. The interdisciplinary applications associated with DSMs and the accuracy of the measurements presented here demonstrate that these methods are an effective tool to improve our understanding of the pre- and post-landslide processes, for monitoring areas at risk for landslides and other natural hazards, and for rapid response to catastrophic events.

AB Satellite observations of pan-Arctic sea ice thickness have so far been constrained to winter months. For radar altimeters, conventional methods cannot differentiate leads from meltwater ponds that accumulate at the ice surface in summer months, which is a critical step in the ice thickness calculation. Here, we use over 350 optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the summer months to train a 1D convolution neural network for separating CryoSat-2 radar altimeter returns from sea ice floes and leads with an accuracy >80%. This enables us to generate the first pan-Arctic measurements of sea ice radar freeboard for May-September between 2011 and 2020. Results indicate that the freeboard distributions in May and September compare closely to those from a conventional 'winter' processor in April and October, respectively. The freeboards capture expected patterns of sea ice melt over the Arctic summer, matching well to ice draft observations from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Program (BGEP) moorings. However, compared to airborne laser scanner freeboards from Operation IceBridge and airborne EM ice thickness surveys from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) IceBird program, CryoSat-2 freeboards are underestimated by 0.02-0.2 m, and ice thickness is underestimated by 0.28-1.0 m, with the largest differences being over thicker multi-year sea ice. To create the first pan-Arctic summer sea ice thickness dataset we must address primary sources of uncertainty in the conversion from radar freeboard to ice thickness.

AB Canopy radiative transfer (RT) modeling is critical for the quantitative retrieval of vegetation biophysical parameters and has been under intensive research over the decades. RT models of discontinuous canopies, such as three-dimensional (3D) RT models, posed challenges for the early one-dimensional (1D) hypothesis. Although 3D RT models have higher accuracy, theoretically, they suffer from two problems: detailed scene parameters and complex computational steps. To overcome these problems, the stochastic radiative transfer (SRT) theory, which is known to have the accuracy of 3D RT while being as simple as 1D RT, has been adapted from atmospheric research to the study of vegetation canopies. While the SRT model has been adopted into the operational production of vegetation parameters, its accuracy needs further improvement because of the insufficient consideration of hotspot effects. Additionally, the evaluation and validation of SRT process are still preliminary, which hinders its further development and application. To provide the community with missing information and a scientific basis for subsequent model improvement, we modified, evaluated, and validated the SRT model in this study. First, we proposed the new version of SRT model to better achieve the coupling of SRT process and hotspot effect by dividing the previous SRT into four subproblems. Then, we evaluated the performance of the modified SRT by comparing multiple intermediate variables in the SRT process with 3D computer simulations, and analyzed the model sensitivity to key input parameters as well as the spatial distribution and conservation of radiation energy. Our findings reconfirmed that the SRT theory can well describe the radiation regime of discontinuous canopies with balanced efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the newly proposed coupling scheme of hotspot effect further improves the model performance in the hotspot regions. Finally, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations served as a reference to validate the modeled canopy reflectance, which shows a high concordance. These results provide a detailed theoretical basis for applications and further improvements of the SRT model.

AB Despite the importance of diffraction of irregular ocean waves, there is a lack of reported measurements over scales larger than a few tens of wavelengths. In the coastal zone, Satellite Altimetry is hindered because the backscatter characteristics of waveforms deviate from Brown's theoretical model, specially up to 20 km from the coastline. Here, we combine a novel set of retracked - reprocessed - altimeter data with directional buoy spectra and simulations with a spectral numerical model where diffraction is computed with an approximation based on the Mild Slope Equation. The Channel Islands, off the coast of California, is an ideal spot for the analysis because of the sharp variations in bathymetry in the vicinity of the archipelago, increasing the relative importance of diffraction over refraction. Spatial variations of wave energy in the lee of the islands are investigated along and across the wave propagation direction. For the first time the lateral rate of energy spreading - across the wave propagation direction - was computed in oceanic conditions and are of the same magnitude as those found in previously published experiments in a wave tank. The importance of diffraction as a non-dissipative process during wave propagation in situations normally encountered in the ocean is also discussed.

AB Virtual laser scanning (VLS), the simulation of laser scanning in a computer environment, is a useful tool for field campaign planning, acquisition optimisation, and development and sensitivity analyses of algorithms in various disciplines including forestry research. One key to meaningful VLS is a suitable 3D representation of the objects of interest. For VLS of forests, the way trees are constructed influences both the performance and the realism of the simulations. In this contribution, we analyse how well VLS can reproduce scans of individual trees in a forest. Specifically, we examine how different voxel sizes used to create a virtual forest affect point cloud metrics (e.g., height percentiles) and tree metrics (e.g., tree height and crown base height) derived from simulated point clouds. The level of detail in the voxelisation is dependent on the voxel size, which influences the number of voxel cells of the model. A smaller voxel size (i.e., more voxels) increases the computational cost of laser scanning simulations but allows for more detail in the object representation. We present a method that decouples voxel grid resolution from final voxel cube size by scaling voxels to smaller cubes, whose surface area is proportional to estimated normalised local plant area density. Voxel models are created from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds and then virtually scanned in one airborne and one UAV-borne simulation scenario. Using a comprehensive dataset of spatially overlapping terrestrial, UAV-borne and airborne laser scanning field data, we compare metrics derived from simulated point clouds and from real reference point clouds. Compared to voxel cubes of fixed size with the same base grid size, using scaled voxels greatly improves the agreement of simulated and real point cloud metrics and tree metrics. This can be largely attributed to reduced artificial occlusion effects. The scaled voxels better represent gaps in the canopy, allowing for higher and more realistic crown penetration. Similarly high accuracy in the derived metrics can be achieved using regular fixed-sized voxel models with notably finer resolution, e.g., 0.02 m. But this can pose a computational limitation for running simulations over large forest plots due to the ca. 50 times higher number of filled voxels. We conclude that opaque scaled voxel models enable realistic laser scanning simulations in forests and avoid the high computational cost of small fixed-sized voxels.

AB Soil moisture is an important component of the Earth system and plays a key role in land-atmosphere interactions. Remote sensing of soil moisture is of great scientific interest and the scientific community has made significant progress in soil moisture estimation using Earth observations. Currently, several satellite-based coarse spatial resolution soil moisture datasets have been produced and widely used for various applications in climate science, hydrology, ecosystem research and agriculture. Owing to the strong demand for soil moisture data with high spatial resolution for regional applications, much effort has recently been devoted to the generation of high spatial resolution soil moisture data from either high-resolution satellite observations or by downscaling existing coarse-resolution satellite-based soil moisture datasets. In addition, land surface models provide an alternative way to obtain consistent high-resolution soil moisture information when forced with high-resolution inputs. The aim of this study is to create and evaluate high-resolution soil moisture products derived from multiple sources including satellite observations and land surface model simulations. The JULES-CHESS simulated soil moisture and satellite-based soil moisture datasets including SMAP L3E, SMAP L4, SMOS L4, Sentinel 1, ASCAT, and Sentinel 1/SMAP combined products were first validated against observed soil moisture from COSMOS-UK, a network of in-situ cosmic-ray based sensors. Second, an approach based on triple collocation was applied to compare these satellite products in the absence of a known reference dataset. Third, a combined soil moisture product was generated to integrate the better-performing soil moisture estimates based on triple collocation error estimation and a least-squares merging scheme. From further evaluation, it is found that the merged soil moisture integrates the characteristics of model simulation and satellite observations and particularly improves the limited temporal variability of the JULES-CHESS simulation. Therefore, we conclude that the triple collocation merging scheme is a simple and reliable way to combine satellite-based soil moisture products with outputs from the JULES-CHESS simulation for estimating model-data fused high-resolution soil moisture for the British mainland.

   updating existing building footprint from bi-temporal remote sensing

AB Building footprint information is one foundation for understanding urban processes and hence a program for environmentally sustainable urbanization. For most cities, municipal governments have constructed basic building contour databases for basic land resource management and urban planning. These building contour databases, however, need to be updated regularly to ensure their validity. Cities are dynamic, changing rapidly over short periods, thus there is an urgent need for automatic methods to produce up-to-date building footprints. Even fully supervised automated methods have major limitations in the building footprint updating process because the labels for current buildings or changed areas are lacking. Moreover, state-of-the-art automatic schemes even some based on deep learning approaches, however, often fail to precisely depict building boundaries, jeopardizing effective updating of building databases. To address these interrelated problems, we developed a novel algorithm to automatically update the existing building databases to their current status with minimal manual intervention; the saliency-guided edge-preservation framework (named SG-EPUNet) for updating existing building databases and producing up-to-date building footprints. This neural network-based method can update building footprints from remote sensing images, requiring manual annotations for only 20% of the buildings. To robustly extract building features, we designed an edge-preservation neural network (EPUNet) that combines edge detection with contextual aggregation in the proposed SG-EPUNet framework. We applied the methods on two datasets from Christchurch, New Zealand, and Guangzhou, China, to assess the effectiveness of the method in urban and suburban areas. For both study areas, the F1-score values for the building update results reached approximately 97%, which confirmed the applicability of the SG-EPUNet framework. The results also show that SG-EPUNet maintains robustness to large areas, even with very limited ground truth labeling. The joint combination of building prior and very high-resolution remote sensing images makes the proposed method a promising approach for automatically producing up-to-date building footprints in practical applications. The source code of the proposed EPUNet and SG-EPUNet is publicly available at https://g ithub.com/HaonanGuo/SG-EPUNet.

AB Accurate estimation of aerial net primary production (ANPP) using remotely acquired data is one of the main challenges in both environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. Reflectance-based techniques have been widely used for decades, but detection of fluorescence emission by chlorophyll has emerged as a promising alternative in recent years. Although passive sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) monitoring has shown interesting results, the information it provides is limited to few wavelengths (Fraunhofer and telluric lines). On the other hand, active measurements of steady-state fluorescence and its spectral distribution cover the full-emission spectrum but have not been fully explored due to obvious experimental limitations. In this work we develop a novel active fluorescence measurement procedure, based on lamps and sensors mounted on a field tractor. This technique allowed the detection of the full spectrum of fluorescence emission of a plant crop for the first time in the literature. The main objective of this work was to analyze how the information based on reflectance and fluorescence, recorded by the new proposed methodology, tracks the differences caused by different irrigation treatments in the ANPP of three soybean varieties. We observed that reflectance-based vegetation indices showed limited sensitivity to these cumulative differences, as only EVI2, NDWI and SRWI were able to distinguish between rainfed and irrigation treatments in some few cases. Passive, irradiance-normalised SIF showed this same trend, but active fluorescence peak ratio (FRed/FFar-red) revealed statistically significant differences for the three cultivars studied. In addition, the latter showed a significant correlation with ANPP for two soybean varieties after correction for light re-absorption and scattering (p < 0.05, R2 > 0.5), which was observed for only EVI and foliar water status VIs among passive indicators. Active fluorescence measurements at leaf level by PAM fluorometry did not show differences between treatments in the upper part of the canopy but revealed a biomass-dependent decrease in PSII yield along the vertical axis. Our study demonstrated that fluorescence emission spectrum holds highly valuable information that might allow monitoring ANPP changes upon irrigation from remote sensing applications, and therefore should be carefully studied. Lastly, it highlights the potential of SIF retrieval at both O2-A and O2-B lines.

AB We analyse high rate (20 Hz) altimeter derived sea level information, both from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry missions and Low Resolution Mode missions, in an inner sea and coastal environment. They are compared versus measured and high resolution model data. After a compact description of the relevant physical processes affecting the local sea level values, we focus on three specific passes on the Adriatic Sea, East of Italy. Our main finding is that altimeters and models provide both valuable, partially overlapping, but complementary, information to be exploited in parallel with a double purpose: to progressively approach the truth and to ensure the parallel improvement of both sources. From altimeter data there is a very strong suggestion that the spatial, and implicitly temporal, variability of the fields is much higher than shown by models. The reasons are discussed.

However, the precise characterization of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), its variability, trends, and predictability, and its associated uncertainty at the global scale is largely unexplored. In addition, gaps in satellite-retrieved AODs across space and time remain an obstacle to accurately revealing aerosol properties. This study uses MODIS Collection 6 AOD retrievals for a time series analysis and modeling of global aerosols from 2003 to 2015. Random forest (RF) regression is first applied to replace the missing data in the satellite AOD retrievals. AOD variations and trends are then investigated and future values are predicted using a Mann-Kendall analysis approach and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, respectively. The results indicate that the developed RF model enhances the AOD data coverage significantly, with the root mean square error and mean absolute error statistical metrics well below 0.13 and 0.08, respectively. High AOD loadings are found over East, South, and Southwest Asia, West and Central Africa, and northern South America. Prominent discrepancies are shown in aerosol variations and trends likely because of dust emissions, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and socioeconomic practices, which has significant implications for climate systems and mitigation policy-making. The ARIMA model delineates AOD features with clear annual and seasonal variations and with high accuracy over most regions. The performance of the model is jointly impacted by the data quality and data values. Overall, our study suggests the feasibility and applicability of the RF model in reconstructing area-scale satellite missing AOD retrievals, as well as the ability of the stochastic ARIMA model to accurately depict and forecast AOD profiles. The globally simulated and predicted aerosols will improve evaluations of aerosol effects for climate and epidemiological studies.

AB Crop lodging reduces yield quantity and grain quality of cereal crops. Understanding seasonal variation in crop lodging susceptibility enables lodging risk assessments and predictions of associated crop yield losses. We demonstrate a novel remote sensing-based approach, using sparse field observations and widely available synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, to map a safety factor against root lodging (SFA) in wheat. SFA quantifies the ability of the rooting system to support the self-weight moment of the whole plant and can be used as an indicator of in-season root lodging susceptibility. SAR satellite images, from Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2, were acquired synchronously with field measurements in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy during the 2018 winter wheat growing season. The field data included measurements from non-lodged (healthy) wheat such as plant height, height at the centre of gravity, self-weight moment of the whole plant, soil anchorage strength, SFA and those from lodged wheat such as crop angle of inclination, lodged area and the point of plant failure (stem or root). Field measurements confirmed that SFA decreased progressively through the season and was consistent with the observed lodging. Strong and significant correlations through the season were observed between SFA and SAR satellite image metrics. The validated regression models showed a strong relationship between fieldmeasured SFA and the metrics from RADARSAT-2 (R2CV = 0.84, RMSECV = 0.54) and Sentinel-1 data (R2CV = 0.73, RMSECV = 0.59). However, it is possible that the relationship between SFA and SAR parameters is confounded by the variations in crop biomass, which is highly correlated with SFA (r = -0.71, p < 0.0001). Our study, for the first time, demonstrates the use of remote sensing SAR data for lodging susceptibility assessment. Current and planned satellite platforms have the potential for large scale, operational assessment of lodging susceptibility in cereal crops.

AB Selective logging is the primary driver of forest degradation in the tropics and reduces the capacity of forests to harbour biodiversity, maintain key ecosystem processes, sequester carbon, and support human livelihoods. While the preceding decade has seen a tremendous improvement in the ability to monitor forest disturbances from space, large-scale (spatial and temporal) forest monitoring systems have almost universally relied on optical satellite data from the Landsat program, whose effectiveness is limited in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can penetrate clouds and have been utilized in forest mapping applications since the early 1990s, but only recently has SAR data been widely available on a scale sufficient to facilitate pan-tropical selective logging detection systems. Here, a detailed selective logging dataset from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon was used to assess the effectiveness of SAR data from Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) for monitoring tropical selective logging. We built Random Forests models aimed at classifying pixel-based differences between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we used the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to assess if a dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery displayed recognizable shifts in pixel values after selective logging. In general, Random Forests classification with SAR data (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) performed poorly, having high commission and omission errors for logged observations. This suggests little to no difference in pixel-based metrics between logged and unlogged areas for these sensors, particularly at lower logging intensities. In contrast, the Sentinel-1 time series analyses indicated that areas under higher intensity selective logging ( 5% in unlogged forest. Overall our results suggest that SAR data can be used in time series analyses to detect tropical selective logging at high intensity logging locations ( 20 m3 ha- 1) within the Amazon.

AB For typical cloud conditions, a clear sky retrieval rate (CSRR) >67% is required to meet the Global Climate Observing System temporal interval requirement of 10 days when mapping canopy biophysical variables ('variables'). Physically based algorithms suitable for global mapping of variables using multispectral satellite imagery, e.g. the Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P), typically have a CSRR between 25% and 75%. An Active Learning Regularization (ALR) approach was developed to increase the CSRR rate while satisfying uncertainty requirements. A local calibration database for each variable was produced from representative valid SL2P estimates and associated Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument surface reflectance estimates. Predictors for each variable were developed by i) using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression to select a subset of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) from a provided library, ii) removing outliers from the calibration database by trimming the conditional distribution of each variable given a VI, and iii) calibrating a non-linear regression predictor of the variable given the selected VIs using the trimmed database. ALR was applied to MSI imagery acquired over the Canadian Prairies during the 2016 and 2018 growing seasons and validated with in-situ data collected over 50 fields by the SMAPVEX16-MB campaign. The mean CSRR during the 2018 growing season was similar to 98% (similar to 70%) for ALR (SL2P) for all canopy variables except FCOVER and similar to 98% for FCOVER using both ALR and SL2P. In comparison to SL2P, ALR had increased agreement rates with in-situ leaf area index (86% versus 79%) and fraction cover (96% versus 79%) but not canopy water content (35% versus 53%). Intercomparison with valid SL2P estimates from different MSI images acquired within +/- 2 days found that 90% [+/- 5%] of ALR estimates fell within the uncertainty of the valid estimates. These findings support the hypothesis that, over croplands, ALR significantly increases CSRR over SL2P without appreciably increasing uncertainty for variables retrieved by SL2P within thematic performance requirements.

AB In the coming years, Earth Observation missions like the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) will acquire the radiance signal from the visible to the near-infrared at a very high spectral resolution, enabling exciting prospects for new insights in satellite-based photosynthetic studies. In this context, the process of de-coupling atmospheric and vegetation-related spectral signatures will become essential to guarantee a reliable estimation of the vegetation photosynthetic activity from space. Dynamic changes related to the vegetation photosynthetic status result in subtle contributions to the top of atmosphere radiance signal, e.g. due to the emission of the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (similar to 650-800 nm) or due to changes in surface reflectance spectra (500-600 nm) indicating variations in the vegetation photoprotection and light use efficiency. Conversely, atmospheric effects (molecular and aerosol absorption and scattering) dominate the spectral interval of interest for vegetation studies. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the atmospheric radiative effects caused by aerosols, ozone (O-3), water vapor (H2O), oxygen (O-2), and atmospheric pressure and temperature changes within the visible and near-infrared spectral interval, and paying special attention to the co-occurring vegetation-related spectral changes associated with the fluorescence emission and the activation of the photoprotection mechanisms. Since the largest uncertainties in the atmospheric correction process are associated with the characterization of the aerosol radiative effects, this work largely concentrates on the satellite retrieval-related implications under different aerosol absorbing and scattering scenarios on a global scale. Through a simulation exercise, it is evaluated to what extent aerosol climatology could influence the accuracy of satellite-derived surface apparent reflectance spectra impacting; therefore, any vegetation-related satellite product on a seasonal and global scale.

AB As an essential feature of plant autotrophy, Nitrogen (N) is the major nutrient affecting plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems, thus is of not only fundamental scientific interest, but also a crucial factor in crop productivity. Timely non-destructive monitoring of canopy nitrogen concentration (N%) demands fast and highly accurate estimation, which is often quantified using spectroscopic analyses in the 400-2500 nm spectral region. However, extracting a set of useful spectral absorption features from canopy spectra to determine N% remains challenging due to confounding canopy architecture. Deep Learning as a statistical learning technique is useful to extract biochemical information from canopy spectra. We evaluated the performance of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and compared it with two state-of-the-art methods: partial least squares regression (PLSR) and gaussian process regression (GPR). We utilized a large and diverse in-field multi-season (autumn, winter, spring and summer) spectral database (n = 7014) over 8 years (2009-2016) of dairy and hill country farms across New Zealand to develop season specific and spectral-region specific (VNIR and/or SWIR) 1D-CNN models. Results on the independent validation dataset (not used to train the model) showed that the 1D-CNN model provided higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.72; nRMSE% = 14) than PLSR (R-2 = 0.54; nRMSE% = 19) and GPR (with R-2 = 0.62; nRMSE% = 16). Season specific models based on 1D-CNN indicated apparent differences (14 <= nRMSE <= 19 for the test dataset), while the performance of all seasons combined model was remained higher for the test dataset (nRMSE% = 14). The full spectral range model showed higher accuracy than the spectral region-specific models (VNIR and SWIR alone) (15.8 <= nRMSE <= 18.5). Additionally, predictions derived using 1D-CNN were more precise (less uncertain) with <0.12 mean standard deviation (uncertainty intervals) than PLSR (0.31) and GPR (0.16). This study demonstrated the potential of 1D-CNN as an alternative to conventional techniques to determine the N% from canopy hyperspectral spectra.

AB The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS), is a new measurement strategy that includes a photon-counting technique. Employing such an advanced system facilitates highly accurate measurement of changes in the land surface of the Earth, as well as water depths, thereby providing a novel opportunity for nearshore bathymetry. The main problem in photon-counting bathymetry is the precise identification and separation of photons with different density dis-tributions on the water surface and water-column. Further, automatic detection of the signal photon of the water surface and bottom from the noise photon presents a problem. To overcome such problems, we propose a novel, validated, adaptive variable ellipse filtering bathymetric method (AVEBM). This method can precisely identify and separate the photons in the above-water, water surface, and water-column regions. Filter parameters can be determined automatically by the density distribution of photons in different water environments and water depths, and the signal photons of the water surface and bottom can be detected precisely to conduct bathymetry. To ensure and improve the accuracy and reliability of the AVEBM, datasets of different photon densities were selected and employed in conducting experiments. Further, we used in situ data and remote sensing images to validate and estimate the detection accuracy of the signal photon and bathymetric accuracy. The experimental results indicated that bathymetric accuracy based on the AVEBM method reached 0.48 m of root mean square error (RMSE) when we employed three ATL03 datasets in combination for Qilianyu Islands. Moreover, the bathymetric accuracy reached 0.79 m of RMSE when comparing with the SDB result in Shanhu Island. Results showed that the proposed AVEBM method facilitated highly accurate signal photon detection and bathymetry.

AB Satellite based remote sensing offers one of the few approaches able to monitor the spatial and temporal development of regional to continental scale droughts. A unique element of remote sensing platforms is their multi-sensor capability, which enhances the capacity for characterizing drought from a variety of perspectives. Such aspects include monitoring drought influences on vegetation and hydrological responses, as well as assessing sectoral impacts (e.g., agriculture). With advances in remote sensing systems along with an increasing range of platforms available for analysis, this contribution provides a timely and systematic review of multi sensor remote sensing drought studies, with a particular focus on drought related datasets, drought related phenomena and mechanisms, and drought modeling. To explore this topic, we first present a comprehensive summary of large-scale remote sensing datasets that can be used for multi-sensor drought studies. We then review the role of multi-sensor remote sensing for exploring key drought related phenomena and mechanisms, including vegetation responses to drought, land-atmospheric feedbacks during drought, drought-induced tree mortality, drought-related ecosystem fires, post-drought recovery and legacy effects, flash drought, as well as drought trends under climate change. A summary of recent modeling advances towards developing integrated multi-sensor remote sensing drought indices is also provided. We conclude that leveraging multi-sensor remote sensing provides unique benefits for regional to global drought studies, particularly in: 1) revealing the complex drought impact mechanisms on ecosystem components; 2) providing continuous long-term drought related information at large scales; 3) presenting real-time drought information with high spatiotemporal resolution; 4) providing multiple lines of evidence of drought monitoring to improve modeling and prediction robustness; and 5) improving the accuracy of drought monitoring and assessment efforts. We specifically highlight that more mechanism-oriented drought studies that leverage a combination of sensors and techniques (e.g., optical, microwave, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and constellations) across a range of spatiotemporal scales are needed in order to progress and advance our understanding, characterization and description of drought in the future.

AB Predicting long-term spatiotemporal characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is important in China to understand historical levels of PM2.5, to support health effects research of both long-term and short-term exposures to PM2.5, and to evaluate the efficacy of air pollution control policies. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides a unique opportunity to characterize the long-term trends of ground-level PM2.5 at high spatial resolution. However, the missing rate of AOD in Northeastern China (NEC) is very high, especially in winter, and challenges the accuracy of long-term predictions of PM2.5 if left unresolved. Using random forest algorithms, this study developed a gap-filling approach combing satellite AOD, meteorological data, land use parameters, population and visibility in the NEC during 2005-2016. The model, including all predictors, combined with a model without AOD was able to fill the gap of PM2.5 predictions caused by missing AOD at 1-km resolution. The R-2 (RMSE) of the full-coverage predictions was 0.81 (18.5 mu g/m(3)) at the daily level. Gap-filled PM2.5 predictions on days with missing AOD reduced the relative prediction error from 28% to 2.5% in winter. The leave-one-year-out-cross-validation R-2 (RMSE) of the full-coverage predictions was 0.65 (16.3 mu g/m(3)) at the monthly level, indicating relatively high accuracy of predicted historical PM2.5 concentrations. Our results suggested that AOD helped increase the reliability of historical PM2.5 prediction when ground PM2.5 measurements were unavailable, even though predictions from the AOD model only accounted for approximate 37% of the whole dataset. Predicted PM2.5 level in NEC have increased since 2005, reached its peak during 2013-2015, then saw a major decline in 2016. Our high-resolution predictions also showed a south to north gradient and many pollution hot spots in the city clusters surrounding provincial capitals, as well as within large cities. Overall, by combining predictions from the AOD model with higher accuracy and predictions from the non-AOD model to achieve full coverage, our modeling approach could produce long-term, full-coverage historical PM2.5 levels in high-latitude areas in China, despite the widespread and persistent AOD missingness.

AB During the past decades, extreme events have become more prevalent and last longer, and as a result drought-induced plant mortality has increased globally. Timely information on plant water dynamics is essential for understanding and anticipating drought-induced plant mortality. Leaf water potential (Psi(L)), which is usually measured destructively, is the most common metric that has been used for decades for measuring water stress. Remote sensing methods have been developed to obtain information on water dynamics from trees and forested landscapes. However, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the existing methods have limited our understanding of the water dynamics and diurnal variation of Psi(L) within single trees. Thus, we investigated the capability of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) intensity in observing diurnal variation in Psi(L) during a 50-h monitoring period. We aimed to improve the understanding on how large a part of the diurnal variation in Psi(L) can be captured using TLS intensity observations. We found that TLS intensity at the 905 nm wavelength measured from a static position was able to explain 77% of the variation in Psi(L) for three trees of two tree species with a root mean square error of 0.141 MPa. Based on our experiment with three trees, a time series of TLS intensity measurements can be used in detecting changes in Psi(L), and thus it is worthwhile to expand the investigations to cover a wider range of tree species and forests and further increase our understanding of plant water dynamics at wider spatial and temporal scales.

AB The Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data sensed by the Landsat 1-5 satellites make up a significant portion of the early Landsat data record. However, accurate MSS image geolocation has been difficult to achieve systematically due to a number of factors associated primarily with the older sensor and satellite technology. As of August 2019, only 49% of the Landsat MSS archive could be processed at the highest-level L1TP (precision and terrain corrected) level, and the remainder were processed as L1GS (systematically corrected) with inaccurate geolocation and no terrain correction. This paper presents a methodology to improve the geolocation of MSS time series. The methodology uses an areaand feature-based least-squares matching scale-space algorithm, with a time series registration implementation, that we developed previously using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology requires that at least three L1TP images in the time series acquired over a given path/row are available. A linear combination of a polynomial transformation and multiple radially symmetric radial-basis functions (RBFs) to model local uncorrected terrain relief effects present in the L1GS images are used. The processing is automated and applied in two passes. The first pass screens L1TP images to select the well-aligned ones that are used as references. The second pass registers the target images, including the L1GS images and any misaligned L1TP images, to all the reference L1TP images. The transformation coefficients for each registered target image are derived by least-squares adjustment using densely-matched tie-points between the target and the reference images. The methodology is demonstrated using 12 months of Landsat-4 MSS images at four Landsat path/row locations that contain agricultural, mountainous, and coastal regions, including a total of 43 L1TP and 31 L1GS images. There were sufficient tie-points to characterize the degree of misregistration of 14 L1GS images that had significant mean misregistration shifts ranging from 7.33 to 17.42 60 m pixels. In addition, at one site, two L1TP images were found to be misaligned and have mean misregistration shifts of 1.27 and 2.20 60 m pixels. The methodology provides sub-pixel registration accuracy after registration, the mean misregistration shifts for the 14 L1GS and two misaligned L1TP images varied from only 0.10 to 0.41 60 m pixels. The methodology does not use a digital elevation model, and examples illustrate that although the RBF transformations can compensate terrain relief distortion effects, larger (similar to 0.5 to 1.0 pixel) misregistration errors can remain in areas with highly variable terrain relief. Results are also provided for Landsat-1 MSS imagery to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to even the earliest part of the Landsat record. Detailed qualitative and quantitative results are presented and indicate the potential of the methodology to improve the geolocation of the Landsat MSS data record that is discussed with recommendations for future research.

AB Rivers are among the world's most threatened ecosystems. Enabled by the rapid development of drone technology, hyperspatial resolution (< 10 cm) images of fluvial environments are now a common data source used to better understand these sensitive habitats. However, the task of image classification remains challenging for this type of imagery and the application of traditional classification algorithms such as maximum likelihood, still in common use among the river remote sensing community, yields unsatisfactory results. We explore the possibility that a classifier of river imagery based on deep learning methods can provide a significant improvement in our ability to classify fluvial scenes. We assemble a dataset composed of RGB images from 11 rivers in Canada, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Costa Rica. The images were labelled into 5 land-cover classes: water, dry exposed sediment, green vegetation, senescent vegetation and roads. In total, > 5 billion pixels were labelled and partitioned for the tasks of training (1 billion pixels) and validation (4 billion pixels). We develop a novel supervised learning workflow based on the NASNet convolutional neural network (CNN) called 'CNN-Supervised Classification' (CSC). First, we compare the classification performance of maximum likelihood, a multilayer perceptron, a random forest, and CSC. Results show median F1 scores (a commonly used quality metric in machine learning) of 71%, 78%, 72% and 95%, respectively. Second, we train our classifier using data for 5 of 11 rivers. We then predict the validation data for all 11 rivers. For the 5 rivers that were used in model training, median F1 scores reach 98%. For the 6 rivers not used in model training, median F1 scores are 90%. We reach two conclusions. First, in the traditional workflow where images are classified one at a time, CSC delivers an unprecedented mix of labour savings and classification F1 scores above 95%. Second, deep learning can predict land-cover classifications (F1 = 90%) for rivers not used in training. This demonstrates the potential to train a generalised open-source deep learning model for airborne river surveys suitable for most rivers `out of the box'. Research efforts should now focus on further development of a new generation of deep learning classification tools that will encode human image interpretation abilities and allow for fully automated, potentially real-time, interpretation of riverine landscape images.

AB This paper assessed the precision of 20-Hz sea level anomaly (SLA) estimates with different sea state bias (SSB) corrections from reprocessed Jason-1/2/3 and Sentinel-3A data over the period of 2002-2019 within 100 km from the entire Australian coast. The altimeter waveforms were retracked by the modified Brown-peaky (MBP) retracker for Jason missions and by the SAMOSA+ retracker for Sentinel-3A. We recalculated the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections using a regional parametric model from 20-Hz retracked estimates of the SLA, significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. The composite SSB correction, which was recomputed after removing the retracker-dependant correlated error in 20-Hz SLA, is found to achieve better performance than other SSB corrections in the study area. Applying the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections has reduced similar to 10% and similar to 13% of noise, respectively, in the MBP-retracked 20-Hz Jason SLA estimates, while only similar to 2% of noise reduction is shown by applying the 1-Hz standard SSB correction. It is also found that the improvement of retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates by SSB corrections is very low (similar to 3%), indicating a dedicated SSB correction model should be developed for the SAR mode altimeter.
   As a result, the precision of composite SSB-corrected SLA estimates for all Jason missions can be retained at the level of 5.1 +/- 1.1 cm until 3 km from the Australian coast, which is slightly lower than that of Sentinel-3A (4.2 +/- 0.9 cm). The degradation within 3 km from the coast mainly corresponds to the along-track direction for MBP-retracked Jason SLA estimates, and the across-track direction for SAMOSA+ retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates, respectively.

AB We analysed 7188 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in a 3-year period, between October 2014 and September 2017, in the Western Mediterranean Sea and found imprints of about 14,300 oceanic eddies with diameters ranging from 0.4 km to 160.1 km. Those eddies manifest on the SAR imagery either through the accumulation of surfactants or through wave-current interaction, and considering the fa-vourable wind-speed ranges for both mechanisms we performed statistical analyses to gain insight into the eddies' spatio-temporal distribution, their typical sizes and shapes, and into the predominant mechanisms that are responsible for their formation. The vast majority of the detected eddies is elliptical, with a tendency for only large mesoscale eddies towards a circular shape. We found no general influence of the wind on the eddies' orientation, although mesoscale eddies tend to orient into the main current direction in each subregion. Submesoscale eddies do not show such tendency. Submesoscale eddies in the Western Mediterranean Sea are predominantly cyclonic (> 90%), and with increasing eddy diameter there is a transition from cyclonic to anticyclonic sense of rotation. In general, we found highest densities of submesoscale eddies in autumn, when the biological activity is still high and when mean regional winds are already strong, but variable. In addition, instabilities of thermal fronts during summer and autumn and instabilities of the main and secondary currents influence the formation of submesoscale eddies. Some of our results confirm those previously obtained for other regions.

AB The ability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to detect marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) roll-induced roughness modulation of the sea surface wave field is well known. This study presents SAR measurements of MABL rolls using global coverage data collected by the European Space Agency's C-band Sentinel-1A satellite in 2016-2017. An automated classifier is used to identify likely roll events from more than 1.3 million images that were acquired at two incidence angles of 23 degrees and 36.5 degrees in either VV or HH polarization. Characteristics of the detected rolls are examined for different wind speeds, polarizations, incidence and relative azimuth angles. Roll detection counts are much higher at the higher incidence angle and nearly equivalent for VV and HH polarizations. Detection depends strongly on the relative azimuth with roll detection rates at crosswind being 3-10 times lower than for upor downwind. All data show a low wind speed threshold near 2 m s(-1) and that rolls are most commonly observed at wind speeds near 9 m s(-1). For all viewing configurations, we find that rolls induce a wide range of mean surface wind speed modulation with the most frequent value being 8% (+/- 3.5%). Roll detection at crosswind is associated with stronger roll-induced surface wind en-hancement. Dependencies of roll detection on the incidence and relative azimuth angles are consistent with rapid short-scale wind-wave adjustments to the roll-induced surface wind gusts. These cm-scale waves are highly directional and provide limited crosswind backscatter at shallower incidence angles. The same roll-induced surface forcing is thus not equally detectable at all viewing geometries or polarizaions. Stronger and possibly longer-duration wind forcing is likely needed to produce detectable roll-induced modulations at crosswind.

AB Polar-orbiting ocean color satellites such as Landsat-8, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP), and Sentinel-3 offer valuable image data for the derivation of water bathymetry in optically shallow environments. Because of the multi-spectral limitation, however, it is challenging to derive bathymetry over global shallow waters without reliable mechanistic algorithms. In this contribution, we present and test a physics-based algo-rithm for improved retrieval of bathymetry with multi-spectral sensors. The algorithm leverages the temporal variation of water-column optical properties in two satellite measurements. By incorporating two remote sensing reflectance spectra in an optimization procedure, it enhances the spectral constraining condition for the optimization, thus leading to improved retrieval accuracy. This scheme is evaluated using synthetic multi-spectral data. It is shown that the new approach can provide accurate estimation of water depths over 0-30 m range with three types of benthic substrates (corals, seagrass, and sand) and for a wide range of water column optical properties. Based on the degree of improvement, Landsat-8 appears to be benefited the most, followed by SNPP, and then Sentinel-3. The application of the new approach is demonstrated with satellite images over shallow waters (0-30 m) dominated with coral reefs, seagrass, and sand, respectively. This proof-of-concept study confirms the promise of multi-spectral satellite sensors for accurate water depth retrieval by accounting for the temporal characteristics in multiple measurements, suggesting a path forward for the derivation of bathymetry from the existing satellites over global shallow waters.

AB Monitoring of surface soil moisture (SM) through microwave radiometry typically relies on the inversion of a radiative transfer model. Conventional inversion algorithms require proper calibration of surface roughness and radiometric parameters of the overlying canopy, including the scattering albedo and optical depth. However, uncertainty in global characterization of these parameters is one of the main sources of error in satellite SM retrievals. To cope with this uncertainty, this paper presents a new algorithm, called "temporal polarization ratio algorithm" (TPRA), that enables retrieval of SM independent of surface roughness and vegetation parameters. This approach uses the temporal differences of polarized emissivity observations assuming that the surface roughness and vegetation parameters are invariant over a window of time. Unlike the classical dual channel algorithms (DCA), TPRA is not only free of surface calibration but also robust to systematical errors arising from surface soil temperature errors. One caveat is that the algorithm is unable to retrieve SM when surface emissivity does not change appreciably in time. The performance of TPRA is evaluated through several controlled numerical experiments and validated using the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite retrievals as well as in-situ SM measurements over Australia. The results show improved SM retrievals compared with the DCA and SMAP official products as long as the surface emissivity changes sufficiently over the retrieval time period.

AB Artisanal Small-scale Mining (ASM) is a critical source of livelihoods for large areas of the Global South but it can bring with it many problems, including deforestation, water pollution and low worker safety. Timely and comprehensive management of ASM is crucial to ensure that it can take place safely and cleanly, supporting sustainable development. The informal nature of the sector presents challenges related to documenting the locations of ASM. Remote sensing methods have been used to detect ASM, although difficulties with accuracy, resolution and persistent cloud cover have been encountered. This paper proposes a method of ASM detection using a deep convolutional neural network model applied to open source Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. Firstly, the model is evaluated against both existing ASM detection methods and visual inspection of randomly sampled points. Secondly, the model is used to map mining and urban land use changes over a dataset spanning four years and 6 million hectares of southern Ghana, demonstrating the ability of this method to process very large areas.
   The omission and commission errors of less than 8% from the sampled points indicate that this model has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy for the task of detecting ASM from satellite imagery. When applied to the case study area, the data on ASM trends over time demonstrate a correlation between the Ghanaian government's 2017 clampdown and ASM activities. The ASM land use category decreased by 6000 ha in 2017, despite a net increase of 15000 ha over the period 2015-2019. Additionally, the model was applied to quantify the extent of illegal mining related deforestation within Ghana's protected forests, measured at over 3500 ha, with 2400 of these lost since 2015. The results demonstrate that this methodology can detect ASM in Ghana with a high degree of accuracy at a minimal cost in terms of financial and human resources. The model shows strong generalisation abilities, offering exciting potential for using this methodology to further monitor and analyse ASM related land use changes worldwide.

AB Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), as an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen status, has been non-destructively estimated from canopy reflectance spectra in recent studies. They have also found significant canopy structure and solar angle effects on canopy reflectance spectra, especially for row-structured open crop canopies with varying sunlit and shaded soil backgrounds over seasonal and diurnal cycles. Since the canopy reflectance signature of crops is negligibly contaminated by shaded soil, it can be inferred that LCC should be better estimated when the soil background is under shaded conditions than under sunlit conditions. However, the effects of solar angle or spectral observation time and canopy structure on LCC estimation for row crops have been poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the optimal observation time and to reduce the canopy structural effect for LCC estimation over row-structured crops. To achieve these goals, we simulated canopy reflectance spectra covering four typical crop orientations over seasonal and diurnal cycles based on the leaf optical models (PROSPECT-5B and PROSPECT-D) coupled with canopy radiative transfer models (4SAIL and 4SAIL-RowCrop). Moreover, this study proposed the leaf area index (LAI)-insensitive chlorophyll index (LICI) to mitigate the canopy structural effect on the LCC similar to LICI relationship. LICI and 11 traditional vegetation indices (VIs) were investigated to calibrate semi-empirical LCC similar to VI models with canopy spectral simulations. The performance of those models in LCC estimation was evaluated with experimental datasets measured from both ground and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms.
   Our results showed linear relationships between LICI and LCC for both synthetic and experimental datasets and negligible sensitivity of those models to LAI. Compared to traditional spectral measurements around 12:00 h, LCC estimation could be improved at observation time (15:00 h) that minimized observed sunlit soil fraction for the north-south (NS) row crop orientation. The semi-empirical LCC similar to LICI model (LCC = 52.85 x LICI 16.71) calibrated with the combination of PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL-RowCrop showed the best accuracies among all VIs, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 5.01 mu g/cm(2) and 3.32 mu g/cm(2) for ground-based and UAV-based canopy spectra measured at 15:00 h, respectively. For the commonly used NS row orientation, this study recommends off-noon spectral measurements to avoid the exposure of sunlit soil to the sensor. These findings have great potential for improving the understanding of the canopy structure and solar angle effects on LCC estimation and facilitating the spectral sampling protocols for crop chlorophyll status monitoring.

AB To embrace the burgeoning land change science studies that exploit public-domain cloud-computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), for the first time, we organized a special issue entitled "Remote Sensing of Land Change Science with Google Earth Engine" in the journal "Remote Sensing of Environment". This paper serves as a summary to a collection of 19 papers that have been published since the inception of the special issue in November 2017. In particular, we summarized their contributions with regard to two perspectives: what new themes of questions are articulated, what contributions have been made. Taking account of the disciplinary difference, we carried out the summary separately in two major science domains: Remote Sensing of Environment (RSE), i.e., naturally-induced land change, and Remote Sensing of Society (RSS), i.e., human-induced land change. Furthermore, we presented a historical review of the developments of GEE-relevant studies published before our special issue. Finally, we provided a future prospect on how GEE will continue to evolve to further the study of land change science.

AB Soil Moisture (SM) is a direct indicator of dryness of the land surface, and the amount of precipitation (P), vegetation status, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are directly related to SM; thus, these factors indirectly characterize the dryness of the land surface. However, there are limitations and shortcomings of using a single factor to assess dryness because of the interactions among factors. A method that can combine the advantages of the three factors is needed to better monitor dryness. In this study, a new Remote Sensing (RS) dryness index, called the Temperature Vegetation Precipitation Dryness Index (TVPDI), was defined and developed using the Euclidean distance method and three-dimensional (3D) P-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-LST.The reasonableness of this index was tested and verified using SM data, three variables (P, NDVI, and LST), other recognized dryness indices, crop yield per unit area and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). In addition, the reliability of the TVPDI results was analyzed at different spatial scales and using different data sources. The results demonstrated that the TVPDI was highly correlated with SM (R > 0.64, p < .01) and exhibited better performance than the P, NDVI, and LST results. The time series of the TVPDI and other dryness indices exhibited spatially good consistency. The TVPDI was temporally well-matched to the crop yield per unit area and NPP in most regions of China, and performed better than other dryness indices. Furthermore, in the four sample regions, the TVPDIMODIS results closely matched the TVPDILandsat and Landsat image results, indicating that the TVPDI is a reliable and robust index for dryness monitoring to some extent. Moreover, the application of the TVPDI for dryness-wetness monitoring in China indicated significant spatiotemporal differences in the dryness-wetness status at both monthly and annual scales. The distribution of dryness in China exhibited obvious differences in different agricultural regions. In conclusion, the TVPDI is an RS dryness index that can be applied to dryness assessments.

TI How will radar layover impact SWOT measurements of water surface

AB Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200 m and 10 km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4 cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17 mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments.

AB The NASA L-Band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission launched in 2015 has produced soil moisture and freeze thaw (FT) products at a global scale. While the use of L-band (1.41 GHz) passive microwave radiometry (P-MW) has proven useful in detecting changes in the surface FT state, these classifications have not been comprehensively assessed against similar existing FT products, such as the global FT record from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I, Ka-band, 37.0 GHz) as part of the FT Earth System Data Record (FT-ESDR). In order to fill in this gap, this study investigates regions in which FT classifications diverge and identifies potential sources of classification variability. The SMAP and SSM/I FT records are compared over an extended period covering multiple seasonal cycles from April 2015 through December 2017. The spatially and temporally varying relationship between these products is examined in relation to climate (Koppen-Geiger climate classes and air temperature), MODIS (MoDerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) land cover, and topography (using Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data). SMAP and SSM/I FT product agreement proportion (Ap) was corrected for seasonality and then separated by land cover classes and compared to the global Ap mean. The agreement between these products vary most notably during freeze and thaw onset and in areas near abundant surface water, snow and ice, and wetlands. Relative to other vegetation types, reduced agreement between FT products is also observed over grasslands, sparsely vegetated lands, as well as mixed and evergreen forests. Distinct seasonal differences in FT classification agreement were also detected between products over cold arid regions and between continental and temperate classes. Similarly, as topographic complexity increases, a decreasing trend in agreement between L- and Ka-band FT products is observed. While reiterating challenges in FT classifications identified by prior studies, this work also contributes new insights by providing detailed geospatial and seasonal analyses into the factors contributing to FT product divergence.

AB Radiative transfer models (RTMs) of vegetation canopies can be applied for the retrieval of numerical values of vegetation properties from satellite data. For such retrieval, it is necessary first to apply atmospheric correction to translate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) satellite data into top-of-canopy (TOC) values. This atmospheric correction typically assumes a Lambertian surface reflection, which introduces errors if the real surface is non-Lambertian. Furthermore, atmospheric correction requires atmospheric characterization as input, which is not always available. In this study, we present an RTM for soil-plant-atmosphere systems to model TOC and TOA reflectance as observed by sensors, and to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA reflectance skipping the atmosphere correction processes with the inversion mode of the RTM. The model uses three computationally efficient RTMs for soil (BSM), vegetation canopies (PROSAIL) and atmosphere (SMAC), respectively. The sub-models are coupled by using the four-stream theory and the adding method. The resulting 'Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Radiative Transfer model' (SPART) simulates directional TOA spectral observations, with all major effects included, such as sun-observer geometries and non-Lambertian reflectance of the land surface. A sensitivity anaylsis of the model shows that neglecting anisotropic reflection of the surface in coupling the surface with atmosphere causes considerable errors in TOA reflectance. The model was validated by comparing TOC and TOA reflectance simulations with those simulated with the atmosphere-included version of the DART RTM model. We show that the differences between DART and SPART are less than 7% for simulating TOC reflectance, and are less than 20% (less than 10% at most bands) for simulating TOA reflectance. The model performance in retrieving key vegetation and atmospheric properties was evaluted by using a synthetic dataset and a satellite dataset. The inversion mode allows estimating vegetation properties along with atmospheric properties and TOC reflectance with reasonable accuracy directly from TOA observations, and remarkable accuracy can be achieved if prior information is used in the model inversion. The model can be used to investigate the sensitivity of surface and atmospheric properties on TOC and TOA reflectance and for the simulation of synthetic data of existing and forthcoming satellite missions. More importantly, it facilitates a quantitative use of remote sensing data from satellites directly without the need for atmospheric correction.

AB The changing climate is affecting the frozen soil at an unprecedented rate across the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to sparse ground measurements, the changes of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the vast cryosphere are still unclear, such as in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, a process-based model solely driven by satellite remote sensing data is employed to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost over the entire TP (similar to 3 million km(2)) during 2002-2016 at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Comprehensive validations against in situ observations of frozen ground types, mean annual ground temperature, active layer thickness, soil temperature, and frozen depth at 608 boreholes and 109 meteorological stations demonstrate an overall satisfactory performance of the model in reproducing the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the frozen soil in the region. Spatially, land surface temperature (LST; both in-season and off-season) primarily controls the frozen ground types and frozen depth, with seasonally frozen ground and permafrost covering similar to 56% and similar to 37% of the plateau, respectively. The estimated spatial-averaged annual maximum soil freeze depth (SFD) is similar to 1.29 m, and the annual maximum active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost is similar to 1.85 m. Temporally, ALT shows an overall increasing trend at an average rate of +3.17 cm yr(-1), while SFD exhibits both decreasing (at similar to 62% areas) and increasing (at similar to 38% areas) trends in the region. Again, LST is found to be the dominant factor that controls the temporal changes in both SFD and ALT while precipitation (i.e., both rainfall and snowfall) plays an important (especially in more arid areas and regions near the lower limit of permafrost) but secondary role. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the satellite-based method in frozen soil simulations over large scales with complex topography and landscape and highlight the important roles of both temperature and precipitation in shaping the frozen soil patterns on the TP or other cold, dry regions.

ID SCENE CLASSIFICATION; MODEL
AB Reliable urban land-use maps are essential for urban analysis because the spatial distribution of land use reflects the complex environment of cities under the combined effects of nature and socio-economics. In recent years, very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery interpretation has resolved the "semantic gap" between the low-level data and the high-level semantic scenes, and has been used to map urban land use. Nevertheless, the existing frameworks cannot easily be applied to practical urban analysis, which can be attributed to three main reasons: 1) the indistinguishable socio-economic attributes of the same ground object layouts; 2) the weak transferability of the supervised frameworks and the time-consuming training sample annotation; and 3) the category system inconsistency between the data source and the urban land-use application. In this paper, to achieve an "application gap" breakthrough for urban land-use mapping, a data-driven point, line, and polygon semantic object mapping (PLPSOM) framework is proposed, which makes full use of open-source VHR images and multi-source geospatial data. In the PLPSOM framework, point, line, and polygon semantic objects are represented by the points of interest (POIs), OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and VHR images corresponding to the scenes in the land-use mapping units, respectively. OSM line semantic objects are utilized to supply the boundaries of the land-use mapping units for the POIs and VHR images, forming urban land parcels (street blocks). To reduce the cost of the data annotation, the training dataset is constructed using multiple open-source data sources. An enhanced deep adaptation network (EDAN) is then proposed to acquire the categories of the VHR scene images in the case of partial transfer learning. Finally, in order to meet the actual needs, a rule-based category mapping (RCM) model is applied to integrate the categories of the POIs and VHR images into the urban land-use category system, allowing us to acquire the land-use maps of the cities. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested in four cities of China, including six specific areas: Beijing and Wuhan city centers; the Hanyang District of Wuhan; the Hannan District of Wuhan; Macao; and the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong, achieving a high classification accuracy. The "urban image" analysis confirmed the practicality of the obtained urban land-use maps.

AB Ground-based evaporative fraction (EF) observations have been used widely for validation purposes in previous remote sensing-based EF models. Few studies have investigated whether such measurements can be utilized for calibration use. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method is proposed to quantify EF over a large heterogeneous area within the surface temperature-vegetation index framework. It is designed at both daily scale and seasonal scale with MODIS products and in-situ EF observations over the Southern Great Plains in the US. The goal is to search for the optimal dry edge within the allowable range that minimizes the difference between the estimated and observed EF of a given site. Results show that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has reached a level comparable to those produced by traditional triangle methods. Compared with the daily-scale optimization method, the seasonal-scale optimization method has not only demonstrated its superiority in accuracy but also held distinctive advantages over the traditional triangle methods. Specifically, the dry edge produced by our optimization method holds true under both clear sky and partially cloudy conditions. This has not only bypassed the repetitive work of previous triangle methods but also made it possible to conduct a continuous monitoring of EF. Besides, the optimization method is characterized by its simplicity in algorithm, stability in accuracy and extensibility in parameterization, which makes it a suitable tool for providing a quick and reasonable estimation of EF over large heterogeneous areas from a limited number of in-situ EF observations.

AB Successful post-fire management depends on accurate burn severity maps that are increasingly derived from satellite data, replacing field-based estimates. Post-fire vegetation and soil changes, besides modifying the reflected and emitted radiation recorded by sensors onboard satellites, strongly alters water balance in the fire affected area. While fire-induced spectral changes can be well represented by fraction images from Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), changes in water balance are mainly registered by evapotranspiration (ET). As both types of variables have a clear physical meaning, they can be easily understood in terms of burn severity, providing a clear advantage compared to widely-used spectral indices. In this research work, we evaluate the potential of Landsat-derived ET to estimate burn severity, together with MESMA derived Sentinel-2 fraction images and important environment variables (pre-fire vegetation, climate, topography). In this study, we use the random forest (RF) classifier, which provides information on variable importance allowing us to identify the combination of input variables that provided the most accurate estimate. Our study area is located in Central Portugal, where a mega-fire burned > 450 km(2) from 17 to 24 June 2017. We used the official burn severity map as ground reference. The RF algorithm identified ET as the most important variable in the burn severity model, followed by MESMA char fractions. When both ET and MESMA char fraction image were used as RF inputs, burn severity estimates reached higher accuracy than if only one of them was used, which suggests their potential synergetic interaction. In particular, when environmental variables were used in addition to ET and char fraction, the highest accuracy for burn severity was reached (kappa = 0.79). Our main conclusion is that post-fire fine resolution ET is a useful and easily understandable indicator of burn severity in Mediterranean ecosystems, in particular when used in combination with a MESMA char fraction image. This novel approach to estimate burn severity may help to develop successful post-fire management strategies not only in Mediterranean ecosystems but also in other ecosystems, due to ease of generalization.
