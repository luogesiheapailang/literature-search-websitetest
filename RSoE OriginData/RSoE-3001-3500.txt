AB The seasonal freeze/thaw variations of the active layer cause seasonal ground deformation, such as thaw subsidence in summer and frost heave in winter due to the cyclic phase changes of soil water. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing, especially interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques, has been proven to be a very useful tool for observing surface displacements of permafrost environments. Most previous studies on seasonal InSAR displacement have been concentrated in several study sites in the Arctic tundra regions. The objective of this study is to extend the InSAR analysis of seasonal ground deformations to boreal forest regions, where monitoring ground deformation is particularly important in terms of better understanding active layer dynamics under various ecological and geological conditions. In this study, we presented a strategy to analyze the time series SAR data in the freezing season to estimate the differential phase for seasonal ground deformation while overcoming the problem of coherence losses due to the rapid growth of vegetation during the short growing season. We applied the SBAS-based InSAR processing method to Sentinel-1 SAR in the central Yakutian lowlands, where boreal forests and thermokarst landforms are widely distributed, and retrieved frost-related displacement signals successfully. In addition to the magnitude of ground deformation in the freezing season, we further examined the temporal deformation pattern related to the progression of the freezing front in the soil during active freezing. Based on the Stefan solution, we proposed a piecewise linear model for the time series deformation. The proposed model divides the time series displacement according to the progression of freezing into three linear segments, and the slope parameter of each linear model can be interpreted as indicating the hydrological characteristics of the upper, middle, and lower parts of the soil. The results for the Yakutian lowlands illustrated the potential of SAR remote sensing to observe and quantify spatial details of the thermal and hydrological properties inside the active layer soil even in highly vegetated subarctic boreal forest areas.

AB The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate highlights the importance of blue carbon in tidal wetlands in combating climate change. In this study, we highlight the uncertainty associated with leaf area index (LAI) estimations in tidal wetlands, specifically salt marshes, a key vegetation parameter for productivity models and Earth System Models (ESM). LAI, derived from satellite reflectance data, is linked to atmospheric carbon exchange and gross primary production (GPP) across vegetative ecosystems. However, estimating salt marsh LAI is challenging because canopy height and density vary across short distances, and tidal flooding alters the atmosphere-exposed leaf area, hereafter called emergent leaf area index (ELAI), at short time scales. Further, in tidal wetlands dominated by species such as Spartina alterniflora, canopy height and density vary across short distances. We present a novel approach for measuring spatiotemporal dynamics in tidal wetland ELAI. We modeled ELAI from vertical LAI profiles and created spatial estimates across tidal periods. We then linked ELAI with eddy covariance carbon (C) fluxes through footprint modeling and revealed correlations between emergent leaf area and C fluxes. Next, we demonstrated that ELAI can be readily estimated across 10-m spatial scales using Sentinel-2 satellite data, even during high tides (R2 = 0.89; NRMSE = 10%). Finally, we showed a common product, MODIS MYD15A2H, underestimated (20%) LAI during dry conditions but overestimated (7-93%) during high flooding. Dynamic ELAI could reduce uncertainties in satellite-derived global GPP products when developing blue carbon budgets for ecosystems threatened by accelerated sea level rise.

AB Global success of utilizing X/C/L-band InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) to survey ground deformation over non-forested terrain in the past two decades, has raised interest in monitoring forested lands, where relatively short-wavelength X/C/L SAR acquisitions often experience strong decorrelation and down-graded InSAR quality. To address this challenge, we considered the long-wavelength P-band SAR and conducted a large-area experiment over diverse terrains of the U.S. West Coast to comprehensively assess P-band SAR's capability for ground deformation surveying. Our results show that P-band InSAR observations greatly out-performed L-band data for identifying ground deformation within forested regions and for measuring spatially high-gradient displacements, such as for slow-moving landslides. Over the entire study area, P-band InSAR helped to discover >200 new landslides that were missing from existing landslide inventories. It also demon-strated high capability of penetrating through shallow snowpack to collect SAR signals from the ground surface beneath. However, P-band data manifested lower sensitivity to subtle deformation, as expected theoretically, and encountered coherence loss resulting from heavy snowpack. Overall, P-band SAR demonstrated to be a highly effective tool for discovering deformation beneath dense forest canopies and for quantifying spatially high -gradient displacements. These findings provide an experimental basis for planning future satellite and airborne P-band SAR missions to enhance the capability to monitor changes of the Earth's surface.

AB Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned, and vegetation is allowed to regenerate during fallow periods. Shifting cultivation is usually associated with cutting and burning forests and thus it is an important driver of forest disturbance in the tropics. However, studies of shifting cultivation are limited, and current area estimates of shifting cultivation are highly uncertain. Although Southeast Asia is a hotspot of shifting cultivation, there are no national maps of shifting cultivation in Southeast Asia at moderate or high resolution (less than or equal to 30 m). Monitoring shifting cultivation is challenging because it is highly dynamic, small-scale and results in complex post-disturbance landscapes. In this study, we monitored shifting cultivation using Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine for the entire country of Laos from 1991 to 2020. First, CCDC-SMA (Continuous Change Detection and Classification -Spectral Mixture Analysis) was used to detect forest disturbances. Then, these disturbances were attributed by combining time series analysis, object-based image analysis (OBIA), and post-disturbance land cover classification. Forest dis-turbances were assigned to Shifting cultivation, New plantation, Deforestation, Severe Drought, and Subtle Disturbance annually from 1991 to 2020 at a 30-m resolution. The major forest disturbances in 1991-2020 were mapped with an overall accuracy of 85%. Shifting cultivation is mapped with a producer's accuracy of 88% and a user's ac-curacy of 80%. The margin of error of the sampling-based area estimates of Shifting cultivation is 5.9%. Shifting cultivation is the main land use in Laos, accounting for 32.9% +/- 1.9% of Laos over the past 30 years. To study changes in shifting cultivation over time, the area of shifting cultivation was estimated at 5-year intervals be-tween 1991 and 2020 with all margins of error <17%. Results show that the area of slash-and-burn activities in Laos increased in 2015-2020. Our study provides an effective approach for monitoring shifting cultivation, which can be potentially applied into other regions. Our results not only provide valuable information for land management in Laos, but also can support analysis of spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimation of carbon emissions associated with shifting cultivation for REDD+ reporting.

AB The area-based leaf nitrogen content (LNCA) has gained increasing attention recently in ecology and plant physiology, and the mass-based nitrogen content (LNCM) has been extensively used by agronomists for making fertilization recommendations. Remote sensing has been emerging as an important tool to quantify LNCA and LNCM across multiple observation scales, such as leaf and canopy. Most models for estimating LNCA and LNCM are based on their empirical relationships with chlorophyll-related vegetation indices (VIs), which cannot cap-ture the dynamic allocation of nitrogen into different components throughout the growing season. This study proposed a simplified nitrogen allocation model by dividing the total nitrogen into photosynthetic nitrogen (PN) and non-photosynthetic nitrogen with the purpose of estimating LNCA and LNCM in rice and winter wheat. The nitrogen allocation model was calibrated with an independent leaf-scale dataset (R-2 = 0.82) and then applied to the canopy scale without the need to adjust the model coefficients. The estimated fractions of PN were 71% and 78% for rice and wheat leaves, respectively, which were close to the reported value (similar to 75%) for common C-3 plants. Overall, the nitrogen allocation-based models were applicable for estimating both LNCA and LNCM with relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values <15% for the jointing and booting stages. In addition, our novel estimation model was generic for rice and wheat, yielding the best estimations for LNCM (R-2 = 0.63) across the entire growing season compared with traditional empirical models based on VIs. This study represents a first attempt to couple nitrogen allocation theory with remote sensing data to improve the spectroscopic estimation of LNCA and LNCM.

AB The acquisition of elevation measurements from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and availability of airborne lidar data over the US present an exceptional opportunity to understand vegetation structural estimates provided by ICESat-2. Although a critical forest biophysical attribute, canopy cover is not yet reported from ICESat-2. Thus, there is a need to better understand the application of ICESat-2 for providing canopy cover information. The overall goal of this study was to investigate methods to derive canopy cover and characterize the predictive capability, with ICESat-2. Given availability of dedicated vegetation products (ATL08) and custom noise filtering algorithms developed for ICESat-2 photon data, multiple datasets were evaluated in this study. With focus on two study sites, the Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in south-east Texas and the Solon Dixon Forestry Education Center (SDFEC) in southern Alabama, specific objectives were to: (1) Evaluate equations for estimating canopy cover using custom-processed geolocated photon data, ATL03, and ICESat-2's vegetation product data, ATL08, (2) Compare ICESat-2-derived estimates of canopy cover with airborne lidar canopy cover, and (3) Evaluate a modeling-based approach to improve predictions of canopy cover by leveraging available canopy metrics from ATL08 and custom-processed datasets. A total of six (6) potential measures of canopy cover were investigated in this study, based on 100-m ATL08 segments: (i) percentage of photons above 2 m, (ii) percentage of photons above 4.6 m, (iii) percent of canopy (inside canopy) and top-of -canopy photons of total canopy and ground photons, (iv) percent of canopy of total ground and canopy photons, (v) percent of top-of-canopy of total top-of-canopy and ground photons, and (vi) mean of (iii), (iv) and (v). While strongest correlations were produced from canopy cover computed with (ii) (r between 0.72 and 0.84), similar relationships were indicated from using (iii) and (v) (r values between 0.70 and 0.79). Considering a suite of available canopy parameters, the best R2 and RMSE values from canopy cover estimation models were produced from the use of custom-processed ICESat-2-derived metrics (R2 and RMSE values of 0.77 and 13%). Findings from this study highlight methods for estimating canopy cover with ICESat-2 that may be suitable to a range of cover types, in addition to vegetation settings where cut-offs based on tree heights (e.g., 2 m and 4.6 m) are not applicable. With multiple approaches to characterizing canopy cover, results serve to better understand the applicability of ICESat-2 as a data source for canopy cover information and ultimately inform ongoing efforts for deriving an updated gridded product.

AB The feasibility of soil moisture retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 data has been widely acknowledged, with preoperational 1-km products currently available at regional and/or continental scale using the long-term (LTCD) or short-term change detection (STCD) methods. Both algorithms share the same assumptions of time-invariant roughness and vegetation, which can be questionable even for a short period of 4 Sentinel-1 acquisitions (18-36 days). An advanced change detection (ACD) method is proposed in this study for an improved soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data, including two main modifications with respect to the existing STCD methods: i) approximating the effect of temporal varying vegetation on the Sentinel-1 backscatter as a variation in the two-way attenuation, and ii) a temporal soil moisture constraint based on the coarse Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product to partly remove the uncertainty caused by vegetation and/or roughness changes. The evaluation, based on time-series observations from 34 OzNet stations and ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) showed that the ACD improved the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and un biased RMSE (ubRMSE), achieving 0.66, 0.071 m3/m3 and 0.071 m3/m3 at the point scale, 0.77, 0.063 m3/m3 and 0.051 m3/m3 at 1-km scale, 0.80, 0.055 m3/m3 and 0.050 m3/m3 at 3-km scale. The contribution of the two modifications was further investigated using 559 stations from 22 networks across the world, showing that: i) the two modifications can increase R by 0.08-0.13 and reduce the retrieval RMSE by 0.009-0.013 m3/m3 (10% - 15% relative), and ii) the retrieval over densely vegetated areas or areas with large temporal vegetation variation can benefit more from the proposed modifications. The ACD achieved stable performance for various Sentinel-1 orbits/passes and maintained a stable performance for retrieval windows up to 30 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, providing a promising alternative for achieving consistent soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Knowledge of the location of surface water in time and space is critical to inform policy on the environment, wildlife, and human welfare. Dynamic surface water maps have been created at continental to global scales from medium and coarse resolution satellite image archives, most notably by Pekel et al. (2016), who mapped global water dynamics from 1984 to 2015 Landsat data. Their occurrence layer, depicting the percentage of time that water was observed in each 30 m resolution cell, has been relied upon heavily by Natural Resources Canada's (NRCan) Emergency Geomatics Service (EGS) to map surface water during flood events. To generate dynamic surface water maps that are optimized for Canada's unique geography, the fully automated EGS surface water mapping methodology was applied in a cloud environment to the 1984-2019 Landsat archive over Canada. National-scale surface water maps and derived inundation frequency akin to Pekel's occurrence, as well as inter -annual wetting and drying trends calculated using per-pixel logistic regression, were produced to form the complete dataset. Separate comparisons of our frequency layer with Pekel's occurrence layer and Canada's water base layer from the National Hydrographic Network (NHN) were conducted. The comparison with Pekel's occurrence showed that our product contains a large number of unique water objects, the majority of which are correct when assessed against Google Earth (GE) imagery. Comparison with the NHN indicated that the NHN contained a large number of permanent water objects that were mapped as ephemeral water objects in our product, with the majority of these being verified in GE as true ephemeral water objects such as floodplains and wetlands. Wetting trends were found to be more than five times greater than drying trends across Canada, with notable wetting in the Prairie Pothole region and Low Arctic verified with examples of statistically significant wetting and drying features. The dataset will enhance EGS flood and river ice mapping operations, provide information on floodplain location and extent, and give insight into the effects of climate change on surface water availability.

TI Early- and in-season crop type mapping without current-year ground
   truth: Generating labels from historical information via a

AB Land cover classification in remote sensing is often faced with the challenge of limited ground truth labels. Incorporating historical ground information has the potential to significantly lower the expensive cost associated with collecting ground truth and, more importantly, enable early-and in-season mapping that is helpful to many pre-harvest decisions. In this study, we propose a new approach that can effectively transfer knowledge about the topology (i.e. relative position) of different crop types in the spectral feature space (e.g. the histogram of SWIR1 vs RDEG1 bands) to generate labels, thereby supporting crop classification in a different year. Importantly, our approach does not attempt to transfer classification decision boundaries that are susceptible to inter-annual variations of weather and management, but relies on the more robust and shift-invariant topology information. We tested this approach for mapping corn/soybeans in the US Midwest, paddy rice/corn/soybeans in Northeast China and multiple crops in Northern France using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. Results show that our approach automatically generates high-quality labels for crops in the target year immediately after each image becomes available. Based on these generated labels from our approach, the subsequent crop type mapping using a random forest classifier can reach the F1 score as high as 0.887 for corn as early as the silking stage and 0.851 for soybean as early as the flowering stage and the overall accuracy of 0.873 in the test state of Iowa. In Northeast China, F1 scores of paddy rice, corn and soybeans and the overall accuracy can exceed 0.85 two and half months ahead of harvest. In the Hauts-de-France region, the OA of multiple crop mapping could reach 0.837 based on labels generated from our approach. Overall, these results highlight the unique advantages of our approach in transferring historical knowledge and maximizing the timeliness of crop maps. Our approach supports a general paradigm shift towards learning transferrable and generalizable knowledge to facilitate land cover classification.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of PM2.5 and ozone. Glyoxal can be utilized as an indicator of VOC emission sources and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In this study, the high-resolution satellite observations of glyoxal were utilized to identify anthropogenic VOC sources, which can be utilized to formulate pollution control policies. Glyoxal vertical column densities were firstly retrieved by the TROPO-spheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Glyoxal retrieval is sensitive to wavelength; therefore, four different areas were studied, and the optimum wavelength range of 435-462 nm was determined and applied in the wavelength sensitivity test. Glyoxal slant column density was corrected by utilizing the daily stripe-correction in the Sahara region which reduces the error by approximately 2.2 x 10(14) molec/cm(2). Glyoxal vertical column densities computed using TROPOMI were vali-dated via multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy measurements obtained at three sites; the daily normalized mean bias and standard deviation for the three sites were-27.5 % +/- 6.5%, 1.8% +/- 7.5%, and-6.6 % +/- 17.3%, respectively. Monthly averaged data shows good correlation with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of 0.90, 0.78 and 0.92, at three MAX-DOSA sites, respectively. The global spatial distribution of glyoxal showed large areas of high-concentration glyoxal distributed over tropical rainforests near the equator, which were attributed to biomass combustion and biogenic processes. Numerous urban hotspots were identified to be mainly concentrated in developing countries, especially those in East Asia and the Middle East. The highest glyoxal vertical column densities were observed over eastern China, and the high-glyoxal concentration areas were mainly located over urban and industrial areas, indicating a significant anthropogenic glyoxal source. Kilometer-level TROPOMI can identify factory emission sources that are undetectable by Ozone Monitoring Instrument due to the higher resolution of TROPOMI.

AB In order to determine whether the calving flux of an ice shelf is changing, the long-term calving flux needs to be established. Methods used to estimate the calving flux either take into account non-steady-state behaviour by capturing movement of the calving-front location (e.g., using satellite observations), or they assume the calving front is stationary and that the ice is in steady state (e.g., flux-gate methods). Non-steady-state methods are hampered by the issue of temporal aliasing, i.e., when the satellite observation frequency is insufficient to capture the cyclic nature of the calving-front position. Methods that assume a steady state to estimate the calving flux accrue uncertainties if the ice shelf changes its physical state. In order to overcome these limitations we propose and implement a new observation-based approach that combines a time series of calving-front locations with a flux-gate method. The approach involves the creation of a unique semi-temporal domain as a mechanism to overcome the issue of temporal aliasing, and only requires easily accessible ice thickness and surface velocity estimates of the ice shelf. This approach allows for complex calving-front geometries and captures calving events of all sizes that are visible within the satellite imagery. Application of the approach allows the long-term average calving flux to be estimated (provided sufficient temporal coverage by satellite imagery), as well as identification of the minimum temporal baseline needed to produce a representative estimate of the long-term average calving flux, for any ice shelf. Implementation of the approach to multiple ice shelves would enable comparisons to be made regarding the spatial variability in the long-term calving flux of Antarctica's ice shelves, thereby highlighting calving regime change around the continent.

AB In-season prediction of crop yield is a topic of research studied by several scientists using different methods. Seasonal forecasts provide critical insights to different stakeholders who use the information for strategic and tactical decisions. In this study, we propose a novel scalable method to forecast in season subfield crop yield through a machine learning model based on remotely sensed imagery and data from a process-based crop model on a cumulative crop drought index (CDI) designed to capture the impact of in-season crop water deficit on crops. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we used 352 growers' fields of different sizes across the states of Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois, with 2520 respective yield maps generated by combine harvesters equipped with precise high-resolution yield monitor sensor, over multiple years (from 2006 up to 2019). We obtained high resolution digital elevation model, climate, and soil data to execute the SALUS model, a processbased crop model, to calculate the CDI for each field used in the study. We used Landsat Analysis Ready Dataset (ARD) products generated by USGS as image source to calculate the green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI). We found that the inclusion of the CDI in remote sensing-based random forest models substantially improved inseason subfield corn yield prediction. The addition of the CDI in the yield prediction model showed that the greatest improvements in predictions were observed in the driest year (2012) in our case study. The proposed approach also showed that the subfield spatial variations of corn yield are better captured with the inclusion of CDI for most fields. The earliest prediction in the growing season with GCVI and CDI together outperformed the latest prediction with GCVI alone, highlighting the potential of CDI for predicting spatial variability of maize yield around grain filling period, which is on average close to two months before typical crop harvest in the US Midwest.

AB Recently, the frequency of natural and environmental disasters has increased significantly, causing constant changes on the Earth's surface. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been proved to be useful for operational change monitoring tasks. The multiscale framework presented in this paper aims at detecting and analyzing changes using SAR image time series composed of large-size images. Spatio-temporal changes are initially detected at the subimage scale analysis stage to determine regions and image acquisition dates related to the change occurrence. Detailed changes are then identified at the pixel scale analysis stage between selected acquisitions at each recognized region. This framework was used for flood monitoring over a large area along the central coast of Vietnam (from Thua Thien Hue province to Quang Nam province). We exploited a Sentinel-1 image time series acquired during two rainy seasons and typhoon seasons in the Western Pacific (from September to December of the two years 2017 and 2018). The proposed framework detected flooded areas with a high overall accuracy of 90.4% and could analyze different types of changes that occurred in this time series, i.e. dirac, periodic, chaotic changes, and temporal stability.

AB Tropical dry forests harbor major carbon stocks but are disappearing rapidly across the globe as agriculture expands into them. Unfortunately, carbon emissions from deforestation in dry forests remain poorly understood as high spatial-temporal and vertical heterogeneity complicate biomass mapping. Here, we use a novel Gradient Boosted Regression framework to test the relative gains of combining optical (MODIS) and radar (Sentinel 1) time series, as well as lidar-based (GEDI) canopy-height information, to map biomass in tropical dry forests. We apply our approach across the entire Dry Chaco ecoregion (about 800,000 km2), using an extensive ground dataset of forest inventory plots for training and validation, to map above-ground biomass (AGB) for the year 2019. Our best AGB model had an r2 of 0.89 (RMSE = 15.1 t/ha) with an estimated AGB in remaining natural vegetation of 4.65 Gt (+/- 0.9 Gt). Seasonal metrics from EVI time-series, combined with seasonal Sentinel 1 metrics, had the highest predictive power, while adding GEDI-based canopy height did not improve models. Our resulting AGB maps had a much higher level of agreement with independent ground-data than global AGB products (agreements between r2 = 0.07-0.41), which all suffer from a huge, up to 14-fold, underestimation of AGB in the Chaco. Most of the remaining AGB stored in Chaco woodlands is found in Argentina (2.4 Gt AGB), followed by Paraguay (1.13 Gt AGB) and Bolivia (1.11 Gt AGB). Our results also highlight that 71% of the remaining AGB is located outside protected areas, and around half of the remaining AGB occurs on land utilized by traditional communities. Together, our analyses reveal substantial risk of continued high carbon emissions should agricultural expansion progress. Considerable co-benefits appear to exist between protecting traditional livelihoods and carbon stocks. Our map, the most accurate and fine-scale AGB map for this global deforestation hotspot, can serve as a basis for land-use and conservation planning aimed at leveraging such co-benefits. More broadly, our analyses reveal the considerable potential of combining time series of optical and radar data for a more reliable mapping of above-ground biomass in tropical dry forests and savannas.

AB Vegetation cover significantly influences the hydrometeorological processes of land surfaces. The heterogeneity of vegetation cover makes these processes more complex and impacts the interaction between water held in the soil matrix and vegetation cover. The backscatter measured by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is sensitive to target dielectric and morphological properties. In addition, SAR acquisitions are weather-independent, providing a major advantage over optical imaging during periods of cloud cover. Most often, vegetation properties are measured using vegetation indices, including simple ratios of backscatter intensities. However, this approach can miss the scattered wave purity from vegetation targets. The scattered wave characteristic is an essential parameter as it is susceptible to the complex random structure of vegetation. In this study, we propose a novel dual-polarimetric SAR vegetation descriptor based on the co-pol purity component of the wave. We use this descriptor within a semi-empirical vegetation model to estimate soil moisture. It is noteworthy that this proposed method to retrieve soil moisture uses only the dual-polarimetric Ground Range Detected (GRD) SAR product, i.e., only backscatter intensities. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential for operational scale monitoring applications at a global scale. This study validated different crop types (viz. canola, oats, forage, maize, soybeans, sugar beet, wheat, winter wheat, winter barley) over two test sites using airborne SAR data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for soil moisture are within the range of 4.3% to 7.7% with the Pearson correlation coefficient r greater than 0.6. This novel descriptor will facilitate the operational use of dual-polarimetric GRD SAR data for vegetation monitoring and soil moisture estimation.

AB The existence of clouds affects the quality of optical remote sensing images. Cloud removal is an important preprocessing procedure to effectively improve the utilization of optical remote sensing images. Thin clouds partly obscure the land surfaces beneath them, making it possible to correct the cloudy scenes according to the available information. In this research, we introduce the attention mechanism-based generative adversarial networks for cloud removal (AMGAN-CR) method for Landsat images. First, attention maps of the input cloudy images are generated to extract the cloud distributions and features through an attentive recurrent network. Second, clouds are removed by an attentive residual network under the guidance of the attention maps. Finally, the generated feature maps are fed to a reconstruction network to restore the final cloud-free images. The networks are trained by cloudy and cloud-free Landsat image pairs, and the cloudy images are tested to validate the effectiveness of AMGAN-CR. Both simulated and real cloud experimental results show that the proposed method is more outstanding than the other five state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods in removing cloud.

AB Long-term excessive groundwater exploitation for agricultural, domestic and stock applications has resulted in substantial ground subsidence in Arizona, USA, and especially in the Willcox Groundwater Basin. The land subsidence rate of the Willcox Basin has not declined but has rather increased in recent years, posing a threat to infrastructure, aquifer systems, and ecological environments. In this study, we first investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence in the Willcox Groundwater Basin using an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analytical approach with L-band ALOS and C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired from 2006 to 2020. The overall deformation patterns are characterized by two major zones of subsidence, with the mean subsidence rate increasing with time from 2006 to 2020. An approach based on independent component analysis (ICA) was adopted to separate the mixed InSAR time series signal into a set of independent signals. The application of ICA to the Willcox Basin not only revealed that two different spatiotemporal deformation features exist in the basin but also filtered the residual errors in InSAR observations to enhance the deformation time series. Integrating the InSAR deformation and groundwater level data, the response of the aquifer skeletal system to the change in hydraulic head was quantified, and the hydromechanical properties of the aquifer system were characterized. Historical spatiotemporal storage loss from 1990 to 2020 was also estimated using InSAR measurements, hydraulic head and estimated skeletal storativity. Understanding the characteristics of land surface deformation and quantifying the response of aquifer systems in the Willcox Basin and other groundwater basins elsewhere are important in managing groundwater exploitation to sustain the mechanical health and integrity of aquifer systems.

AB Landscape fire is a widespread, somewhat unpredictable phenomena that plays an important part in Earth's biogeochemical cycling. In many biomes worldwide fire also provides multiple ecological benefits, but in certain circumstances can also pose a risk to life and infrastructure, lead to net increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and to degradation in air quality and consequently human health. Accurate, timely and frequently updated information on landscape fire activity is essential to improve our understanding of the drivers and impacts of this form of biomass burning, as well as to aid fire management. This information can only be provided using satellite Earth Observation (EO) approaches, and remote sensing of active fire is one of the key techniques used. This form of EO is based on detecting the signature of the (mostly infrared) electromagnetic radiation emitted as biomass burns. Since the early 1980's, active fire (AF) remote sensing conducted using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has been deployed in certain regions of the world to map the location and timing of landscape fire occurrence, and from the early 2000's global-scale information updated multiple times per day has been easily available to all. Geostationary (GEO) satellites provide even higher frequency AF information, more than 100 times per day in some cases, and both LEO-and GEO-derived AF products now often include estimates of a fires characteristics, such as its fire radiative power (FRP) output, in addition to the fires detection. AF data provide information relevant to fire activity ongoing when the EO data were collected, and this can be delivered with very low latency times to support applications such as air quality forecasting. Here we summarize the history of achievements in the field of active fire remote sensing, review the physical basis of the approaches used, the nature of the AF detection and characterization techniques deployed, and highlight some of the key current capabilities and applications. Finally, we list some important developments we believe deserve focus in future years.

AB Rivers are among the most dynamic components in Earth's terrestrial water cycle and provide critical ecosystem services. Yet, the spatiotemporal variability of river surface extents remains largely unquantified at the global scale. Satellite remote sensing provides a promising alternative to in-situ observations, which can enable a more comprehensive survey and systematic analysis of global rivers at fine spatial resolutions. The study examines the spatiotemporal variability of river surface extent globally and its natural driving factors, by combining the use of Landsat-based Global Surface Water (GSW) and Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) databases. In addition to examining the long-term mean river surface extent in various climate zones, we perform statistical analyses to correlate monthly times series of fractional river extent with the terrestrial water storage (TWS) components obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model simulations. Results show that the spatiotemporal variability of water presence in rivers can be explained well via differentiating climate zones. The analysis also shows that 52.7% of the global maximum river extent is covered by water less than half of time. Changes of fractional river extent are found to be highly correlated with groundwater storage in low- and mid-latitudes, whereas snow melting dominates the river dynamics in high latitudes. By examining the extremes of fractional river extent, we found that the abrupt changes of fractional river extent are well linked to precipitation anomalies in the equatorial, arid, and warm temperate areas. This study offers an innovative perspective to study spatiotemporal dynamics of rivers by combining optical remote sensing (Landsat), gravimetry observations (GRACE), and land surface simulations; and it highlights the significant role of low-flow-generating processes (snow melting, infiltration, and recharge-discharge) in controlling river dynamics in certain regions, which warrants future investigation.

AB We propose a signal deconvolution procedure for imaging spectrometer data, where a measured point spread function (PSF) is deconvolved itself before being used for deconvolution of the signal. We evaluate the effectiveness of our procedure for improvement of the spatio-spectral signal, as well as our target application, i.e. estimation of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). Imaging spectrometers are well established instruments for remote sensing. When used for scientific purposes these instruments are usually calibrated on a regular basis. In our case the point spread function of the optics is measured in an elaborate procedure with a tunable monochromator point light source. PSFs are measured at different pixel positions of the imaging sensor, i.e. at different spatiospectral locations, and averaged in order to get an as accurate PSF as possible. We investigate error sources in this calibration process by simulating the procedure in silico. Averaging as well as the spectral and spatial width of the point source introduce some smoothness in the measured PSF. We propose corrective measures, i.e. deconvolution of the PSF itself and median instead of mean averaging, leading to a set of sharper PSFs. We test the performance of these PSFs in deconvolving simulated as well as real hyperspectral images. For deconvolution we test a set of well-known, off the shelf deconvolution algorithms. Quantitatively in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) a combination of Wiener filtering and sharpened PSFs yields strongest improvements, while using Wiener filtering with non-sharpened PSFs even deteriorates the signal. Comparing deconvolution results of the simulated data with results of real data reveals, that visually very similar effects can be observed. This well supports the assumption, that our findings are also valid for real spatio-spectral data. Surprisingly, the choice of PSF, sharpened or not, is of little effect for SIF estimation with the iFLD algorithm in the O(2)A band. Quantitatively we find that deconvolution reduces the overall error of SIF by a factor of 3.8, when using Wiener filtering instead of the currently used 1 iteration of vanCittert's method. For SIF estimation in the O2B band we observe a totally different behavior, where all deconvolution methods yield unreliable results with mostly well above 200% relative error and high standard deviations. In the discussion we can only speculate on possible reasons for this unreliability. As conclusion we therefore propose to use the O(2)A band for SIF estimation together with classic Wiener filtering for deconvolution of spatio-spectral data.

AB The detection and repairment of methane leaks from fossil fuel production activities have been identified as a key climate change mitigation strategy. Several types of optical satellite sensors have recently shown potential to support this task. Spaceborne imaging spectrometers measuring in the 400-2500 nm spectral range belong to this group. These instruments measure the solar radiation reflected by the Earth in hundreds of spectral channels with a typical spectral resolution of 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m. The PRISMA mission from the Italian Space Agency is the first system of this type providing data openly to the international scientific community. In this work, we evaluate the potential of PRISMA to map methane point emissions, which are typical for fossil fuel production activities. Our retrieval of methane concentration enhancements is based on a matched-filter based algorithm applied to PRISMA spectra in the 2300 nm shortwave infrared spectral region. We perform a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to assess the retrieval performance for different sites. We find that surface brightness and homogeneity are major drivers for the detection and quantification of methane plumes with PRISMA, with retrieval precision errors ranging from 61 to 197 parts-per-billion in the evaluated images. The potential of PRISMA for methane mapping is further illustrated by real plume detections at different methane hotspot regions, including oil and gas extraction fields in Algeria, Turkmenistan, and the USA (Permian Basin), and coal mines in the Shanxi region in China. Our study reports several important findings regarding the potential and limitations of PRISMA for methane mapping, most of which can be extrapolated to upcoming satellite imaging spectroscopy missions.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) intensity is used as an input to many flood-mapping algorithms. The appearance of floodwater tends to cause a substantial decrease of backscatter intensity over scarcely vegetated terrain. However, limitations exist in areas where the SAR backscatter is not sufficiently sensitive to surface changes, e.g. shadow areas due to topography or obstacles on the ground, densely forested areas, sand, etc. Thus, we argue that it is of paramount importance to complement any SAR-based flood extent map with an exclusion map (EXmap) indicating all areas where the presence of water cannot be derived from SAR intensity observations. In this study, we introduce a methodology for generating an EX-map based on the analysis of time-series of SAR backscatter data. In particular, the identification of the EX-map is based on the combined use of three temporal indicators based on backscatter statistics, i.e. temporal median, minimum and standard deviation. As a test case, EX-maps were derived from Sentinel-1 data acquired during the 2014-2019 time period from six representative study sites. Reference maps were generated using a global land cover map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM)derived shadow/layover masks, global urban footprint (GUF) data and a Sand Exclusion Layer (SEL). The crosscomparison revealed that the EX-map was consistent with reference maps obtained from other data sources.

AB We propose an innovative multi-pixel atmospheric correction approach (MPACA) to process high-spatialresolution satellite measurements over coastal waters based on a revised POLYMER model. MPACA assumes the aerosol type to be uniform within a relatively small region, while the aerosol load and water properties are allowed to vary. Landsat-8 OLI images over six coastal locations with various turbidities were utilized to evaluate the performance of MPACA. The retrieved remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) by MPACA is validated with in situ matchups obtained from two sources: ship-based field campaigns and the AERONET-OC networks. It is found that, at each of OLI's four visible bands, MPACA provided accurate R-rs(lambda) products over such coastal environments, with the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and Mean Absolute Percentage Difference (MAPD) less than 0.0006 sr(-1) and 16.2%, respectively. In contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved with NASA's SeaDAS (v7.5), where each pixel was treated independently, showed RMSD and MAPD as similar to 0.0018 sr(-1) and similar to 38.8%, respectively. Acolite-DSF, which assumed some spatial dependency, obtained MAPD almost two times that of SeaDAS for each visible band. Further, it appears that Acolite-EXP did not perform well for this evaluation dataset, where RMSD is similar to 0.0062 sr(-1) and MAPD is similar to 228.2%. These results suggest that MPACA is a promising scheme for atmospheric correction in coastal waters, especially for measurements from multi-band satellites that have a high spatial resolution along with at least two bands in the NIR or SWIR domain.

AB Snow cover is highly critical for global water and energy cycles because of its wide areal extent, high reflectivity and good thermal insulation. Knowledge of snow conditions, e.g., snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth, is significant to hydrologic and climatologic processes. Spaceborne passive microwave (PMW) data, namely, brightness temperature (TB), have been in use for snow depth and SWE retrieval at the global scale since 1978. However, the sensitivity of TB to these parameters is complex due to snow metamorphism (e.g., snow grain size, GS), which limits the feasibility of many existing algorithms characterizing snow. This study presents a new methodology to retrieve snow depth over China by coupling a microwave snow emission model with a random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) technique. An effective GS value (effGS), a prior snowpack descriptor, was optimized utilizing the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) model by minimizing the difference between AMSR2 observations (18.7 and 36.5 GHz) and HUT simulations. Five elaborately selected independent variables, including vertical polarized TB differences (TBD) between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz (TBD18.7V&36.5V), 10.65 and 36.5 GHz (TBD10.65V&36.5V), longitude, elevation and effGS, together with the target variable, snow depth, were applied to train the RF model, and then the 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) approach was employed for performance validation using station data during the period from 2012 to 2018. The results indicated that (1) inclusion of effGS in RF greatly enhanced the overall performance in snow depth estimation; (2) the trained RF model performed better on a temporal scale than on a spatial scale, with unRMSEs of 1.81 cm and 3.17 cm, respectively; (3) specifically, the fitted RF algorithm partially addressed the overestimation in shallow (<= 20 cm) snowpacks and underestimation in deep (> 20 cm) snow conditions when compared with the established RF algorithm based solely on predictor variables but without effGS. To evaluate the predictive power of the RF algorithm trained with samples in 2017 and 2018, spatially independent station measurements during the period from 2012 to 2016 and field survey data collected from January 2018 to March 2019 were used for validation. Additionally, the RF estimates were compared with two widely used satellite products (AMSR2 and GlobSnow-2). The validation results showed that RF estimates were closer to the in situ data than the other two satellite products. This study demonstrated the potential utility of combining the snow emission model with an ML approach to improve snow depth estimation.

AB Surface downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is a fundamental variable in determining the Earth's radiation balance and is essential in many applications. Considerable efforts have been devoted to algorithm development, product generation, and validation. However, few studies have focused on comparing retrieval approaches, examining their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying the most suitable scenarios for each approach. In this study, we implemented and evaluated five representative DSR retrieval algorithms, including the forward parameterization approach, two physical inversion methods (look-up table (LUT) and optimization), and two statistical inversion methods (direct estimation and neural networks). We then proposed an algorithm-integration framework that combined the results of these DSR retrieval methods to further improve DSR estimation accuracy and consistency. To validate the DSR retrievals, we used in-situ data collected at 25 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) over one year. Validation revealed that forward parameterization consistently performed best, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 91.7 W/m(2) or a relative RMSE of 16.9%, although it generated the fewest valid retrievals. For an identical data set, the LUT approach generated results comparable to those of parameterization. The neural network-based algorithm-integration approach reduced the RMSE by 11.0 W/m(2) or the relative RMSE by 2.0%, compared to the best individual retrieval algorithm. Our analysis demonstrates that algorithm integration is a promising way to obtain DSR data that are superior to estimates from any individual retrieval algorithm.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) has been effectively retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite measurements under clear-sky conditions. However, TIR satellite data are often severely contaminated by clouds, which cause spatiotemporal discontinuities and low retrieval accuracy in the LST products. Several solutions have been proposed to fill the "gaps"; however, a majority of these possess constraints. For example, fusion methods with microwave data suffer from coarse spatial resolution and diverse land cover types while spatial-temporal interpolation methods neglect cloudy cooling effects. We developed a novel method to estimate cloudy-sky LST from polar-orbiting satellite data based on the surface energy balance (SEB) principle. First, the hypothetical clear-sky LST of missing or likely cloud-contaminated pixels was reconstructed by assimilating high-quality satellite retrievals into a time-evolving model built from reanalysis data using a Kalman filter data assimilation algorithm. Second, clear-sky LST was hypothetically corrected by accounting for cloud cooling based on SEB theory. The proposed method was applied to Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and further validated using ground measurements of fourteen sites from SURFRAD, BSRN, and AmeriFlux in 2013. VIIRS LST recovered from cloud gaps exhibited a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.54 K, a bias of -0.36 K, R-2 of 0.94, and sample size (N) of 2411, comparable to the accuracy of clear-sky LST products and cloudy-sky LST estimation from MODIS (RMSE of 3.69 K, bias of -0.45 K, R-2 of 0.93, and N of 2398). Thus, the proposed method performs well across different sensors, seasons, and land cover types. The abnormal retrieval values caused by cloud contamination were also corrected in the proposed method. The overall accuracy was better than the downscaled cloudy-sky LST retrieved from passive microwave (PMW) observations and former SEB-based cloudy-sky LST estimation methods. Validation using time-series measurements showed that the all-sky LST time series, including both clear- and cloudy-sky retrievals, can capture realistic variability without sudden abruptions or discontinuities. RMSE values for the all-sky LST varied from 2.54 to 4.15 K at the fourteen sites. Spatially continuous LST maps over the Contiguous United States were compared with corresponding maps from PMW data in the winter and summer of 2018, exhibiting similar spatial patterns but with additional spatial details. Moreover, sensitivity analysis suggested that the reconstruction of clear-sky LST dominantly impacts the accuracy of cloudy-sky LST estimation. The proposed method can be potentially implemented in similar satellite sensors for global real-time production.

AB Spatio-temporal changes in water temperature and discharge of the Arctic rivers are important variables to be observed not only for estimating runoff contributions from snow melt, rainfall, and thawing of permafrost over the continents but also for assessing their impacts on the Arctic sea-ice and marine ecosystem. Nevertheless, the number of ground water gauging stations and the frequency of in-situ measurements for temperature and discharge has been decreasing since the 20 Century due to the shrinkage of budgets for maintaining the in-situ stations. In this study, we explored the possibility to perform near-daily monitoring of river surface temperature (RST) and river channel width (RCW) from space using a Japanese satellite-borne optical sensor named SGLI which can observe radiances at the spectral bands from near-ultraviolet to thermal infrared regions at the same spatial resolution of 250-m on a global scale. River surface brightness temperature (RSBT) measured with SGLI TIR band was used as RST without atmospheric correction. RCW was derived as the widths of water pixels identified along river channels using SGLI reflectances at visible to shortwave infrared bands. Analysis results of two-year SGLI data acquired in 2018 and 2019 show that RSBT and RCW can be retrieved successfully from the SGLI observations on a daily basis after applying a spatio-temporal interpolation. The accuracies of the retrieved RSBT evaluated with in-situ water temperatures are about 2.57 K with the interpolation (and 1.84 K without the interpolation but with lower observation frequencies). Retrieved RCWs are correlated well with in-situ river water discharges indicating potentials to assess variations of not only snow melt water but also precipitation within the river basin. Thus, SGLI data can be used to reconstruct not only the river water temperature but also the river water discharges along the continental river channels for assessing heat flux flowing into the Arctic Ocean.

TI Impacts of MOPITT cloud detection revisions on observation frequency and

AB Measurements made by the MOPITT ("Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere") instrument on the NASA Terra polar-orbiting platform enable the retrieval of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. As determined by the Terra orbit and MOPITT swath width, the frequency of MOPITT observations at a specific location, or measurement sampling frequency, is typically about once every three to four days. However, because the MOPITT retrieval algorithm is only applicable to clear-sky scenes, MOPITT retrieval sampling frequency strongly depends on regional cloudiness and can be much smaller than the measurement sampling frequency. Moreover, highly polluted scenes, characterized by high aerosol optical depths, can be confused with cloudy scenes and thus be discarded unnecessarily by the MOPITT cloud detection algorithm. Herein are described revisions to this algorithm which substantially increase retrieval sampling over land in varying pollution conditions. The performance of the revised cloud detection algorithm is evaluated through validation, case studies, and continental-scale maps of retrieval sampling frequency. Presented case studies illustrate (1) why the current operational MOPITT cloud detection algorithm excludes extended areas of potentially valuable cloud-free MOPITT observations and (2) how, for the same scenes, improved retrieval coverage benefits analyses of regional CO variability. Maps of retrieval sampling frequency for South America and Asia exhibit well-defined improvements, especially in regions with poor sampling frequency in the current product.

AB Cloud detection is not only a challenging task, but it also plays a major role in image processing. Due to the diversity of the cloud and the complexity of underlying surfaces, most of the current cloud detection methods still face great challenges, especially in detecting thin cloud. Therefore, we propose a method to detect cloud pixels in the GaoFen-1 WFV images. In our method, a deep network is used to learn the multi-scale global features so that the high-level semantic information obtained in the process of feature learning is integrated with the low-level spatial information in order to classify images into cloud and non-cloud regions. In addition, Up and Down blocks are designed using the Haar wavelet transform in order to fully exploit the structural information of images, and especially the texture information of the cloud, which can be learned targetedly. We pay attention to the original information of images in order to assist the learning for the network. In addition, we have also utilized dark channel prior and designed a Successive Multi-scale Spatial Attention Module by adding attention mechanisms to multi-scale feature maps in the network in order to provide a consistent improvement in the performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed network performs well under different scenarios.

AB Ground observation absence in many parts of the world highlights the importance of merged satellite precipitation products. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of different sources of data in the uncertainties of a merged satellite product, by comparing the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final product (V06B) with a ground-based radar product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), using both pixel-based and object-based approaches. This study is focused on the eastern United States (land-only) during the hurricane days that occurred in 2016?2018. The results showed that IMERG had better agreement in terms of the average precipitation intensity and area with a bias reduction of 75% and 65%, respectively, when the passive microwave (PMW) sensor overpass is matched instantaneously with MRMS compared to temporally averaged MRMS data (MRMS-Averaged). PMW observations tend to show storms with smaller areas in the IMERG Final product in comparison with MRMS, possibly due to the effect of light precipitation not detected properly by PMW sensors. However, by removing the light precipitation (less than 1 mm/h) in the object-based approach, hurricane objects in the IMERG Final product tend to be larger during the PMW observations, which might be related to different viewing angles of sensors contributing to MRMS and IMERG products. Precipitation estimates have smaller areas with higher average intensity during the PMW observations in the IMERG Final product compared to data estimated by Morphed or IR (morph/IR) observations, which is probably related to the effect of morphing technique, leading to homogenization of the varying rainstorm characteristics. In addition, with the longer absence of PMW observations, the quality of morph/IR estimates in IMERG Final product deteriorates with a decreasing correlation coefficient, a growth in precipitation area and a downward trend in average precipitation intensity. Finally, the inter-comparison of PMW sensors showed the priority of imagers over sounders with GMI as the best among imagers and MHS as the best among sounders in terms of correlation and average intensity compared to MRMS; however, SSMIS was the best in capturing the precipitation area.

AB Continuous monitoring of water surfaces is essential for water resource management. This study presents a nonparametric unsupervised automatic algorithm for the identification of inland water pixels from multispectral satellite data using multidimensional clustering and a high-performance subsampling approach for large scenes. Clustering analysis is a technique that is used to identify similar samples in a multidimensional data space. The spectral information and derived indices were used to characterize each scene pixel individually. A machine learning approach with random subsampling and generalization through a Na ve Bayes classifier was also proposed to make the application of complex algorithms to large scenes feasible. Accuracy was evaluated using an independent dataset that provides water bodies in 15 Sentinel-2 images over France acquired in different seasons and that covers a large range of water bodies and water colour types. The validation dataset covers a water surface of more than 1200 km(2) (approximately 12 million pixels) including over 80,000 water bodies outlined using a semiautomatic active learning method, which were manually revised. The classification results were compared to the water pixel classification using three of the major Level 2A processors (MAJA, Sen2Cor and FMask) and two of the most common thresholding techniques: Otsu and Canny-edge. An input mask was used to remove coastal waters, clouds, shadows and snow pixels. Water pixels were identified automatically from the clustering process without the need for ancillary or pretrained data. Combinations using up to three water indices (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index-MNDWI, Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI and Multiband Water Index-MBWI) and two reflectance bands (B8 and B12) were tested in the algorithm, and the best combination was NDWI-B12. Of all the methods, our method achieved the highest mean kappa score, 0.874, across all tested scenes, with a per-scene kappa ranging from 0.608 to 0.980, and the lowest mean standard deviation of 0.091. Standard Otsu's thresholding had the worst performance due to the lack of a bimodal histogram, and the Canny-edge variation achieved an overall kappa of 0.718 when used with the MNDWI. For water masks provided by generic processors, FMask outperformed MAJA and Sen2Cor and obtained an overall kappa of 0.764. In-depth analysis shows a quick drop in performance for all of the methods in identifying water bodies with a surface area below 0.5 ha, but the proposed approach outperformed the second best method by 34% in this size class.

AB During spruce budworm (SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreaks, defoliation causes severe tree damage and mortality to spruce-balsam fir (Picea spp.-Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) forests. Annual defoliation thematic maps provide vital information for forest protection planning against outbreaks, but such data are challenging to accurately collect over large areas during a short (2-3 week) period when damaged foliage peaks. Current operational methods for estimating annual defoliation are aerial surveys, through visual observations by professionals from small aircraft, defining broad defoliation classes which are subjective and spatially can be inaccurate. Remote sensing studies estimating annual defoliation are limited due to lack of ground verification data and difficulty of capturing spectral changes specific to the short detection period. Only one study has used satellite hyperspectral imagery to detect annual SBW defoliation, classifying just two classes of defoliation and using inaccurate aerial survey results for training and validation. In this paper, we introduce a new method to estimate annual SBW defoliation in three classes (light <= 30%, moderate 30-70%, and severe >= 70%), using change detection of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from satellite (EO-1 Hyperion) hyperspectral imagery acquired before and after annual defoliation. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers were used to classify defoliation, and intensive field measurements of branch-level defoliation per plot were used for accuracy assessment. Field plots, with spatially correlated defoliation within stands, were used to derive an additional 624 plots to obtain sufficient and independent datasets for training and validating the detection results. The top four VIs for detecting annual defoliation, based on Random Forest Total Variable Importance Score and Spearman's rank correlations, were Plant Senescence Reflectance Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, Moisture Stress Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index. The spectral regions of VIs used to classify defoliation included visible, near-infrared, red-edge, and shortwave infrared. Accuracies of the light, moderate, and severe defoliation classes using our method ranged from 55-85%, 40-76%, and 40-80%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the 32% accuracy of aerial survey defoliation data for the plots.

AB The Amazon Basin, a major driver of atmospheric CO2 fluxes, is composed of moist tropical forest (> 2000 mm mean annual precipitation), seasonally moist tropical forests (< 2000 mm mean annual precipitation), croplands, and pastures. It is debated whether there is a dry-season increase in photosynthesis for moist forest and a large reduction in photosynthesis of tropical South America was recently cited as a major driver of the historically high atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the 2015/2016 El Nino. To address this debate and to gain insight into changes in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, here we investigate (1) dry-season changes in satellite-based greenness, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and photosynthesis during 2007-2017 and (2) anomalies of satellite-based dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis for two El Nino events (2009/2010 and 2015/2016) and two La Nina events (2007/2008 and 2010/2011). We hypothesize that satellite-based greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forests should increase during the dry season, and find this to be the case using two MODIS BRDF-adjusted vegetation indices (EVI and NDVI), GOME-2 SIF data, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM). We also hypothesize that dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis should be anomalously high during the El Ninos, due to anomalously high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a relatively normal preceding wet season, and anomalously low during the La Ninas because these dry seasons were preceded by anomalously low amounts of wet-season precipitation. For this hypothesis, we present results for moist tropical forest and at the basin scale to determine if and by how much their anomalies differ. We find dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forest and at the basin scale were statistically significantly lower than normal during the La Ninas, significantly higher than normal during the 2009/2010 El Nino, and were mixed for the 2015/2016 El Nino. Although statistically significant, the magnitudes of the dry-season anomalies were not substantial. Our findings provide additional evidence that photosynthesis of moist tropical Amazon forest increases during the dry season and narrows the potential drivers of perturbations to the atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the last four ENSO events, as anomalies in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during these ENSO events were minute.

AB Soil moisture retrieval from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) over vegetated terrains requires an isolation of soil and canopy signals from observed backscatter (sigma degrees). This study develops a probabilistic soil moisture retrieval method from dual polarimetric C-band SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) with uncertainty quantification at distinct vegetation covers (VCs). Both sigma(VV)degrees and sigma(VH)degrees were used to represent ground and volume scattering due to the high respective sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. A novel D-vine copula quantile regression (DVQR) was adopted to provide the soil moisture estimates based on modelling trivariate dependence of sigma(VV)degrees-sigma(VH)degrees -soil moisture anomalies (VV-VH-Mv), with a support from the innovative cosmic-ray soil moisture as ground-truth data. The feasibility of DVQR was underlined for: (1) multivariate nonlinear dependence structure modelling and (2) soil moisture retrieval with associated uncertainty. An inter-dependence analysis, which assesses the correlations among three major variables, indicated that the dependence between each pair of variables decreased as canopy density increases from herbs to forests, mainly due to the ci degrees attenuated by vegetation effect. The dependence structures simulated from the D-vine copula revealed highly nonlinear and asymmetric shapes with tail dependences occurred in most VCs, which can be well captured by different associated Archimedean copulas. Soil moisture anomaly (Mv) estimated using the DVQR and Multiple linear quantile regression (MLQR) were compared against ground-truth data for both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. Superior performances of the DVQR in most VCs, with 10% and 16% improved in RMSE at grasslands and broadleaf forests, respectively, demonstrated the robustness of this method for S-1 soil moisture retrieval due to the highly nonlinear dependence structures captured by the D-vine models. Over VCs, better performances were obtained at low-canopy herbaceous regions (grasslands and croplands); whereas extremely dry conditions and complex structures in shrublands and dense forests resulted in inferior performances. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to evaluate the change in My estimation accuracy given distinct VV and VH quantile levels. Result underlines that VV is the primary factor controlling the retrieval accuracy, but the increase in VH level also contributes to higher errors in soil moisture estimation, especially under wet conditions.

AB Sea surface temperature is an Essential Climate Variable. The radiative impact of mineral dust is one of the major contributors to inaccuracies in the satellite-retrieved sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin). Different aerosol dust vertical distributions have varying effects on the satellite-derived SSTskin. To further investigate the physical mechanisms of aerosol effects on Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) derived SSTskin, the aerosol radiative effects were studied with a field-data match-up analysis and radiative transfer simulations. The field data are measurements of the SSTskin derived from highly accurate ship-based infrared spectrometers vertical atmospheric temperature and water vapor radiosonde profiles. The aerosol dust concentrations in three-dimensions from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 have been used as input to radiative transfer simulations. Based on the analysis field data and simulations, we have empirically determined that the sensitivity of the Terra MODIS retrieved SSTskin accuracies is related to 1) dust concentration the atmosphere, 2) the dust layer altitude, and 3) the dust layer temperature. As the aerosol altitude increases, the effect on the SSTskin retrievals becomes more negative in proportion to the temperature contrast with the sea surface. SSTskin differences, satellite-derived surface measurements, for a given aerosol layer optical depth vary between-3 K and 1 K according to our match-up comparisons and radiative transfer simulations.

AB This study provides the first report of reflectance spectra of coral-spawn slicks and their detection using optical satellite data. The reflectance spectra show that coral-spawn slicks can be discriminated from other sea-surface features such as wave foam and floating Sargassum. Analysis of Planet Dove and Sentinel-2B imagery allowed successful detection of coral-spawn slicks at Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan (24 degrees 31'40 '' N, 124 degrees 17'31 '' E), by using reflectance values in the green and red wavelength regions. This detection was attributable to both their high spatial resolution (3.7 m and 10 m, respectively) and high temporal resolution (1 day and 5 days, respectively), given that coral spawning occurs within a short period (up to several days), typically once a year, and that the coral-spawn slicks have narrow widths of similar to 10 m. The number of the detected coral-spawn slicks was small, possibly because of coral decline around Ishigaki Island caused by the 2016 worldwide mass coral bleaching event. High-frequency satellite observations, including those from satellite constellations, should provide a powerful tool for understanding coral-reef processes and features whose detection requires high spatial and temporal resolution.

AB Scatterometer observations over land are sensitive to the water content in soil and vegetation, but have been rarely used to study seasonal changes in the plant water status and seasonal development of deciduous trees. Here we use Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) observations to investigate the sensitivity of C-band backscatter to spring phenology of temperate deciduous broadleaf forests in Austria. ASCAT's multi-angle looking capability enables the observation of backscatter over a large range of incidence angles. The vegetation status affects the slope of the backscatter-incidence angle relationship. We discovered a maximum in the slope around the month April, hereafter referred to as spring peak, predominantly in regions covered by deciduous broadleaf forest. We hypothesized that the spring peak indicates the average timing of leaf emergence in the deciduous trees in the sensor footprint. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the timing of the spring peak to leaf unfolding ob-servations from the PEP725 phenology database, to the increase of leaf area index (LAI) during spring, and to temperature. Our results demonstrate a good agreement between the ASCAT spring peaks, phenology ob-servations and temperature conditions. The steepest increase in LAI however lags behind the ASCAT peak by several days to a few weeks, suggesting that the spring peak in fact marks the timing of maximum woody water content, which occurs right before leaf emergence. Based on these observations, we conclude that the ASCAT signal has a high sensitivity to spring reactivation and in particular water uptake of bare deciduous broadleaf trees. Our findings might provide the basis for novel developments to estimate eco-physiological changes of forests during spring at large scales.

AB Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) encroachment on the Great Plains has led to decreases in biodiversity, water availability, and grazing land while increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Quantifying the current spatial distribution of eastern redcedar can aid land management efforts to combat encroachment, and extending this information over time can improve our understanding of the patterns and drivers of encroachment. We compared several remote sensing methods for mapping percent conifer cover to develop an approach that would be applicable for monitoring eastern redcedar encroachment across the Great Plains to support management goals. Leaf-off lidar was filtered through a novel approach using normalized return intensity and local canopy density to remove residual points pertaining to deciduous trees, which enabled us to calculate percent conifer cover. A sample of the conifer cover derived from leaf-off lidar was then used to test passive imagery-based methods that could be applied over a greater spatiotemporal extent. These imagery-based methods included Spatial Wavelet Analysis applied to very high-resolution imagery and random forest regression modeling with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 based predictive layers generated in Google Earth Engine from a single image, seasonal composites, and harmonic regression coefficients produced from an annual time series. Spatial Wavelet Analysis provided high accuracy (similar to 5% RMSE) in areas where conifer cover was less than 10%, but accuracy rapidly decreased with increases in observed cover such that this method had a very low overall accuracy (42.5% RMSE). Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 based predictors yielded similar performance to each other in models of conifer cover (9.7 to 13.3% RMSE), but seasonal composites from either sensor provided higher predictive power than either use of a single winter image or harmonic regression coefficients. According to recent estimates from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, eastern redcedar comprises more than 90% of conifer basal area in 277 counties of the central Great Plains, and thus mapping conifer cover can be assumed to reflect eastern redcedar cover. By applying the LandTrendr algorithm to Landsat seasonal composites we produced stable estimates of eastern redcedar cover from 1984 to 2018 and quantified encroachment as a 2.3% per year increase in eastern redcedar forest, defined as areas with >= 10% redcedar cover. The comparison of these methods and their application through time lays the groundwork for monitoring of redcedar encroachment across the central Great Plains and provides an approach for mapping fractional cover of conifer trees more generally.

Among the Earth observation products identified for agriculture monitoring, indicators of vegetation status are deemed critical by end-user communities. In literature, several experiments usually utilize the backscatter intensities to characterize crops. In this study, we have jointly utilized the scattering information in terms of the degree of polarization and the eigenvalue spectrum to derive a new vegetation index from dual-pol (DpRVI) SAR data. We assess the utility of this index as an indicator of plant growth dynamics for canola, soybean, and wheat, over a test site in Canada. A temporal analysis of DpRVI with crop biophysical variables (viz., Plant Area Index (PAI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and dry biomass (DB)) at different phenological stages confirms its trend with plant growth dynamics. For each crop type, the DpRVI is compared with the cross and co-pol ratio (sigma(0)(VH)/sigma(0)(VV)) and dual-pol Radar Vegetation Index (RVI = 4 sigma(0)(VH)/(sigma(0)(VV) + sigma(0)(VH))), Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (PRVI), and the Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI). Statistical analysis with biophysical variables shows that the DpRVI outperformed the other four vegetation indices, yielding significant correlations for all three crops. Correlations between DpRVI and biophysical variables are highest for canola, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.79 (PAI), 0.82 (VWC), and 0.75 (DB). DpRVI had a moderate correlation (R-2 >= 0.6) with the biophysical parameters of wheat and soybean. Good retrieval accuracies of crop biophysical parameters are also observed for all three crops.

AB Drones offer entirely new prospects for precision agriculture. This study investigates the utilisation of drone remote sensing for managing and monitoring silage grass swards. In northern countries, grass swards are fertilised and harvested three times per season when aiming to maximise the yield. Information about the grass quantity and quality is necessary to optimise these operations. Our objectives were to investigate and develop machine-learning techniques for estimating these parameters using drone photogrammetry and spectral imaging. Trial sites were established in southern Finland for the primary growth and regrowth of grass in the summer of 2017. Remote-sensing datasets were captured four times during the primary growth season and three times during the regrowth period. Reference measurements included fresh and dry biomass and several quality parameters, such as the digestibility of organic matter in dry matter (the D-value), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), indigestible neutral detergent fibre (iNDF), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), the nitrogen concentration (Ncont) in dry matter (DM) and nitrogen uptake (NU). Machine-learning estimators based on random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods were trained using the reference measurements and tested using independent test datasets. The best results for the biomass estimation, nitrogen amount and digestibility were obtained when using hyperspectral and 3D data, followed by the combination of multispectral and 3D data. During the training process, the best normalised root-mean-square errors (RMSE%) were 14.66% for the dry biomass and 12% for fresh biomass; the best RMSE% values for NU, the D-value and NDF were 13.6%, 1.98% and 3% respectively. For the primary growth, the accuracies of all quality parameters were better than 20% with the independent test datasets; for the regrowth, the estimation accuracies of the D-value, iNDF, NDF, Ncont and NU were better than 20%. The results showed that drone remote sensing was an excellent tool for the efficient and accurate management of silage production.

AB Urban composition can be analyzed through spectral unmixing of images from airborne imaging spectrometers. Unmixing given a spectral library can be accomplished by set-based methods or distribution-based methods. For computational efficiency and optimal accuracy, set-based methods employ a library reduction procedure when applied to large spectral libraries. On the other hand, distribution-based methods model the library by only a few parameters, hence innately accept large libraries. A natural question arises that can distribution-based methods with the original large spectral library achieve comparable performance to set-based methods in urban imagery.
   In this study, we aim to investigate the unmixing capability of several distribution-based methods, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), normal compositional model (NCM), and Beta compositional model (BCM) by comparing them to set-based methods MESMA and alternate angle minimization (AAM). The data for validation were collected by the AVIRIS sensor over the Santa Barbara region: two 16 m spatial resolution and two 4 m spatial resolution images. 64 validated regions of interest (ROI) (180 m by 180 m) were used to assess estimate accuracy. Ground truth was obtained using 1 m images leading to the following 6 classes: turfgrass, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), paved, roof, soil, and tree. Spectral libraries were built by manually identifying and extracting pure spectra from both resolution images, resulting in 3287 spectra at 16 m and 15,426 spectra at 4 m. The libraries were further reduced to 61 spectra at 16 m and 95 spectra at 4 m for set-based methods. The results show that in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), GMM performed best among the distribution-based methods while MESMA performed best among the set-based methods. For 16 m data, there is no significant difference between GMM and MESMA (MAE = 0.069 vs. MAE = 0.074, p = 0.25). For 4 m data, though GMM is not as accurate as MESMA (MAE = 0.056 vs. MAE = 0.046, p = 7e - 5), it is better than AAM (MAE = 0.056 vs. MAE = 0.065, p = 0.02) which is a re-implementation of MESMA. Further evidence on a reconstructed synthetic dataset implies possible overfitting of the reduced library to the images for MESMA. These findings suggest that the distribution-based method GMM could achieve comparable unmixing accuracy to set-based methods without the need of library reduction, it may also be more stable across datasets, and the current 2-step workflow could be replaced by a single model in applying a universal spectral library.

AB Complete and accurate burned area map data are needed to document spatial and temporal patterns of fires, to quantify their drivers, and to assess the impacts on human and natural systems. In this study, we developed the Landsat Burned Area (BA) algorithm, an update from the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) algorithm. Here, we present the BA algorithm and products, changes relative to the BAECV algorithm and products, and updated validation metrics. We also present spatial and temporal patterns of burned area across the conterminous U.S., how burned area varies in relation to the number of operational Landsat sensors, and a comparison with other burned area datasets, including the BAECV, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), GeoMAC, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1.006 data. The BA algorithm identifies burned areas in analysis ready data (ARD) time-series of Landsat imagery from 1984 through 2018 using machine learning, thresholding, and image segmentation. Validation with reference data from high-resolution commercial satellite imagery resulted in omission and commission error rates averaging 19% and 41%, respectively. In comparison, validation with Landsat reference data had omission and commission error rates averaging 40% and 28%, respectively when burned areas in cultivated crops and pasture/hay land-cover types were excluded. Both validation tests documented lower commission error rates relative to the BAECV products. The amount of burned area detected varies not only in response to climate but also with the number of operational sensors and scenes collected. The combined amount of burned area detected by multiple sensors was larger than from any individual sensor, but there was no significant difference between individual sensors. Therefore, we used BA products from individual sensors to assess trends over time and all available sensors to compare with other existing BA products. From 1984 through 2018, annual burned area averaged 30,000 km(2), ranged between 14,000 km(2) in 1991 and 46,500 km(2) in 2012, and increased over time at a rate of 356 km(2)/year. Compared to existing burned area products, the new Landsat BA products identified 29% more burned area than the BAECV products (1984-2015), 183% more than the MTBS/GeoMAC products (1984-2018), and 56% more than the MCD64A1.006 products (2003-2018). The products had similar patterns of year-to-year variability; the R-2 values of linear regressions between annual burned area were > 0.70 with the BAECV products and the MTBS/GeoMAC products, but somewhat lower for the MCD64A1.006 product (R-2 = 0.66). The BA products are routinely produced as new Landsat data are collected and provide a unique data source to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal patterns and the impacts of fire.

AB Automatically monitoring newly constructed building areas (NCBAs) is essential for efficient land resource management and sustainable urban development, particularly in the rapidly urbanizing country of China. In this regard, time-series multi-view high-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details for clearly characterizing NCBAs, but this leads to great heterogeneity and complexity, owing to the high spectral variation, complicated imaging conditions, and different viewing angles. Moreover, to date, the vertical features and time-series information from these images have not been fully exploited for urban change detection. In this paper, our primary objective is to automatically detect the presence of NCBAs, and meanwhile, to investigate the feasibility of identifying their change timing using time-series multi-view ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images. To this aim, we propose an automatic change detection method consisting of three components: 1) firstly, we jointly use planar-vertical features to delineate the NCBAs; 2) object-based temporal correction is subsequently applied to improve the spatiotemporal consistency of the features; and 3) finally, a multi-temporal change detection model is used to simultaneously capture the NCBAs and the change timing. We applied the method on two urban fringe areas of Beijing (7 multi-temporal image sets) and Shanghai (7 multi-temporal image sets), respectively, which are cities that have been experiencing rapid urbanization. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. For both study areas, the F-score values reached nearly 90% in terms of NCBA detection, and with respect to the change timing, the overall accuracies with a one-year tolerance strategy reached around 92%. The joint use of the planar-vertical features and the inclusion of multi-temporal images make the proposed method a promising approach for automatically providing the spatiotemporal information of NCBAs in practical applications.

AB The eutrophication of lake and reservoir (hereafter referred to as lakes) has attracted concerns from the public and government in China. Water clarity is a reliable indicator for quantifying eutrophic status because of its strong association with chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, and nutrients. Traditionally, water clarity is measured using Secchi disk depth (SD). By linking the spectral signal from water surface with in situ measured SD, remote sensing provides a useful tool for SD estimation at a large scale in a repetitive manner. Remote sensing derived water clarity has been reported in many regions with specific models established for different satellite overpasses concurrent with in situ measured SD, but national water clarity remained unknown in China. In this study, 2152 samples were collected from 34 field campaigns in 2013-2018, of which 1792 samples were gathered within +/- 7 days of Landsat OLI overpasses. We used Landsat 8 OLI bands 1-4 to develop regression models (n = 1016), and 782 samples to validate model performances. We further collected three additional in situ SD datasets to validate the best performance model, and eventually used it to map SD at a national scale with OLI images mainly acquired in 2016. Our results indicated that the entire dataset of SD has a strong association with Landsat reflectance, yielding low root mean square error between measured and estimated SD (RMSE = 63 cm) for lakes in China. The national water clarity was averaged to 176 cm in 2016 with large spatial variability (S.D: 216 cm) due to the marked variation between turbid waters in the east plain area and clean water across the Tibet Plateau. Lakes in the northeastern (75 cm) and eastern (84 cm) China had low clarity due to shallow water depth combined with high suspended matter and algal abundance. Lakes in the Yungui Plateau (91 cm), Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions (114 cm) exhibited intermediate clarity; while lakes in the Tibet Plateau (294 cm) displayed the highest clarity. This investigation demonstrated that Landsat imagery with Rayleigh scattering correction reflectance combined with in situ observation can provide quantitative information about the lake clarity with surface area > 8 ha. Moreover, this method has the potential to retrieve SD with archived Landsat imagery to determine the temporal variation of SD at national or continental scale which can be used to support inland water management and decision-maker for improving water quality.

AB Water in oil (WO) and oil in water (OW) emulsions from marine oil spills have different physical properties, volume concentrations, and spectral characteristics. Identification and quantification of these different types of oil emulsions are important for oil spill response and post-spill assessment. While the spectral characteristics of WO and OW emulsions have been presented in previous studies including Part I of this series, their application to airborne and satellite imagery is further demonstrated here. Using AVIRIS and Landsat observations, we firstly show that false color Red-Green-Blue composite images from Landsat-like sensors (R: 1677 nm, G: 839 nm, B: 660 nm) are effective in differentiating WO and OW emulsions as they show reddish and greenish colors, respectively, in such composite images. This is a consequence of the relative difference in the reflectance of WO and OW emulsions at 1677 and 839 nm, which is not impacted by the presence of medium-strength sunglint or the surface heterogeneity within medium-resolution pixels (e.g., 30 m). Based on image statistics, a decision tree method is proposed to classify oil type, and oil quantification is further attempted, with results partially validated through spectral analysis and spatial coherence test. The numerical mixing experiments using AVIRIS pixels further indicate that the SWIR bands might be used to develop linear unmixing models in the future once the coarse-resolution oiled pixels are first classified to WO and OW types, and 1295 nm is the optimal wavelength to perform spectral unmixing of mixed coarse-resolution pixels.

AB In the last two decades, the advance in nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing has fueled a surge in extensive research towards mapping human footprints. Nevertheless, the full potential of NTL data is largely constrained by the blooming effect. In this study, we propose a new concept, the Pixel Blooming Effect (PiBE), to delineate the mutual influence of lights from a pixel and its neighbors, and an integrated framework to eliminate the PiBE in radiance calibrated DMSP-OLS datasets (DMSPgrc). First, lights from isolated gas flaring sources and a Gaussian model were used to model how the PiBE functions on each pixel through point spread function (PSF). Second, a two-stage deblurring approach (TSDA) was developed to deconvolve DMSPgrc images with Tikhonov regularization to correct the PiBE and reconstruct PiBE-free images. Third, the proposed framework was assessed by synthetic data and VIIRS imagery and by testing the resulting image with two applications. We found that high impervious surface fraction pixels (ISF > 0.6) were impacted by the highest absolute magnitude of PiBE, whereas NTL pattern of low ISF pixels (ISF < 0.2) was more sensitive to the PiBE. By using TSDA the PiBE in DMSPgrc images was effectively corrected which enhanced data variation and suppressed pseudo lights from non-built-up pixels in urban areas. The reconstructed image had the highest similarity to reference data from synthetic image (SSIM = 0.759) and VIIRS image (r = 0.79). TSDA showed an acceptable performance for linear objects (width > 1.5 km) and circular objects (radius > 0.5 km), and for NTL data with different noise levels (< 0.6 sigma). In summary, the proposed framework offers a new opportunity to improve the quality of DMSP-OLS images and subsequently will be conducive to NTL-based applications, such as mapping urban extent, estimating socioeconomic variables, and exploring eco-impact of artificial lights.

AB Small islands face environmental issues directly or indirectly related to land cover/land use changes (LCLUC), such as natural hazards, climate change, loss of biodiversity and proliferation of invasive alien species, some of which are caused by direct human exploitation. A Land Cover/Land Use Change (LCLUC) detection approach based on PCA and vegetation indices derived from low cost high-resolution RapidEye multispectral satellite data and available vegetation maps was developed to assess vegetated/forested aboveground carbon stocks and their changes in Madeira Island, Portugal, for the period between December 2009 and August 2011 due to catastrophic events occurred in 2010.
   During this period, the identified LCLUC revealed a relevant decrease of vegetated areas (especially those dominated by native/endemic communities) substituted by increases of non-vegetated and human-managed vegetated/forested areas. In particular, there was a decrease of 2% of vegetated areas, 30% of which were represented by native/endemic vegetation. The largest and most accurate LCLUC detected were used to estimate changes in aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) stocks. In 2010 more than 25,000 Mg of AGC stocks may have been released. Both relevant LCLUC and AGC stocks depletion in such short period of time may have been strongly enhanced by two catastrophic events that affected Madeira in February (flashflood and landslides) and August 2010 (wildfires). This straightforward and cost-effective methodological approach may be successfully applied in remote territories such as islands or mountainous areas, where the logistic and economic costs associated to periodic and standard airborne remote sensing campaigns for mapping, assessing and monitoring aboveground biomass carbon stocks are generally unaffordable for most decision-makers and land managers in these territories.

AB Surface floating macroalgae, microalgae, and other marine and freshwater organisms have been reported in many specific regions around the globe. However, it is technically challenging to identify similar occurrences, or other types of floating organisms or materials, within the vast global oceans and lakes. In this study, we address this challenge through combining global-scale, 375-m resolution false-colored Red-Green-Blue (FRGB) imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in NOAA's online Ocean Color Viewer (OCView) for visual inspection and data from several other satellite sensors for spectral diagnostics. In the FRGB imagery, the near-infrared (NIR) band (862 nm) is used as the green channel, which is sensitive to floating algae and organisms/materials on the water surface. Visual inspection of the daily FRGB VIIRS imagery from January 2018 to October 2019 reveals the appearance of various slicks with different colors in many ocean regions and lakes. Combined with spectral diagnostics of the quasi-concurrent Sentinel-3A/3B Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and other higher spatial resolution satellite data as well as knowledge of local oceanography/limnology, most of these elongated or diffuse image features can be identified as Ulva, Sargassum, Noctiluca, Trichodesmium, Microcystis, oil slicks, or pumice rafts. Some of these identified features are found in regions where such occurrences have never been reported before. Some features are of unknown type as they have not been reported previously from remote sensing. In such cases, contemporaneous scientific literature and news reports as well as spectral diagnostics allow for educated inferences to be made. One example is from surface features in the northern Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, and Southwest of Nova Scotia between early June and early July of 2019. Spectral shapes of the FRGB image features indicate transparent materials lacking pigments. Knowledge of local fisheries oceanography and frequent news reports all suggest that these unknown image features may be aggregations or blooms of sea jellies and, to a lesser extent, salps. Another example is from the Great Salt Lake, where image features in the south arm of the lake are speculated to be caused by aggregations of brine shrimp eggs. Once confirmed from field sightings, these findings may represent a milestone in satellite remote sensing because previously remote sensing could only be used to infer oceanographic environments conducive to sea jellies or shrimps. In addition to the findings presented here, the approach in this study may serve as a template to discover various known and unknown types of floating algae and organisms/materials as well as to routinely monitor and track their distributions and movements.

AB In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 & 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action.
   A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning.
   Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.

AB Forest ecosystem services such as clean water, wildlife habitat, and timber supplies are increasingly threatened by drought and disturbances (e.g., harvesting, fires and conversion to other uses), which can have great impacts on stand development and water balance. Improved understanding of the hydrologic response of forested systems to drought and disturbance at spatiotemporal resolutions commensurate with these impacts is important for effective forest management. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key hydrologic variable in assessing forest functioning and health, but it remains a challenge to accurately quantify ET at landscape scales with the spatial and temporal detail required for effective decision-making. In this study, we apply a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to study the response of forest ET to drought and disturbance over a 7-year period. This approach combines Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET product time series retrieved using a surface energy balance model to generate a multi-year ET datacube at 30-m resolution and daily timesteps. The study area (similar to 900 km(2)) contains natural and managed forest as well as croplands in the humid lower coastal plains in North Carolina, USA, and the simulation period from 2006 to 2012 includes both normal and severe drought conditions. The model results were evaluated at two AmeriFlux sites (US-NC2 and US-NC1) dominated by a mature and a recently clearcut pine plantation, respectively, and showed good agreement with observed fluxes, with 813% relative errors at monthly timesteps. Changes in water use patterns in response to drought and disturbance as well as forest stand aging were assessed using the remotely sensed time series describing total evapotranspiration, the transpiration (T) component of ET, and a moisture stress metric given by the actual-to-reference ET ratio (f(RET)). Analyses demonstrate differential response to drought by land cover type and stand age, with larger impacts on total ET observed in young pine stands than in mature stands which have substantially deeper rooting systems. Transpiration flux shows a clear ascending trend with the growth of young pine plantations, while stand thinning within the plantation leads to decreases in both remotely sensed leaf area index and T, as expected. Time series maps of f(RET) anomalies at 30-m resolution capture signals of drought, disturbance and the subsequent recovery after clearcut at the stand scale and may be an effective indicator for water use change detection and monitoring in forested landscapes.

ID MASS-BALANCE; SHEET; ALGORITHM
AB The drainage divides of ice sheets separate the overall glaciated area into multiple sectors. These drainage basins are essential for partitioning mass changes of the ice sheet, as they specify the area over which basin specific measurements are integrated. The delineation of drainage basins on ice sheets is challenging due to their gentle slopes accompanied by local terrain disturbances and complex patterns of ice movement. Until now, in Greenland the basins have been mostly delineated along the major ice divides, which results in large drainage sectors containing multiple outlet glaciers. However, when focusing on measuring glaciological parameters of individual outlet glaciers, more detailed drainage basin delineations are needed. Here we present for the first time a detailed and fully traceable approach that combines ice sheet wide velocity measurements by Sentinel-1 and the high resolution TanDEM-X global DEM to derive individual glacier drainage basins. We delineated catchments for the Northeast Greenland Ice Sheet with a modified watershed algorithm and present results for 31 drainage basins. Even though validation of drainage basins remains a difficult task, we estimated basin probabilities from Monte-Carlo experiments and applied the method to a variety of different ice velocity and DEM datasets finding discrepancies of up to 16% in the extent of catchment areas. The proposed approach has the potential to produce drainage areas for the entirety of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

AB This paper presents the generation of a global burned area mapping algorithm using MODIS hotspots and near-infrared reflectance within ESA's Fire_cci project. The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that combines MODIS highest resolution (250 m) near-infrared band and active fire information from thermal channels. The burned area is detected in two phases. In the first step, pixels with a high probability of being burned are selected in order to reduce commission errors. To do that, spatio-temporal active-fire clusters are created to determine adaptive thresholds. Finally, a contextual growing approach is applied from those pixels to the neighbouring area to fully detect the burned patch and reduce omission errors. The algorithm was used to obtain a time series of global burned area dataset (named FireCC151), covering the 2001-2018 period. Validation based on 1200 sampled sites covering the period from 2003 to 2014 showed an average omission and commission errors of 67.1% and 54.4%. When using longer validation periods, the errors were found smaller (54.5% omission and 25.7% commission for the additional 1000 African sampled sites), which indicates that the product is negatively influenced by temporal reporting accuracy. The inter-comparison carried out with previous Fire_cci versions (FireCC141 and FireCC150), and NASA's standard burned area product (MCD64A1 c6) showed consistent spatial and temporal patterns. However, the new algorithm estimated an average BA of 4.63 Mkm(2), with a maximum of 5.19 Mkm(2) (2004) and a minimum of 3.94 Mkm(2) (in 2001), increasing current burned area estimations. Besides, the new product was found more sensitive to detect smaller burned patches. This new product, called FireCC151, is publicly available at: http://cci.esa.int/data, last accessed on September 2019.

AB Improving our ability to monitor ocean carbonate chemistry has become a priority as the ocean continues to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This long-term uptake is reducing the ocean pH; a process commonly known as ocean acidification. The use of satellite Earth Observation has not yet been thoroughly explored as an option for routinely observing surface ocean carbonate chemistry, although its potential has been high-lighted. We demonstrate the suitability of using empirical algorithms to calculate total alkalinity (A(T)) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T), assessing the relative performance of satellite, interpolated in situ, and climatology datasets in reproducing the wider spatial patterns of these two variables. Both A(T) and C-T in situ data are reproducible, both regionally and globally, using salinity and temperature datasets, with satellite observed salinity from Aquarius and SMOS providing performance comparable to other datasets for the majority of case studies. Global root mean squared difference (RMSD) between in situ validation data and satellite estimates is 17 mu mol kg(-1) with bias < 5 mu mol kg(-1) for A(T) and 30 mu mol kg(-1) with bias < 10 mu mol kg(-1) for C-T. This analysis demonstrates that satellite sensors provide a credible solution for monitoring surface synoptic scale A(T) and C-T. It also enables the first demonstration of observation-based synoptic scale A(T) and C-T temporal mixing in the Amazon plume for 2010-2016, complete with a robust estimation of their uncertainty.

AB We propose a globally applicable algorithm (GAA(SPM)) to seamlessly retrieve the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) (C-SPM) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) across ocean to turbid river mouths without any hard-switching in its application. GAA(SPM) is based on a calibrated relationship between C-SPM and a generalized index for SPM (GI(SPM)) from water color. The GI(SPM) is mainly composed of three R-rs(lambda) ratios (671, 745, and 862 nm over 551 nm, respectively), along with weighting factors assigned to each ratio. The weighting factors are introduced to ensure the progressive application of R-rs(lambda) in the longer wavelengths for increasing C-SPM. Calibration of GAA(SPM) employed data collected from multiple estuarine and coastal regions of Europe, China, Argentina, and the USA with the measured C-SPM spanning from 0.2 to 2068.8 mg/L. Inter-comparison with several recalibrated well-known C-SPM retrieval algorithms demonstrates that GAA(SPM) has the best retrieval accuracy over the entire C-SPM range with a relative mean absolute difference (rMAD) of 41.3% (N = 437). This averaged uncertainty in GAA(SPM) -derived C-SPM is mostly attributed to the retrievals from less turbid waters where C-SPM < 50 mg/L (rMAD = 50%, N = 214). GAP(SPM) was further applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements over prominent coastal areas and produced reliable C-SPM maps along with realistic spatial patterns. In contrast, applications of other C-SPM algorithms resulted in less reliable C-SPM maps with either unjustified numerical discontinuities in the C-SPM spatial distribution or unsatisfactory retrieval accuracy. Therefore, we propose GAA(SPM) as a preferred algorithm to retrieve C-SPM over regions with a wide range of C-SPM, such as river plume areas.

AB The sulfur-bearing volcanic gases SO2 and H2S have a direct impact on ecosystems and can endanger human health. Timely information regarding dispersion patterns of fumarolic gases is crucial for predicting potential impacts. However, real-time fixed-point observations are difficult in alpine areas where snow accumulation is seasonably variable, in addition to being potentially dangerous to on-the-ground observers. Thus, in this study we tested a novel technique using a colorimeter, digital camera, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to evaluate the dispersion of sulfur particles from fumarolic gas over a snow-covered location in the Tateyama Mountain Range, central Japan, from 2013 to 2015. Snow samples were collected at the depths ranging from 0 to 0.5 cm and the sulfur particle content was determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis. The dissolved ion concentrations in snow melt solutions were analyzed to clarify the contribution of Asian yellow dust (KOSA) to the snow surface color. RGB color images captured by the UAV were converted to CIE-Lab color space with three axes: X axis changed from red to green (a*), Y axis from yellow to blue (b*), and Z axis from white to black (L*). The color levels of green and yellow increased in the snow surface of fumarolic areas and showed a significant correlation with the densities of sulfur particles on the snow surface ((r)2 = 0.853, P < 0.001). These results indicated that aerial images of snow surface color can be used for estimation of sulfur particle dispersion from fumarolic gases.

AB Drylands make up roughly 40% of the Earth's land surface, and billions of people depend on services provided by these critically important ecosystems. Despite their relatively sparse vegetation, dryland ecosystems are structurally and functionally diverse, and emerging evidence suggests that these ecosystems play a dominant role in the trend and variability of the terrestrial carbon sink. More, drylands are highly sensitive to climate and are likely to have large, non-linear responses to hydroclimatic change. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of dryland ecosystem structure (e.g., leaf area index) and function (e.g., primary production and evapotranspiration) is therefore a high research priority. Yet, dryland remote sensing is defined by unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic or humid regions. Major challenges include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high soil background reflectance, presence of photosynthetic soils (i.e., biological soil crusts), high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Additionally, there is a relative paucity of continuous, long-term measurements in drylands, which impedes robust calibration and evaluation of remotely-sensed dryland data products. Due to these issues, remote sensing techniques developed in other ecosystems or for global application often result in inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland ecosystem structural and functional dynamics. Here, we review past achievements and current progress in remote sensing of dryland ecosystems, including a detailed discussion of the major challenges associated with remote sensing of key dryland structural and functional dynamics. We then identify strategies aimed at leveraging new and emerging opportunities in remote sensing to overcome previous challenges and more accurately contextualize drylands within the broader Earth system. Specifically, we recommend: 1) Exploring novel combinations of sensors and techniques (e.g., solar-induced fluorescence, thermal, microwave, hyperspectral, and LiDAR) across a range of spatiotemporal scales to gain new insights into dryland structural and functional dynamics; 2) utilizing near-continuous observations from new-and-improved geostationary satellites to capture the rapid responses of dryland ecosystems to diurnal variation in water stress; 3) expanding ground observational networks to better represent the heterogeneity of dryland systems and enable robust calibration and evaluation; 4) developing algorithms that are specifically tuned to dryland ecosystems by utilizing expanded ground observational network data; and 5) coupling remote sensing observations with process-based models using data assimilation to improve mechanistic understanding of dryland ecosystem dynamics and to better constrain ecological forecasts and long-term projections.

AB Most cropping systems around the world are organised around few dominant crops and a larger number of less frequent crops. While rare and infrequent crops occupy a small share of the cropped area, they produce ecological benefits on farmland, contribute to sustainability and help provide food and nutritional security. However, data about their location and extent derived from satellite imagery generally lack accuracy, largely owing to the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance occurs when only few instances of some classes are available for training classifiers, and leads to large error rates of the infrequent classes. In this study, we assessed the magnitude of the class imbalance problem in crop classification and evaluated balancing methods to combat it by creating synthetic minority observations or by removing majority observations. To that aim, we generated 18 unbalanced data sets from Sentinel-2 time series and crop type observations in Victoria, Australia. These data sets covered a wide range of complexity, number of classes, number of samples per class and spectral separability which enabled us to gather evidence about the benefits and drawbacks of balancing methods in various settings. Classification accuracy was assessed with two metrics: the Overall Accuracy (OA), which gives more weight to majority classes, and the G-Mean accuracy (GM), which is more sensitive to minority classes. Results showed that class imbalance explained near 40% of the accuracy variability. We found that balancing methods boosted GM by 0.01-0.54 but no single best solution emerged. The price for increasing the accuracy of minority classes was a drop in OA of a magnitude that was problem- and method-specific. We thus applied an algorithm selection method called the F-race to identify optimal balancing methods in a computationally economic fashion. Optimal balancing methods lead to maximum gain in GM and minimum loss in OA. We demonstrated that this approach either successfully identified optimal balancing methods or ones that were not significantly sub-optimal, while reducing the computational cost by up to 60%. It can readily be incorporated to operational crop classification systems with little disruption to the existing processing chains. This contribution paves the way for achieving a more comprehensive and detailed view of crop distribution and cropping sequences.

AB One of the main consequences of climate change is the sea level rise (SLR), which impacts coastal areas affecting many infrastructures, particularly seaports, whose operations may be jeopardized. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to assess the impact of SLR on port operability by using digital elevation models derived from LiDAR data. The methodology is applied to four ports along the Catalan Coast (NW Mediterranean). The study is made for the RCP8.5 scenario from IPCC, analysing port operability every 10 years throughout the 21st century. The approach provided here allows a port authority to determine which berthing areas will be affected at each port and at each time interval. Results show that, if no adaptation measures are taken, ports will have significant reductions of present operability for most of their activities, in particular after year 2070. This work shows that the developed methodological framework is a very useful tool for port authorities to detect operability tipping points and to design well in advance the necessary adaptation pathways to overcome the expected impacts.

AB We developed the Function of mask (Fmask) 4.0 algorithm for automated cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel-2 images. Three major innovative improvements were made as follows: (1) integration of auxiliary data, where Global Surface Water Occurrence (GSWO) data was used to improve the separation of land and water, and a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to normalize thermal and cirrus bands; (2) development of new cloud probabilities, in which a Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT)-based cloud probability was designed to replace temperature probability for Sentinel-2 images, and cloud probabilities were combined and re-calibrated for different sensors against a global reference dataset; and (3) utilization of spectral contextual features, where a Spectral-Contextual Snow Index (SCSI) was created for better distinguishing snow/ice from clouds in polar regions, and a morphology -based approach was applied to reduce the commission error in bright land surfaces (e.g., urban/built-up and mountain snow/ice). The Fmask 4.0 algorithm showed higher overall accuracies for Landsats 4-8 imagery than the 3.3 version (Zhu et al., 2015) (92.40% versus 90.73% for Landsats 4-7 and 94.59% versus 93.30% for Landsat 8), and much higher overall accuracies for Sentinel-2 imagery than the 2.5.5 version of the Sen2Cor algorithm (Mtiller-Wilm et al., 2018) (94.30% versus 87.10%).

AB Changes in water availability strongly affect vegetation growth, and vegetation can also modify land water storage by changing the land surface water balance. Here, based on the terrestrial water storage (TWS) data retrieved from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)satellites mission and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2015, we investigate the interplay between land water and vegetation greenness at a global scale. The results reveal a coherent trend with statistical significance between the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and the NDVI in 20.90% of global vegetated lands in contrast to a non-coherent trend of 20.87% in global vegetated lands. Vegetation greenness exhibits a common 0 to 1-month delayed response to the TWSA, and significant positive TWSA-NDVI relationships appear in approximately 43.17% of global vegetated areas. A comparison study suggests that the response of vegetation greenness to the TWSA is more rapid than that to precipitation. Interactions between the TWSA and NDVI are further investigated by using the Granger causality test technique. Globally, a strong interaction between the TWSA and NDVI occurs in over 16.75% of vegetated areas. Simultaneously, vegetation greenness is found to be the Granger cause of the TWSA in over 40.34% of global vegetated areas, indicating widespread impacts of vegetation change on variations in land water storage. A case study in China suggests that vegetation greenness increase is an important reason for the decrease in the TWSA in North and Northwest China, which are traditionally water-limited-growth regions. In two humid regions, Southwest and South China, the influence of the TWSA on vegetation greenness seems to be stronger than that of vegetation greenness on the TWSA. Our study suggests that the GRACE TWS is a useful tool for investigations of interactions between vegetation greenness and land water conditions.

AB Information on the timing of melt onset over sea ice is important for understanding the Arctic's changing climate. The daily temporal resolution of passive microwave brightness temperatures provides the most widely utilized observations to detect melt onset but are limited to a spatial resolution of 25 km. Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides a much higher spatial resolution (20-100 m) but melt onset detection remains challenging because of i) insufficient temporal resolution to facilitate accurate melt onset detection, ii) inconsistent viewing geometries and iii) limited image availability across the Arctic. Here, we construct high temporal resolution composite gamma nought backscatter products (1 day, 1-2 day and 2-4 day) using Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 over a close-to-seamless revisit region located in northern Canadian Arctic and Greenland for estimating melt onset over Arctic sea ice in 2016 and 2017. We employ the necessary radiometric terrain flattening and local resolution weighting techniques to generate normalised backscatter over the entire study region, removing restrictions limiting analysis to a single sensor or track's swath width by integrating both ascending and descending passes into the composite products. Results indicate that higher temporal resolution multi-sensor composite gamma nought products (1 day) that make use of the most imagery provide a robust temporal evolution of the backscatter. This allows for more representative estimates of melt onset as it is easier to separate the melt onset threshold from winter variability that is otherwise a considerable challenge for SAR based melt onset algorithms because of inconsistent temporal resolution. Multi-sensor composite gamma naught melt onset detection is in good agreement with melt onset estimates derived from the Advance Scatterometer (ASCAT) backscatter values and passive microwave brightness temperatures over homogenous sea ice regions but very noticeable improvement was found within narrow channels and regions with more heterogeneous sea ice. In anticipation of the availability of data from even more SAR satellites with the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, the multi-sensor composite gamma nought approach presented here may offer the most robust approach to estimate the timing of melt onset over sea ice across the Arctic using high spatiotemporal resolution SAR.

AB Active and passive microwave signals over land co-vary depending on their shared scattering and emission characteristics by soil and vegetation media. Estimates of this covariation can be used beneficially to downscale coarse-resolution brightness temperatures with high-resolution backscatter for enhanced-resolution Earth observations. In this study, a forward model of covariation for vegetated soil is derived by combining two well-established models of active and passive microwave interactions. The covariation model is inverted to obtain a single-pass observation-driven estimation of active-passive microwave covariation (beta) based on multi-channel radiometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes. A key feature of the estimation approach is that it is applicable to co-located spatial data scenes and does not rely on temporal information. We present applications of the estimation with combinations of SMAP (L-band) radiometry and both SMAP (L-band) and multi-angular Sentinel-1 (C-band) backscatter data. We first show that for the period of available SMAP L-band radiometer and radar data, the estimation approach for beta, introduced in this study, yields similar results as the statistical time-series approach originally designed for SMAP. The new single-pass approach also allows estimation of active-passive covariation where the statistical approach cannot be applied because dynamic range of brightness temperature and backscatter are too limited to allow regression. We then apply the developed estimation method to SMAP L-band radiometer and multi-angular Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. Here, the study quantifies the effects of microwave frequency and look-angles on the covariation by applying the estimation globally and analyzing the results as a function of vegetation cover - a key determinant of the strength of the covariation.

AB The relatively high spatial resolution, short revisit time and red-edge spectral band (705 nm) of the ESA Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager makes this sensor attractive for monitoring water quality of coastal and inland waters. Reliable atmospheric correction is essential to support routine retrieval of optically active substance concentration from water-leaving reflectance. In this study, six publicly available atmospheric correction algorithms (Acolite, C2RCC, ICOR, 12gen, Polymer and Sen2Cor) are evaluated against above-water optical in situ measurements, within a robust methodology, in two optically diverse coastal regions (Baltic Sea, Western Channel) and from 13 inland waterbodies from 5 European countries with a range of optical properties. The total number of match-ups identified for each algorithm ranged from 1059 to 1668 with 521 match-ups common to all algorithms. These in situ and MSI match-ups were used to generate statistics describing the performance of each algorithm for each respective region and a combined dataset. All ACs tested showed high uncertainties, in many cases > 100% in the red and > 1000% in the near-infra red bands. Polymer and C2RCC achieved the lowest root mean square differences (similar to 0.0016 sr(-1)) and mean absolute differences (similar to 40-60% in blue/green bands) across the different datasets. Retrieval of blue-green and NIR-red band ratios indicate that further work on AC algorithms is required to reproduce the spectral shape in the red and NIR bands needed to accurately retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration in turbid waters.

AB Recent years have seen a rapid surge in the use of remote sensing technologies for characterizing the structure, composition and function of forested landscapes. Yet with few exceptions these studies have only provided snapshots of the ecosystem at one point in time, thereby limiting our ability to understand how forests are responding to global change. New approaches for characterizing forest dynamics using multi-temporal remotely sensed data are therefore urgently needed if we are to integrate these new technologies into conservation and management decision making processes. By combining data from a network of forest plots with repeat airborne lidar, here we develop an approach to (i) map fine-scale variation in aboveground carbon density (ACD) and its change over time across the landscape, and (ii) link these changes in ACD to forest structural attributes, species composition, disturbance regimes and local topography. We tested this framework on a temperate forest in the Alps characterized by the presence of three dominant species: spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). We found that between 2007 and 2011 the majority of the landscape (61.0%) increased in ACD, with a much smaller fraction of the study area exhibiting evidence of small-scale natural disturbances (3.7%) or ACD loss as a result of logging activities (13.7%). On average, areas of the landscape that actively sequestered carbon did so at a rate of 3.6% per year. However, rates of ACD accumulation varied considerably across the landscape, being greatest in forest stands characterized by multi-layered heterogeneous canopies, in ones dominated by spruce and at lower elevations. We demonstrated the potential of repeat lidar for characterizing not only the structure, but also the composition and aboveground carbon dynamics of forests. In doing so we open the door to monitor forests across large and inaccessible landscapes in order to better understand how they are responding to rapid global change and refine how we manage and conserve these critical ecosystems.

AB Measures of forest fragmentation, and how fragmentation is changing through time, offer required information for understanding the status and dynamics of forest ecosystems, habitat conditions, and ecosystem functions. In this research, we investigate the multi-temporal characterization of forest fragmentation across the forested ecosystems of Canada (> 650 million ha) and characterize the past three decades of forest fragmentation, providing useful context against which future analyses can be compared. Using 33 years of annual land cover maps produced from classified Landsat image best-available pixel composites (1984-2016), we describe and quantify the different forest patterns and dynamics that emerged in areas that were not disturbed in the analysis period, as well as following stand-replacing (i.e., wildfire, harvest) and non-stand-replacing (e.g., insects, water stress) disturbances. Baseline levels of fragmentation for each ecozone were determined by analyzing unchanged areas. Fragmentation dynamics by dominant forest disturbance showed that harvest activities generally lead to an increase in fragmentation related to the amount of forest cover (composition), while wildfires result in increasing fragmentation as a function of the spatial arrangement of the forest. The results presented herein also allow for characterization of the recovery of vegetation spatial patterns following various disturbance types, with areas dominated by fire presenting slower spatial recovery rates compared to harvest. By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, forest fragmentation metrics in harvest-dominated landscapes were comparable to the pre-harvesting baseline, reaching 96% of mean pre-disturbance levels for mean forest patch size, and 83% for number of forest patches. In contrast, fire-dominated landscapes resulted in more event related fragmentation, with reduced forest cover (mean Thiel Sen slope = -0.13% year(-1)), mean forest patch size (-0.22 ha year(-1)), an increase in forest patches (0.11 year(-1)), and forest-non-forest join counts (0.83 year(-1)). By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, mean forest patch size reached 96% of mean pre-disturbance levels and 68% the number of forest patches. Overall, non-stand replacing changes had no impact on the behaviour of the forest fragmentation metrics. The open access to Landsat's image archive combined with the analysis methods presented herein enable the systematic quantification and characterization of Canada-wide trends in forest fragmentation trends and post-disturbance spatial patterns over three decades. The results reported herein provide detailed information on the temporal evolution of spatial forest patterns, and illustrate that given an adequate time period, spatial patterns in areas where land use has not changed, recover to resemble pre-disturbance conditions.

AB A photogrammetric flight was performed in December 2016 as BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) operation over Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands, Western Antarctica). Images were taken by the PW-ZOOM fixed wing UAV equipped with a digital SLR Canon 700D camera. The flight was performed at 550 m ASL and covered a total distance of 231.58 km. The plane take-off and landing site was near the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station (Arctowski) on King George Island, South Shetlands. The main aim of the mission was to collect environmental data to estimate the size of penguin and pinniped breeding populations and to map vegetation cover and landforms. The plane returned to Arctowski with 1630 images of Penguin Island with the ground sample distance (GSD) lower than 0.07 m. The analysis of developed ortophoto allowed us to locate and identify individuals of two penguin species (Adelie and chinstrap), and individuals of two species of pinnipeds (Southern elephant seal and Weddell seal). Three types of tundra communities were mapped together with numerous landforms such as: volcanic, mass movement, fluvial, coastal and aeolian ones. The UAV BVLOS photogrammetric operation proved to be very robust in gathering valuable qualitative and quantitative data necessary for monitoring distant and isolated polar environments.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SiF) is increasingly used as a proxy for vegetation canopy photosynthesis. While ground-based, airborne, and satellite observations have demonstrated a strong linear relationship between SiF and gross primary production (GPP) at seasonal scales, their relationships at high temporal resolution across diurnal to seasonal scales remain unclear. In this study, far-red canopy SiF, GPP, and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) were continuously monitored using automated spectral systems and an eddy flux tower over an entire growing season in a rice paddy. At half-hourly resolution, strong linear relationships between SiF and GPP (R-2 = 0.76) and APAR and GPP (R-2 = 0.76) for the whole growing season were observed. We found that relative humidity, diffuse PAR fraction, and growth stage influenced the relationships between SiF and GPP, and APAR and GPP, and incorporating those factors into multiple regression analysis led to improvements up to R-2 = 0.83 and R-2 = 0.88, respectively. Relationships between LUEp ( = GPP/APAR) and LUEf ( = SiF/APAR) were inconsistent at half-hourly and weak at daily resolutions (R 2 = 0.24). Both at diurnal and seasonal time scales with half-hourly resolution, we found considerably stronger linear relationships between SiF and APAR than between either SiF and GPP or APAR and GPP. Overall, our results indicate that for subdiurnal temporal resolution, canopy SiF in the rice paddy is above all a very good proxy for APAR at diurnal and seasonal time scales and that therefore SiF-based GPP estimation needs to take into account relevant environmental information to model LUEp. These findings can help develop mechanistic links between canopy SiF and GPP across multiple temporal scales.

AB Passive ocean color remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to quantify the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton across the ocean surface. Lidar technology can provide remotely sensed estimates of the vertical distribution of optical properties and suspended particles in natural waters, significantly improving our ability to model upper ocean biogeochemical processes. In this study, we constructed and deployed a ship-based lidar system to measure laser backscattering and linear depolarization profiles in the coastal Mid-Atlantic ranging from estuarine to oceanic conditions, and across the Gulf of Maine (GoM). The instrument identified layers with different backscattering intensity in stratified waters of the coastal Mid-Atlantic and produced system attenuation coefficients (K-sys) approximating the absorption coefficient (a(pg)) of particulate + dissolved matter. The linear depolarization ratio was strongly related to in situ measurements of the particulate backscattering ratio (b(bp)/b(p)). Measurements of K-sys and linear depolarization made across the GoM corresponded well with simultaneous in situ observations performed aboard the M/V Nova Star and by an autonomous glider deployed along the transect. The relationship between K-sys, and a(pg) differed between sampling schemes, likely due to differences in the deployment geometries (e.g., height, nadir angle). These results support the proposition that ship-based lidar systems can provide a powerful tool for remotely measuring the vertical distributions of optical properties and geochemical constituents (e.g., particles) in the upper ocean. Continued development of compact lidar systems for deployment on ships, moorings, and autonomous platforms has the potential to greatly improve the quality and scope of a variety of oceanographic investigations.

AB Characterizing offshore areas for marine conservation faces impediment from logistics and costs of in situ data collection. This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation. Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define "dynamic" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years. This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.

AB The detectability of adjacency effects (AE) in ocean color remote sensing by SeaWiFS, MODIS-A, MERIS, OLCI, OLI and MSI is theoretically assessed for typical observation conditions up to 36 km offshore (20 km for MSI). The methodology detailed in Bulgarelli et al. (2014) is applied to expand previous investigations to the wide range of terrestrial land covers and water types usually encountered in mid-latitude coastal environments. Simulations fully account for multiple scattering within a stratified atmosphere bounded by a non-uniform reflecting surface, sea surface roughness, sun position and off-nadir sensor view. A harmonized comparison of AE is ensured by adjusting the radiometric sensitivity of each sensor to the same input radiance. Results show that average AE in data from MODIS-A, and from MERIS and OLCI in reduced spatial resolution, are still above the sensor noise level (NL) at 36 km offshore, except for AE caused by green vegetation at the red wavelengths. Conversely, in data from the less sensitive SeaWiFS, OLI and MSI sensors, as well as from MERIS and OLCI in full spatial resolution, sole AE caused by highly reflecting land covers (such as snow, dry vegetation, white sand and concrete) are above the sensor NL throughout the transect, while AE originated from green vegetation and bare soil at visible wavelengths may become lower than NL at close distance from the coast. Such a distance increases with the radiometric resolution of the sensor. It is finally observed that AE are slightly sensitive to the water type only at the blue wavelengths. Notably, for an atmospheric correction scheme inferring the aerosol properties from NIR data, perturbations induced by AE at NIR and visible wavelengths might compensate each other. As a consequence, biases induced by AE on radiometric products (e.g., the water-leaving radiance) are not strictly correlated to the intensity of the reflectance of the nearby land.

AB This study presents the first detailed long-term analysis of satellite and ground-based Dobson, Brewer, SAOZ (Systeme D'Analyse par Observations Zenithales) and DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer) measurements inside the Antarctic vortex for the 1979-2013 period. In general, the satellite measurements show a good agreement with ground-based measurements at all stations (correlation coefficient > 0.95). The average relative difference between ground-based and satellite measurements is about +/- 1-3% and the mean bias error (MBE) is within +/- 4 DU, depending on the satellite instrument and ground-based station. The satellite measurements show good stability over their operational period, for which the estimated drifts are about +/- 0.1-5%/decade and are statistically insignificant for most instruments. The Nimbus TOMS (Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) measurements are stable over the period, but the Earth Probe-TOMS measurements show deterioration after 2000. Also, most satellite instruments show no dependency on satellite solar zenith angle (SZA), but reveal significant dependency on stratospheric temperature. In addition, the mean relative difference shows larger variation with lower total column ozone (TCO). This long-term and multi-instrument comparison exercise would help both ground-based and satellite measurement community to better analyse accuracy of the TCO measurements from the instruments and examine the stability of their long-term measurements. In addition, the SZA and temperature dependency assessment would also help the ozone observation community to use better absorption cross-sections for TCO retrievals.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool to map ecosystem properties and functions through time and space. However, general information on the accuracy of this technology to assess the vegetation's biophysical and-chemical trait composition, and on the variables which are mediating this accuracy, is often lacking so far. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap for grass- and shrubland ecosystems and applied novel three-level meta-analytical regression equations to 77 studies that validated hyperspectral remote sensing data with field observations. Our results showed that the accuracy of hyperspectral sensors is generally high, but strongly depends on the trait being studied (leaf area index: R-2 = 0.79 and nRMSE = 0.19, chlorophyll: R-2 = 0.77 and nRMSE = 0.21, carotenoids: R-2 = 0.80 and nRMSE = 0.29, phosphorus: R-2 = 0.75 and nRMSE = 0.14, nitrogen: R-2 = 0.74 and nRMSE = 0.09, water: R-2 = 0.69 and nRMSE = 0.13, and lignin content: R-2 = 0.64 and nRMSE = 0.26). Moreover, they indicated that the use of multivariate signal processing techniques could improve these estimation accuracies (adjusted p < 0.06 for LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen). Finally, estimations from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, allowing for functional mapping at broader spatial scales, were found to be as accurate as estimations from ground-based spectral measurements. Despite these promising findings, we revealed that leaf morphological properties (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) and biochemical traits which are not growth-related (e.g. lignin and cellulose) remain under explored in grass- and shrublands. Moreover there was a strong publication bias towards R2 for assessing model performance. Our findings foster and direct further methodological and technological developments for a more accurate and complete functional characterization of these ecosystems worldwide.

AB Monitoring grazing activities on grassland is crucial for ensuring sustainable grassland development and for protecting it from grazing-led degradation. The Leaf Area Index (LAI), which measures leaf coverage over a surface area, is commonly used as a proxy for grassland condition. However, current studies focus on the year-round or seasonal aggregated LAI change rather than the change that can be attributed explicitly to grazing, which is the important indicator for quantifying grassland grazing. This paper presents a new exponential growth function under grazing with an estimation algorithm, the purpose of which is to extract grazing-led LAI changes for every 8 days' satellite observations. All the analyses are based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD15A2H products. An improved MODIS LAI and an expected LAI are produced separately, considering both current and previous grazing-led LAI changes. The differences between expected LAI and improved LAI are then converted to the equivalent carbon mass of grazed material. This grazed carbon mass is then aggregated within the growing season, and compared with the expected carbon mass consumed by livestock (calculated from statistics yearbooks). In addition, Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is produced using the improved LAI, simulated by a Light Use Efficiency with Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (LUE-VPM). This is compared with the NPP produced by LUE-VPM based on original MODIS LAI, MODIS NPP products (MOD17A2H) and grassland monitoring stations' in situ measured data. Results show that the NPP calculated from the improved LAI is statistically the same as in situ converted NPP with a p-value equalling 0.998 (the RMSE between the two is 97.77 gC/m(2)). Conversely, the p-value between converted in situ measured carbon mass and the MODIS NPP product is 0.011 (the RMSE between the two is 133.98 gC/m(2)), indicating they are statistically different. The results detailed in this paper provide precise and almost real-time grassland grazing monitoring information for policy makers managing grassland.

AB In Phase III of the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study an automatic workflow has been developed for evaluating forest disturbance history using Landsat observations. It has four major components: an automated approach for image selection and preprocessing, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) forest disturbance analysis, postprocessing, and validation. This approach has been applied to the conterminous US (CONUS) to produce a comprehensive analysis of US forest disturbance history using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) cloud computing system. The resultant NAFD-NEX product includes 25 annual forest disturbance maps for 1986-2010 and two time-integrated maps to provide spatial-temporal synoptic view of disturbances over this time period. These maps were derived based on 24,000 + scenes selected from 350,000 + available Landsat images at 30-m resolution, and were validated using a visual assessment of Landsat time-series images in combination with high resolution and other ancillary data sources over samples selected using a probability based sampling method. The validation revealed no major biases in the NAFD-NEX maps for disturbance events that resulted in at least 20% canopy cover loss. The average user's and producer's accuracies for the disturbance class were 53.6% and 53.3%, respectively, with the individual year's user's accuracy varying from 42.8% to 73.6% and producer's accuracy from 39.0% to 84.8% over the 25-year period. The NAFD-NEX disturbance maps are available from a web portal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC).

AB Sea surface roughness (SSR) is commonly used to describe the state of the sea surface. Sun glitter (SG), caused by direct specular reflection of sunlight from the sea surface, and its intensity are strongly affected by SSR. Here, we propose a new model for estimating SSR at a pixel scale using multi-angle SG images. To test our model, high resolution multi-angle SG images acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor were used to estimate SSR. The modal value of SSR was more suitable for describing the background SSR induced by wind, and these data were then converted into wind speed for accuracy evaluation. The estimated wind matched reasonably well with corresponding reanalysis wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting and buoy wind data from the National Data Buoy Center. The results showed that the proposed model has an inversion accuracy that is comparable to other remote sensing methods. Next, we presented three examples of high-resolution SSR images of an oil slick, submarine topography, and internal wave information to illustrate the applications of the model. These estimated SSR images showed detailed oceanographic features with low noise and quantitative changes in SSR at a pixel scale. The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate SSR at a high resolution using multi-angle SG images, and high-resolution SSR observations have considerable applicability to oceanographic phenomena.

AB Modeling the radiative transfer (RT) in heterogeneous forest scenes is important for understanding biophysical processes, as well as retrieving information from remotely sensed data. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is capable of providing highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) canopy structural information that can be used to parameterize RT models. In previous studies, point cloud data (such as terrestrial LiDAR data) are often vox-elized with coarse resolutions, and the foliage voxels are often assumed to be turbid medium. In this study we propose a new voxel-based RT model, namely VBRT, that uses high resolution solid voxels to approximate 3D structure of forest more accurately than coarse resolution turbid medium voxels used in previous studies. Parallel computing techniques are used to speed up computation and the model can run on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. VBRT was tested in four virtual forest scenes, using the well-known physically based ray tracer (PBRT) as a benchmark. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model, which is based on turbid medium voxels, was also compared. Experimental results show that simulated digital imagery and bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) by VBRT and PBRT are in good agreement, and the difference in simulation results can be reduced by using higher resolution voxels or larger number of samples per pixel. According to our test, parameterizing VBRT using high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data with 0.02 m voxels can produce more accurate results than DART with turbid medium voxels (0.1 m), although VBRT is more computation-intensive due to the use of higher resolution voxels. Our results indicate that VBRT has good potential in modeling radiation transfer in forests, as it is possible to parameterize the model using high density point cloud data such as terrestrial LiDAR data.

AB Remote sensing of inland and sea waters depends on the quality of the retrieval of the water-leaving radiance from the top-of-atmosphere measurements. The water-leaving radiance can be difficult to observe due to the reflection of direct sunlight on the air-water interface (sunglint) in the direction of the satellite field of view. The viewing geometry of Sentinel-2 satellite (European Space Agency) makes it vulnerable to sunglint contamination. In this paper, an original method is proposed to correct Sentinel-2-like imagery for sunglint contamination. The sunglint contribution is first estimated from the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) part of the spectrum and then extrapolated toward the near-infrared and visible bands. The spectral variation of the sunglint signal is thus revisited for a wide spectral range (from 350 to 2500 nm). The bidirectional reflectance distribution function related to the sunglint is shown to vary by > 28% from the SWIR to the blue bands of Sentinel-2. The application of the proposed algorithm on actual Sentinel-2 data demonstrates that sunglint patterns are satisfactorily removed over the entire images whatever the altitude of the observed target. Comparison with in situ data of water-leaving radiances (AERONET-OC) showed that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the correlation between satellite and in situ data by 55% (i.e., from R-2 = 0.56 to R-2 = 0.87). In addition, the discrepancies between satellite and in situ measurements are reduced by 60%. It is also shown that the aerosol data provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) can be safely used within the proposed algorithm to correct the Sentinel-2-like satellite data for both sunglint and atmospheric radiances. Improvements of the proposed method potentially rely on simultaneous retrievals of the aerosol optical properties. The proposed method is applicable to any satellite sensor which is able to measure in SWIR spectral bands over aquatic environments.

In this study, we perform a large-scale characterization of the morphology and internal layering of linear dunes in hyper-arid areas on Earth, through utilizing multiple complementary radar datasets (SIR-C imaging, SRTM interferometry-derived elevations and radar sounding or Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). Linear dune fields in the Egyptian desert are of special interest, due to their significance as planetary analogs to dunes on Mars and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Satellite radar imagery and elevation data of the region show significant variance in the geomorphology of different dune fields in Egypt. In addition, GPR probing of the first few meters suggests different inner settings in the layering of dunes of different ages in eastern and western Egypt, reflecting different paleoclimatic regimes that led to their formation. Furthermore, our radiometric analysis suggests that dunes with different inner layering arrangement also exhibit different radar backscatter returns as a function of their heights. For relatively younger dunes with a homogeneous inner structure, like the ones in eastern Egypt in the Qattaniya dune field, we observe that sigma0 does not change as a function of the dune height. For relatively older dunes in western Egypt like the Great Sand Sea (Northern (Siwa) and Southern dune fields), we observed a linear correlation between sigma0 and the dune height. Thus, surface properties of dunes like morphology and backscatter variation with height are related to inner characteristics like arrangement of internal layering, relative ages and can be used to infer their depositional history.
   Linear dunes discovered in the equatorial regions of Titan by the Cassini-Huygens mission are morphologically very similar to these linear dune fields in the Egyptian Sahara. Hence, assessing the variability of morphology and radar backscatter properties of Titan's dunes as a function of their heights can help constrain the ambiguities associated with their internal structure and formation history and provide insights into Titan's paleowind regimes.

AB Light absorption of the colored fraction of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a dominant optical component of the Arctic Ocean (AO). Here we show Pan-Arctic characteristics of CDOM light absorption for various Arctic regions covering both coastal and oceanic waters during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12% (root mean square error of 0.3 m(-1)) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r(2) > 0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28%. Implications for the monitoring of DOC concentrations in Arctic coastal waters are discussed.

AB A time series of annual land use and land cover (LULC) maps that cover an extended period of time is a key dataset for climatological studies investigating land-atmosphere interaction. Change in LULC can influence regional climate by altering the surface roughness, soil moisture, heat flux partition, and terrestrial carbon storage. Although annual global LULC maps are generated from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the earliest MODIS LULC map is for 2001, which limits the potential time period for climatological analyses. This study produced a continuous series of annual LULC maps of China from 1982 to 2013 using random forest classification of 19 phonological metrics derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third generation NDVI (NDVI3g) data. The classifier was trained using reference data derived from the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1). Based on a comparison with Google Earth images, the overall accuracy of a simplified eight-class version of our 2012 LULC map is 73.8%, which is not significantly different from the accuracy of the MODIS map of the same year. Our maps indicate that for the three decades studied, the area of croplands and forests in China increased, and the area of grasslands decreased. These annual maps of land cover will be an important dataset for future climate studies, and the methodologies used in this study can be applied to other geographical regions where availability of continuous time series of LULC maps is limited.

AB Elevation is a key environmental factor influencing both biological and ecological phenomena in mountain environments. Mountains are useful areas for studying impacts associated with climatic change, as their significant biological diversity often varies in conjunction with elevation. While previous studies have used remote sensing to quantify the impacts of elevation differences on land surface phenology descriptors in mountains, they have focused almost exclusively on the Northern Hemisphere. This study fills this gap by presenting a 15-year phenological time-series for the Australian Alps derived using data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Phenological descriptors were estimated from the MODIS time-series and they corresponded with the start, end and duration of the growing period (SGP, EGP and DGP, respectively) for the major vegetation communities in the Australian Alps. Results indicated that the descriptor corresponding with the start of the growing period was more sensitive to changes in elevation, while the results for the end of the growing period descriptor were more uniform, particularly at lower elevations. For all but the highest elevation areas in the Australian Alps, the results indicated an overall trend towards an earlier start and later end to the growing period, culminating in a longer duration of the growing period. These findings are consistent with those previously reported in the literature, though they are likely influenced by the fire history of the alpine areas., (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) from remote sensing is of tremendous significance to monitor the physiological status of vegetation or to estimate primary production. Many vegetation indices (Vls) have been developed to retrieve Cab at the canopy level from meter- to decameter-scale reflectance observations. However, most of these Vls may be affected by the possible confounding influence of canopy structure. The objective of this study is to develop methods for Cab estimation using millimeter to centimeter spatial resolution reflectance imagery acquired at the field level.
   Hyperspectral images were acquired over sugar beet canopies from a ground-based platform in the 400-1000 nm range, concurrently to Cab, green fraction (GF), green area index (GAI) ground measurements. The original image spatial resolution was successively degraded from 1 mm to 35 cm, resulting in eleven sets of hyperspectral images. Vegetation and soil pixels were discriminated, and for each spatial resolution, measured Cab values were related to various Vls computed over four sets of reflectance spectra extracted from the images (soil and vegetation pixels, only vegetation pixels, 50% darkest and brightest vegetation pixels). The selected Vls included some classical Vls from the literature as well as optimal combinations of spectral bands, including simple ratio (SR), modified normalized difference (mND) and structure insensitive pigment index (SIPI). In the case of mND and SIPI, the use of a blue reference band instead of the classical near-infrared one was also investigated. For the eleven spatial resolutions, the four pixel selections and the five VI formats, similar band combinations are obtained when optimizing VI performances: the main bands of interest are generally located in the blue, red, red edge and near-infrared domains. Overall, mND(blue)[728,850] defined as (R-440-R-728)/(R-440+R-850) and computed over the brightest green pixels obtains the best correlations with C-ab for spatial resolutions finer than 8.8 cm with a root mean square error of prediction better than 2.6 mu g/cm(2). Conversely, mND(blue)[728,8501 poorly correlates with variations in GF and GAI, thus reducing the risk of deriving non-causal relationships with Cab that would actually be due to the covariance between C-ab and these canopy structure variables. As mND(blue)[728,8501 can be calculated from most current multispectral sensors, it is therefore a promising VI to retrieve C-ab from millimeter- to centimeter-scale reflectance imagery.

AB Numerous studies have investigated reflectance-based estimations of physico-chemical leaf traits such as the contents of light absorbing pigments, leaf mass per area, or carbon and nitrogen contents. Only few studies, however, attempted to estimate leaf traits that are more directly linked to photosynthesis. We tested the feasibility of estimating two important photosynthesis traits, the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax, 25) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max), 25), from in-situ leaf reflectance spectra using approaches that are applicable also on larger spatial scales. We conducted measurements of reflectance, CO2 response curves, leaf mass per area (LMA), and nitrogen content per area (Na) for 37 temperate deciduous tree species and a total of 242 leaves from widely differing light environments. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to estimate V-cmax, 25, J(max), 25, LMA, and Na from reflectance spectra.
   The results showed that both V-cmax, 25 and J(max), 25 can be estimated from leaf reflectance measurements with good accuracy (R-2= 0.64 for V-cmax, 25, R-2= 0.70 for J(max), 25) even for a large number of tree species and varying light environments. Detailed analysis of reflectance-based PLS and linear regression models with regard to prediction performances and regression coefficients led to the conclusion that the correlation to Na was the dominating mechanism on which the V-cmax, 25 and J(max), 25 PLS models were based. The PLS regression coefficients of Na, V-cmax, 25 and J(max), 25 showed clear signatures of nitrogen-related absorption features.
   The finding that V-cmax, 25 and J(max), 25 estimations from leaf reflectance are predominantly based on their relationships to Na has important implications for large scale estimations of these photosynthesis parameters. We suggest that future studies should focus more on large scale estimation of Na from remote sensing and estimate V-cmax,V- 25 and J(max), 25 in a separate step using their respective relationships to Na.

AB Spatially-explicit tree species distribution maps are increasingly valuable to forest managers and researchers in light of the effects of climate change and invasive pests on forest resources. Traditional forest classifications are limited to broad classes of forest types with variable accuracy. Advanced remote sensing techniques, such as spectral unmixing and object-based image analysis, offer novel forest mapping approaches by quantifying proportional species composition at the pixel level and utilizing ancillary environmental data for forest classifications. This is particularly useful in the Northeastern region of the United States where species composition is often mixed.
   Here we employed a hierarchical forest mapping approach using spectral unmixing of multi-temporal Landsat imagery to quantify percent basal area for ten common tree species/genera across northern New York and Vermont. Basal area maps were then refined using an object-based ruleset to produce a thematic forest classification. Validation with 50 field inventory plots covering a range of species compositions indicated that the quality of percent basal area mapping largely reflected the number of "pure" (>80% BA) endmember plots available for calibration, with more common species mapped at a higher accuracy (i.e. Acer saccharum, adj. r(2) = 0.44, compared to Populus sp., adj. r(2) = 0.24). The resulting thematic forest classification mapped 15 forest classes (nine species/genus level and six common species assemblages) with overall accuracy = 42%, KHAT = 33%, fuzzy accuracy = 86% at the pixel level, and 38%, KHAT = 29%, fuzzy accuracy = 84% at the object level.
   Using the validation plots to compare existing forest classification products, this hierarchical approach provided more class detail (11 represented classes) and higher accuracy than the National Forest Type Map (six represented classes, overall accuracy 18%, fuzzy accuracy 70%), LANDFIRE (five represented classes, overall accuracy 28%, fuzzy accuracy 80%) and National Land Cover Database (three represented classes, overall accuracy = 56%).
   These results show that more detailed and accurate forest mapping is possible using a combination of multi-temporal imagery, spectral unmixing, and rule-based classification techniques. Improved large-scale forest mapping has important implications for natural resource management and other modeling applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over one-third of the global land area undergoes a seasonal transition between predominantly frozen and non-frozen conditions each year, with the land surface freeze/thaw (FT) state a significant control on hydrological and biospheric processes over northern land areas and at high elevations. The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission produced a daily landscape FT product at 3-km spatial resolution derived from ascending and descending orbits of SMAP high-resolution L-band (1.4 GHz) radar measurements. Following the failure of the SMAP radar in July 2015, coarser (36-km) footprint SMAP radiometer inputs were used to develop an alternative daily passive microwave freeze/thaw product. In this study, in situ observations are used to examine differences in the sensitivity of the 3-km radar versus the 36-km radiometer measurements to the landscape freeze/thaw state during the period of overlapping instrument operation. Assessment of the retrievals at high-latitude SMAP core validation sites showed excellent agreement with in situ flags, exceeding the 80% SMAP mission accuracy requirement. Similar performance was found for the radar and radiometer products using both air temperature and soil temperature derived FT reference flags. There was a tendency for SMAP thaw retrievals to lead the surface flags due to the influence of wet snow cover conditions on both the radar and radiometer signal. Comparison with other satellite derived FT products showed those derived from passive measurements (SMAP radiometer; Aquarius radiometer; Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - 2) retrieved less frozen area than the active products (SMAP radar; Aquarius radar).

AB This paper presents a new atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) retrieval method based on three thermal infrared band observations from geostationary satellites. The proposed method is similar to the traditional physical split-window (PSW) retrieval technique, but a water vapor channel observation near 6.7 mu m was included. Sensitivity analyses and simulation retrievals were carried out respectively according to the instrument characteristics of the Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer onboard FengYun-2G (SVISSR/FY-2G) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra (MODIS/Terra). The results indicate that the proposed 3-band algorithm can significantly reduce PWV retrieval errors caused by surface emissivity uncertainty and observation errors, especially in dry atmospheric conditions (i.e., PWV < 2 cm). The proposed algorithm was validated using SVISSR/FY-2G and MODIS/Terra observations, and was compared with radiosonde and GPS PWV. The determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias between the SVISSR retrieved PWV and the radiosonde PWV are 0.87, 0.43 cm and 0.14 cm, respectively. The R-2, RMSE and bias of the MODIS retrieved PWV are 0.89, 0.10 cm and - 0.042 cm, respectively, which are slightly better than the MODIS L2 thermal infrared and near-infrared PWV products.

AB The National Mapping Agency in Sweden has conducted an airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaign covering almost the entire country for the purpose of creating a new national Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The ALS data were collected between 2009 and 2015 using Leica, Optech, Riegi, and Trimble scanners and have a point density of 0.5-1.0 pulses/m(2). A high resolution national raster database (12.5 m x 12.5 m cell size) with forest variables was produced by combining the ALS data with field data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). Approximately 11500 NFI plots (10 meter radius) located on productive forest land, inventoried between 2009 and 2013, were used to create linear regression models relating selected forest variables, or transformations of the variables, to metrics derived from the ALS data. The resulting stand level relative RMSEs for predictions of stem volume, basal area, basal-area weighted mean tree height, and basal-area weighted mean stem diameter were in the ranges of 17.2-22.0%, 13.9-18.2%, 5.4-9.5%, and 8.7-13.1%, respectively. It was concluded that the predictions had an accuracy that were at least as good as data typically used in forest management planning. Above ground tree biomass was also included in the national raster database but not validated on a stand -level. An important part of the project was to make the raster database available to private forest owners, forest associations, forest companies, authorities, researchers, and the general public. Thus, all predicted forest variables can be viewed and downloaded free of charge at the Swedish Forest Agency's homepage (http://www. skogsstyrelsen.se/skogligagrunddata). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents a novel method of multi-temporal land cover classification based on the polarization signature (PS). Additionally, the temporal change of the scattering mechanism of crops and other land cover classes is analyzed based on the PS. Firstly, the scattering mechanisms of corn, soybean, wheat, forest and urban over time are analyzed. The correlation coefficient is computed between their PS and the PS of canonical targets to study their relationships with the completely polarized surface, dihedral, dipole and helix scattering targets. The pedestal height (PH) of their PS is also calculated to investigate their un-polarized components such as multiple scattering. Then, a novel multi-temporal supervised binary-tree classification scheme (MTSBTCS) with a criterion that maximizes the power difference of PS (MDPS) is developed (MTSBTCS-MDPS), in which the MDPS is proposed to find the optimum orientation angle, ellipticity angle and image acquisition date to maximize the power difference of two different land cover classes and a binary-tree classifier is constructed for the final multi-temporal classification. Seven fully polarimetric C-band RADARASAT-2 images in Fine Quad (FQ) 21 mode acquired in southwestern Ontario, Canada during the entire growing season from May to September in 2012 are used for the purpose of the scattering mechanism analysis and validation of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. The experiment demonstrates that, the scattering mechanism varies with crop type and also changes greatly for each crop when they are in different growing stages. However, the scattering mechanisms of urban and forest areas remain almost the same. In terms of the classification, comparison of the MDPS with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the Wishart distance (WD), shows that for the single-date image classification, both MDPS and WD achieve much higher accuracy on each date than that of the SVM and RF, but the MDPS consumes more time than that of the WD and its accuracy is also lower. However, when they are applied to the multi-temporal images, both SVM and RF suffer a severe misclassification between forest and urban with their accuracy lower than that of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. In addition, the MTSBTCS-MDPS developed in this paper is much less time-consuming approximately 2.5 times less than that of the MTSBTCS-WD, meanwhile, it also achieves the highest accuracy with its overall accuracy of 87.5% and kappa coefficient of 0.85 among all methods applied.

AB Remote sensing-based retrieval of the concentrations of water components relies largely on the accuracy of the atmospheric correction. Although a variety of atmospheric correction algorithms have been developed for turbid waters, the water-leaving reflectance is still underestimated in extremely turbid waters, such as in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a spectral optimization algorithm (ESOA) with a coupled water-atmosphere model. The model combines an aerosol model that is constructed from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation data and a simple semi-empirical radiative transfer (SERT) model (Shen et al. 2010) for water component retrieval. Four unknown parameters are involved in the coupled model: the relative humidity (RH), fine-mode fraction (FMF), aerosol optical thickness in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength tau(a)(lambda(0)) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration (C-spm). These parameters are estimated by a global optimization approach that is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) without any initial inputs. Validation results of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) from matchups between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and in situ data show that the algorithm has satisfactory accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the absolute percentage difference (APD) are 0.0089 and 35.12, respectively. By contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved from the same matchups using the GOCI data processing system (GDPS) have higher RMSE and APD of 0.0104 and 69.15, respectively. The ESOA method can be implemented conveniently within the open source code of SeaDAS (v7.1) as an alternative and operational tool for atmospheric correction of ocean color data, including GOCI, MERIS and MODIS, over highly turbid estuarine and coastal regions, such as the Yangtze estuary, the Hangzhou Bay and most of the coastal ocean in Eastern China.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a markedly directional variable and its remotely sensed measurement may be strongly affected by viewing and illumination geometries. This study proposes the use of LST products collocated in space and time, but obtained with different viewing angles, to calibrate a simple model capable of characterizing the LST angular variability. The exercise is performed using MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and SEVIRI (Meteosat) LST products, for an area covering Mediterranean Europe and Northern Africa and encompassing the full years of 2011,2012, 2013 and 2014. The approach relies on a kernel model that is composed by an "emissivity kernel" and a "solar kernel", associated to observation angle anisotropy and to shadowing/sunlit effects on the surface, respectively. The spatial distribution of the kernel coefficients is shown to reflect characteristics of the landscape, both in terms of vegetation cover and topography. Model performance is assessed through several comparison exercises over the 4-year period under analysis. Cross-validation results show that the angular correction by the kernel model leads to a decrease of the root mean square difference between SEVIRI and MODIS daytime (night-time) LST products, from the original uncorrected values of 3.5 K (1.5 K) to 2.3 K (1.3 K). Comparison of both MSG and MODIS LST products against in situ daytime measurements gathered over 2 years at a validation site in Evora (Portugal) reveals that the angular correction leads to a decrease in root mean square error from 4.6 K (2.0 K) to 3.8 K (1.9 K) for MODIS (SEVIRI). The kernel model may be a useful tool to quantify the LST uncertainties associated with viewing and illumination angles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Active radar backscatter (sigma degrees) observations from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and passive radiometer brightness temperature (TB) observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission are assimilated either individually or jointly into the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) to improve its simulations of soil moisture and land evaporation. To enable sigma degrees and TB assimilation, GLEAM is coupled to the Water Cloud Model and the L -band Microwave Emission from the Biosphere (L-MEB) model. The innovations, i.e. differences between observations and simulations, are mapped onto the model soil moisture states through an Ensemble Kalman Filter. The validation of surface (0-10 cm) soil moisture simulations over the period 2010-2014 against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) shows that assimilating sigma degrees or TB alone improves the average correlation of seasonal anomalies (R-an) from 0.514 to 0.547 and 0.548, respectively. The joint assimilation further improves Ran to 0.559. Associated enhancements in daily evaporative flux simulations by GLEAM are validated based on measurements from 22 FLUXNET stations. Again, the singular assimilation improves R-an from 0.502 to 0.536 and 0.533, respectively for sigma degrees and TB, whereas the best performance is observed for the joint assimilation (R-an = 0.546). These results demonstrate the complementary value of assimilating radar backscatter observations together with brightness temperatures for improving estimates of hydrological variables, as their joint assimilation outperforms the assimilation of each observation type separately.

TI Rain footprints on C-band synthetic aperture radar images of the ocean -
   Revisited

AB It is well known that rain leaves footprints on the sea surface that sometimes become visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Rain cells can easily be detected on SAR images at all radar frequencies when they are associated with a downdraft pattern. But rain cells are not always associated with downdraft and rain can also occur in other forms, as stratified rain, rain bands, and squall lines. It turns out that radar signatures of rain at C-band are much more complex than at L- or X-band radar and that it is particularly difficult to identify unambiguously rain events on C-band SAR images acquired over the ocean. This is because C-band lies in the transition region where raindrops impinging onto the sea surface can increase (usually) or decrease the backscattered radar power and where volume scattering and attenuation by rain drops in the atmosphere are not always negligible (at very high rain rates). In order to get an insight into the physical mechanisms causing the C-band radar signatures of rain, we first revisit results obtained from historic laboratory and field experiments and multi-frequency/multi-polarization SAR data acquired during the SIR-C/X-SAR spaceshuttle mission in 1994. Then we analyze several C-band SAR images acquired by the European satellites Envisat and Sentinel-1A, and the Canadian satellite Radarsat-2 and compare them, whenever possible, with quasi-coincident and collocated weather radar images. The observational data show that, at low to medium rain rates, the main physical mechanism causing C-band radar signatures of rain is Bragg scattering at ring waves generated by the rain drops impinging onto the sea surface, which increase the radar backscatter. However, areas of increased radar backscatter are often accompanied by adjacent areas of decreased radar backscatter, which is due to attenuation of the Bragg waves by turbulence also generated by the impinging rain drops. Furthermore, we present a full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 SAR image of a rain cell together with a polarimetric decomposition analysis, which shows that the C-band radar signature of a rain cell is caused by surface scattering. The observation show that radar signatures of rain cells often contain segments, where the co-polarized as well the cross-polarized radar backscatter are strongly enhanced, which indicates non-Bragg scattering contributions to the scattering process. Furthermore, the polarimetric decomposition analysis shows that the C-band radar signature of a rain cell is dominated by surface scattering. Possible mechanisms, like scattering at splash products, are discussed. Whether the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) due to rain is increased or decreased depends on rain rate, wind speed, incidence angle, and history of the rain event. At low to moderate wind speeds (<10 ms(-1)) and low to medium high rain rates (<50 mm h(-1)), the NRCS is usually increased by up to 8 dB, and at high wind speeds (>10 m s(-1)) and low to high rain rates (but <50 mm h(-1)), the NRCS is usually decreased by up to 3 dB.

AB The potential research, policy and management applications of global burned area products place a high priority on rigorous, quantitative assessment of their accuracy. Such an assessment can be achieved by implementing validation methods employing design-based inference in which the independent reference data are selected via a probability sampling design. The majority of global burned area validation exercises use Landsat data to derive the independent reference data. This paper presents a three-dimensional sampling grid that allows for probability sampling of Landsat data in both space and time. To sample the globe in the spatial domain with non-overlapping sampling units, the Thiessen Scene Area (TSA) tessellation of the Landsat path/row geometry is used. The TSA grid is combined in time with the 16-day Landsat acquisition calendar to provide three-dimensional elements (voxels). This allows for implementation of stratified random sampling designs, where not only the location but also the time interval of the independent reference data is explicitly drawn by probability sampling. To illustrate this, we use a stratification methodology based on the Olson global ecoregion map and on the MODIS global active fire product. Using the global MODIS burned area product to establish a hypothetical population of reference data, we show that a sampling scheme based on the proposed stratification with equal sample allocation among strata is effective in reducing the standard errors of accuracy and area estimators compared to simple random sampling. Globally, the standard errors were reduced by 63%, 54%, 22% and 53% for overall accuracy, omission error, commission error and total burned area estimates respectively. By incorporating probability sampling in both the spatial and temporal domains, the present study establishes the foundation for rigorous design based validation of global burned area products and, more generally, of terrestrial thematic products that have high temporal variability.

AB We made an assessment on the use of 12-bit resolution of Landsat 8 (L8) on evapotranspiration (ET) retrievals via the METRIC process as compared to using 8-bit resolution imagery of previous Landsat missions. METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution using Internalized Calibration) is an ET retrieval system commonly used in water and water rights management where the surface energy balance process is coupled with an extreme-end point calibration process to remove most impacts of systematic bias in remotely sensed inputs. We degraded L8 thermal images by grouping sequential digital numbers to reduce the apparent numerical resolution and then recomputed ET using METRIC and compared to nondegraded ET products. The use of 8-bit thermal data did not substantially impair the accuracy of ET retrievals derived from METRIC, as compared to the use of 12-bit thermal data. The largest error introduced into ET was <1%. We also compared ET retrieved from images processed during the 1,8 and Landsat 7 (L7) March 2013 underfly to assess differences in ET caused by differences in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and scaling of the two systems.
   We evaluated the impact of bias in land surface temperature (LST) retrievals on ET determination using the CIMEC calibration approach (Calibration using Inverse Modeling using Extreme Member Calibration) employed in METRIC by introducing globally systematic biases into LST retrievals from L7 and L8 and comparing to ET from non-biased retrievals. The impacts of the introduction of both additive and multiplicative biases into surface temperature on ET were small for the three regions of the US studied, and for both L7 and L8 satellite systems. An independent study showed that METRIC-produced ET compared to within 3% of measured ET for the California site. The study assessed the impact of the February 2014 recalibration of L8 thermal data that caused a 3 K downward shift in LST estimation and changed reflectance values by about 0.7%. We found that the use of the recalibrated LST and shortwave data sets in METRIC did not change the accuracy of ET retrievals due to the automatic compensation for systematic biases employed by METRIC.

AB The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical input in numerous climatological and ecological models. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10%, or 0.05, for many applications. However, most of the FAPAR products in current usage have not yet fulfilled the accuracy requirement, thus requiring further improvements. In this study, a new FAPAR estimation model is developed on the basis of the radiative transfer (RT) for a horizontally homogeneous continuous canopy. The spatially explicit parameterization of leaf scattering and soil background reflectance is derived from a 13-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo database. The new algorithm requires the input of leaf area index (LAI), which is estimated by a hybrid geometric optical-RT model suitable for both continuous and discrete vegetation canopies in this study. The model calculated radiative surface fluxes, i.e., canopy reflectance, absorption, and transmittance, are compared with the reference data from Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The evaluation results show that the model estimated FAPAR has an uncertainty of 0.08 over homogeneous and heterogeneous canopies. The FAPAR estimates from the new model are intercompared with reference satellite FAPAR products and validated with ground-based measurements at the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) AmeriFlux experimental sites. The validation results show that the FAPAR estimates from the new model are comparable to or slightly better in performance than the MODIS and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) FAPAR products when using corresponding satellite LAI product values as the input. The FAPAR estimates are further improved when using the new LAI estimates from the hybrid model as the input. The new model adequately identifies the growing seasons and produces smooth time series curves of estimated FAPAR during a specific duration. The uncertainty is reduced to 0.1 when validating with total FAPAR measurements, and 0.08 when validating with green FAPAR measurements. The improvements are apparent in grasslands and forests with an uncertainty reduction of 0.06. The regional scale application of the presented model generates consistent FAPAR maps at spatial resolutions of 30 m, 500 m, and 1 km from the Landsat, MODIS, and MISR data, respectively.

AB Accurate estimation of the gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is vital fora better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of the global carbon cycle. In this study, we estimate GPP in North America (NA) using the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), MODIS images at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions, and NCEP-NARR (National Center for Environmental Prediction-North America Regional Reanalysis) climate data. The simulated GPP (GPP(VPM)) agrees well with the flux tower derived GPP (GPP(EC)) at 39 AmeriFlux sites (155 site-years). The GPP(VPM) in 2010 is spatially aggregated to 0.5 by 0.5 grid cells and then compared with sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data from Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2), which is directly related to vegetation photosynthesis. Spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of GPP(VPM) and GOME-2 SIF show good consistency. At the biome scale, GPP(VPM) and SIF shows strong linear relationships (R-2 > 0.95) and small variations in regression slopes (4.60-5.55 g C m(-2) day(-1)/mW m(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1)). The total annual GPP(VPM) in NA in 2010 is approximately 13.53 Pg C year(-1), which accounts for similar to 11.0% of the global terrestrial GPP and is within the range of annual GPP estimates from six other process-based and data-driven models (11.35-22.23 Pg C year(-1)) Among the seven models, some models did not capture the spatial pattern of GOME-2 SIF data at annual scale, especially in Midwest cropland region. The results from this study demonstrate the reliable performance of VPM at the continental scale, and the potential of SIF data being used as a benchmark to compare with GPP models.

AB This study presents a comparison and integration of three methods commonly used to estimate the amount of forest ecosystem carbon (C) available for storage. In particular, we examine the representation of living above and below-ground biomass change (net accumulation) using plot-level biometry and repeat airborne laser scanning (ALS) of three dimensional forest plot structure. These are compared with cumulative net CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem production, NEP) from eddy covariance (EC) over a six-year period within a jack pine chronosequence of four stands (similar to 94, 30, 14 and 3 years since establishment from 2005) located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Combining the results of the two methods yield valuable observations on the partitioning of C within ecosystems. Subtracting total living biomass C accumulation from NEP results in a residual that represents change in soil and litter C storage. When plotted against time for the stands investigated, the curve produced is analogous to the soil C dynamics described in Covington (1981). Here, ALS biomass accumulation exceeds EC-based NEP measured in young stands, with the residual declining with age as stands regenerate and litter decomposition stabilizes. During the 50-70 year age-period, NEP and live biomass accumulation come into balance, with the soil and litter pools of stands 70-100 years post-disturbance becoming a net store of C. Biomass accumulation was greater in 2008-2011 compared to 2005-2008, with the smallest increase in the 94-year-old "old jack pine" stand and greatest in the 14-year-old "harvested jack pine 1994" stand, with values of 1.4 (+/- 3.2) tC ha(-1) and 12.0 (+/- 1.6) tC ha(-1), respectively. The efficiency with which CO2 was stored in accumulated biomass was lowest in the youngest and oldest stands, but peaked during rapid regeneration following harvest (14-year-old stand). The analysis highlights that the primary source of uncertainty in the data integration workflow is in the calculation of biomass expansion factors, and this aspect of the workflow needs to be implemented with caution to avoid large error propagations. We suggest that the adoption of integrated ALS, in situ and atmospheric flux monitoring frameworks is needed to improve spatio-temporal partitioning of C balance components at sub-decadal scale within rapidly changing forest ecosystems and for use in national carbon accounting programs.

TI Multi-dimensional interpolation of SMOS sea surface salinity with
   surface temperature and in situ salinity data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; SATELLITE; SPACE
AB Availability of accurate remotely-sensed sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements is crucial to investigating fundamental aspects of the global hydrological cycle, ocean dynamics and marine biogeochemistry. The European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has been specifically designed for this aim. However, SMOS data display a high level of noise with respect to the signal they have to detect. Space-time averaging over relatively large sampling periods/areas is thus generally carried out to increase SSS accuracy, and further interpolation is required to fill in data gaps resulting from both mission geometry and other instrumental/physical limitations. Here, a daily, 1/4 degrees nominal resolution, mesoscale-resolving SSS field product is obtained by using a multidimensional optimal interpolation (OI) algorithm combining SMOS salinity retrievals and satellite sea surface temperature data with in situ salinity measurements. The methodology has been developed in the framework of the ESA OSMOSIS (Ocean ecosystem Modelling based on Observations from Satellite and In-Situ data) project and it is applied here to a wide zonal portion of the Southern Hemisphere (10 degrees S-65 degrees S). The interpolated SSS has been validated by looking at the differences with respect to fully independent in situ observations and by performing a wavenumber spectrum analysis. Despite minor progress being obtained in terms of root mean square of the differences with respect to in situ observations, a significant improvement in terms of effective spatial resolution is obtained with the new technique with respect to presently available SSS observation-based analyses.

AB The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, have provided more than a decade of global fire data. Here we describe improvements made to the fire detection algorithm and swath-level product that were implemented as part of the Collection 6 land product reprocessing, which commenced in May 2015. The updated algorithm is intended to address limitations observed with the previous Collection 5 fire product, notably the occurrence of false alarms caused by small forest clearings, and the omission of large fires obscured by thick smoke. Processing was also expanded to oceans and other large water bodies to facilitate monitoring of offshore gas flaring. Additionally, fire radiative power (FRP) is now retrieved using a radiance-based approach, generally decreasing FRP for all but the comparatively small fraction of high intensity fire pixels. We performed a Stage-3 validation of the Collection 5 and Collection 6 Terra MODIS fire products using reference fire maps derived from more than 2500 high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images. Our results indicated targeted improvements in the performance of the Collection 6 active fire detection algorithm compared to Collection 5, with reduced omission errors over large fires, and reduced false alarm rates in tropical ecosystems. Overall, the MOD14 Collection 6 daytime global commission error was 1.2%, compared to 2.4% in Collection 5. Regionally, the probability of detection for Collection 6 exhibited a similar to 3% absolute increase in Boreal North America and Boreal Asia compared to Collection 5, a similar to 1% absolute increase in Equatorial Asia and Central Asia, a similar to 1% absolute decrease in South America above the Equator, and little or no change in the remaining regions considered. Not unexpectedly, the observed variability in the probability of detection was strongly driven by regional differences in fire size. Overall, there was a net improvement in Collection 6 algorithm performance globally. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Reliable estimations of stem volume are important for sustainable forest management planning as well as for monitoring of global changes. However, the derivation of stem volume in cubic meters per hectare based on traditional sampling-based forest inventories (usually with a repetition rate of ten years) is very expensive, labor-intensive and only available for the minority of the forest areas worldwide. Thus, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can provide estimations of forest parameters with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for large areas. Height information extracted from two interferometric dual-polarized TanDEM-X data sets were used to investigate the potential of polarimetric interferometric X-band SAR data for stem volume estimation in the complex forest stands of the Traunstein forest in Southeast Bavaria, Germany. In contrast to other studies of forest parameter estimation from X-band SAR data carried out in boreal or tropical forest stands, the current study investigated stem volume estimation based on X-band SAR data in complex temperate forest stands. A linear regression model based on the allometric relationship of forest height (estimated from SAR data combined with an airborne LiDAR-based Digital Terrain Model) and stem volume per unit area (deduced from traditional forest inventory) was derived. Moreover, the model was extended and thus improved by integrating novel parameters derived from the co-occurrence matrix as surrogates for horizontal forest structure. This linear regression model predicted stem volume at plot (circular plots of 500 m(2)) level with a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 69% and a root mean square error of RMSE = 155 m(3) ha(-1) and stand (areas of 1.5 to 6.4 ha) level with R-2 = 94% and RMSE = 44 m(3) ha(-1) respectively.

AB Shifts in ecosystem phenology play an important role in the definition of inter-annual variability of net ecosystem carbon uptake. A good estimate at the global scale of ecosystem phenology, mainly that of photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP), may be provided by vegetation indices derived from MODIS satellite image data.
   However, the relationship between the start date of a growing (or greening) season (SGS) when derived from different vegetation indices (VI's), and the starting day of carbon uptake is not well elucidated. Additionally, the validation of existing phenology data with in-situ measurements is largely missing. We have investigated the possibility to use different VI's to predict the starting day of the growing season for 28 FLUXNET sites as well as MODIS data. This analysis included main plant functional types (PFT's).
   Of all VI's taken into account in this paper, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) shows the highest correlation coefficient for the relationship between the starting day of the growing season as observed with MODIS and in-situ observations. However, MODIS observations elicit a 20-21 days earlier SGS date compared to in-situ observations. The prediction for the NEE start of the growing season diverges when using different VI's, and seems to depend on the amplitude for carbon and VI and on PFT. The optimal VI for estimation of a SGS date was PFT-specific for example the WRDVI for cropland, but the MODIS NDVI performed best when applied as an estimator for Net Ecosystem Exchange and when considering all PFF's pooled.

AB Among the forestry-related applications for which airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have been shown to be beneficial, forest inventory has been investigated as much if not more than other applications. Metrics extracted from ALS data for spatial units such as plots and grid cells are typically of two forms: echo-based metrics derived directly from the three-dimensional distribution of the point cloud data and metrics derived from a canopy height model (CHM). For both cases, a large number of metrics can be calculated and used to construct parametric and non-parametric models to predict forest variables.
   We compared model-assisted estimates of total forest aboveground biomass (AGB) obtained using echo-based and CHM-based height metrics with two prediction methods: (i) a parametric linear model, and (ii) the non parametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique. Model-assisted (MA) estimators were used with sample data obtained using a two-phase, tessellation stratified sampling (TSS) framework to estimate population parameters. The study was conducted in Molise Region in central Italy.
   For the four combinations of metrics and prediction techniques, estimates of total biomass were similar, in the range 1.96-2.1 million t, with standard error estimates that were also similar, in the range 0.20-0.21 t. Thus, the CHM-based metrics produced AGB estimates that were similar to and as accurate as those for the echo based metrics, regardless of whether the parametric or the non-parametric prediction method was used. Additionally, the proposed MA estimator was more accurate than the estimator that did not use auxiliary data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The recently launched WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite is a high spatial resolution instrument with eight multi spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared and an additional eight bands in the short-wave infrared (SWIR). Three of the SWIR bands, including bands 9, 12, and 16 (centered at 1210, 1730, and 2330 nm) respectively overlap with diagnostic absorption features of hydrocarbons (HCs) at 1200,1700, and 2300 nm. This paper aims to investigate the capability of this superspectral instrument for direct HC detection. For this purpose, we have conducted several simulation experiments using multiple datasets comprising (i) spectral libraries of different HCs measured in the laboratory, (ii) close-range hyperspectral imagery of a well-known tar-sand sample acquired with a sisuCHEIVIA imaging system, and (iii) far-range ProSpecTIR hyperspectral imagery collected over twelve simulated HC-shows. These datasets were convolved to the spectral resolution of WV-3 and analyzed using a variety of spectral processing techniques. The absorption features of HCs manifest themselves in all cases albeit with varying intensity. The effect of a series of parameters on the detectability of the HCs was also scrutinized; these included background geology, spectral mixing, HC type, endmember set, spatial resolution, noise level, and topography. We demonstrate that the HC absorption feature in WV-3's band 12, accompanied by shoulders sustained at bands 11 and 13 (centered at 1660 and 2165 nm), is resilient enough and persist under various conditions. Potential applications of these finding include hydrocarbon exploration in frontier basins and environmental monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring forest recovery following disturbance is important for both forest management as well as assessing possible climate change impacts on forest dynamics. To do so, an improved understanding of forest recovery processes and their relationship to remotely sensed spectral measures of recovery is required. Our objective in this research is to develop and apply a methodology for using Landsat time series to characterize forest recovery using spectral recovery trajectories. We focus our efforts in the Canadian Boreal Shield ecozone where a known geographic east to west distinction in disturbance regimes remains to be quantified. Results show that forest recovery following a stand replacing disturbance is detectable and quantifiable using a dense Landsat time series of spectral reflectance. All Tasseled Cap indices were found to capture an element of forest recovery following disturbance, with Wetness offering additional information on increasing vegetation structure and complexity. Tasseled Cap component trajectories of recovery show clear differences in both disturbance detection and forest recovery across the east and west Boreal Shield sections. The Cohen's d similarity metric indicated large differences (d>.08) in Wetness and Greenness-based spectral recovery trajectories when comparing the two Boreal Shield sections with the East Boreal Shield having markedly more above average recovery (+2 std. dev. from the mean) than the West. Based on our spectral recovery results, we also observe that forest recovery varies over the entire ecozone and is different between the east and west Boreal Shield forests.

AB Rice is a staple food crop for the majority of the world's population, yet paddy fields are threatened by urban expansion, climate change, and degraded agricultural land. Vietnam, one of the largest exporters of rice globally, grows most of its rice in the Mekong River Delta, but this low-lying and heavily populated area is susceptible to major land cover changes. To properly monitor and manage rice crops in this region, remote sensing with satellite imagery has been particularly useful; however, most efforts to map regional paddy area utilize coarse resolution MODIS or AVHRR data due to their high temporal frequency. Because the average size of a rice paddy field in the region is smaller than a coarse resolution pixel, we map the Mekong study area using finer-scale Landsat data collected across multiple growing seasons. First, we exploit dense landsat time stacks for circa 2000 and circa 2010 to map rice paddy extent using vegetation trajectories, then combine these pixel-based rice maps with image-based segments to generate a polygon-based rice map. The results show that this method can map rice paddies with over 90% overall accuracy (and errors of omission and commission ranging from 6 to 25%) at a finer spatial resolution than previous efforts. Next, we differentiate between single-, double-, and triple-cropped rice paddies in the delta using a supervised classification based on exemplars of these different cropping trends. From circa 2000 to circa 2010, we find that triple-cropped rice fields have nearly doubled in area from one-third to nearly two-thirds of paddy area. Our work also highlights the importance of scenes that capture flooded fields, and the utility of cloud-covered scenes within the dense time stacks of data, to achieve higher classification accuracies. Methods to map rice paddies are vital to understanding the sustainability of these agricultural systems, and the work presented here makes strides toward routine monitoring at a field-level resolution.

AB The launch of European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite has opened up the new opportunities for land data assimilation. In this work, the one-dimensional version of the Ensemble Kalman filter (1D-EnKF) is applied to assimilate SMOS soil moisture retrievals (2010-2013) into a land surface-hydrological model, Modelisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH), over the Great Lakes basin. A priori rescaling on the retrievals is performed by matching their cumulative distribution function (CDF) to the model surface soil moisture's CDF. The SMOS retrievals, the open-loop soil moisture (no assimilation) and the assimilation estimates are validated against point-scale in situ measurements, respectively, in terms of the daily time series correlation coefficient (skill R). The skill for SMOS retrievals typically decreases with increased canopy density. In contrast, the open-loop model typically provides higher soil moisture skill R for forest surfaces than for crop surfaces. The skill improvement Delta RA-M, defined as the skill for the assimilation soil moisture product minus the skill for the open-loop estimates, for both surface and root-zone soil moisture typically increases as the SMOS observation skill and decreases with increased open-loop skill, showing a strong linear relation to Delta RS-M, defined as the SMOS observation skill minus the open-loop surface soil moisture skill. Every time the SMOS skill is greater than or equal to the open-loop surface soil moisture skill, the assimilation is typically able to significantly improve the model soil moisture skill. The crop-dominated grids typically experience the largest Delta RA-M if the assimilated SMOS retrievals also come from crop surfaces (note that a model grid cell and the SMOS node mapped onto the grid are not exactly matched in space), consistent with a high satellite observation skill and a low open-loop skill, while Delta RA-M is usually weak or even negative for the forest-dominated grids when the SMOS retrievals also from forest surfaces are assimilated, due to the presence of a low observation skill and a high open-loop skill. The dependence of Delta RA-S, referred to as the skill for the surface soil moisture assimilation product minus the SMOS observation skill, upon the open-loop skill and the satellite observation skill is opposite to that for Delta RA-M. Overall our R metric of skill and the anomaly R metric as used in previous studies provide a consistent explanation for the vegetation modulation of the assimilation. This work offers further insight into the impact of the open-loop skill and the satellite observation skill on the assimilation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the land surface albedo together with its Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are retrieved for the years 2000 to 2012 from Local Area Coverage (LAC) surface reflectance data gathered by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over Europe. For the retrieval the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/albedo processing scheme is employed. The comparatively high revisit frequency and high variability in angular sampling of the AVHRR sensors operated simultaneously onboard the different National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites contribute substantially to the success and quality of BRDF retrieval. The performance of the BRDF model for AVHRR data is assessed by comparison to MODIS BRDF retrievals, and the AVHRR BRDF reflectance data is validated against BRDF reflectance data from MODIS and in situ data gathered at three field sites in Switzerland. The comparison shows that the AVHRR BRDF retrievals are of high quality across most of Europe. The higher angular sampling of AVHRR allows for more full model retrievals of best quality and generates less fill values compared to MODIS. For most of the years investigated, the absolute accuracy of the AVHRR albedos is found to be within 0.05 throughout the complete seasonal cycle with a minimum bias at the peak of the growing season. However, they systematically underestimate the field-measured albedos, predominantly in winter due to spatial scale mismatch in combination with site heterogeneity and because the expression for the calculation of satellite-based blue-sky albedo does not account for multiple scattering. A slightly increased underestimation also occurs during vegetation senescence, presumably because of the narrow to broadband conversion employing only two bands. Overall, the results confirm the potential of AVHRR to produce multi-decadal data sets of reflectance anisotropy and albedo for use in climate monitoring and modeling studies. This offers a promising and unique opportunity to produce a BRDF/albedo climate data record from AVHRR dating back to 1985. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing provides unique and abundant spectral information for quantification of the land surface shortwave radiation budget, which can be used to calibrate climate models and to estimate surface energy budget for monitoring agriculture and urban environment However, only single broadband or multispectral data have been used in previous studies. In the present study, two methods are proposed to estimate the instantaneous land surface net shortwave radiation (NSR) with high spatial resolutions using hyperspectral remote sensing observations from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Method A calculates the NSR based on separate estimation of downward radiation and surface broadband albedo, which requires ancillary information for aerosol optical depth; and Method B directly estimates the NSR from the observed radiance. Results based on radiative transfer simulations showed that the use of hyperspectral data can significantly improve NSR estimation compared with the multispectral data method. Atmospheric water vapor correction was applied to adjust the surface radiation estimation. Validation of AVIRIS NSR estimates against ground measurements from two flux networks for the period of 2006-2014 showed that the two methods were similar and had consistent accuracy in the all-sky instantaneous NSR estimation with root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of approximately 28-56 W/m(2). The pixel-based water vapor content estimation from AVIRIS data provided slightly different results than those obtained using coarse resolution remote sensing data. A simplified topographic correction algorithm was found to be able to improve the results generated from Method A; however, the degree of improvement provided by Method B was unclear, possibly because of the lack of consideration of horizontal atmospheric scattering effects from adjacent pixels. In general, hyperspectral remote sensing data have been shown to improve the NSR estimation accuracies compared with results obtained in previous studies. Additional efforts are needed to refine the NSR estimation for application to future satellite hyperspectral data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An updated version of the SCOPE model was used here (v1.53) which contains novel leaf physiological modules for determination of the steady state fluorescence yield: a photosynthesis model coupled with (a) submodels having empirically derived relationships, identified as TB12 for unstressed and TB12-D for drought conditions and (b) a mechanistic (MD12) submodel based on theoretical relationships. By inspecting Sobol's total order (main effect and all the interactions) sensitivity index (S-Ti) rankings, the influential and non-influential variables were determined. Two experiments were conducted for the different leaf physiology modules in SCOPE considering (1) only vegetation variables, and (2) all SCOPE variables, i.e., including micrometeorological, aerodynamic and geometry variables.
   Considering TB12-D S-Ti results using only vegetation input variables, the canopy-leaving broadband (641-800 nm) SIF variability was determined mainly by leaf optical properties and canopy structural variables. The most important variables were (with decreasing importance) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf inclination (LIDFa) and leaf area index (LA!). These three variables alone determined 77.9% of the SIF variability. V-cmo, the variable related to photosynthetic capacity, determined 11.4% of overall SIF variability, and its importance declined considerably when moving from the first emission peak (SIFred; with maximal relevance of 17.9% at 676 nm) to the second emission peak (SIFNIR; e.g., 9.6% at 740 nm). Stronger relationships with V-cmo, were obtained when retrieving the full broadband SIF flux and calculating total fluorescence yield (F-yield, determined as the integral of the hemispherical broadband SIF flux divided by the total absorbed PAR), of which 35% of the variability was influenced by V-cmo. Using the TB12 submodel, the major drivers of SIF flux were similar to TB12-D except that V-cmo accounted for very little (<2%) variability. The MD12 submodel identified the components of long-term PSII photoprotection and photodamage as the dominant factors for SIF variability: these two variables alone accounted for 51.4% of the variability of SIF flux and 61% of F-yield, whereas V-cmo explained only 9.7% and 10.9% of variability in SIF flux and F-yield, respectively.
   Analysis of the relative importance of all SCOPE variables revealed that in addition to the key vegetation variables, micrometeorological variables were important in driving SIF variability, especially incoming shortwave radiation (Rin) and to a lesser extent air temperature (Ta), atmospheric vapor pressure (ea) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca). Their impact further reduced the relative importance of V-cmo.
   The GSA experiments led to the following conclusions: (1) explicit knowledge of key variables driving the SIF flux is essential in order to achieve unbiased SIF interpretation related to photosynthetic activity at local and global scales; (2) information related to photosynthetic activity is found more in the first emission peak (SIFred) than in the second peak (SIFNIR), and more in the full broadband SIF emission, which allows calculation of F-yield, than in individual wavebands.

AB Full waveform lidar has a unique capability to characterise vegetation in more detail than any other practical method. The reflectance, calculated from the energy of lidar returns, is a key parameter for a wide range of applications and so it is vital to extract it accurately. Fifteen separate methods have been proposed to extract return energy (the amount of light backscattered from a target), ranging from simple to mathematically complex, but the relative accuracies have not yet been assessed. This paper uses a simulator to compare all methods over a wide range of targets and lidar system parameters. For hard targets the simplest methods (windowed sum, peak and quadratic) gave the most consistent estimates. They did not have high accuracies, but low standard deviations show that they could be calibrated to give accurate energy. This may be why some commercial lidar developers use them, where the primary interest is in surveying solid objects. However, simulations showed that these methods are not appropriate over vegetation. The widely used Gaussian fitting performed well over hard targets (0.24% root mean square error, RMSE), as did the sum and spline methods (0.30% RMSE). Over vegetation, for large footprint (15 m) systems, Gaussian fitting performed the best (12.2% RMSE) followed closely by the sum and spline (both 12.7% RMSE). For smaller footprints (33 cm and 1 cm) over vegetation, the relative accuracies were reversed (0.56% RMSE for the sum and spline and 1.37% for Gaussian fitting). Gaussian fitting required heavy smoothing (convolution with an 8 m Gaussian) whereas none was needed for the sum and spline. These simpler methods were also more robust to noise and far less computationally expensive than Gaussian fitting. Therefore it was concluded that the sum and spline were the most accurate for extracting return energy from waveform lidar over vegetation, except for large footprint (15 m), where Gaussian fitting was slightly more accurate. These results suggest that small footprint (<< 15 m) lidar systems that use Gaussian fitting or proprietary algorithms may report inaccurate energies, and thus reflectances, over vegetation. In addition the effect of system pulse length, sampling interval and noise on accuracy for different targets was assessed, which has implications for sensor design. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) is a methodology that retrieves soil moisture from low frequency dual polarized microwave measurements and has been extensively tested on C-, X- and Ku-band frequencies. Its performance on L-band is tested here by using observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. These observations have potential advantages compared to higher frequencies: a low sensitivity to cloud and vegetation contamination, an increased thermal sampling depth and a greater sensitivity to soil moisture fluctuations. These features make it desirable to add SMOS-derived soil moisture retrievals to the existing European Space Agency (ESA) long-term climatological soil moisture data record, to be harmonized with other passive microwave soil moisture estimates from the LPRM. For multi-channel observations, LPRM infers the effective soil temperature (T-eff) from higher frequency channels. This is not possible for a single channel mission like SMOS and therefore two alternative sources for T-eff were tested: (1) MERRA-Land and (2) ECMWF numerical weather prediction systems, respectively. SMOS measures brightness temperature at a range of incidence angles, different incidence angle bins (45 degrees, 52.5 degrees and 60 degrees) were tested for both ascending and descending swaths. Three LPRM algorithm parameters were optimized to match remotely sensed soil moisture with ground based observations: the single scattering albedo, roughness and polarization mixing factor. The soil moisture retrievals were optimized and evaluated against ground-based data from the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (OzNet) in southeast Australia. The agreement with single-angle SMOS LPRM retrievals was close to the official SMOS L3 product, provided the three parameters were optimized for the OzNet dataset, with linear correlation of 0.70-0.75 (0.75-0.77 for SMOS L3), root-mean-square error of 0.069-0.085 m(3) m(-3) (0.084-0.106 m(3) m(-3) for SMOS 13) and small bias of -0.02-0.01 m(3) m(-3) (0.03-0.06 m(3) m(-3) for SMOS L3). These results suggest that the LPRM can be applied successfully to single-angle SMOS L-band observations, but further testing is required to determine if the same set of parameters can be used in other geographic areas.

TI Selecting algorithms for Earth observation of climate within the
   European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative: Introduction to a
   special issue
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate data record; Earth observation; Algorithm inter-comparison
AB This special issue is focused on the assessment of algorithms for the observation of Earth's climate from environmental satellites. Climate data records derived by remote sensing are increasingly a key source of insight into the workings of and changes in Earth's climate system. Producers of data sets must devote considerable effort and expertise to maximise the true climate signals in their products and minimise effects of data processing choices and changing sensors. A key choice is the selection of algorithm(s) for classification and/or retrieval of the climate variable. Within the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, science teams undertook systematic assessment of algorithms for a range of essential climate variables. The papers in the special issue report some of these exercises (for ocean colour, aerosol, ozone, greenhouse gases, clouds, soil moisture, sea surface temperature and glaciers). The contributions show that assessment exercises must be designed with care, considering issues such as the relative importance of different aspects of data quality (accuracy, precision, stability, sensitivity, coverage, etc.), the availability and degree of independence of validation data and the limitations of validation in characterising some important aspects of data (such as long-term stability or spatial coherence). As well as requiring a significant investment of expertise and effort, systematic comparisons are found to be highly valuable. They reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of different algorithmic approaches under different observational contexts, and help ensure that scientific conclusions drawn from climate data records are not influenced by observational artifacts, but are robust.

AB The European Slope Current (SC) is a major section of the warm poleward flow from the Atlantic to the Arctic, which also moderates the exchange of heat, salt, nutrients and carbon between the deep ocean and the European shelf seas. The mean structure of the geostrophic flow, seasonality, interannual variability and long-term trend of SC are appraised with an unprecedented continuous 20-year satellite altimeter dataset Comparisons with long term in situ data showed a maximum correlation of r(2) = 0.51 between altimeter and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), with similar results for drogued buoy data. Mean geostrophic currents were appraised more comprehensively than previous attempts, and the paths of 4 branches of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and positions of 5 eddies in the region were derived quantitatively. A consistent seasonal cycle in the flow of the SC was found at all 8 sections along the European shelf slope, with maximum poleward flow in the winter and minimum in the summer. The seasonal difference in the altimetry current speed amounted to similar to 8-10 cm s(-1) at the northern sections, but only similar to 5 cm s(-1) on the Bay of Biscay slopes. This extended altimeter dataset indicates significant regional and seasonal variations, and has revealed new insights into the interannual variability of the SC. It is shown that there is a peak poleward flow at most positions along a similar to 2000 km stretch of the continental slope from Portugal to Scotland during 1995-1997, but this did not clearly relate to the extreme negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the winter of 1995-1996. The speed of the SC exhibited a long term decreasing trend of similar to 1% per year. By contrast the NAC showed no significant trend over the 20-year period. Major changes in the NAC occurred three times, and these changes followed decreases in the NAO index. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study analyzes the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation products for assessment of meteorological drought. Two versions of the TMPA research datasets (3B42V6 and 3B42V7) and one real-time dataset (3B42RTV7) are considered. The TMPA datasets are evaluated against a merged precipitation product which is estimated by merging four non-TMPA global satellite-gauge based datasets (non-TMPA merged). Comparisons are made over global land areas between 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N at monthly and 0.25 degrees spatial resolution from 2000 to 2009 (ten years). All the TMPA precipitation datasets show similar spatial patterns; however quantitatively they disagree considerably, especially over tropical regions. 3B42V7 and 3B42RTV7 show the lowest and highest differences with the non-TMPA merged product, respectively. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at various time scales (1 month to 12 months) is calculated for each dataset for detecting drought events, with drought defined as when monthly SPI < - 1.0 and severe drought when monthly SPI < -1.5. The SPI results complement the spatial patterns found in the precipitation statistics. The non-TMPA merged and the 3B42V7 precipitation datasets simultaneously identify months under drought more frequently than any other pair (i.e., non-TMPA merged 3B42V6 and non-TMPA merged 3B42RTV7) of precipitation datasets. We consider four severe drought events: (a) 2007 southeastern US drought, (b) 2003 western European heat wave and drought, (c) 2005 Amazon drought and (d) 2006 Kenyan drought as case studies. All precipitation products are able to identify the drought events in time and space except a few cases. The spatial correlation of drought area is the highest (>0.8) for the 2007 southeastern US drought and the lowest (<0.62) for the 2006 Kenyan drought. For severe drought (SPI < -1.5), all three TMPA products and the non-TMPA merged product show more than 50% area under severe drought for the four drought events with few exceptions.
   Our results show that major differences among datasets are found over many sparse gauge density regions which suggests that the skill of the datasets primarily depends on the differential performance of the respective processing algorithms in different geographic and climatic regions, density of the underlying rain-gauge station networks and the quality of the input data used from non-gauge data sources. Even though the 3B42V7 product performs the best, the 3B42V6 product also performs reasonably well during our study period and domain. The 3B42RTV7 real-time data perform the worst and are not comparable with the two TMPA research products, due to lack of corrections from gauge observations. Therefore, caution should be applied when using this product for real-time monitoring of the drought conditions. Our evaluation of the TMPA research products indicates that they can provide useful information for drought monitoring and as input to hydrological modeling applications for assessment of land surface conditions.

AB Measurements of the Hemispherical Directional Reflectance Factor (HDRF) of snow surfaces were performed at Dome C, Antarctica, during the Australis Summer 2011-2012 to support the inter-comparison and inter-calibration of satellite optical sensors. HDRF data were collected with the Gonio Radiometric Spectrometer System (GRASS) which performs hyper-spectral measurements of radiance from the same target surface with independent collectors at a number of viewing and azimuth angles in the 0-60 degrees and 0-360 degrees angular ranges, respectively. The radiance collectors, installed on a hemispheric frame and connected to a spectrometer through fibre optics, have an 8 degrees full cone of acceptance and a viewing footprint varying from 0.049 m(2) at nadir to 0.142 m(2) at viewing angles of 60 degrees. These relatively small footprints allow for the characterisation of small-scale heterogeneities in the HDRF of observed surfaces. HDRF measurements representative of the Dome C snow surfaces were made at eight different sites along a transect approximately 100 m long. All the sites exhibit similar HDRF distributions with inter-site differences explained by small-scale inhomogeneities of the surface. The measured HDRF display marked forward scattering with anisotropy increasing with wavelength in the 400-1600 nm spectral region. These data complement those from previous measurements performed in the same area with a different technique. Agreement between the two data sets is shown by differences generally lower than 4% between HDRF distributions derived from a previous study and the spatially averaged HDRF from the various sites along a transect presented in this work.

AB Remote sensing based biomass estimation in arid environments is essential for monitoring degradation and carbon dynamics. However, due to the low vegetation cover in these regions, satellite-based research is challenging. Numerous potentially useful remotely-sensed predictor variables have been proposed, and several statistical and machinelearning techniques are available for empirical spatial modeling, but their predictive performance is yet unknown in this context We therefore modeled total biomass in the Eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan, a region with extremely low vegetation cover, with a large set of satellite based predictors derived from two commonly used sensors (Landsat OLL RapidEye), and assessed their utility in this environment using several suitable modeling approaches (stepwise, lasso, partial least squares and ridge regression, random forest). The best performing model (lasso regression) resulted in a RMSE of 992 kg ha(-1) in spatial cross-validation, indicating that biomass quantification in this arid setting is feasible but subject to large uncertainties. Furthermore, pronounced over-fitting in some commonly used models (e.g. stepwise regression, random forest) underlined the importance of adequate variable selection and shrinkage techniques in spatial modeling of high dimensional data. The applied sensors showed very similar performance and a combination of both only slightly improved results of better performing models. A permutation-based assessment of variable importance showed that some of the most frequently used vegetation indices are not suitable for dwarf shrub biomass prediction in this environment We suggest that predictor variables based on several bands accounting for vegetation as well as background information are required in this arid setting.

AB A combination of new measurements and analysis of historical data from several geographic regions was used to address four issues that affect the reliability and interpretation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measured by remote sensing of inland waters. First, high variability of CDOM levels in lakes and rivers was found at seasonal and multi-year time scales and at shorter intervals in some rivers and lakes. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of 30%-50% for absorptivity at 440 nm (a(440)) were common in historical and new data sets we examined. CDOM values used to calibrate imagery thus should be measured close to the image acquisition date, preferably within 1-2 months in lakes and a few days in large rivers, unless it can be shown that CDOM levels are temporally stable over longer (or shorter) time periods in a given aquatic system. Second, spectral slopes (S) for CDOM in the visible range vary little over time (even over multi-year periods) within sites. Substantial variation was found between sites, however, and most spectra showed a change in slope near 460 nm. Values of S400-460 for waters with moderate to high CDOM levels generally were within a narrow range (similar to 0.014-0.018) and similar to reported S values in the near UV. Values of S400-460 for waters with low CDOM generally were smaller and more variable, as were values for S460-650 for all waters. Overall, the variability of spectral slopes in the visible range should not have a large effect on the reliability of a(440) estimates made from remote sensing, which in many models involve reflectance measurements at wavelengths > 500 nm. Third, although a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.925) was found between CDOM levels and DOC concentrations in 34 surface waters sampled in 2013, the standard error of estimate suggests an uncertainty of similar to +/- 20% in predicting DOC at a(440) = 5 m(-1) (a moderate CDOM level). Moreover, CDOM-DOC relationships for unpublished data sets we analyzed and those reported in the literature indicate that both the fraction of DOC that is colored and slopes of regressions between CDOM and DOC are highly variable in space and time. Prediction of DOC concentrations in water bodies from CDOM levels (whether measured in the laboratory or by remote sensing) thus is associated with considerable uncertainty. For the present, this implies that field sampling is required to verify DOC concentrations predicted from remotely sensed CDOM measurements until we have a better understanding of variations in DOC-CDOM relationships. Fourth, shapes of reflectance spectra for CDOM-rich waters varied greatly depending on the concentrations of other constituents (suspended solids and chlorophyll) that affect the optical properties of water. Nonetheless, it is not obvious from our results for several predictive models that different remote sensing algorithms are needed to calculate CDOM levels accurately for waters where CDOM is the only variable affecting reflectance versus waters where other constituents also affect the spectra. The best band or band ratio models for simulated Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 bands from field measured reflectance spectra yielded high r(2) values (0.84-0.86) for a(440).
   The broader Landsat 8 bands worked nearly as well for a(440) as the narrower Sentinel band sets and hyperspectral bands, probably because CDOM is characterized by a broad exponential increase in absorbance with decreasing wavelength rather than specific peaks or troughs in absorbance or reflectance.

AB Evaporation is an important component of the water and energy balance of lakes and reservoirs. The energy balance combination method for estimating evaporation requires the heat storage changes (Q(t)) to be known. The lack of data on water temperature profiles and water depth fluctuations hinders routine computations of Q. Following successful estimation of the soil heat flux density of land surfaces (G) and heat storage change of urban areas and wetlands from net all wave radiation (Rn), we investigated in this paper whether a similar generic Q(t)(Rn) empirical relationship can be developed for lakes and reservoirs. A comprehensive literature survey was conducted and experimental datasets for 22 lakes with different characteristics were collected. A linear Q(t)(Rn) model with a hysteresis function to describe seasonal warming and cooling effects was developed (Q(t) = a * Rn + b + c * dRn/dt) that fits the 22 independently gathered datasets satisfactory (R-2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 22 W m(-2)) for bi-weekly and monthly time scales. Predictive models for the coefficients a, b and c were also developed, using Rn and water surface temperature measurements that can be retrieved from routine earth observation measurements. The average R2 between measured and modeled Q(t) was 0.84 and the RMSE was 37 W m(-2) if predictive models were used for the assessment of lake specific Q(t)(Rn) functions. Two independent satellite-derived products were explored: the ARC-Lake (ATSR Reprocessing for Climate) product for water surface temperature using the ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) series data, and the CM SAP (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) product for solar radiation Rs based on the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. The proposed procedure using purely satellite-derived data as inputs resulted in comparably good Q(t) estimates as those using in-situ measurements. The new Q(t) hysteresis model can thus be applied together with satellite measurements for supporting the computation of evaporation from open water bodies based on energy balance equations.

AB Despite the threats faced by seabirds in both terrestrial and marine habitats, even basic knowledge of the locations of colonies, population sizes and trends is lacking for many remote areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that the guano of Adelie penguins can be identified from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery and used to map colonies on coasts around continental Antarctica. Our study highlights a new technique based on the unique spectral signature of guano that can be used to discriminate seabird colonies from background geology and vegetation in a wider range of natural environments, including the vegetated and zoologically-diverse region of the Antarctic Peninsula; moreover, the method was effective for all densely colonial, surface-nesting seabirds. Using Landsat ETM imagery, we correctly identified all known seabird colonies of over 50 pairs in the area of Marguerite Bay. Almost all other areas with a similar spectral signature that were outside known breeding areas were single pixels that were readily distinguishable from genuine colonies. If these were excluded, only 4.1% of pixels appeared to represent unknown breeding or roosting sites, and warrant further investigation. The spatial extent of the guano provided a general guide to the number of individuals present, but further work would be required to determine the accuracy of this method for estimating population size. Spectral profiles of guano collected by satellite and hand-held spectrometers were compared with available data in spectral libraries and did not match with any known geological profile. There may also be potential for discriminating colonies of different species that differ in phenology and show seasonal changes in diet by the carefully-timed acquisition of suitable satellite imagery. We conclude that the remotely-sensed guano signature is a good indicator of the location of seabird breeding or roosting sites, with potentially wide application to other areas of the world.

AB The Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model forms the basis of the European Space Agency's GlobSnow snow water equivalent (SWE) product (Takala et al., 2011). The model applies a semi-empirical radiative transfer calculation to account for the interaction of the snow medium with microwaves; separate components are applied to account for vegetation, the atmosphere, and emission from the ground surface. For the retrieval of SWE, an innovative method is used to account for spatial and temporal variability in snow conditions by retrieving an effective parameter describing the scattering behavior of microwaves in the snow (a proxy indicator of the microwave effective snow grain size). In this study, the influence of differing snow conditions, as well as varying land cover, on the retrieved microwave effective snow grain size was analyzed. Passive microwave measurements were acquired using tower-based, mobile sled-based and airborne radiometers in a mixed forest environment near Sodankyla, Finland. Forward simulations at the tower site over an entire winter period showed that the use of an empirical relation to modify the classical in situ measured grain size produced HUT model bias errors less than 6 K on average at 19 and 37 GHz from a similar to 20-80 cm deep boreal snowpack. Model simulations for airborne and sled-based observations showed that using a simplified 2-layer representation of the snowpack improves simulation biases and RMSE, although modification of the measured grain size was again necessary to achieve these results, regardless of the layering configuration. The microwave effective grain size retrieved from HUT predictions was closely related to a simple average grain size measured in situ, both in terms of magnitude and temporal trend. This is an important finding as the retrieval scheme of Takala et al. (2011) relies on the microwave effective grain size to retain a degree of physical basis for values to be generally applicable over larger areas, which is challenging because this free parameter also accounts for errors unrelated to the effective snow grain size (i.e. vegetation, soil conditions, scene heterogeneity, etc.).

AB This paper assessed the SMOS soil moisture values from Level 3 (SMOS L3SM) product provided by the French CNES-CATDS. The evaluation was conducted at the local scale through comparison with ground-based soil moisture measurements acquired in Mali, Niger and Benin from 2010 to 2012. The SMOS L3SM product was compared to three other satellite-based soil moisture products. It was found that, in average over the three sites, the SMOS L3SM product provided the best coefficients of correlation and the lowest root mean square errors (RMSE). The second part of the paper is devoted to retrieve soil moisture estimates between successive SMOS soil moisture measurements in order to increase the temporal resolution. The result of the methodology allows obtaining 3-hour soil moisture mapping over West Africa with a coefficient of correlation greater than 0.82, and an RMSE lower than 0.030 m(3) m(-3) in Niger and Mali and lower than 0.044 m(3) m(-3) in Benin.

AB Forest cover maps were produced for the Gabonese Agency for Space Studies and Observations (AGEOS) for 1990, 2000 and 2010 for an area of approximately 102,000 km(2) corresponding to 38% of the total area of Gabon and representative of the range of human pressure on forest resources. The maps were constructed using a combination of a semi-automated classification procedure and manual enhancements to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. A two-stage area frame sampling approach was adopted to collect reference data for assessing the accuracy of the forest cover maps and to estimate proportion forest cover and net proportion deforestation. A total of 251 2 x 2 km segments or primary sample units (PSUs) were visually interpreted by a team of photo-interpreters independently from the map production team to produce a reference dataset representing about 1% of the study area. Paired observations were extracted from the forest cover map and the reference data for a random selection of 50 secondary sample units (SSUs) in the form of pixels within each PSU. Overall map accuracies were greater than 95%. PSU and SSU outputs were used to estimate proportion forest cover and net proportion deforestation using both direct expansion and model-assisted regression (MAR) estimators. All proportion forest cover estimates were similar, but the variances of the MAR estimates were smaller than variances for the direct expansion estimates by factors as great as 50. In addition, SSU-level estimates had standard errors slightly greater than those of PSU-level estimates, but the differences were small, particularly when auxiliary variables were obtained from forest cover maps. Therefore, a two-stage sampling approach was justified for collecting a reliable forest cover reference dataset for estimating proportion forest cover area and net proportion deforestation. Finally, despite large overall map accuracies, net proportion deforestation estimates obtained from the maps alone can be misleading as indicated by the finding that the MAR estimates, which included adjustment for bias estimates, were twice the non-adjusted map estimates for the periods 1990-2000 and 1990-2010. The results confirmed the expected generally small level of net deforestation for Gabon. However, loss of forest cover appears to have almost stopped in the last 10 years. One explanation could be the creation of national parks and the implementation of forest concession management plans from 2000 onward, but this should be further explored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB City lights present one of humankind's most unique footprints on Earth as seen from space. Resulting light pollution from artificial lights obscures the night sky for astronomy and has negative impacts on biodiversity as well as on human health. However, remote sensing studies of night lights to date have been mostly limited to coarse spatial resolution sensors such as the DMSP-OLS. Here we present a new source for high spatial resolution mapping of night lights from space, derived from a commercial satellite. We tasked the Israeli EROS-B satellite to acquire two night-time light images (at a spatial resolution of 1 m) of Brisbane, Australia, and analyzed their radiometric quality and content with r8pect to land cover and land use. The spatial distribution of night lights as imaged by EROS-B corresponded with night-time images acquired by an airborne camera, although EROS-B was not as sensitive to low light levels. Using land cover and land use data at the statistical local area level, we could statistically explain 89% of the variability in night-time lights. Arterial roads and commercial and service areas were found to be some of the brightest land use types. Overall, we found that EROS-B imagery provides fine spatial resolution images of night lights, opening new avenues for studying light pollution in cities worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The objectives of this study are to: (i) compare the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS), the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) in retrieving the particulate backscattering coefficient, robust proxy of the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM), in the turbid waters of the East China Sea, then (ii) combine ocean color satellite data to field data recorded by an autonomous bio-optical profiling float to reconstitute and explain the dynamics of SPM within the whole water column in the middle of the East China Sea. MODIS, MERIS and GOCI seawater reflectance products at green, red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are generated using atmospheric correction algorithms designed for turbid coastal waters then compared. Good agreement is obtained in the green and red while significant differences are observed in the NIR. The standard GOCI algorithm and a new one based on a regional empirical relationship established using MODIS satellite data are both proved to perform well over the whole range of water turbidity. Finally the dynamics of SPM is reconstituted along a three-month period to highlight a steady-state and stratified situation before the overpass of a large typhoon which mixed the water column, destroyed the deep-chlorophyll maximum and enhanced resuspension of bottom sediments varying according to tidal cycles.

AB Maps based on classified Earth observation (EO) imagery have been used to model biodiversity, but errors associated with the classification process itself and the resulting discretization of land cover may ultimately limit such efforts. Among other issues, discrete land cover maps can often be costly to produce and validate. Alternatively, the original continuous spectral information in EO imagery can be used. The primary objective of this study was to compare predictors based on continuous and discrete information derived from Landsat TM imagery for modeling biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In 46 landscapes throughout Eastern Ontario, Canada, landscape metrics (mean field size, the percentage of landscape in agriculture, and crop diversity) derived from a discrete image classification, along with several measures of crop productivity based on the continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used as predictors of field-based measures of species diversity for birds, butterflies, and plants. Using an Information-Theoretic approach for model-averaging and inference, we compared and interpreted the magnitude and direction of model-averaged coefficients, model evidence ratios, and overall fit of model-averaged predictions. Our findings indicate that when using Landsat TM imagery in agricultural environments, models using predictors derived from continuous information consistently outranked models based on discrete information derived from classified imagery.

AB Atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color imagery in sediment-laden and algal bloom waters remains to be a challenging task because of the inefficiency of present methods to accurately assess aerosol radiances in the near-infrared (NIR) bands and extrapolate these into the visible spectrum. This study presents a novel method for estimation and extrapolation of aerosol radiances in MODIS-Aqua bands over optically complex oceanic waters dominated by suspended sediments and algal blooms. The Rayleigh-corrected radiance at 748 nm, after correcting the influence of the elevated radiance contributed by suspended sediments and algal blooms, is employed in the present method to estimate aerosol radiance in a MODIS-Aqua band centered at 531 nm. Then, the normalized Gaussian distribution function is used to extrapolate aerosol radiance over the entire wavebands (from 412 to 748 nm). This method retrieves water-leaving radiances L-w(lambda) nearly comparable to those of the NIR scheme for extremely clear waters (chlorophyll <0.15 mg m(-3)) with an error of <5% which is an acceptable limit for such waters. Evaluation of the performance of the new method with NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes using in-situ L-w(lambda) measurements from highly turbid waters off Point Calimere (on the southeast coast of India) and other regional waters (NOMAD in-situ L-w(lambda) data) shows an apparent improvement in L-w(lambda) retrievals with the new method over NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes (i.e., with a decrease in mean relative error by 22.59% and 23.06% respectively). The performance of the new method is demonstrated for several MODIS-Aqua imageries of optically contrasted and complex waters (containing different in-water and floating algal blooms), and yields physically realistic water-leaving (or surface-leaving) radiances in all visible bands. By contrast, the NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes show large distortions in L-w(lambda) structures with large negative values across the visible bands. These results suggest that the new method will have important implications for satellite remote sensing of optically complex waters, since the accuracy of bio-geophysical products derived from such data mainly depends on the water-leaving radiance products delivered by the atmospheric correction algorithm.

AB The seasonal melt-freeze transitions are important to continuously monitor over Arctic sea ice in order to better understand Arctic climate variability. The K-u-band scatterometer QuikSCAT (13.4 GHz), widely used to retrieve pan-Arctic seasonal transitions, discontinued its decadal long record in 2009. In this study, we show that the C-band scatterometer ASCAT (5.3 GHz), in orbit since 2006 and with an anticipated lifetime through 2021, can be used to extend the QuikSCAT record of seasonal melt-freeze transitions. This is done by (1) comparing backscatter measurements over multiyear and first-year ice, and by (2) retrieving seasonal transitions from resolution-enhanced ASCAT and QuikSCAT measurements and comparing the results with independent datasets. Despite operating in different frequencies, ASCAT and QuikSCAT respond similarly to surface transitions. However, QuikSCAT measurements respond slightly stronger to the early melt of first-year ice, making it less sensitive to sea-ice dynamics. To retrieve the transitions, we employed an improved edge-detector algorithm, which was iterated and constrained using sea-ice concentration data, efficiently alleviating unreasonable outliers. This gives melt-freeze transitions over all Arctic sea ice north of 60 degrees N at a 4.45 km resolution during 1999-2009 and 2009-2012 for QuikSCAT and ASCAT, respectively. Using the sensor overlap period, we show that the retrieved transitions retrieved from the different instruments are largely consistent across all regions in the Arctic sea-ice domain, indicating a robust consistency.

AB Satellite remote sensing has shown the advantage of water quality assessment at synoptic scales in coastal regions, yet modern sensors such as SeaWiFS or MODIS did not start until the late 1990s. For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High-resolution (ca. 1 m) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have great potential for all-weather monitoring of crop biophysical variables in small and mosaic crop fields in Asia. Rice is the most important staple crop in monsoon Asia, and the timely monitoring of rice growth is critical for precision farming and the assessment of productivity. The objective of this study was to determine the potential capability of backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) from satellite C-band SAR sensors for the assessment of biophysical variables in rice. SAR images were acquired by a Radarsat-2 sensor in spotlight mode during the critical growth stages over 4 years in one of the major rice-producing areas of japan. Detailed plant biophysical measurements were made concurrently with the SAR observations. The seasonal consistency of C-band sigma(0) was clearly demonstrated. The baseline sigma(0) values (minimum sigma(0) for zero-biomass paddy fields) were determined to be -28.5 dB in VH and -21.1 dB in HH and VV, respectively. The dynamic change in sigma(0) during the full range of rice growth was similar (ca. 12 dB) in all polarizations. A comprehensive analysis revealed the response of C-band sigma(0) to biophysical canopy variables. High or moderate sensitivity of sigma(0) to canopy height, water content, or chlorophyll content was superficial and was attributable to the change in leaf biomass and structure. Both the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf biomass were significantly and consistently correlated with sigma(0) throughout all growth stages. These relationships were expressed by exponential curves with high coefficients of determination, although sigma(0) saturates at around a LAI of 3 and a leaf biomass of 180 gDW m(-2). The response of sigma(0) to total biomass was expressed by an exponential function with a high coefficient of determination, but the sensitivity was clear only within the lower 20% range of the seasonal maximum biomass. The C-band sigma(0) had the highest correlation with fAPAR, and the sigma(0)-fAPAR relationship was linear throughout the growth stages. The results suggest the suitability of C-band sigma(0) for the assessment of LAI or fAPAR and show promise for the timely monitoring of rice growth by C-band SAR and/or through its constellation with optical sensors.

AB Microphytobenthic (MPB) biofilms are taxonomically mixed microbial assemblages (e.g. cyanobacteria, chlorophyta and diatoms) responsible for important estuarine ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient fluxes, sediment cohesion, and primary productivity). MPB biofilms exhibit high spatial-temporal variation leading to high variability in collected data and requiring high sampling replication. Thus there is an increasing interest in developing remote sensing tools to quantify and describe MPB biofilms. The objectives of the current work were to investigate the effect of MPB taxonomic diversity on biofilm spectral reflectance signatures and to investigate the possibility of using second derivative analysis to estimate MPB chlorophyll a (as a proxy for biomass) and pigment composition in monospecific and mixed species biofilms. Two diatoms, Amphora coffeaeformis (Agardh) Kutzing and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) W. Smith; one green algae, Dunaliella tertiolecta and one cyanobacteria, Spirulina platensis (Gomont) Geitler were used to construct artificial MPB biofilms on glass fiber filters. Biofilms with a range of different MPB concentrations and different taxonomic groups were constructed, their spectral reflectances were measured with a ASD FieldSpec 3FR spectroradiometer and pigments were extracted and measured by HPLC The best relationships between pigment concentration and second derivative spectra (delta delta) obtained with monospecific biofilms were: delta delta(548) for fucoxanthin, delta delta(590) for zeaxanthin, delta delta(650) for chlorophyll b and delta delta(675) for chlorophyll a. The relationship between delta delta(590) and zeaxanthin was probably the result of covariation with phycocyanin or phycoeritrin. delta delta(590) and delta delta(650) were strongly affected by the presence of other taxonomic groups in the mixed species biofilms and underestimated the respective pigments, while delta delta(548) and delta delta(675) could be used to estimate directly fucoxanthin and chlorophyll a in taxonomically mixed biofilms. The relationship between delta delta(675) and chlorophyll a was strongly affected by the presence of a second derivative double peak caused by chlorophyll fluorescence in the red region and was highly dependent on the smoothing amount applied to the original reflectance spectra. An alternative was proposed using the area of the second derivative peaks between 660 and 690 nm (A[delta delta(RED)]). This index showed very good relationships with MPB chlorophyll a concentration and was almost insensitive to the amount of smoothing applied to the original spectra. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The potential of Landsat data processing to provide continental scale 30 m products has been demonstrated by the NASA Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The integration of a recent MODIS based Landsat atmospheric correction algorithm into the WELD processing is described and demonstrated by application to 12 months of conterminous United States (CONUS) Landsat 7 ETM + data. A large volume assessment of the atmospheric correction is presented considering approximately 53 million 30 m pixel locations sampled systematically across the CONUS for December 2009 to November 2010. Monthly 30 m reflectance and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are assessed comparing the top of atmosphere (TOA) and the MODIS-based atmospherically corrected surface reflectance values with respect to spectral, temporal, land cover, and a per-pixel atmospheric correction quality storage scheme. The mean CONUS absolute difference between surface and TOA NDVI expressed as a percentage of the surface NDVI was 28% and the surface NDVI was on average 0.1 greater than the TOA NDVI for "vegetated" surfaces. The mean difference between surface and TOA reflectance (surface minus TOA) increased monotonically with increasing surface reflectance. On average the change from a negative to a positive mean difference occurred when the surface reflectance was 036, 0.22, 0.17, 0.14, 0.07, and 0.02 for Landsat ETM + reflective bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 respectively. These values are of interest as they depict the average CONUS Landsat ETM + surface reflectance values where the atmosphere has on average no impact and provide the average boundary values for positive and negative atmospheric contributions to ETM + TOA reflectance. The CONUS mean absolute differences between surface and TOA reflectance expressed as percentages of the surface reflectance were 45%, 22%, 12%, 6%, 5%, and 13% for Landsat ETM + bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 respectively.

AB There is a need for monitoring methods for forest volume, biomass and carbon based on satellite remote sensing. In the present study we tested interferometric X-band SAR (InSAR) from the Tandem-X mission. The aim of the study was to describe how accurate volume and biomass could be estimated from InSAR height and test whether the relationships were curvilinear or not. The study area was a spruce dominated forest in southeast Norway. We selected 28 stands in which we established 192 circular sample plots of 250 m(2), accurately positioned by a Differential Global Positioning System (dGPS). Plot level data on stem volume and aboveground biomass were derived from field inventory. Stem volume ranged from zero to 596 m(3)/ha, and aboveground biomass up to 338 t/ha. We generated 2 Digital Surface Models (DSMs) from InSAR processing of two co-registered, HH-polarized TanDEM-X image pairs - one ascending and one descending pair. We used a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) as a reference and derived a 10 m x 10 m Canopy Height Model (CHM), or InSAR height model. We assigned each plot to the nearest 10 m x 10 m InSAR height pixel. We applied a nonlinear, mixed model for the volume and biomass modeling, and from a full model we removed effects with a backward stepwise approach. InSAR height was proportional to volume and aboveground biomass, where a 1 m increase in InSAR height corresponded to a volume increase of 23 m(3)/ha and a biomass increase of 14 t/ha. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were 43-44% at the plot level and 19-20% at the stand level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The estimates of above-ground forest biomass (AGB) in Northern Eurasia are highly uncertain, despite the global importance of AGE for ecosystem services and its role as carbon stores. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of ALOS/PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), for the estimation of AGB in the range of 10-190 tons (dry matter)/ha in mixed and deciduous forests at the southern edge of the boreal region in Western Siberia. Various regression models were tested to determine the relationship between forest biomass derived from field measurements and radar backscatter. The best results were obtained using HV-polarized backscatter with the Water Cloud model, giving estimation errors in terms of root mean square errors (RMSE) between 25% and 32% of the mean biomass, and coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.35 and 0.49 for the whole range of SAR backscatter used in the analysis. The method displayed a higher prediction accuracy with RMSE of 15%, and the R-2 between 0.55 and 0.72 when restricted to SAR backscatter (sigma(0)) < - 12.6 dB where the model was clearly defined. The SAR-based estimates offer a potential of rapid, high resolution and low cost mapping of the lower biomass woody vegetation (sparse or young forests on shallow peat) in Siberia, the area where more accurate national or large scale forest inventories hardly exist.

AB West Nile (WNV) is now established in the continental United States with new human cases occurring annually in most states. Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are the primary vectors and exploit urban stagnant water and swimming pools as larval habitats. Public health surveys to monitor unmaintained pools typically rely on visual inspections of aerial imagery. This work demonstrates automated analysis of airborne imaging spectroscopy to assist Culex monitoring campaigns. We analyze an overflight of Fresno County, CA by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer instrument (AVIRIS), and compare the spectral information with a concurrent ground survey of swimming pools. Matched filter detection strategies reliably detect pools against a cluttered urban background. We also evaluate remotely sensed spectral markers of ecosystem characteristics related to larval colonization. We find that commonly used chlorophyll signatures accurately predict the probability of pool colonization by Culex larvae. These results suggest that AVIRIS spectral data provide sufficient information to remotely identify pools at risk for Culex colonization. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A multitemporal method to map snow cover in mountainous terrain is proposed to guide Landsat climate data record (CDR) development. The Landsat image archive including MSS, TM, and ETM + imagery was used to construct a prototype Landsat snow cover CDR for the interior northwestern United States. Landsat snow cover CDRs are designed to capture snow-covered area (SCA) variability at discrete bi-monthly intervals that correspond to ground-based snow telemetry (SNOTEL) snow-water-equivalent (SWE) measurements. The June 1 bi-monthly interval was selected for initial CDR development, and was based on peak snowmelt timing for this mountainous region. Fifty-four Landsat images from 1975 to 2011 were preprocessed that included image registration, top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance conversion, cloud and shadow masking, and topographic normalization. Snow covered pixels were retrieved using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and unsupervised classification, and pixels having greater (less) than 50% snow cover were classified presence (absence). A normalized SCA equation was derived to independently estimate SCA given missing image coverage and cloud-shadow contamination. Relative frequency maps of missing pixels were assembled to assess whether systematic biases were embedded within this Landsat CDR. Our results suggest that it is possible to confidently estimate historical bi-monthly SCA from partially cloudy Landsat images. This multitemporal method is intended to guide Landsat CDR development for freshwater-scarce regions of the western US to monitor climate-driven changes in mountain snowpack extent.

AB Wotje Atoll is located at 9 degrees 25'N and 170 degrees 04'E within the Republic of the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. As on other atolls, the islands perched along the rim of Wotje are low-lying and considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. A widely anticipated impact of continued sea level rise is the chronic erosion of island shorelines. Using a combination of aerial photographs and satellite imagery shoreline changes are assessed over a 67-year period characterized by rising sea level. Results indicate that between 1945 and 2010 shoreline accretion is more prevalent than erosion, with an average Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) of + 1.74 m, indicating accretion. Shorelines were accretionary along the lagoon, ocean and channel facing shorelines, as well as on elongate spits and small islands. A high-frequency assessment of shoreline change on a subset of islands in the east of Wotje reveals that islands were stable, with a balance between shoreline accretion and erosion. Shorelines interpreted from high resolution satellite imagery captured between 2004 and 2012 indicate that shorelines within this sample of islands are largely in an erosive state. The post-2004 shift toward erosion may be sea level rise induced, or part of an unresolved shoreline oscillation. This study demonstrates the critical need for improved shoreline change monitoring within atoll settings in order to assess sea level rise impacts along island shorelines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of satellite-based soil moisture retrievals for hydrologic, meteorological and climatological applications is advancing significantly due to increasing capability and temporal coverage of current and future missions. Characterisation of the relative skill of soil moisture products from different satellite sensors on a common spatial grid is crucial to achieve synergetic applications. This paper therefore evaluates three soil moisture products from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System), ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) in absolute soil moisture units and on a common grid, against in-situ observations from southeast Australia. Before renormalisation, the three products yield correlations of 0.63-0.71 and a similar root-mean-square difference (RMSD) in the order of 0.1 m(3) m(-3), although showing different levels of error contributions from bias, variance and correlations. The results are compared with land and precipitation data to investigate the sensitivity of their errors to land surface features. Three renormalisation strategies - minimum-maximum matching, mean/standard-deviation (mu-sigma) matching and cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching - are considered for correcting systematic differences between ground and satellite data. The renormalised satellite data is found to retain RMSDs of 0.04-0.06 m(3) m(-3) on average. The CDF method produces only marginal further improvements to correlations (0.67-0.75) and RMSDs compared to the mu-sigma approach. The renormalisations by mu-sigma and CDF methods also bring three products into better agreements with each other, but lead to strong correlations between RMSD and the dynamic range of in-situ soil moisture.

AB Bark beetles cause significant tree mortality in coniferous forests across North America. Mapping beetle-caused tree mortality is therefore important for gauging impacts to forest ecosystems and assessing trends. Remote sensing offers the potential for accurate, repeatable estimates of tree mortality in outbreak areas. With the advancement of multi-temporal disturbance detection methods using Landsat data, the capability exists for improvement in mapping methods, yet more information is needed to determine the accuracy of these methods for mapping forest disturbances and to quantify differences between these methods and single-date image classification methods. We compared single-date (using maximum likelihood classification) to multi-date (using time series of spectral indices) classification methods of Landsat imagery and investigated how detection accuracy changed with varying levels of mortality severity. For each method, we evaluated several bands and/or spectral vegetation indices and identified the one that resulted in the highest accuracy. A fine-resolution classified aerial image within the Landsat scene was used as reference data for evaluation and comparison between methods. For the single-date image classification, we achieved a 91.0% (kappa = 0.88) overall accuracy with 11.7% omission and 23% commission errors for the red stage (tree mortality) class using the tasseled cap transformation indices of brightness, greenness, and wetness. For the multi-date analysis, the Band5/Band4 anomaly produced the highest accuracy among spectral indices and resulted in a 89.6% (kappa = 0.86) classification accuracy with 12.6% omission and 7.1% commission errors for the red stage class. We compared accuracies between the best single- and multi-date methods across a range of tree mortality within a pixel. The multi-date method was more accurate at intermediate levels of tree mortality, whereas the single-date method was more accurate at high mortality levels. Our results indicate that Landsat-based mapping of forest disturbances that use either single-date or multi-date methods can result in high classification accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing data from MODIS, ASTER and LANDSAT 7 sensors were used to assess land cover-temperature interactions in the Abu Dhabi metropolitan area over a 10-year period between 2000 and 2010 with a multi-sensor approach. Low resolution data from MODIS sensor with high revisiting time have been used to analyze the daily variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST), the derived Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Medium resolution data from ASTER and LANDSAT 7 sensors have been used for spot assessment of the above mentioned parameters at district level. With medium resolution satellites, LST and NDVI have been analyzed in correspondence of different level of Impervious Surface Areas (ISAs) over the study period.
   With both datasets, the obtained results showed an inversion of the standard SUHI phenomenon during daytime, where the downtown areas appear colder compared to the suburbs. Throughout the study period, the trend has been replicated and seasonality is also observed, where the inversion of SUHI is accentuated mainly in the summer months with a daily difference of 5-6 K compared to 2-3 K during the winter season, while the standard SUHI can be observed during the night with values of downtown 2-3 K higher than the suburbs. Spot analysis of single images confirmed this trend, adding the contribution of ISA to an average increment of 1 K during winter and 2 K during the summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The science and policy communities increasingly require information about inter-urban variability in form, infrastructure, and energy use for cities globally and in a timely manner. Nighttime light (Nil) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) are able to provide information on nighttime luminosity, a correlate of the built environment and energy consumption. Although NTL data are used to map aggregate measures of urban areas such as total area extent, their ability to characterize inter-urban variation is limited due to saturation of the data values, especially in urban cores. Here we propose a new spectral index, the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), which combines MODIS NDVI with Nil, to achieve three key goals. First, the index reduces the effects of NTL saturation. Second, the index increases variation of the NTL signal, especially within urban areas. Third, the index corresponds to biophysical and urban characteristics. Additionally, the index is intuitive, simple to implement, and enables rapid characterization of inter-urban variability in nighttime luminosity. Assessments of VANUI show that it significantly reduces NTL saturation and increases variation of data values in core urban areas. As such, VANUI can be useful for studies of urban structure, energy use, and carbon emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High temporal resolution observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), on the Meteosat Second Generation satellites, can offer new insights into the processes governing the behaviour of dust sources. Here we evaluate a multi-year, high time-resolution record of dust flagging and dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) derived from SEVIRI to identify diurnal patterns of dust loading, and diagnose issues with the dust retrievals over North Africa and Arabia. The original dust detection scheme falsely flags dust in regions of high 8.7 mu m emissivity. The implementation of an updated scheme mitigates this by making use of the mean 10.8-8.7 mu m brightness temperature difference in order to isolate airborne dust from rocky surfaces. Comparing the DAODs (at 550 nm) retrieved using the different schemes with co-located AERONET observations, the impact is relatively small (RMS<0.02); however, these sites tend to be situated away from the regions where false detections are prevalent. For these regions, the application of the new scheme tends to provide a more consistent DAOD baseline for when the dust flag is triggered, important for the creation of a consistent data record. Turning to the DAODs themselves, RMS differences with the AERONET sites range from 0.19 to 0.46, but show a clear seasonal variation in the level of agreement, with higher biases in the boreal winter.

AB We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series analysis of ALOS L-band SAR data to resolve land subsidence in western Indonesia with high spatial and temporal resolution. The data reveal significant subsidence in nine areas, including six major cities, at rates up to 22 cm/year. Land subsidence is detected near Lhokseumawe, in Medan, Jakarta, Bandung, Blanakan, Pekalongan, Bungbulang, Semarang, and in the Sidoarjo regency. The fastest subsidence occurs in highly populated coastal areas particularly vulnerable to flooding.
   We correlate the observed subsidence with surface geology and land use. Despite the fact that subsidence is taking place in compressible deposits there is no clear correlation between subsidence and surface geology. In urban areas we find a correlation between rapid, patchy subsidence and industrial land use and elsewhere with agricultural land use. This suggests that the subsidence is primarily caused by ground water extraction for industrial and agricultural use, respectively. We also observe subsidence associated with exploitation of gas fields near Lhokseumawe and in the Sidoarjo regency. A continuation of these high rates of subsidence is likely to put much of the densely populated coastal areas below relative sea level within a few decades. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Microwave brightness temperatures (Tbs) contain information about snow properties, including the thickness, density, grain size, and temperature of stratigraphic layers; each of these properties generally varies vertically in the snowpack. Inverse solutions to characterize Snow via Tbs have met with only limited success, not least because multiple sets of snow properties can lead to the same Tbs; the problem becomes more complex with increasing number of layers. Our objective is to address the question: Can an inverse solution be obtained with only very minimal prior information on snow properties under ideal conditions? We developed a new inverse algorithm: a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme solved using the Metropolis algorithm. We allowed the number of snowpack layers itself to be unknown by generating different chains for each possible number of layers (up to a maximum of four), then selecting the optimal chain using a model selection criterion. We generated synthetic Tb observations using the microwave emission model for layered snow (MEMLS), and then used the Metropolis algorithm, MEMLS, and the synthetic observations to estimate the snow properties for 150 snowpits measurements made during the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) field campaign. We evaluated algorithm results using the accuracy criteria on snow water equivalent (SWE) imposed for the planned CoreH2O satellite mission. We obtained an accurate solution to number of layers, layer thickness, density, grain size, snow temperature and ground temperature from microwave measurements for shallow snow (less than 300 mm), with an RMSE of 18.2 mm. We examined the sensitivity of these results to error in MEMLS, and found that for model error less than 8 K standard deviation, the SWE RMSE is uniformly less than 30 mm. For deep snow, however, the problem appears to be intractable, with RMS errors greater than 20% even for an assumption of zero model error. We conclude that for deep snow, additional prior information is required for accurate SWE estimation from microwave Tbs. We suggest that such prior information could come from physical snowpack models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the dynamics of leaf area index (LA!) at ecosystem scale is critical for evaluating and modeling the response of vegetation to environmental variability and change. We present an approach for quantifying daily ecosystem Lid that integrates automatic acquisition of a small number of reference photos, viewed towards the zenith, and a larger number of photos covering a spatially extensive area that were manually acquired during periodic field trips. We present an image archive spanning three years for an oak-savanna ecosystem in California to identify the timing of phenological and disturbance events, and to quantify the seasonal to interannual variability of tree LAI at ecosystem scale. The digital camera-derived LAI, corrected for clumping effects, agreed well (r(2)=0.94, root mean square error=0.05) with independent estimates of LAI from litterfall traps and the LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product, which combined grass and tree LAI, we obtained realistic seasonal patterns of ecosystem LAI that corresponded with tree LAI from the digital cameras for the period when grass was dead. The digital camera method is an easy and inexpensive way to monitor LAI at ecosystem scale. This method can be used for testing and improving phenology models, evaluating remote-sensing-derived LAI products, and quantifying forest structures in rapidly changing environments.

AB Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe (-1,236,000 km(2)) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, -250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65%. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1% of the total area, compared to 29.6% agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8% producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8% over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process.

AB Conceived in the 1960s. the Landsat program has experienced six successful missions that have contributed to an unprecedented 39-year record of Earth Observations that capture global land conditions and dynamics. Incremental improvements in imaging capabilities continue to improve the quality of Landsat science data, while ensuring continuity over the full instrument record. Landsats 5 and 7 are still collecting imagery. The planned launch of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission in December 2012 potentially extends the Landsat record to nearly 50 years. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat archive contains nearly three million Landsat images. All USGS Landsat data are available at no cost via the Internet. The USGS is committed to improving the content of the historical Landsat archive though the consolidation of Landsat data held in international archives. In addition, the USGS is working on a strategy to develop higher-level Landsat geo- and biophysical datasets. Finally, Federal efforts are underway to transition Landsat into a sustained operational program within the Department of the Interior and to authorize the development of the next two satellites - Landsats 9 and 10.

AB The Sentinel 2 mission offers continuity of service for the moderate resolution multispectral SPOT XS and Landsat Thematic Mapper series sensors, but also offers several design improvements that may lead to enhanced capability in coral reef mapping applications. In this study modeling and simulated image analyses were conducted to evaluate the relative capability of the Sentinel 2 instrument design compared to SPOT-4 and Landsat ETM+, for mapping bathymetry and benthic composition, and for coral bleaching detection. The analyses involved propagating noise and environmental uncertainties through a radiative transfer model inversion to quantify uncertainty in retrievable parameters from each sensor. The experiment structure included factors for sensor-environmental noise, band choice, and complexity of benthic reflectance model. Results indicate that while variables related to reef 'health' such as coral mortality and algal cover cannot be mapped accurately by this class of instrument; Sentinel 2 does have improved ability for discrimination of reef benthic composition over SPOT-4 and Landsat ETM+. The key enabling design factors are the narrowness of bands, increased spatial resolution and additional band at 443 nm; instrument noise was a less significant factor. Rapid revisit times, global coverage, and freely available data suggest the potential for time series analyses. Sentinel 2 may also be capable of bleaching detection by change analysis given effective methods for precise cross-image image radiometric and spatial alignment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The measurements of surface temperature are prone to important directional anisotropy in relation to the structure of the urban canopy and the radiative and energy exchanges inside it. Following the work of Lagouarde et al. 2010 that describes the daytime conditions, this paper focuses on the experimental analysis and modelling of the nighttime directional anisotropy. An extensive data set of airborne thermal infrared (TIR) measurements was collected over the city of Toulouse, France in the framework of the CAPITOUL project (Masson et al., 2008). The TIR measurements use a pair of thermal cameras equipped with wide angle lenses installed aboard a small aircraft. Three flights were made between 21:45 and 23:15 UTC, one in autumn and 2 in winter during 2004 and 2005 intensive operation periods (10Ps). The experimental results show that (i) the nighttime TIR directional anisotropy remains lower than 1 degrees C for zenithal view angles up to 50 degrees, and (ii) the nighttime anisotropy is insensitive to the azimuthal viewing direction. A modelling approach that combines a simplified 3D representation of the urban canopy with 2 energy transfer models, TEB and SOLENE, is then proposed. It confirms the experimental results quite well. Possible uncertainties on the geometry of the canopy and on most important thermo-radiative surface parameters are shown to have only little impact on the modelled TIR directional anisotropy. The time evolution of TIR anisotropy throughout night is simulated: for the fall and winter conditions studied the effects of thermal inertia completely vanish about 3 to 4 h after sunset, and the anisotropy never exceeds 2 degrees C up to 60 degrees zenithal view angles.

AB Information about the spatial distribution of urban surface emissivity is essential for surface temperature estimation. The latter is critical in many applications, such as estimation of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, energy budget, urban canopy modeling, bio-climatic studies and urban planning. This study proposes a new method for improving the estimation of urban surface emissivity, which is primarily based on spectral mixture analysis. The urban surface is assumed to consist of three fundamental land cover components, namely vegetation, impervious and soil that refer to the urban environment Due to the complexity of the urban environment, the impervious component is further divided into two land cover components: high-albedo and low-albedo impervious. Emissivity values are assigned to each component based on emissivity distributions derived from the ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0. The fractional covers are estimated using a constrained least absolute values algorithm which is robust to outliers, and results are compared against the ones derived from a conventional constrained least squares algorithm. Following the proposed method, by combining the fraction of each cover component with a respective emissivity value, an overall emissivity for a given pixel is estimated. The methodology is applicable to visible and near infrared satellite imagery, therefore it could be used to derive emissivity maps from most multispectral satellite sensors. The proposed approach was applied to ASTER multispectral data for the city of Heraklion, Greece. Emissivity, as well as land surface temperature maps in the spectral region of 10.25-10.95 mu m (ASTER band 13) were derived and evaluated against ASTER higher level products revealing comparable error estimations. An overall RMSE of 0.014776 (bias = -0.01239) was computed between the estimated emissivity obtained using the proposed methodology and the ASTER higher level product emissivity (AST05). The respective overall RMSE value for derived LST was found equal to 0.816935 K (bias = 0.67826 K). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MSG-SEVIRI DATA; VEGETATION INDEX; TIME-SERIES; AREA
AB Urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon of high spatial and temporal variabilities. It can develop during night or daytime. UHI monitoring is possible through thermal satellite remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST). LST over large areas (size of a city) can be measured at high temporal resolution merely from instruments on-board geostationary satellites. These can cover the diurnal cycle as they provide data even every 5 min (SEVIRI rapid scanning). Sensors on-board the geostationary satellites have, however, poor spatial resolution. Using high spatial resolution is in many regions most important because LST is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter especially in urban areas. UHI characteristics are correlated with the land cover and micro-relief parameters. These are often available in a higher spatial resolution (e.g. NDVI and EVI). Thus, we employed them to enhance the spatial resolution of the SEVIRI LST over central Europe - using moving window analysis - to 1000 m spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 15 min. For each SEVIRI pixel a multiple regression was run on the low resolution data. Regression equation was then used on the high resolution data in order to estimate LST of high spatial and temporal resolutions. The validation over urban areas showed that the downscaled SEVIRI LST is comparable with the MODIS LST with an average root mean square error of 2.5 K. The obtained results make possible to analyse the diurnal cycle of UHI. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new coefficient-based retrieval scheme for estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instruments. The new coefficients are banded by total column water vapour (TCWV), obtained from numerical weather prediction analyses. TCWV banding reduces simulated regional retrieval biases to <0.1 K compared to biases similar to 0.2 K for global coefficients. Further, detailed treatment of the instrumental viewing geometry reduces simulated view-angle related biases from similar to 0.1 K down to <0.005 K for dual-view retrievals using channels at 11 and 12 mu m. A novel analysis of trade-offs related to the assumed noise level when defining coefficients is undertaken, and we conclude that adding a small nominal level of noise (0.01 K) is optimal for our purposes.
   When applied to ATSR observations, some inter-algorithm biases appear as TCWV-related differences in SSTs estimated from different channel combinations. The final step in coefficient determination is to adjust the offset coefficient in each TCWV band to match results from a reference algorithm. This reference uses the dual-view observations of 3.7 and 11 mu m. The adjustment is independent of in situ measurements, preserving independence of the retrievals. The choice of reference is partly motivated by uncertainty in the calibration of the 12 mu m of Advanced ATSR.
   Lastly, we model the sensitivities of the new retrievals to changes to TCWV and changes in true SST, confirming that dual-view SSTs are most appropriate for climatological applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Semi-automated geomorphological mapping techniques are gradually replacing classical techniques due to increasing availability of high-quality digital topographic data. In order to efficiently analyze such large amounts of data, there is a need for optimizing the processing of automated mapping techniques. In this context, we present a novel approach to semi-automatically map alpine geomorphology using stratified object-based image analysis. We used a 1 m Digital Terrain Model (DTM) derived from laser altimetry data from a mountainous catchment from which we calculated various Land-Surface Parameters (I-SPs). The LSPs 'slope angle' and 'topographic openness' have been combined into a single composite layer for selecting reference material and delineating training samples. We developed a novel method to semi-automatically assess segmentation results by comparing 2D frequency distribution matrices of training samples and image objects. The segmentation accuracy assessment allowed us to automate optimization of the scale parameter and LSPs used for segmentation. We concluded that different geomorphological feature types have different sets of optimal segmentation parameters. The feature-dependent parameters were used in a new approach of stratified feature extraction for classifying karst, glacial, fluvial and denudational landforms. In this way, we have used stratified object-based image analysis to semi-automatically extract contrasting geomorphological features from high-resolution digital terrain data. A further step would be to also automate the optimization of classification rules. We would then be able to create a library of feature characteristics that could be transferred and applied to other mountain regions and further automate geomorphological mapping strategies.

AB Regularly updated land cover information at continental or national scales is a requirement for various land management applications as well as biogeochemical and climate modeling exercises. However, monitoring or updating of map products with sufficient spatial detail is currently not widely practiced due to inadequate time-series coverage for most regions of the Earth. Classifications of coarser spatial resolution data can be automatically generated on an annual or finer time scale. However, discrete land cover classifications of such data cannot sufficiently quantify land surface heterogeneity or change. This study presents a methodology for continuous and discrete land cover mapping using moderate spatial resolution time series data sets. The method automatically selects sample data from higher spatial resolution maps and generates multiple decision trees. The leaves of decision trees are interpreted considering the sample distribution of all classes yielding class membership maps, which can be used as estimates for the diversity of classes in a coarse resolution cell. Results are demonstrated for the heterogeneous, small-patch landscape of Germany and the bio-climatically varying landscape of South Africa. Results have overall classification accuracies of 80%. A sensitivity analysis of individual modules of the classification process indicates the importance of appropriately chosen features, sample data balanced among classes, and an appropriate method to combine individual classifications. The comparison of classification results over several years not only indicates the method's consistency, but also its potential to detect land cover changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we explored fusion of structural metrics from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) and spectral characteristics from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for biomass estimation in the Sierra Nevada. in addition, we combined the two sensors to map species-specific biomass and stress at landscape scale. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to classify vegetation from AVIRIS images and obtain sub-pixel fractions of green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade.,LVIS metrics. AVIRIS spectral indices, and MESMA fractions were compared with field measures of biomass using linear and stepwise regressions at stand (1 ha) level. AVIRIS metrics such as water band indices and shade fractions showed strong correlation with LVIS canopy height (r(2) = 0.69, RMSE = 5.2 m) and explained around 60% variability in biomass. LVIS variables were found to be consistently good predictors of total and species specific biomass (r(2) = 0.77, RMSE = 70.12 Mg/ha). Prediction by LVIS after species stratification of field data reduced errors by 12% (r(2) = 0.84. RMSE = 58.78 Mg/ha) over using LVIS metrics alone. Species-specific biomass maps and associated errors created from fusion were different from those produced without fusion, particularly for hardwoods and pines, although mean biomass differences between the two techniques were not statistically significant. A combined analysis of spatial maps from LVIS and AVIRIS showed increased water and chlorophyll stress in several high biomass stands in the study area. This study provides further evidence that lidar is better suited for biomass estimation, per se, while the best use of hyperspectral data may be to refine biomass predictions through a priori species stratification, while also providing information on canopy state, such as stress. Together, the two sensors have many potential applications in carbon dynamics, ecological and habitat studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land-cover is an important parameter in analyzing the state and dynamics of natural and anthropogenic terrestrial ecosystems. Land-cover classes related to semi-arid savannas currently exhibit among the greatest uncertainties in available global land cover datasets. This study focuses on the Kalahari in northeastern Namibia and compares the effects of different composite lengths and observation periods with class-wise mapping accuracies derived from multi-temporal MODIS time series classifications to better understand and overcome quality gaps in mapping semi-arid land-cover types. We further assess the effects of precipitation patterns on mapping accuracy using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observation data. Botanical field samples, translated into the UN Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), were used for training and validation. Different sets of composites (16-day to three-monthly) were generated from MODIS (MOD13Q1) data covering the sample period from 2004 to 2007. land-cover classifications were performed cumulatively based on annual and inter-annual feature sets with the use of random forests. Woody vegetation proved to be more stable in terms of omission and commission errors compared to herbaceous vegetation types. Generally, mapping accuracy increases with increasing length of the observation period. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) verified that inter-annual classifications significantly improved class-wise mapping accuracies, and confirmed that monthly composites achieved the best accuracy scores for both annual and inter-annual classifications. Correlation analyses using piecewise linear models affirmed positive correlations between cumulative mapping accuracy and rainfall and indicated an influence of seasonality and environmental cues on the mapping accuracies. The consideration of the inter-seasonal variability of vegetation activity and phenology cycling in the classification process further increases the overall classification performance of savanna classes in large-area land-cover datasets. Implications for global monitoring frameworks are discussed based on a conceptual model of the relationship between observation period and accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we examine, for the first time, the potential of remote sensing to monitor flood dynamics in urban areas and constrain mathematical models of these processes. This is achieved through the development of a unique data set consisting of a series of eight space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and aerial photographic images of flooding of the UK town of Tewkesbury acquired over an eight day period in summer 2007. Previous observations of urban flooding have used single image and wrack mark data and have therefore been unable to adequately chart the propagation and recession of flood waves through complex urban topography. By using a combination of space-borne radar and aerial imagery we are able to show that remotely sensed imagery, particularly from the new TerraSAR-X radar, can reproduce dynamics adequately and support flood modelling in urban areas. We illustrate that image data from different remote sensing platforms reveal sufficient information to distinguish between models with varying degrees of channel-floodplain connectivity, particularly toward the end of the recession phase of the event. For this test case, our results also show that high resolution SAR imagery even when acquired from satellites can reveal important hydraulic characteristics difficult to simulate with current dynamic flood models. Hence, it is established, at least for this test case and event, that SAR imagery from as far as several hundred kilometers from the Earth's surface can deliver important information about floodplain dynamics that can be used to identify and help build suitable models, even in built-up environments.

AB Three ocean colour algorithms, OC4v6, Carder and OC5 were tested for retrieving Chlorophyll-a (Chla) in coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal and open ocean areas of the Arabian Sea. Firstly, the algorithms were run using similar to 80 in situ Remote Sensing Reflectance, (R-rs(lambda)) data collected from coastal areas during eight cruises from January 2000 to March 2002 and the output was compared to in situ Chla. Secondly, the algorithms were run with similar to 20 SeaWiFS R-rs(lambda) and the results were compared with coincident in situ Chla. In both cases, OC5 exhibited the lowest log(10)-RMS, bias, had a slope close to 1 and this algorithm appears to be the most accurate for both coastal and open ocean areas. Thirdly the error in the algorithms was regressed against Total Suspended Material (TSM) and Coloured Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM) data to assess the co-variance with these parameters. The OC5 error did not co-vary with TSM and CDOM. OC4v6 tended to over-estimate Chla >2 mg m(-3) and the error in OC4v6 co-varied with TSM. OC4v6 was more accurate than the Carder algorithm, which over-estimated Chla at concentrations >1 mg m(-3) and under-estimated Chla at values <0.5 mg m(-3). The error in Carder Chla also co-varied with TSM. The algorithms were inter-compared using >5500 SeaWiFS R-rs(lambda) data from coastal to offshore transects in the Northern Bay of Bengal. There was good agreement between OC4v6 and OC5 in open ocean waters and in coastal areas up to 2 mg m(-3). There was a strong divergence between Carder and OC5 in open ocean and coastal waters. OC4v6 and Carder tended to over-estimate Chla in coastal areas by a factor of 2 to 3 when TSM >25 g m(-3). We strongly recommend the use of OC5 for coastal and open ocean waters of the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. A Chla time series was generated using OC5 from 2000 to 2003, which showed that concentrations at the mouths of the Ganges reach a maxima (similar to 5 mg m(-3)) in October and November and were 0.08 mg m(-3) further offshore increasing to 0.2 mg m(-3) during December. Similarly in early spring from February to March, Chla was 0.08 to 0.2 mg m(-3) on the east coast of the Bay. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soils play a key role in shaping the environment and in risk assessment. We characterized the soils of bare agricultural plots using TerraSAR-X (9.5 GHz) data acquired in 2009 and 2010. We analyzed the behavior of the TerraSAR-X signal for two configurations, HH-25 degrees and HH-50 degrees, with regard to several soil conditions: moisture content, surface roughness, soil composition and soil-surface structure (slaking crust).
   The TerraSAR-X signal was more sensitive to soil moisture at a low (25 degrees) incidence angle than at a high incidence angle (50 degrees). For high soil moisture (>25%), the TerraSAR-X signal was more sensitive to soil roughness at a high incidence angle (50 degrees) than at a low incidence angle (25 degrees).
   The high spatial resolution of the TerraSAR-X data (1 m) enabled the soil composition and slaking crust to be analyzed at the within-plot scale based on the radar signal. The two loamy-soil categories that composed our training plots did not differ sufficiently in their percentages of sand and clay to be discriminated by the X-band radar signal.
   However, the spatial distribution of slaking crust could be detected when soil moisture variation is observed between soil crusted and soil without crust. Indeed, areas covered by slaking crust could have greater soil moisture and consequently a greater backscattering signal than soils without crust. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB During summer and autumn 2007, a 11 GHz microwave radiometer was deployed in an experimental tree plantation in Sardinilla, Panama. The opacity of the tree canopy was derived from incoming brightness temperatures received on the ground. A collocated eddy-covariance flux tower measured water vapor fluxes and meteorological variables above the canopy. In addition, xylem sapflow of trees was measured within the flux tower footprint. We observed considerable diurnal differences between measured canopy opacities and modeled theoretical opacities that were closely linked to xylem sapflow. It is speculated that dielectric changes in the leaves induced by the sapflow are causing the observed diurnal changes. In addition, canopy intercepted rain and dew formation also modulated the diurnal opacity cycle. With an enhanced canopy opacity model accounting for water deposited on the leaves, we quantified the influence of canopy stored water (i.e. intercepted water and dew) on the opacity. A time series of dew formation and rain interception was directly monitored during a period of two weeks. We found that during light rainfall up to 60% of the rain amount is intercepted by the canopy whereas during periods of intense rainfall only 4% were intercepted.

AB The development and assessment of satellite ocean color products require quality assured in situ data representative of the variety of bio-optical regimes encountered in the different seas. The measurement program named Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) fulfills this requirement by using identical instruments and applying cross-site consistent methods for the characterization of seawater inherent and apparent optical properties in the various European seas. This work introduces the BiOMaP radiometric data and describes their application to the validation of primary ocean color products. Within this framework, the radiometric data are discussed through the spectral shape and amplitude of normalized water-leaving radiances (L-WN). Specifically, the spectral shape is expressed through the Principal Component Analysis of L-WN(lambda)/L-WN(555) while the amplitude is represented by L-WN(555). The resulting distribution of BiOMaP data in a three dimensional feature space demonstrates a continuity of cases across the investigated marine regions confirming a wide representativity of bio-optical regimes. The application of BiOMaP data to the validation of remote sensing reflectance from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S), indicates improved performance of the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS, version 6.1) atmospheric correction. In particular, the comparison of satellite and in situ matchups in the blue spectral region shows biases of a few percent with respect to the much larger reported in studies relying on earlier SeaDAS versions. Matchup analyses, restricted to the Eastern Mediterranean, Black and Baltic Seas, indicate marked regional differences likely explained by the diversity of water and aerosol types.

AB Despite the importance of CDOM to upper ocean biogeochemical processes and optics, our current understanding of its spatial and temporal distributions and the factors controlling these distributions is very limited. This eventually prevents an understanding of its relationship to the pool of dissolved organic carbon in coastal and open oceans. This work aims to present a new approach for accurate modeling of absorption spectra of CDOM (a(cdom)) and deriving information on its composition in global ocean waters. The modeling approach uses measurements (in situ) of the remote sensing reflectances at two wavelengths (denoted R-555(443)rs) to estimate a(cdom)(350) and a(cdom)(412), applies them to determine two spectral slopes of an exponential curve fit (S) and a hyperbolic curve fit (gamma), derives an appropriate parameter (gamma degrees) for grading the CDOM compositional changes from a(cdom) (350) and gamma, and finally employs a(cdom) (350), S. and gamma degrees in a modified exponential model to describe a(cdom)(lambda) as a function of wavelength. The robustness of this model was rigorously tested on three independent datasets, such as NOMAD in situ data, NOMAD SeaWiFS match-ups data and IOCCG simulated data (all of them contain a(cdom)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda)). which represent a variety of waters within coastal and offshore regions around the world. Accuracy of the retrievals found with the new models was generally excellent, with MRE (mean relative error) and RMSE (root mean square error) of -5.64-3.55% and 0.203-0.318 for the NOMAD in situ datasets, and -5.63 to -0.98% and 0.136-0.241 for the NOMAD satellite datasets respectively (for lambda(412) to lambda(670)). When used with SeaWiFS images collected over the regional and global waters, the new model showed the highest surface abundances of CDOM within the subpolar gyres and continental shelves dominated by terrestrial inputs (and perhaps local production) of colored dissolved materials, and the lowest surface abundances of CDOM in the central subtropical gyres and the open oceans presumably regulated by photobleaching phenomenon, bacterial activity and local processes. Significant interseasonal and interannual seasonal changes in the terrestrially-derived CDOM distributions were noticed from these new products that closely corresponded with the global mean runoff/river discharge induced by climate change/warming scenarios.

AB Successful discrimination of a variety of natural and urban landscape components has been achieved with remote sensing data using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). MESMA is a spectral matching algorithm that addresses spectral variability by allowing multiple reference spectra (i.e.. endmembers) to represent each material class. However, materials that have a high-degree of spectral similarity between classes, such as similar plant-types or closely related plant species, and large variations in albedo present an ongoing challenge for accurate class discrimination with imaging spectrometry. Continuum removal (CR) analysis may improve class separability by emphasizing individual absorption features across a normalized spectrum. The spectral and structural characteristics common to most Eucalyptus trees make them notoriously difficult to discriminate in closed-canopy forests with imaging spectrometry. We evaluated whether CR applied to hyperspectral remote sensing data improved the performance of MESMA in classifying and mapping nine eucalypt tree species according to the two major Eucalyptus subgenera, Eucalyptus (common name "monocalypt") and Symphyomyrtus (common name "symphyomyrtle"). Mixed-canopies comprised of monocalypts and symphyomyrtles are common in Australia, although their spatial distribution is not random. The ability to map these functional types on a landscape-scale could provide important information about ecosystem processes, landscape disturbance history and wildlife habitat. We created a spectral library of 229 pixels from 37 symphyomyrtle tree canopies and 406 pixels from 62 monocalypt tree canopies selected from HyMap imagery and verified with field data. Based on these reference data, we achieved overall classification accuracies at the subgenera-level of 75% (Kappa 0.48) for non-CR spectra and 83% (Kappa 0.63) for the CR spectra. We found that continuum-removal improved the classification performance of most endmember-models, although a larger portion of pixels remained unmodeled with the CR spectra (2%) compared to the non-CR spectra (0%). We utilized a new method for model optimization and created maps of monocalypt and symphyomyrtle distribution in our study area based on our best performing endmember-models. Our vegetation maps were largely consistent with our expectations of subgenera distribution based on our knowledge of the region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological monitoring is essential for meaningful water-management policies and actions, especially where water resources are scarce and/or dwindling, as is the case in Australia. In this paper, we investigate the regional 4 degrees x 4 degrees mascon (mass concentration) GRACE solutions for Australia provided by GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA) for their suitability in monitoring Australian hydrology, with a particular focus on the Murray-Darling Basin (MOB). Using principal component analysis (PCA) and multi-linear regression analysis (MLRA), the main components of spatial and temporal variability in the mascon solutions are analysed over the whole Australian continent and the MOB. The results are compared to those from global solutions provided by CSR (Center for Space Research, University of Texas at Austin, USA) and CNES/GRGS (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales/Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie Spatiale, France) and validated using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), water storage changes predicted by the WaterGap Global Hydrological Model (WGHM) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and ground-truth (river-gauge) observations. For the challenging Australian case with generally weak hydrological signals, the mascon solutions provide similar results to those from the global solutions, with the advantage of not requiring additional filtering (destriping and smoothing) as, for example, is necessary for the CSR solutions. A further advantage of the mascon solutions is that they offer a higher temporal resolution (i.e., 10 days) compared to approximately monthly CSR solutions. Examining equivalent water volume (EWV) time series for the MOB shows a good cross-correlation (generally>0.7) among the GRACE solutions when considering the whole basin, although lower (generally<0.5)when all the GRACE solutions are compared to the TRMM, WGHM and GLDAS time series. Examining smaller portions of the MOB see the correlation among the GRACE solutions and the TRMM, WGHM and GLDAS EWV time series increase slightly (>0.6), with all time series appearing to visually follow the general behaviour of the river-gauge data, although the cross-correlations are relatively low (between 0.3 and 0.6).

AB This study uses a combination of satellite imagery and GIS data, a vegetation map, interview data, and on-site field studies to map detailed natural vegetation to land-use conversion pathways (similar to 22,000 possible combinations) in the seasonal tropics of Santa Cruz Department in southeastern Bolivia from 1994 to 2008. We mapped a suite of land-use classes based on the seasonal phenology of double- and single season cropping regimes; pasture; and bare soil cropland (fallow). Analyses focus specifically on the Corredor Bioceanico, which bisects some of the most sensitive and poorly understood ecosystems in the world and indirectly creating one of the most important agricultural region-deforestation hotspots in South America at the present time. Training data to predict class membership were based on MODIS NDVI annual mean, maximum, minimum, and amplitude derived from field observations, semi-structured interviews, and aerial videography. Results show that over 8,000 km(2) of forest was lost during the 14-year study period. In the first years of cultivation, pasture is the dominant land use, but quickly gives way to cropland. The main findings according to forest type is that transitional forest types on deep and poorly drained soils of alluvial plains have lost the most in terms of percentage area cleared. The resulting transition pathways can potentially provide decision-makers with more detailed insight as to the proximate causes or driving forces of land change in addition to the most threatened forests remaining in the Tierras Bajas and those most likely to be cleared in the Brazilian Shield and Pantanal.

AB A new method of estimating per-pixel atmospheric column water vapor (ACWV) and potential differences in the reported band center wavelengths of the HyMap sensor has been developed. The new method uses variations of a second order derivative algorithm (SODA) to assess the impact of atmospheric residual features on calculated surface reflectance spectra after atmospheric compensation. The SODA method provides an alternative to the current band ratio techniques of ACWV estimation and also allows the same form of algorithm to be used for the estimation of possible band shifts. A comparison of in-situ measured surface reflectance at two field sites in Western Australia demonstrates improvement in the resulting spectra when post-flight updates are made to the reported HyMap band center wavelengths and applied during the atmospheric compensation process. The same SODA methodology was varied to estimate the ACWV on a per-pixel basis and found to significantly reduce the appearance of the underlying surface structure on the resulting ACWV images as well as improve the overall accuracy of the estimation. The ACWV estimated from the HyMap imagery at the two field sites was found to agree with in-situ atmospheric ACWV measurements to within 2% and represented a two fold increase in accuracy over a 3 band ratio Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR) technique of ACWV estimation.

AB Gross primary production (GPP) defined as the overall rate of fixation of carbon through the process of vegetation photosynthesis is important for carbon cycle and climate change research. Three models, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), the Temperature and Greenness (TG) model and the Vegetation Index (VI) model have been compared for the estimation of GPP in Harvard Forest from 2003 to 2006 using climate variables acquired by eddy covariance (EC) measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. All these models provide more reliable estimates of GPP than that of MODIS GPP product. High Pearsons correlation coefficients r equal to 0.94, 0.92 and 0.90 are observed for the VPM, the TG and the VI model, respectively. Relationships between GPP and land surface temperature (LST, R-2=0.72), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, R-2=0.45) indicate that climate variables are important for GPP estimation. Due to proper characterization of temperature, water stress and leaf age by three scalars, VPM best follows the seasonal variations of GPP. By incorporation of the MODIS surface reflectance and LST product, the TG model is the most suitable choice for areas without prior knowledge as it is based entirely on remote sensing observations. Results from the VI model demonstrate the possibility of using a single vegetation index for light use efficiency (LUE) estimation in deciduous forest that is of high spatial heterogeneity. The validation and comparison of models will be helpful in development of future GPP models using combinations of climate variables and/or remote sensing observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Riparian zones in Australia are exposed to increasing pressures because of disturbance from agricultural and urban expansion, weed invasion, and overgrazing. Accurate and cost-effective mapping of riparian environments is important for assessing riparian zone functions associated with water quality, biodiversity, and wildlife habitats. The objective of this research was to compare the accuracy and costs of mapping riparian zone attributes from image data acquired by three different sensor types, i.e. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) (0.5-2.4 m pixels), and multi-spectral QuickBird (2.4 m pixels) and SPOT-5 (10 m pixels). These attributes included streambed width, riparian zone width, plant projective cover, longitudinal continuity, vegetation overhang, and bank stability. The riparian zone attributes were mapped for a study area along Mimosa Creek in the Fitzroy Catchment, Central Queensland, Australia. Object-based image and regression analyses were used for mapping the riparian zone attributes. The validation of the LiDAR, QuickBird, and SPOT-5 derived maps of streambed width (R = 0.99, 0.71, and 0.44 respectively) and riparian zone width (R = 0.91, 0.87, and 0.74 respectively) against field derived measurements produced the highest accuracies for the LiDAR data and the lowest using the SPOT-5 image data. Cross-validation estimates of misclassification produced a root mean square error of 1.06. 1.35 and 1.51 from an ordinal scale from 0 to 4 of the bank stability score for the LiDAR, QuickBird and SPOT-5 image data, respectively. The validation and empirical modelling showed high correlations for all datasets for mapping plant projective cover (R>0.93). The SPOT-5 image data were unsuitable for assessment of riparian zone attributes at the spatial scale of Mimosa Creek and associated riparian zones. Cost estimates of image and field data acquisition and processing of the LiDAR, QuickBird, and SPOT-5 image data showed that discrete return LiDAR can be used for costs lower than those for QuickBird image data over large spatial extents (e.g. 26,000 km of streams). With the higher level of vegetation structural and landform information, mapping accuracies, geometric precision, and lower overall costs at large spatial extents, LiDAR data are a feasible means for assessment of riparian zone attributes.

AB Detection of sub-surface optical layers in marine waters has important applications in fisheries management, climate modeling, and decision-based systems related to military operations. Concurrent changes in the magnitude and spatial variability of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) ratios and submerged scattering layers were investigated in coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska during summer of 2002 based on high resolution and simultaneous passive (MicroSAS) and active (Fish Lidar Oceanic Experimental, FLOE) optical measurements. Principal Component Analysis revealed that the spatial variability of total lidar backscattering signal (5) between 2.1 and 20 m depth was weakly associated with changes in the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of surface waters. Also based on a 250-m footprint, the vertical attenuation of S was inversely related to the IOPs (Spearman Rank Correlation up to -0.43). Low (arithmetic average and standard deviation) and high (skewness and kurtosis) moments of R-rs(443)/R-rs(490) and R-rs(508)/R-rs(555) ratios were correlated with vertical changes in total lidar backscattering signal (5) at different locations. This suggests the use of sub-pixel ocean color statistics to infer the spatial distribution of sub-surface scattering layers in coastal waters characterized by stratified conditions, well defined S layers (i.e., magnitude of S maximum comparable to near surface values), and relatively high vertically integrated phytoplankton pigments in the euphotic zone (chlorophyll a concentration >150 mg m(-2)).

AB As soil moisture increases, slope stability decreases. Remotely sensed soil moisture data can provide routine updates of slope conditions necessary for landslide predictions. For regional scale landslide investigations, only remote-sensing methods have the spatial and temporal resolution required to map hazard increases. Here, a dynamic physically-based slope stability model that requires soil moisture is applied using remote-sensing products from multiple Earth observing platforms. The resulting landslide susceptibility maps using the advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) surface soil moisture are compared to those created using variable infiltration capacity (VIC-3L) modeled soil moisture at Cleveland Corral landslide area in California, US. Despite snow cover influences on AMSR-E surface soil moisture estimates, a good relationship between the downscaled AMSR-E's surface soil moisture and the VIC-3L modeled soil moisture is evident. The AMSR-E soil moisture mean (0.17 cm(3)/cm(3)) and standard deviation (0.02 cm(3)/cm(3)) are very close to the mean (0.21 cm(3)/cm(3)) and standard deviation (0.09 cm(3)/cm(3)) estimated by VIC-3L model. Qualitative results show that the location and extent of landslide prone regions are quite similar. Under the maximum saturation scenario, 0.42% and 0.49% of the study area were highly susceptible using AMSR-E and VIC-3L model soil moisture, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we investigate the surface displacement related to the 2006 Machaze earthquake using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) and sub-pixel correlation (SPC) of radar amplitude images. We focus on surface displacement measurement during three stages of the seismic cycle. First, we examined the co-seismic stage, using an Advanced SAR (ASAR) sensor onboard the Envisat satellite. Then we investigated the post-seismic stage using the Phase Array L-band SAR sensor (PALSAR) onboard the ALOS satellite. Lastly, we focussed on the inter-seismic stage, prior to the earthquake by analysing the L-band JERS-1 SAR data. The high degree of signal decorrelation in the C-band co-seismic interferogram hinders a correct positioning of the surface rupture and correct phase unwrapping. The post-seismic L-band interferograms reveal a time-constant surface displacement, causing subsidence of the surface at a similar to 5 cm/yr rate. This phenomenon continued to affect the close rupture field for at least two years following the earthquake and intrinsically reveals a candidate seismogenic fault trace that we use as a proxy for an inversion against an elastic dislocation model. Prior to the earthquake, the JERS interferograms do not indicate any traces of pre-seismic slip on the seismogenic fault. Therefore, slip after the earthquake is post-seismic, and it was triggered by the Machaze earthquake. This feature represents a prominent post-seismic slip event rarely observed in such a geodynamic context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Repeatable approaches for mapping saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) at regional scales, with the ability to detect low density stands, is crucial for the species' effective control and management, as well as for an improved understanding of its current and potential future dynamics. This study had the objective of testing subpixel classification techniques based on linear and nonlinear spectral mixture models in order to identify the best possible classification technique for repeatable mapping of saltcedar canopy cover along the Forgotten River reach of the Rio Grande. The suite of methods tested were meant to represent various levels of constraints imposed in the solution as well as varying levels of classification details (species level and landscape level), sources for endmembers (space-borne multispectral image, airborne hyperspectral image and in situ spectra measurements) and mixture modes (linear and nonlinear). A multiple scattering approximation (MSA) model was proposed as a means to represent canopy (image) reflectance spectra as a nonlinear combination of subcanopy (field) reflectance spectra. The accuracy of subpixel canopy cover was assessed through a 1-m spatial-resolution hyperspectral image and field measurements. Results indicated that: 1) When saltcedar was represented by one single image spectrum (endmember), the unconstrained linear spectral unmixing with post-classification normalization produced comparable accuracy (OA = 72%) to those delivered by partially and fully constrained linear spectral unmixing (63-72%) and even by nonlinear spectral unmixing (73%). 2) The accuracy of the fully constrained linear spectral unmixing method increased (from 67% to 77%) when the classes were represented with several image spectra. 3) Saltcedar canopy reflectance showed the strongest nonlinear relationship with respect to subcanopy reflectance, as indicated through a range of estimated canopy recollision probabilities. 4) Despite the considerations of these effects on canopy reflectance, the inversion of the nonlinear spectral mixing model with subcanopy reflectance (field) measurements yielded slightly lower accuracy (73%) than the linear counterpart (77%). Implications of these results for region-wide monitoring of saltcedar invasion are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The amount and spatial distribution of aboveground forest biomass (AGB) are required inputs to forest carbon budgets and ecosystem productivity models. Satellite remote sensing offers distinct advantages for large area and multi-temporal applications, however, conventional empirical methods for estimating forest canopy structure and AGB can be difficult in areas of high relief and variable terrain. This paper introduces a new method for obtaining AGB from forest structure estimates using a physically-based canopy reflectance (CR) model inversion approach. A geometric-optical CR model was run in multiple forward mode (MFM) using SPOT-5 imagery to derive forest structure and biomass at Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The approach first estimates tree crown dimensions and stem density for satellite image pixels which are then related to tree biomass and AGB using a crown spheroid surface area approach. MFM estimates of AGB were evaluated for 36 deciduous (trembling aspen) and conifer (lodgepole pine) field validation sites and compared against spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) biomass predictions from atmospherically and topographically corrected (SCS+C) imagery. MFM provided the lowest error for all validation plots of 31.7 tonnes/hectare (t/ha) versus SMA (32.6 t/ha error) and NDVI (34.7 t/ha) as well as for conifer plots (MFM: 23.0 t/ha; SMA 27.9 t/ha; NDVI 29.7 t/ha) but had higher error than SMA and NDVI for deciduous plots (by 4.5 t/ha and 2.1 t/ha, respectively). The MFM approach was considerably more stable over the full range of biomass values (67 to 243 t/ha) measured in the field. Field plots with biomass >1 standard deviation from the field mean (over 30% of plots) had biomass estimation errors of 37.9 t/ha using MFM compared with 65.5 t/ha and 67.5 t/ha error from SMA and NDVI, respectively. In addition to providing more accurate overall results and greater stability over the range of biomass values, the MFM approach also provides a suite of other biophysical structural outputs such as density, crown dimensions. LAI, height and sub-pixel scale fractions. Its explicit physical-basis and minimal ground data requirements are also more appropriate for larger area, multi-scene, multi-date applications with variable scene geometry and in high relief terrain. MFM thus warrants consideration for applications in mountainous and other, less complex terrain for purposes such as forest inventory updates, ecological modeling and terrestrial biomass and carbon monitoring studies.

AB Since January 2008, the U.S. Department of Interior / U.S. Geological Survey have been providing free terrain-corrected (Level IT) Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data via the Internet, currently for acquisitions with less than 40% cloud cover. With this rich dataset, temporally composited, mosaics of the conterminous United States (CONUS) were generated on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis using 6521 ETM+ acquisitions from December 2007 to November 2008. The composited mosaics are designed to provide consistent Landsat data that can be used to derive land cover and geo-physical and bio-physical products for detailed regional assessments of land-cover dynamics and to study Earth system functioning. The data layers in the composited mosaics are defined at 30 m and include top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, TOA brightness temperature, TOA normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the date each composited pixel was acquired on, per-band radiometric saturation status, cloud mask values, and the number of acquisitions considered in the compositing period. Reduced spatial resolution browse imagery, and top of atmosphere 30 m reflectance time series extracted from the monthly composites, capture the expected land surface phenological change, and illustrate the potential of the composited mosaic data for terrestrial monitoring at high spatial resolution. The composited mosaics are available in 501 tiles of 5000x5000 30 m pixels in the Albers equal area projection and are downloadable at http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php. The research described in this paper demonstrates the potential of Landsat data processing to provide a consistent, long-term, large-area, data record. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been used to detect relative water level changes in wetlands. We developed an innovative method to integrate InSAR and satellite radar altimetry for measuring absolute or geocentric water level changes and applied the methodology to remote areas of swamp forest in coastal Louisiana. Coherence analysis of InSAR pairs suggested that the HH polarization is preferred for this type of observation, and polarimetric analysis can help to identify double-bounce backscattering areas in the wetland. ENVISAT radar altimeter-measured 18-Hz (along-track sampling of 417 m) water level data processed with regional stackfile method have been used to provide vertical references for water bodies separated by levees. The high-resolution (similar to 40 m) relative water changes measured from ALOS PALSAR L-band and Radarsat-1 C-band InSAR are then integrated with ENVISAT radar altimetry to obtain absolute water level. The resulting water level time series were validated with in situ gauge observations within the swamp forest We anticipate that this new technique will allow retrospective reconstruction and concurrent monitoring of water conditions and flow dynamics in wetlands, especially those lacking gauge networks.

AB Airborne hyperspectral data fulfills the high spectral and spatial resolution requirements of urban remote sensing applications. Its high spectral information content enables delineating impervious areas including the separation of built-up and non built-up surfaces, thus being of high relevance for many urban environmental applications. However, two phenomena related to surface structure negatively impact the accuracy of maps from such airborne data sets: (1) displaced buildings that lead to confusion between the class built-up and adjacent non built-up areas as a function of building height and view-angle; (2) urban street trees obscuring impervious surface underneath. Both effects have so far not been investigated from airborne hyperspectral data and potential sources of inaccuracy are usually not differentiated in analysis utilizing such data. Thus, the positive influence of hyperspectral information might have been undervalued in many cases. We set up an analysis scheme that allows for separately quantifying sources of error when producing land cover maps from urban areas. Given reliable cadastral information on building extent and street network, a detailed analysis for a relatively large Hyperspectral Mapper data set acquired over Berlin, Germany, was performed. Results show that both building displacement and impervious surface obscured by tree crowns are of great impact: at large view-angles, building displacement adds up to 16% error compared to nadir regions: more than 30% of the street area is classified as vegetation. Moreover, both effects show irregularities that prohibit empirical correction: misclassification due to building displacement also depends on view-direction, i.e. illumination properties and shadow, while the influence of trees differs significantly along streets and inside residential areas. Results from this work underline the necessity to consider all image processing steps when evaluating the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing products and they depict directions for future methodological development.

AB Hyperspectral imaging data have been collected with different types of imaging spectrometers from aircraft and satellite platforms since the mid-1980s. Because the solar radiation on the sun-surface-sensor path in the 0.4-2.5 mu m visible and near-IR spectral regions is subject to absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols, the hyperspectral imaging data contains atmospheric effects. In order to use hyperspectral imaging data for quantitative remote sensing of land surfaces and ocean color, the atmospheric effects must be removed. Over the years, atmospheric correction algorithms have evolved from the earlier empirical line method and the flat field method to more recent methods based on rigorous radiative transfer modeling approaches. Here, a review of hyperspectral atmospheric correction techniques is presented. Issues related to spectral smoothing are discussed. Suggestions for improvements to the present atmospheric correction algorithms, mainly the addition of a module for modeling atmospheric nitrogen dioxide absorption effects in the visible, are given.

AB Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral imaging, has been transformed in less than 30 years from being a sparse research tool into a commodity product available to a broad user community. Currently, there is a need for standardized data processing techniques able to take into account the special properties of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we provide a seminal view on recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral image processing. Our main focus is on the design of techniques able to deal with the high-dimensional nature of the data, and to integrate the spatial and spectral information. Performance of the discussed techniques is evaluated in different analysis scenarios. To satisfy time-critical constraints in specific applications, we also develop efficient parallel implementations of some of the discussed algorithms. Combined, these parts provide an excellent snapshot of the state-of-the-art in those areas. and offer a thoughtful perspective on future potentials and emerging challenges in the design of robust hyperspectral imaging algorithms.

AB The science of spectroscopy has existed for more than three centuries, and imaging spectroscopy for the Earth system for three decades. We first discuss the historical background of spectroscopy, followed by imaging spectroscopy, introducing a common definition for the latter. The relevance of imaging spectroscopy is then assessed using a comprehensive review of the cited literature. Instruments, technological advancements and (pre-) processing approaches are discussed to set the scene for application related advancements. We demonstrate these efforts using four examples that represent progress due to imaging spectroscopy, namely (i) bridging scaling gaps from molecules to ecosystems using coupled radiative transfer models (ii) assessing surface heterogeneity including clumping, (iii) physical based (inversion) modeling, and iv) assessing interaction of light with the Earth surface. Recent advances of imaging spectroscopy contributions to the Earth system sciences are discussed. We conclude by summarizing the achievements of thirty years of imaging spectroscopy and strongly recommend this community to increase its efforts to convince relevant stakeholders of the urgency to acquire the highest quality imaging spectrometer data for Earth observation from operational satellites capable of collecting consistent data for climatically-relevant periods of time.

AB Gross primary production (GPP), the photosynthetic uptake of carbon, is an important variable in the global carbon cycle. Although continuous measurements of GPP are being collected from a network of micro-meteorological towers, each site represents a small area with records available for only a limited period. As a result, GPP is commonly modeled over forested landscapes as a function of climatic and soil variables, often supplemented with satellite-derived estimates of the vegetation's light-absorbing properties. Since the late 1990s, a number of models have been developed to provide seasonal and annual estimates of GPP across much of the Earth. Each model, however, contains different underlying assumptions and requires different amounts of data. As a result, predictions vary, sometimes significantly. In this paper we compare modeled estimates of GPP for forested areas across the U.S.A. derived from: NASA's MODIS Product (MOD17): the C-Fix model using SPOT-VGT satellite-derived vegetation data; and the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth from Satellites (3-PGS) model, a process-based model that requires information on both climate and soil properties. The models predicted average ecoregion values of forest GPP between 9.8 and 14.1 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) across the United States. 3-PGS predicted the lowest values while the C-Fix model, which included a CO2 fertilization factor, produced the highest estimates. In the western part of the country, estimates of GPP within a given ecoregion varied by as much as 50%, whereas in the northeast, where topography and climate are less extreme, variation in GPP was less than 10%. Within ecoregions, 3PGS predicted the most variation, reflecting its sensitivity to variation in soil properties. We conclude that where model predictions disagree, an opportunity is presented to evaluate underlying assumptions through sensitivity analyses, additional data collection and where more detailed study is warranted.

AB Remote sensing in the optical band is a well-established tool for monitoring changes in forested areas, although it can suffer from limitations, especially where frequent cloud cover occurs. The increased availability of space-borne radar imagery offers additional means for assessing the state of forests and monitoring their dynamics. in this study, the potential of multi-temporal space-borne SAR data for monitoring vegetation recovery over burned areas next to the Mediterranean coast is investigated. In particular, the study considers a set of ERS-SAR images, C-band and VV polarization, taken over the Castel Fusano pinewood, located near Rome, Italy, devastated in summer 2000 by a fire that burned about 350 ha of the wood. Starting from the analysis of the information contained in the variations, both in burnt and unburnt areas, of the inter annual multitemporal backscattering signatures, the study presents two different approaches, one more qualitative, the other one more quantitative, for the retrieval of the biomass re-growth after the fire. In the quantitative case, the inversion procedure computes the biomass re-growth rate by means of simulations carried out with the Tor Vergata scattering model. The obtained results are satisfactory as they are in agreement with simultaneous analysis based on optical data and in-situ measurement campaigns. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Low relief oceanic islands often suffer from scarcity of freshwater resources. Remote sensing has proved to be an effective tool to generate valuable data for hydrological analysis and has improved the management of ecosystems and water. However, remotely sensed data are often tested over areas with existing validation databases and not always where the need is greatest. In this paper we address the need for topographical data to understand the hydrological system of Santa Cruz Island (Galapagos archipelago) so that management of freshwater ecosystems and resources can take place. No high resolution, high accuracy topographical data exist for Santa Cruz Island, and its growing population has created an urgent need for water resource management and protection of unique and pristine ecosystems.
   Inaccessible National Park land covers more than 97% of Galapagos territory, which makes the use of remote sensing methods indispensable. SRTM data was insufficient in terms of grid size (90 m) to carry out the needed data analysis. We used ASAR data (ENVISAT) in VV polarization image mode for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation, in order to extract drainage network, watersheds, and flow characteristics from a morpho-structural analysis.
   Results show the high potential of these data for both interferometric and radargrammetric generation methods. Although interferometry suffered from low coherence over highly vegetated areas, it showed high precision over the rest of the island. Radargrammetry gave consistent results over the entire island, and details were enhanced by integrating the 90 m SRTM data as an external DEM. Accuracy of the SRTM and the combined radargrammetric/SRTM DEM was similar, with the radargrammetric having a finer pixel-based resolution (20 m).
   Validation of the extracted drainage networks and watersheds was carried out using ground-based field observations and comparison to mapped river networks visually extracted from aerial photographs and high resolution (1 m) satellite imagery available on GoogleEarth(C). For the first time, watershed characteristics and flow paths were made available for an island of the Galapagos archipelago. Furthermore, the drainage network is shown to be strongly influenced by observed and extracted structural discontinuities. Having characterized freshwater flow, water balance calculations were carried out for Pelican Bay watershed, where urban areas, agricultural land and Galapagos National Park land are concomitant.

AB Relationships of plant species richness with spectral indices derived from airborne hyperspectral image data were evaluated for several habitat-types on Horn Island, Mississippi, northern Gulf of Mexico. A 126-band hyperspectral data cube of Horn Island acquired by the HyMap imaging system covered the 450-2500 nm spectrum at a 3 m Ground Sample Distance (GSD). Reflectance spectra were extracted from 5-11 HyMap pixels representing each of 95,15-m vegetation line transects that were established randomly on the island. In simple regressions, no index related to richness when data from all habitat-types were combined. a number of reflectance and spectral derivative indices related significantly (p <= 0.05) with richness However, when habitat-types were considered separately. Only those indices which passed a fidelity test based on the consistency of index response to changes in plant and environmental moisture were selected as potentially reliable indicators of richness. Transect coefficient of variation (CV) for R-1056/R-966 and R-920/R-834 related negatively with richness in meadows and transition zones, respectively. The CV of R-951/R-1100 and R-904 related negatively with woodland richness. Negative regression slopes, field observations and spectral mixtures indicated that richness in these habitats declined with increased bare soil exposure. In marsh habitat, positive relationships of richness with mean R-618/R-2475 or the CV of R-514/R-2459 were explained by the increasing presence and patchy distribution of broadleaved vegetation in the progression from wetter, low-richness sites to slightly-elevated, higher-richness sites. Present results combined with those of a previous grassland study suggested that remotely-sensed indicators of soil exposure may be generally useful in the assessment of plant species richness in mesic habitats.

In Amazonia non-floodable swampy forests call not be easily distinguished from non-floodable terra-firme forests using just bidimensional spectral data. accurate topographic data are required for the understanding of land Surface processes at finer scales, Topographic detail has now become available with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. This new digital elevation model (DEM) shows the feature-rich relief of lowland rain forests, adding to the ability to map rain forest environments through many quantitative terrain descriptors. In this paper we report oil the development of a new quantitative topographic algorithm, called HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), based oil SRTM-DEM data. We tested the HAND descriptor for a groundwater, topographic and vegetation dataset from central Amazonia. The application of the HAND descriptor in terrain classification revealed strong correlation between soil water conditions, like classes of water table depth, and topography. This correlation obeys the physical principle of soil draining potential, or relative vertical distance to drainage, which call be detected remotely through the topography of the vegetation canopy found in the SRTM-DEM data.

AB In the case of marine systems, monitoring seabird populations at sea require adequate, low cost protocols that maximize data resolution, accuracy and survey effort. This paper examines bias associated with pelagic aerial strip-transects, an easily designed and low cost survey method, to validate its use for monitoring and mapping seabird populations at sea at a very large scale. We used data collected on the entire seabird community between October 2001 and March 2002 in the Bay of Biscay (100000 km(2) on the French Atlantic coast, Northeast Atlantic) to determine whether aerial strip-transect seabird survey were subject to temporal (i.e. variations of detection probability during the survey) or distance (i.e. variations of detection probability across the strip) bias. To detect these biases, two seabird taxa were contrasted, the highly conspicuous northern gannet versus three cryptic species of auks pooled as one taxonomic group. We reported that the only temporal bias was attributable to sun glare. By contrast, distance bias did not occur in a strip of 150 m for both species, and the effect of distance up to 230 m was very weak. We conclude that visibility bias have a limited effect on pelagic aerial surveys for most seabird species. Particular attention should be paid to the constant record of sun glare, while altitude and speed can be fixed in a relatively wide range (140-180 m, 150-200 km/h) without affecting detection probability. Since distance bias did not occur across a 150 m strip, there is no need to add complexity to survey protocol by using line-transect method. This method takes distance effects into account but requires distance estimates between the bird and the transect line for every sightings. These estimates are usually easily collected in the case of marine mammals but become problematic in the case of flying animals such seabirds, sometimes encountered in very high density and aggregated into groups of several hundred individuals.

AB RCA-chlorophyll (red tide index chlorophyll algorithm - RCA) estimates from the SeaWiFS, sea surface height (SSH) variations/geostrophic currents from the multi-satellite altimeters, sea surface temperature (SST) from the NOAA-AVHRR, and wind speed/direction from the QuikSCAT are used in conjugation with field observation data to first describe comprehensively the occurrences of various hazardous algal blooms (HABs) and their underlying mechanisms and link to nutrient enrichment during the summer (June-September) in shelf-slope waters off the Northwest Pacific (NWP) covering China, Korea, Japan and Russia (perhaps this is the first satellite-based study in Russia). These datasets provide a coherent view of the summertime evolution of HABs and related physical processes in the above regional segments with four common dynamic regions: coastal cold/estuary water zones, upwelling zones next to the coast, repeated meanders/eddies, and frontal regimes induced by the Kuroshio and its tributaries. Summer HABs numerically dominated by dinoflagellates and diatoms (only in few cases) were initiated in these hydrodynamically active coastal regions and subsequently transported throughout their coastal and oceanic ranges by major currents and eddy systems. As a consequence, dense and colossal blooms displayed mean RCA of > 7 mg m(-3) and TBCA (total bloom covered area) of > 20 x 10(3) km(2), which limits the research vessels to observe concomitantly their spatially explicit phases together with physical oceanographic features in such large regions. Less dense and spatially disbanded blooms were characterized by mean RCA of < 3 mg m(-3) and TBCA of < 8 x 10(3) km(2). Besides those of the nutrient-abundant zones, high blooms coincided with the coastal upwelling and cyclonic eddy regimes that followed SST minimum and large negative SSH along with favorable phase of winds. By contrast, relatively low mean RCA were consistent with the fronts and anticyclonic meanders revealing moderate-high SSH fields along with variable winds blown off the NWP coast. These anticyclonic meanders, on some occasions, when nutrient-containing coastal water setoff higher chlorophyll biomass and major currents gained force in August, straddled the continental margin, entraining high chlorophyll water from the coast and from the adjacent cyclonic eddies (and upwelling) located nearby into their outer rings that formed a conveyer-belt system of transport to inject coastal blooms into the deep-sea (e.g., East Sea) region of the NWP. The above findings based on satellite data combined with field hydrographic/bloom observation data evidently illustrated richness of the response of summer HABs to the surface circulation and nutrient enrichment processes in shelf-slope waters off the NWP coast.

AB Remotely sensed images and processing techniques are a primary tool for mapping changes in tropical forest types important to biodiversity and environmental assessment. Detailed land cover data are lacking for most wet tropical areas that present special challenges for data collection. For this study, we utilize decision tree (DT) classifiers to map 32 land cover types of varying ecological and economic importance over an 8000 km 2 study area and biological corridor in Costa Rica. We assess multivariate QUEST DTs with unbiased classification rules and linear discriminant node models for integrated vegetation mapping and change detection. Predictor variables essential to accurate land cover classification were selected using importance indices statistically derived with classification trees. A set of 35 variables from SRTM-DEM terrain variables, WorldClim grids, and Landsat TM bands were assessed.
   Of the techniques examined, QUEST trees were most accurate by integrating a set of 12 spectral and geospatial predictor variables for image subsets with an overall cross-validation accuracy of 93%+/- 3.3%. Accuracy with spectral variables alone was low (69%+/- 3.3%). A random selection of training and test set pixels for the entire landscape yielded lower classification accuracy (81%) demonstrating a positive effect of image subsets on accuracy. A post-classification change comparison between 1986 and 2001 reveals that two lowland forest types of differing tree species composition are vulnerable to agricultural conversion. Tree plantations and successional vegetation added forest cover over the 15-year time period, but sometimes replaced native forest types, reducing floristic diversity. Decision tree classifiers, capable of combining data from multiple sources, are highly adaptable for mapping and monitoring land cover changes important to biodiversity and other ecosystem services in complex wet tropical environments.

AB A spatially explicit dataset of aboveground live forest biomass was made from ground measured inventory plots for the conterminous U.S., Alaska and Puerto Rico. The plot data are from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. To scale these plot data to maps, we developed models relating field-measured response variables to plot attributes serving as the. predictor variables. The plot attributes came from intersecting plot coordinates with geospatial datasets. Consequently, these models serve as mapping models. The geospatial predictor variables included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived image composites and percent tree cover; land cover proportions and other data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD); topographic variables; monthly and annual climate parameters; and other ancillary variables. We segmented the mapping models for the U.S. into 65 ecologically similar mapping zones, plus Alaska and Puerto Rico. First, we developed a forest mask by modeling the forest vs. nonforest assignment of field plots as functions of the predictor layers using classification trees in See5 (c). Secondly, forest biomass models were built within the predicted forest areas using tree-based algorithms in Cubist (c). To validate the models, we compared field-measured with model-predicted forest/nonforest classification and biomass from an independent test set, randomly selected from available plot data for each mapping zone. The estimated proportion of correctly classified pixels for the forest mask ranged from 0.79 in Puerto Rico to 0.94 in Alaska. For biomass, model correlation coefficients ranged from a high of 0.73 in the Pacific Northwest, to a low of 0.31 in the Southern region. There was a tendency in all regions for these models to over-predict areas of small biomass and under-predict areas of large biomass, not capturing the full range in variability. Map-based estimates of forest area and forest biomass compared well with traditional plot-based estimates for individual states and for four scales of spatial aggregation. Variable importance analyses revealed that MODIS-derived information could contribute more predictive power than other classes of information when used in isolation. However, the true contribution of each variable is confounded by high correlations. Consequently, excluding any one class of variables resulted in only small effects on overall map accuracy. An estimate of total C pools in live forest biomass of U.S. forests, derived from the nationwide biomass map, also compared well with previously published estimates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The goal of this study is to demonstrate the asset in using a Kalman filter to improve the spatial coherence and time consistency of surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo retrievals from moderate resolution sensor data sets. For this purpose, we use a simple surface model describing BRDF seasonal evolution for the land cover classes of the ECOCLIMAP database. The application of temporal composition windows used so far for BRDF retrieval is limited in regions characterized by a high frequency of cloud coverage, which induces a lot of gaps in the temporal series. Instead, the present method ensures a continuous production of surface BRDF parameters thanks to the Kalman filter recursive data processing. An application of the method is performed with SPOT/VEGETATION data over the western Africa equatorial region for the year 2003. Compared to presently available products from VEGETATION and MODIS instruments, this new approach allows to fill the gaps and improves the retrieved parameters time consistency. Another interesting possibility of the Kalman filter is the production of surface biophysical variables in quasi-real-time for applications that require a frequent update of the surface parameters.

AB Cloud detection from geostationary satellite multispectral images through statistical methodologies is investigated. Discriminant analysis methods are considered to this purpose, endowed with a nonparametric density estimation and a linear transform into principal and independent components. The whole methodology is applied to the MSG-SEVIRI sensor through a set of test images covering the central and southern part of Europe. "Truth" data for the learning phase of discriminant analysis are taken from the cloud mask product MOD35 in correspondence of passages of MODIS close to the SEVIRI images. Performance of the discriminant analysis methods is estimated over sea/land, daytime/nighttime both when training and test datasets coincide and when they are different. Discriminant analysis shows very good performance in detecting clouds, especially over land. PCA and ICA are effective in improving detection. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the last few years, encouraging results using radiative transfer model inversion techniques were obtained for land biophysical variables retrieval. However, the inversion of radiative transfer models is a severely ill-posed problem that may lead to significant uncertainties in the biophysical variables estimates. Improvement of performances of the inversion process requires more information to be exploited including better radiative transfer models, exploitation of proper prior information on the distribution of canopy and atmosphere variables, knowledge of uncertainties in satellite measurements, as well as possible spatial and temporal constraints. In this study we focus on the use of coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transfer models (SMAC+SAIL+PROSPECT) to estimate some key biophysical variables from top of atmosphere canopy reflectance data. The inversion is achieved over an ensemble of pixels belonging to a spatial window where aerosol properties are supposed to be constant, and over a temporal window of few days where vegetation state is assumed not to vary. The ensemble inversion scheme accounting for the spatial and temporal constraints is described. Top of atmosphere reflectance observations are simulated for 13 bands within the visible and near infrared domains. The coupled model is inverted with a variational method implementation dedicated to solve very large inverse problems. It is based on the use of the adjoint model and a Quasi-Newton optimisation technique with BFGS update.
   The multitemporal-patch inversion approach exploiting the spatial and temporal constraints is compared to the classical instantaneous-local inversion applied on single pixel and date. The 'ensemble' approach shows significant performance improvements when retrieving aerosol optical thickness T-550 and some canopy characteristics (LAI, LAI x C-ab and ALA). Conclusions are drawn on the interest of such approaches, and perspectives are given, with due attention to their applicability within operational algorithms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Reliable information about the geographic distribution and abundance of major plant functional types (PFTs) around the world is increasingly needed for global change research. Using remote sensing techniques to map PFTs is a relatively recent field of research. This paper presents a method to map PFTs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a multisource evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm. The method first utilizes a suite of improved and standard MODIS products to generate evidence measures for each PFT class. The multiple lines of evidence computed from input data are then combined using Dempster's Rule of combination. Finally, a decision rule based on maximum support is used to make classification decisions. The proposed method was tested over the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and North Dakota, USA where crops dominate. The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture were employed to validate our new PFT maps and the current MODIS PFT product. Our preliminary results suggest that multisource data fusion is a promising approach to improve the mapping of PFTs. For several major PFT classes such as crop, trees, and grass and shrub, the PFT maps generated with the ER method provide greater spatial details compared to the MODIS PFT. The overall accuracies increased for all the four states, with the biggest improvement occurring in Iowa from 5 1 % (MODIS) to 64% (ER). The overall kappa statistic also increased for all the four states, with the biggest improvement occurring in Iowa from 0.03 (MODIS) to 0.38 (ER). The paper concludes with a discussion of several methodological issues pertaining to the further improvement of the ER approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

AB Uncertainties in the length of active faults and the styles of deformation often hamper the evaluation of seismic potentials in a region. in the area near Chiayi City of southwestern Taiwan, where historically there have been many strong earthquakes, complex fault and fold systems produced by regional tectonic forces and the subsequent deformation are frequently obscured by vegetation and anthropogenic effects; and therefore detailed deformation information has not been available for evaluation of the seismic potential. By stacking the results from Differential Interferometry and removing the ambiguity of interferograms using GPS data, we were able to retrieve surface deformation information about the area under consideration near Chiayi City. In our results, we found that the Meishan fault to the north of Chiayi City extended 10 kin to the west of its currently documented area and served as a geological boundary separating the northern part, where sediments were thicker, from the southern part of the westward extension of the Meishan fault. Chiayi City was under active deformation by a double plunging fold with vertical uplift rate at approximately 1 cm/yr. Frequent seismicity and active deformation allowed the tectonic stress to permute between strike-slip and thrust in this area. Continuous folding of Chiayi City and episodic large earthquakes along the Meishan Fault posed a serious threat of seismic hazards in this region, and called for continuous monitoring of the area.

AB Five years of data from 1998 to 2002 of TRMM-3B42 version 5 (V5), 3B43 V5, 3B42 version 6 (W), 3B43 V6, and the Bangladesh Meteorological Department rain-gauge network were analyzed to understand the climatic characteristics of rainfall over Bangladesh. TRMM-PR 2A25 data were used to obtain the precipitation field of the convection events. Daily rainfall measured by TRMM V5 31342 was compared to that of rain-gauge values from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon months (March-November). The time sequence patterns of the daily rainfall determined by the V5 3B42 and those from rain gauges were remarkably similar. The spatial and temporal averages of rainfall revealed good estimations of rainfall: during March to November, the V5 3B42- and rain gauge-estimated daily rainfall was 8.12 and 8.34 mm, respectively. In annual scale, TRMM V5 3B42-, V5 3B43-, V6 3B42-, V6 3B43- and rain-gauge estimated rainfall was 6.9, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8 and 7.1 mm/day, respectively. The average percentage of rainy days determined by V5 3B42 data with respect to the rain-gauge value was 96%. TRMM is useful for estimating the average values of rainfall in Bangladesh. The prominent difference between rainfall estimated by rain-gauge and V5 3B42 was found to be period- and location-dependent. The V5 3B42 overestimated the rainfall during the pre-monsoon period and in dry regions but underestimated it during the monsoon period and in wet regions. The reason for the differences according to season and locations is considered to be the vertical cross section of convection obtained by TRMM-PR 2A25 data. The rainfall overestimation in pre-monsoon and underestimation in monsoon period measured by V5 3B42 is reduced to reasonable amount by V6 3B42 and V6 3B43. In this manner, the merit of using TRMM data for climatological studies of rainfall over Bangladesh is shown. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB ASTER stereo and ASTER infrared (IR) retrieved cloud top heights (CTHs) at 90 m spatial resolution are compared to operational Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) stereo and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal IR techniques at I 100 m and 5000 m spatial resolution, respectively. ASTER data availability limits this study to trade wind cumulus clouds only. ASTER IR, MISR stereo and MODIS IR cloud height frequency distributions were derived for 41 trade wind cumulus cloud scenes with no cirrus contamination. All three retrievals produce a bimodal CTH distribution with maxima at 650 and 1500 m.
   Several scenes are investigated in further details utilizing the ASTER stereo heights. The ASTER stereo-derived CTH frequency distribution is also bimodal and coincides best with a surface-based ceilometer-derived cloud base height distribution, in the sense that it produces the fewest CTH retrievals below the typical lidar-observed cloud base height. Sensitivity to spatial resolution was investigated by degrading ASTER stereo and IR CTH retrievals to the MISR spatial resolution, and also by deriving ASTER stereo heights from degraded radiances. The degraded ASTER stereo CTH retrievals remain bimodal, but showed less high clouds and more lower clouds, whereas the ASTER stereo heights from degraded radiances lose the bimodal structure similarly to the ASTER degraded resolution IR technique.
   Overall, the stereo technique appears more suitable for retrieving CTH for trade wind cumulus clouds than IR techniques, because it shows less sensitivity to resolution. With either technique CTHs should be produced at the high spatial resolution (finer than 1 km) and with subsampling preferred over spatial averaging, if necessary. Nonetheless, even at a spatial resolution of 1 km (which often exceeds the horizontal size of many trade wind cumulus clouds) both stereo and IR techniques reflect the CTH bimodality characterizing the scenes we studied.

AB The variability of snowmelt dates is important for the terrestrial carbon balance in boreal and subarctic environments. Scatterometers such as the K-u-Band QuikScat have been proven applicable for the detection of surface thaw. We present an improved method for the capture of thaw events based on significance of diurnal differences with respect to long term noise. For each 10 km x 10 km grid point two products are derived for the major thaw period: 1) the onset of thaw and 2) the end of daily freeze/thaw cycles at the surface. Both dates may be related to biogeochemical processes, especially carbon fluxes in boreal forests. The onset of the spring thaw period coincides with the first days of increased CO2 fluxes above the late winter baseline. The end of daily freeze/thaw cycles corresponds to the switch from source to sink in evergreen boreal forest environments as illustrated by comparison with eddy-flux tower data and xylem sap flow records from other investigators.
   The approach is suitable for detecting freeze/thaw cycle periods in boreal forest and tundra biomes. The mean absolute difference in end of freeze/thaw cycling date within the central Siberian study area (3 Mio km(2) comprising tundra, boreal forest and steppe grassland) was 9 days for 2000 to 2004. Largest mean differences occurred in the southern taiga and all tundra regions, which were highest for spring 2000.
   The improved extraction method delivers more precise products from the viewpoint of carbon accounting in evergreen boreal forest environments. This widens the application potential of scatterometer data beyond the current status. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Reliable monitoring of seasonality in the forest canopy leaf area index (LAI) in Siberian forests is required to advance the understanding of climate-forest interactions under global environmental change and to develop a forest phenology model within ecosystem modeling. Here, we compare multisatellite (AVHRR, MODIS, and SPOT/VEGETATION) reflectance, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and LAI with aircraft-based spectral reflectance data and field-measured forest data acquired from April to June in 2000 in a larch forest near Yakutsk, Russia. Field data in a 30 x 30-m study site and aircraft data observed around the field site were used. Larch is a dominant forest type in eastern Siberia, but comparison studies that consider multi-satellite data, aircraft-based reflectance, and field-based measurement data are rarely conducted. Three-dimensional canopy radiative transfer calculations, which are based on Antyufeev and Marshak's [Antyufeev, VS., & Marshak, AL. (1990). Monte Carlo method and transport equation in plant canopies, Remote Sensing of Environment, 31, 183-19 1] Monte Carlo photon transport method combined with North's [North, P.R. (1996). Three-dimensional forest light interaction model using a Monte Carlo method, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 34(4), 946-956] geometric-optical hybrid forest canopy scene, helped elucidate the relationship between canopy reflectance and forest structural parameters, including several forest floor conditions. Aircraft-based spectral measurements and the spectral response functions of all satellite sensors confirmed that biases in reflectance seasonality caused by differences in spectral response functions among sensors were small. However, some reflectance biases occur among the near infrared (NIR) reflectance data from satellite products; these biases were potentially caused by absolute calibration errors or cloud/cloud shadow contamination. In addition, reflectance seasonality in AVHRR-based NIR data was very small compared to other datasets, which was partially due to the spring-to-summer increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor. Radiative transfer simulations suggest that bi-directional reflectance effects were small for the study site and observation period; however, changes in tree density and forest floor conditions affect the absolute value of NIR reflectance, even if the canopy leaf area condition does not change. Reliable monitoring of canopy LAI is achieved by minimizing these effects through the use of NIR reflectance difference, i.e., the difference in reflectance on the observation day from the reflectance on a snow-free/pre-foliation day. This may yield useful and robust parameters for multi-satellite monitoring of the larch canopy LAI with less error from intersensor biases and forest structure/floor differences. Further validation with field data and combined use of other index (e.g. normalized difference water index, NDWI) data will enable an extension of these findings to all Siberian deciduous forests.

AB For High Arctic ecosystems, snow is one of the most important climatic factors-affecting both length of the growing season, and primary plant production. To perform a retrospective analysis of inter-annual variability in snow distribution/amount and vegetative activity in a High Arctic ecosystem, these factors were investigated for the Zackenberg valley at 74.5 degrees N, 21 degrees.0W in Northeast Greenland. The analysis was based on recently introduced techniques that utilize Conventional- and Multispectral Digital Camera Images combined with Landsat TM/ETM+ and SPOT HRV satellite data. Since 1998 (and since 2002 multispectral) digital cameras have been installed on the Zackenberg mountain 500 in above the valley floor taking daily images of the valley automatically. The images taken by the cameras were transformed into digital orthophotos, which were then used to analyze snow cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The snow cover and NDVI data were used to develop models to calculate end-of-winter snow accumulation, snow-cover-depletion, and net vegetative activity in 16 different melting (growing) seasons (1988-2004). At Zackenberg the end-of-winter snow accumulation shows significant inter-annual variability, whereas the end-of-winter snow cover distribution remains similar from year to year. A comparison between snow cover and NDVI distribution reveals that vegetative vigor in the Zackenberg area primarily is linked to the initiation time of the snow-free period rather than temperature. This indicates that in some Arctic regions increases in winter (snow)-precipitation might be as or even more crucial for the ecosystem, than the increased temperatures projected by the majority of General Circulation Models (GCMs).

AB This paper describes an infrared image simulator for remote sensing applications, called OSIrIS (outdoor scene and infrared image simulation). It has been developed partly for training and reproduces with great details the physical phenomena that play a major role in complex urban environment. OSIrIS performs a synthesis of scene based on a 3-D description of the landscape with a high spatial resolution (0.5-10 m). The physical processes are briefly described and their importance with respect to the objectives are discussed. Thermal emission depends on temperature and generally dominates the signal. Temperature is governed by heat equation and is solved by the means of boundary conditions such as in-depth temperature and flux balance at surface. Main parameters are solar and atmospheric radiations, wind, heat conduction and changes in humidity. An innovative approach was developed to take into account variations in time of the interactions between the landscape and the physical processes. OSIrIS aims at simulating situations that are encountered in reality. It enables users self-formation, helping them understanding changes in image radiance as a function of the input parameters and their own simulation requirements. Examples are given that illustrate specific aspects of infrared images. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eastern Europe has experienced drastic changes in political and economic conditions following the breakdown of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, these changes often differ among neighboring countries. This offers unique possibilities to assess the relative importance of broadscale political and socioeconomic factors on land cover and landscape pattern. Our question was how much land cover differed in the Polish, the Slovak, and the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains and to what extent these differences can be related to dissimilarities in societal, economic, and political conditions. We used a hybrid classification technique, combining advantages from supervised and unsupervised methods, to derive a land cover map from three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images from 2000. Results showed marked differences in land cover between the three countries. Forest cover and composition was different for the three countries, for example Slovakia and Poland had about 20% more forest cover at higher elevations than Ukraine. Broadleaved forest dominated in Slovakia while high percentages of conifers were found in Poland and Ukraine. Agriculture was most abundant in Slovakia where the lowest level of agricultural fragmentation was found (22% core area compared to less than 5% in Poland and Ukraine). Post-socialist land change was greatest in Ukraine, were we found high agricultural fragmentation and widespread early-successional shrublands indicating extensive land abandonment. Concerning forests, differences can largely be explained by socialist forest management. The abundance and pattern of arable land and grassland can be explained by two factors: land tenure in socialist times and economic transition since 100. These results suggest that broad-scale socioeconomic and political factors are of major significance for land cover patterns in Eastern Europe, and possibly elsewhere. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leaf phenology of tropical evergreen forests affects carbon and water fluxes. In an earlier study of a seasonally moist evergreen tropical forest site in the Amazon basin, time series data of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the VEGETATION and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors showed an unexpected seasonal pattern, with higher EVI in the late dry season than in the wet season. In this study we conducted a regionat-scale analysis of tropical evergreen forests in South America, using time series data of EVI from MODIS in 2002. The results show a large dynamic range and spatial variations of annual maximum EVI for evergreen forest canopies in the region. In tropical evergreen forests, maximum EVI in 2002 typically occurs during the late dry season to early wet season. This suggests that leaf phenology in tropical evergreen forests is not determined by the seasonality of precipitation. Instead, leaf phenological process may be driven by availability of solar radiation and/or avoidance of herbivory. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the utility of the 970 nm water band index (WBI) in estimating evapotranspiration and vegetation water status for a semiarid shrubland ecosystem. Between 2001 and 2003, spectral reflectance coupled with CO2 and water flux data were collected at Sky Oaks Biological Field Station, a chaparral-dominated ecosystem in southern California, and one of the sites within the SpecNet network. The reflectance data were collected either by walking along a 100 m transect or by using a semi-automated tram system installed later at the site along the same 100 m transect. CO2 and water flux data were gathered with an eddy covariance flux tower adjacent to the tram system. The 970 nm WBI and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were derived from the spectral reflectance. The two indices were expressed both as points approximately a meter apart along the transect and as whole-transect averages, where all of the reflectance values along the transect were averaged together, simulating a large pixel. This study encompassed a wet year with normal precipitation (2001), a 100-year record drought (2002), and a recovery year (2003), allowing for comparison over time and between precipitation regimes. Species-specific responses to wet and dry periods were evident in the reflectance spectra, providing a basis for separating species based on their optical properties. The WBI was significantly correlated with the NDVI revealing a strong link between canopy water content and green canopy structure; however this relationship varied with species and water status, providing evidence for the independence of these two optical indices. The WBI was also strongly linked to surface-atmosphere fluxes, explaining 49% of the variance in the water vapor flux, and 24% of the carbon dioxide fluxes. These results suggest that WBI or other similar water status indices may be useful variables in modeling CO2 and water fluxes when combined with other physiological, environmental, and atmospheric factors.

AB After leaves are clipped their reflectance properties change over time at variable rates. Spectral change can in part be attributed to the changing water content of the leaf, which affects absorption in the VIS, NIR and the SWIR. Maintaining water volume within samples has been the motivation behind many leaf handling techniques. This study has assessed the time constraints between leaf collection and spectral measurement. Specifically the relationship between leaf water content and foliar spectra (350-2500 nm) was examined over time for five tropical trees (common guava (Psidium guajava), purple guava (Psidium littorale), weeping fig (Ficus benjamina), floss silk (Chorisia speciosa), and coffee (Coffea arabica)). This investigation was carried for leaves wrapped with moist gauze around their petiole (treatment leaves) and leaves with no treatment. Spectral measurements and mass measurements were repeated for each leaf once every hour for the first 12 h, then every 4-6 h for 18 h, followed by one measurement after 12 h, and finally once a day until the control samples became air-dry. Foliar reflectance in the visible spectrum was not immediately responsive to water content changes and did not change until wilting of the leaf was observed. The NIR and SWIR wavelength regions were affected immediately by small changes in water content. Thus, by the time wilting was first observed the NIR and SWIR foliar reflectance differed considerably from corresponding fresh leaf reflectance. No common time limit could be observed for leaf clipping and reflectance measurement. Leaves have a variety of water contents and dehydration rates hence measurement time constraints are dependent on the properties of the leaf or species. Rather than using a time limit it is recommended that leaf handling techniques be based upon managing leaf water content and leaf structure. The results of this study indicate that leaves with petioles wrapped in moist paper towel and placed within plastic bags will maintain leaf reflectance longer than equivalent leaves without treatment; samples tested here lasted a minimum of 7 days. theta and D indices ("angle difference" and "root mean square difference", respectively) revealed a stronger relationship between leaf water content and spectral shape than between leaf water and raw reflectance magnitude. The ratio of 1187/1096 nm, when compared with theta and D indices and individual reflectance bands, showed the highest coefficient of determination with leaf water content (r(2)=0.952).

AB The boreal forest biome is one of the largest on Earth, covering more than 14% of the total land surface. Fire disturbance plays a dominant role in boreal ecosystems, altering forest succession, biogeochemical cycling, and carbon sequestration. We used two time-series data sets of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery for North America to analyze vegetation recovery after fire. The Canadian Forest Service Large Fire Database was used to identify the location of fires and calculate scaled NDVI statistics from the Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) and the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) AVHRR data sets. Unburned areas were also identified, based on interannual variability metrics, in order to reduce the effects of factors other than fire on the temporal behavior of scaled NDVI. Burned and unburned areas were stratified by ecoregion to ensure the presence of comparable land cover types and account for influences of local environmental variability. Temporal anomalies in NDVI for burned and unburned areas show the impacts of fire and the recovery of the forest to pre-burn levels, and indicate changes in variability that might be associated with vegetation compositional changes consistent with early successional species. The rate of recovery varied in the three episodic fire years on which we focused our analysis (1981, 1989, and 1995), but were consistently shorter than previous studies that emphasized the most impacted areas within fires. Temporal variability in the time series, represented by the difference of burned and unburned area anomalies, increased beyond the observed post-fire recovery period. This indicates residual effects of fire disturbance over the regrowth period, perhaps associated with early successional vegetation and increased susceptibility to drought. Distinct differences were noted between the PAL and GIMMS data sets, with evidence for systematic data processing artifacts remaining in the PAL time series. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Stream temperature is an important indicator of water quality, particularly in regions where endangered fish populations are sensitive to elevated water temperature. Regional assessment of stream temperatures from the ground is limited by sparse sampling in both space and time. Remotely sensed thermal-infrared (TIR) images are able to make spatially distributed measurements of the radiant skin temperature of streams. We quantify and discuss the accuracy and uncertainty limits to recovering stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest for a range of stream widths (10-500 m), and TIR pixel sizes (5-1000 m) from remotely sensed airborne and satellite TIR images. Among locations with more than three pixels across the stream, the image temperature overestimated the in-stream temperature on average by 1.2 degrees C, which is 7% of the in-stream temperature (standard error (SE) of 0.2 degrees C, n = 21). The corresponding uncertainty (band weighted standard deviation in image temperature) for these locations averaged 0.3 degrees C (SE < 0.1 degrees C, n=21) which is 2% of in-stream temperatures. This overestimation by the image temperatures is likely to be due to thermal stratification between the stream surface and the location of the in-stream temperature measurements deeper in the water column. For streams with one to three pixels across, mixing with bank elements increased the overestimation by image temperatures to 2.2 degrees C (SE=0.3 degrees C, n=23) on average (13% of in-stream temperatures), and the uncertainty increased to +/- 0.4 degrees C (SE=0.1 degrees C, n=23) which is 2% of in-stream temperatures. For a fraction of a pixel across the stream the overestimation by image temperatures was 7.6 degrees C (SE= 1.2 degrees C, n =23) on average (45% of in-stream temperatures), and the uncertainty was +/- 0.5 degrees C (SE=0.1 degrees C, n=23) which is 3% of in-stream temperatures. These results show that reliable satellite TIR measurement of stream temperatures is limited to large rivers (similar to 180-m across for Landsat ETM+), unless novel unmixing algorithms are used effectively.

AB Despite the large number of in situ, plot-level phenological measurements and satellite-derived phenological studies, there has been little success to date in merging these records temporally or spatially. In this research, we bridge this scale gap through higher resolution satellite records (Landsat) and quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived metrics with direct field measurements. We compiled fifty-seven Landsat scenes from southern New England (P12 R51) from 1984 to 2002. Green vegetation areal abundance for each scene was derived from spectral mixture analysis and a single set of endmembers. The leaf area signal was fit with a logistic-growth simulating sigmoid curve to derive phenological markers (half-maximum leaf-onset and offset). Spring leaf-onset dates in homogenous stands of deciduous forests displayed significant and persistent local variability. The local variability was validated with multiple springtime ground observations (r(2)=0.91). The highest degree of verified small-scale variation occurred where contiguous forests displayed leaf-onset gradients of 10-14 days over short distances (< 500 m). These dramatic gradients occur in of low-relief (< 40 m) upland regions. The patterns suggest that microclimates resulting from springtime cold-air drainage may be influential in governing the start of leaf growth; every 4.16 m loss in elevation delayed spring leaf onset by 1 day. These microclimates may be of crucial importance in interpreting in situ records and interpolating phenology from satellite data. Regional patterns from the Landsat analyses suggest topographic, coastal, and land-use controls on phenology. Our results indicate that deciduous forests in the Providence, RI metropolitan area leaf out 5-7 days earlier than comparable rural areas. The platform-independent curve-fit methodology may be extended across platforms and field data. The methodologically consistent approach, in tandem with Landsat data, allows an effective scaling from plot to satellite phenological observations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical airborne remote-sensing relationships were examined to estimate chlorophyll a concentration in the first optical depth (chl(FOD)) Of coastal waters of Afgonak/Kodiak Islands during July-August 2002. Band-ratio and spectral-curvature models were tested using satellite remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) measurements. Additional shipboard and airborne R-rs(lambda) data were also analysed to evaluate consistency of proposed chl(FOD)-R-rs(lambda) relationships. Validation of chlorophyll algorithms was performed using data collected in the northern-part of the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea during 1996, 2002, and 2003 cruises. Likewise, oceanographic conditions during the surveys were typified to interpret variability of chl(FOD) fields. The SeaWiFS band-ratio algorithm OC2d was the most sensitive R-rs combination (R-rs(509)/R-rs(553)) to detect chl(FOD) variability. Conversely, OC2a (R-rs(412)/R-rs(553)) had the lowest performance to derive chl(FOD) values. No valid statistical regressions were established for spectral-curvature relationships in the blue spectrum (<500 nm). Fertile waters (>5 mg m(-3)) Were preferentially located over shallow banks (similar to 50 m) and at the entrance of the bays. The approach used in this study to derive chl(FOD) values could be universal for Alaskan coastal waters. However, chl(FOD)-R-rs(lambda) relationships must be calibrated locally for a given season.

AB Natural hazards like landslides, avalanches, floods and debris flows can result in enormous property damage and human casualties in mountainous regions. Switzerland has always been exposed to a wide variety of natural hazards mostly located in its alpine valleys. Recent natural disasters comprising avalanches, floods, debris flows and slope instabilities led to substantial loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure, cultural heritage and environment. In order to offer a solid technical infrastructure, a new concept and expert-tool based on an integrated web-based database/GIS structure is being developed under HazNETH. Given the HazNETH database design contemplates the detection and mapping of diagnostic features from remote sensors (e.g., ground, air and space borne) this paper analyses the use of remote sensing data in landslides studies during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including a discussion of its potential and research challenges as result of new operational and forthcoming technologies such as the very high spatial resolution optical and infrared imagery of Ikonos, Quickbird, IRS CartoSat-1, ALOS, the satellite based interferometric SAR (InSAR and DInSAR of Radarsat, ERS, Envisat, TerraSAR-X, Cosmo/SkyMed, ALOS), micro-satellites like the Pleiades, DMC, RapidEye, airborne LASER altimetry or ground-based differential interferometric SAR. The use of remote sensing data, whether air-, satellite- or ground-based varies according to three main stages of a landslide related study, namely a) detection and identification; b) monitoring; c) spatial analysis and hazard prediction. Accordingly, this paper presents and discusses previous applications of remote sensing tools as related to these three main phases, proposing a conceptual framework for the contribution of remote sensing to the design of databases for natural hazards like debris flows, and identifying areas for further research.

AB This study intercompared the performance of eight band-ratio chlorophyll-a algorithms which together can be used to process measurements from the ocean colour satellite sensors CZCS, OCTS, SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, and GLI. The study area included Subtropical, Subtropical Front and Subantarctic waters cast of New Zealand, and Case I waters of the New Zealand northeast continental shelf Over 170 co-incident measurements of spectral normalised water-leaving radiance and near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a were made on nine research voyages between 1998 and 2000. The studentised bootstrap method was used to identify statistically significant bias in algorithm products relative to in situ measurements. The band-ratio algorithms used by CZCS, OCTS and SeaWiFS missions systematically underestimated chlorophyll-a concentration in the offshore regions by between 21% and 45%, but showed no systematic bias in the continental shelf waters. The band-ratio algorithms applicable to the MODIS and MERIS sensors had no clear bias with respect to in situ measurements in offshore waters, but had a positive bias of 20% over the continental shelf The proposed GLI band-ratio algorithm led to estimates that were negatively biased with respect to in situ measurement offshore (- 30%), and positively biased over the continental shelf (20%). The results were consistent with unusually high values of absorption in the blue part of the spectrum (443-490 nm) compared to the green part (similar to 550 nm) by phytoplankton pigments in the offshore waters, and high chlorophyll-specific absorption over the continental shelf.

AB This paper assessed the use of optical and SAR imagery for crop identification in an operational context with a particular emphasis on actual crop diversity and information delivery time. Fifteen ERS and Radarsat and 3 optical images were used to discriminate agricultural crop types based on dedicated per-parcel classification and photo interpretation schemes. For crop area control, the efficiency concept was introduced as a complementary indicator of classification performance. A set of 6571 parcels were classified into 39 crop types from various combinations of images. The efficiency computed from an independent set of 899 parcels peaked based on a combination of optical images and 3 to 5 SAR images. Moreover, the delivery time of the relevant information was improved when SAR data was included. The hierarchical classification strategy based on nested classifications also improved the operational crop control system for all image combinations. Finally, this research documented the respective contributions of optical and SAR time series for any control system of agricultural land. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an original methodology to retrieve surface soil moisture based on the use of the ENVISAT-ASAR multi-incidence angle sensor. Previous studies using ERS and RADARSAT SAR have shown the potential of radar signals to monitor surface soil moisture with one incidence-angle data and a simple linear relationship. This work aims at developing this linear approach to estimate mean soil surface moisture of a small watershed using ASAR multi-incidence angle data.
   A method of normalisation of all radar data acquired at different incidence angles is first described. Secondly, the effects of roughness and soil texture on the linear relationship between moisture and radar signals are discussed. Finally, the proposed methodology to reduce these effects is developed. The validation of our approach is based on eight experimental campaigns with different ASAR incidence angles, and different surface moisture conditions. The processed radar signal shows a linear relationship with the mean measured soil surface moisture, with very high correlation (R-2 = 0.97) and a slope of 0.28. These results illustrate the high potential of the developed approach and ENVISATASAR to monitor surface moisture. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use airborne lidar data for the summit area of Kilauea Caldera, Hawaii, to explore the utility of topographic data collected by the TOPSAR airborne interferometric radar for volcanology studies. The lidar data are processed to a spatial resolution of 1 m/pixel, compared to TOPSAR with a spatial resolution of 5 m. Over a variety of fresh volcanic surfaces (pahoehoe and aa lava flows, ash falls and fluvial fans), TOPSAR data are shown to have a typical vertical offset compared to the lidar data of no more than similar to 2 - 3 m. Larger differences between the two data sets and TOPSAR data drop-outs are found to be concentrated around steep scarps such as the walls of pit craters and ground cracks associated with the Southwest Rift Zone. A comparison of these two data sets is used to explore the utility of TOPSAR to interpret the topography of volcanic features close to the spatial resolution of TOPSAR, such as spatter ramparts, fractures, a perched lava flow, and eroded ash deposits. Comparison of the TOPSAR elevation and the lidar first-return minus the return from the ground surface (the so-called "bald Earth" data) for vegetated areas reveals TOPSAR penetration into the tree canopy is typically at least 10% and no more than similar to 50%, although a wide range of penetration values from 0% to 90% has been identified. Our results are significant because they show that TOPSAR data for volcanoes can reliably be used to measure regional slopes and the thickness of lava flows, and have value for the validation of coarser spatial resolution digital elevation data (such as SRTM) in areas where lidar data have not been collected.

AB Many fundamental ecosystem properties and dynamics are determined by plant water stress, particularly in dryland ecosystems where water is usually limiting. Indeed, under severe drought, plant water stress and associated insect infestations can produce landscape-scale mortality. Despite the fundamental importance of plant water stress in determining properties and dynamics at ecosystem and landscape scales, approaches for remotely sensing plant water stress are largely lacking. particularly for conifers, We evaluated the remotely sensed detection of foliar drought stress in two conifer species, Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma, which are co-dominants of extensive jumper woodlands in North America, the first of which experienced extensive mortality in association with a recent drought, Needle spectra were made on these species in the field using an integrating sphere and pot-table spectrometer, Two indices of foliar water condition, plant water content (% of dry mass) and plant water potential, were compared to five spectral analyses: Continuum removal of the 970 and 1200 nm water absorption features, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the red edge wavelength position. For P edulis, plant water content was significantly correlated with four of the five indices: NDVI (R-2=0.71) and NDWI (R-2=0.68) which exhibited stronger relationships than 970 nm continuum removal (R-2=0.57) or red edge position (R-2=0.45). All Five indices were significantly correlated with P edulis water content when trees undergoing mortality Were included in analyses (R-2=0.60 0.93), Although the correlations were weaker than for plant water content, plant water potential was significantly correlated with NDWI (R-2=0.49), 970 nm (R-2=0.44), NDVI (R-2=0.35), and red edge (R-2=0.34); again all five indices had significant relationships when trees undergoing mortality were included (R-2=0.51-0.86). The relationships were weaker for J. monosperma: water content was significantly related to 970 nm (R-2=0.50) and 1200 nm (R-2=0.37) continuums; and NDVI (R-2=0.33), while water potential was related only to 1200 nm (R-2=0.40). Our results demonstrate a critical link between plant physiological characteristics tied to water stress and associated spectral signatures for two extensive co-occurring conifer species.

ID OCEAN COLOR; COASTAL; MODEL
AB An algorithm is derived to retrieve the concentration of optically active materials, e.g., phytoplankton pigments, etc., from remotely measured spectra of up welled oceanic light. The algorithm takes into account sensor noise in deriving equations for the best linear estimate of concentration mean and residual variance. The algorithm is applied to the problem of phytoplankton concentration retrieval using a modeled hyperspectral sensor based roughly on the LASH imager. The algorithm requires knowing the joint distribution of radiance spectra and concentration. This joint distribution is obtained by simulation using ocean radiance models. It is shown that sensor noise (both shot and dark current) markedly decreases the accuracy of concentration retrieval. However, accuracy is greatly improved if a priori information about observation conditions is known and included in the algorithm. Thus accounting for sensor noise improves retrieval accuracy and affects the choice of observation method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-pixel level classification is essential for the successful description of many land cover patterns with spatial resolution of less than similar to1 km and has been widely used in global or continental scale land cover mapping with remote sensing data. This paper presents a general comparison of four non-linear models for sub-pixel classification: ARTMAP. ART-MMAP. Regression Tree (RT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm. The comparison is based oil four factors: accuracy. model complexity, interpolation ability and error distribution. Two data sets, one simulated and one real world MODIS satellite image. were used to demonstrate the characteristics of each model. Experimental results show the superior performance of MLP with the simulated data set and better performance of ART-MMAP with the MODIS data set. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A CO2 eddy flux tower study has recently reported that an old-growth stand of seasonally moist tropical evergreen forest in Santarem, Brazil, maintained high gross primary production (GPP) during the dry seasons [Saleska, S. R., Miller, S. D., Matross, D. M., Goulden, M. L., Wofsy. S. C., da Rocha, H. R., de Camargo, P. B., Crill, P., Daube, B. C., de Freitas, H. C., Hutyra, L., Keller, M., Kirchhoff, V., Menton, M., Munger, J. W., Pyle, E. H., Rice, A. H., & Silva, H. (2003). Carbon in amazon forests: Unexpected seasonal fluxes and disturbance-induced losses. Science, 302, 1554-1557]. It was proposed that seasonally moist tropical evergreen forests have evolved two adaptive mechanisms in an environment with strong seasonal variations of light and water: deep roots system for access to water in deep soils and leaf phenology for access to light. Identifying tropical forests with these adaptive mechanisms could substantially improve our capacity of modeling the seasonal dynamics of carbon and water fluxes in the tropical zone. In this paper, we have analyzed multi-year satellite images from the VEGETATION (VGT) sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite (4/1998-12/2002) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite (2000-2003). We reported temporal analyses of vegetation indices and simulations of the satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) identified subtle changes in the seasonal dynamics of leaf phenology (leaf emergence, leaf aging and leaf fall) in the forest, as suggested by the leaf litterfall data. The land surface water index (LSWI) indicated that the forest experienced no water stress in the dry seasons of 1998-2002. The VPM model, which uses EVI, LSWI and site-specific climate data (air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) for 2001-2002, predicted high GPP in the late dry seasons, consistent with observed high evapotranspiration and estimated GPP from the CO2 eddy flux tower.

AB The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data set was compared to comprehensive archives of in situ chlorophyll data from NASA and NOAA. The global comparison indicated a root mean square (RMS) log error of 31%, with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.76, using 4168 data points where in situ and SeaWiFS data were coincident and collocated. RMS log error for open ocean (defined as bottom depth>200 in) was 27.7% with r(2) = 0.72, compared to 33% RMS log error and r(2) = 0.60 on the coasts, indicating a deterioration of quality of the SeaWiFS data set in coastal regions. All of the Pacific oceanographic basins generally showed very good agreement with SeaWiFS, as did the South Atlantic basin. However, poorer agreement was found in the Mediterranean/Black Seas, Equatorial Atlantic, and the Antarctic. Optical complexity arising from riverine inputs, Saharan dust, and anomalous oceanic constituents contributed to the differences observed in the Atlantic, where an overestimation by SeaWiFS occurred. The Antarctic indicated a pronounced negative bias, indicating an underestimation, especially for chlorophyll concentrations greater than about 0.15 mg m(-3). The results provide a comprehensive global and geographic analysis of the SeaWiFS data set, which will assist data users and policy makers in assessing the uncertainty of estimates of global and regional ocean chlorophyll and primary production.

AB The central role that land surface albedo (7) plays in the physical climate system makes it a key component of climate and ecosystem models. However, this parameter remains one of the largest radiative uncertainties associated with modelling attempts. Uncertainty occurs because models commonly prescribe albedo using in situ observations, which are rarely sufficiently dense to accurately characterize albedo at a regional scale. This is especially problematic over seasonally snow-covered landscapes such as the boreal forest. The aims of this study are to (a) analyze and compare the local- and regional-scale albedo characteristics of the dominant land cover types found within the North American boreal region, (b) assess the effects of snow cover on these patterns, and (c) quantify the potential bias that can result from using local-scale observations to describe surface albedos across larger geographical extents. Our study is based on local-scale in situ observations and regional-scale satellite (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-GOES) measurements that were collected as part of the Boreal EcosystemAtmosphere Study (BOREAS). Our results show (a) that the albedo patterns among land cover types are generally consistent at local and regional scales, (b) that snow cover not only increases the albedo of all cover types, but also their sensitivities to changes in solar zenith angle, and (c) that weekly averaged in situ observations provide a reasonable characterization of regional-scale albedo when under snow-free conditions, but a poor characterization when snow is present. Land cover albedo characteristics are caused by canopy properties that influence within-canopy shadowing. The disparity between in situ albedo observations and those collected over low-density needleleaf forest are particularly a concern because this cover type comprises a significant proportion of the boreal region, and its mis-specification in climate models could lead to large errors in energy balance. Further studies should focus on reducing the disparity between albedo data sets over snow-covered surfaces. They should also consider the effects of diffuse radiation, as well as finer time scales, on the above relationships. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For several years, the NASA SIMBIOS Project has collected, processed, and archived optical aerosol data from shipboard sun photometers. The calibration, processing, quality control, and archival methodology for handheld sun photometers are described here, along with their deployment statistics. Data processing has been standardized for all instruments by using identical calibration methods, ancillary data, and processing software. Statistical analysis reveals a dataset influenced by its temporal and geographic distribution, while multimodal histograms for aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and Angstrom exponent reveal varied aerosol populations. A K-means unsupervised classification technique is used to separate these populations. This separation is validated by showing individual classes are more likely to be log-normally (for AOTs) or normally (for Angstrom exponents) distributed than the dataset as a whole. Properties for each class are presented, along with the characteristics of each class by regional oceanic basin. Results also compare favorably with maritime aerosols measured by land-based AERONET Cimels in island sites, while providing data coverage in previously sparsely sampled regions. Aerosol models employed by SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) also compare favorably with these ground based measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information about vegetation water content (VWC) has widespread utility in agriculture, forestry, and hydrology. It is also useful in retrieving soil moisture from microwave remote sensing observations. Providing a VWC estimate allows us to control a degree of freedom in the soil moisture retrieval process. However, these must be available in a timely fashion in order to be of value to routine applications, especially soil moisture retrieval. As part of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 (SMEX02), the potential of using satellite spectral reflectance measurements to map and monitor VWC for corn and soybean canopies was evaluated. Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data and ground-based VWC measurements were used to establish relationships based on remotely sensed indices. The two indices studied were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The NDVI saturated during the study period while the NDWI continued to reflect changes in VWC. NDWI was found to be superior based upon a quantitative analysis of bias and standard error. The method developed was used to map daily VWC for the watershed over the 1-month experiment period. It was also extended to a larger regional domain. In order to develop more robust and operational methods, we need to look at how we can utilize the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua platforms, which can provide daily temporal coverage.

ID TEXTURE SEGMENTATION
AB Due to the ability of the NOAA-AVHRR sensor to cover a wide area and its high temporal frequency, it is possible to quickly obtain a general overview of the prevailing situation over a large area of terrain and, more specifically, quickly assess the damage caused by a recent large forest fire by mapping the extent of the burned area. The aim of this work was to map a large forest fire that recently took place on the Spanish Mediterranean coast using innovative image classification techniques and low spatial resolution imagery. The methodology involved developing an object-based classification model using spectral as well as contextual object information. The burned area map resulting from the image classification was compared with the fire perimeter provided by the Catalan Environmental Department in terms of spatial overlap and size in order to determine to what extent they were compatible. Results of the comparison indicated a high degree (approximate to 90%) of spatial agreement. The total burned area of the classified image was found to be 6900 ha, compared to a fire perimeter of 6000 ha produced by the Catalan Environmental Department. It was concluded that, although the object-oriented classification approach was capable of affording very promising results when mapping a recent burn on the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the method in question required further assessment to ascertain its ability to map other burned areas in the Mediterranean.

AB Intrinsic soil factors affect and are affected by the spatial variation of soil properties. Therefore, intrinsic soil factors may both characterize and serve as an indicator for soil taxonomy. Difficulties in inferring intrinsic soil properties hamper attempts to assess their variability, on both local and regional/broad scales. Radar remote sensing might facilitate a breakthrough in this field, due to its sensitivity to the soil water content. In this research, a raster Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology is developed for combining multi-temporal ERS-2 SAR and Landsat TM data, which allows the estimation of drying rate patterns in bare soil surfaces. The drying rates provide further indication about intrinsic soil properties. The multi-scale behaviour of soil-drying rates is described using the richness-area curves and characteristic curves are determined to four soil formations typical to a climatic gradient between Mediterranean and semi-arid environments in Israel. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to document the effect of intrinsic soil factors on the soil system at the regional scale. The results achieved here demonstrate the connection between drying rates, richness-area variation and soil hydraulic conductivity of the four soil formations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

ID SURFACE; MODEL
AB The present study focuses on the development of a new land cover classification product over France at I km resolution. It is based on data sets from the Earth observing system SPOT4/VEGETATION. The satellite measurements are aimed at supporting regional efforts to set up global mosaics on new land cover products. They have been acquired in the frame of the Global Land Cover 2000 project. The instrument design relies on advanced technology, which leads to an improved radiometric and geometric resolution data. Such characteristics allow taking full benefit of the daily repetitiveness of the VEGETATION wide field-of-view sensor without the drawback of a variable pixel size on the image edge. Several physical processing steps are successively operated to the images on a per-pixel basis to remove detector blindness, to filter cloud contamination, and finally to correct both atmospheric and surface anisotropy effects. A new thematic map using the K-means clustering method has been built. First, the results of the satellite-based land cover classification has been successfully compared with the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) database which serves as a reference to appraise the reliability of the study. Then, it has been inter-compared with land cover products derived from MODIS and AVHRR sensors. For this, an aggregative scheme particularly focused on major land units (forest, grassland, cropland) adopted in order to yield a whole mapping at the same geographic projection and space resolution. The discrepancies between maps enhance the quality of the proposed product, thanks to the use of advanced data processing and a more appropriate method. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On global and regional scales, earth observation (EO)-based estimates of leaf area index (LAI) provide valuable input to climate and hydrologic modelling, while fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) is a key variable in the assessment of vegetation productivity and yield estimates. Validation of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and fAPAR products is an important prerequisite to using these variables for global modelling or for local water resource modelling and net primary production (NPP) assessment, as in semi-arid West Africa and Senegal. In situ measurements of LAI and fAPAR from three sites in semi-arid Senegal were carried out in 2001 and 2002 for comparison with remotely sensed MODIS data. The seasonal dynamics of both in situ LAI and fAPAR were captured well by MODIS LAI and fAPAR. MODIS LAI is overestimated by approximately 2-15% and the overall level of fAPAR is overestimated by 8-20%. Both MOMS LAI and WAR are characterised by a moderate offset, which is slightly higher than can be explained by model and input data uncertainty. In situ fAPAR and normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) for three different vegetation types showed a strong linear relationship, suggesting that covariance between fAPAR and NDVI is insensitive to variations in leaf angle distribution (LAD) and vegetative heterogeneity. A strong linear relation also exists between MODIS fAPAR and NDVI but with different regression coefficients than the in situ relation because of MODIS' tendency to overestimate fAPAR. The fAPAR/NDVI relations found here, however, do not apply on a global scale but are only valid for similar sun-sensor view geometry and soil colour. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method of forest attribute estimation and mapping has become an integral part of national forest inventory methods in Finland in the last decade. This success of kNN method in facilitating multi-source inventory has encouraged trials of the method in the Great Lakes Region of the United States. Here we present results from applying the method to Landsat TM and ETM+ data and land cover data collected by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. In 1999, the FIA program in the state of Minnesota moved to a new annual inventory design to reach its targeted full sampling intensity over a 5-year period. This inventory design also utilizes a new 4-subplot cluster plot configuration. Using this new plot design together with 1 year of field plot observations, the kNN classification of forest/nonforest/water achieved overall accuracies ranging from 87% to 91%. Our analysis revealed several important behavioral features associated with kNN classification using the new FIA sample plot design. Results demonstrate the simplicity and utility of using kNN to produce FIA defined forest/nonforest/water classifications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Live fuel moisture, an important determinant of fire danger in Mediterranean ecosystems, exhibits seasonal changes in response to soil water availability. Both drought stress indices based on meteorological data and remote sensing indices based on vegetation water absorption can be used to monitor live fuel moisture. In this study, a cumulative water balance index (CWBI) for a time series spanning 1994-1997 and 1999-2001 was compared to field measured live fuel moisture and to equivalent water thickness (EWT) calculated from remote sensing data. A sigmoidal function was used to model the relationships between CWBI, live fuel moisture, and EWT. Both live fuel moisture and EWT reach minima at large CWBI deficits. Minimum and maximum live fuel moisture, minimum and maximum EWT, and the modeled inflection points of both live fuel moisture and EWT were found to vary with vegetation type. Modeled minimum and maximum EWT were also found to vary with vegetation biomass. Spatial variation in modeled EWT inflection points may be due to vegetation type and to local variation in soil moisture. Based on their temporal and spatial attributes, CWBI and EWT offer complimentary methods for monitoring live fuel moisture for fire danger assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model to compute the thermal-infrared emissivity of a wind-roughened sea surface. The model includes the effects of both shadowing and the reflected component of surface emission. By using Stokes vectors to quantify the radiation along a given ray path, we compute the effects of polarization as well. We separate the direct emission from surface reflections to show how each affects the nature of the emitted field. The reflected component is an important part of the radiative transfer and affects nearly 10% of the ray paths at emission angles between 60degrees and 80degrees at wind speeds greater than or equal to5 m/s, increasing the effective emissivity by as much as 0.03. The modeled emissivities agree nicely with recent sea surface emissivity measurements. We also compare the Monte Carlo results to a recently published analytic model and show that the two vary somewhat due to differences in the amount of the reflected component included in the calculations. Surface roughness has a large effect on the polarization between 60degrees and 90degrees but less so at smaller angles. Including the reflected component has a small but noticeable effect which actually enhances the degree of polarization at intermediate angles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) is the primary instrument in the NASA Earth Observing System for monitoring the seasonality of global terrestrial vegetation. Estimates of 8-day mean daily gross primary production (GPP) at the I km spatial resolution are now operationally produced by the MODIS Land Science Team for the global terrestrial surface using a production efficiency approach. In this study, the 2001 MODIS GPP product was compared with scaled GPP estimates (25 km(2)) based on ground measurements at two forested sites. The ground-based GPP scaling approach relied on a carbon cycle process model run in a spatially distributed mode. Land cover classification and maximum annual leaf area index, as derived from Landsat ETM+ imagery, were used in model initiation. The model was driven by daily meteorological observations from an eddy covariance flux tower situated at the center of each site. Model simulated GPPs were corroborated with daily GPP estimates from the flux tower. At the hardwood forest site, the MODIS GPP phenology started earlier than was indicated by the scaled GPP, and the summertime GPP from MODIS was generally lower than the scaled GPP values. The fall-off in production at the end of the growing season was similar to the validation data. At the boreal forest site, the GPP phenologics generally agreed because both responded to the strong signal associated with minimum temperature. The midsummer MODIS GPP there was generally higher than the ground-based GPP. The differences between the MODIS GPP products and the ground-based GPPs were driven by differences in the timing of FPAR and the magnitude of light use efficiency as well as by differences in other inputs to the MODIS GPP algorithm-daily incident PAR, minimum temperature, and vapor pressure deficit. Ground-based scaling of GPP has the potential to improve the parameterization of light use efficiency in satellite-based GPP monitoring algorithms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a concept related to the significant information extracted from the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the terrestrial targets. The main issues are: the choice of the BRDF model, the solution to the inverse problem, and the accuracy assessment of estimated albedo. The present concept is based on the fact that the exact solution to the inverse problem belongs to a statistically significant region centered on the least squares solution (LSS). Nonetheless, LSS may be useless if the matrix inversion yields an ill-posed problem. It is then recommended to seek an alternative solution, which will yield a similar confidence interval but will be more physically sound. A list of 15 kernels entering in a basic model is examined by means of factor analysis performed in vector space, which is spanned at all known kernels. The application is carried out with synthetic angular data generated for the SEVIRI/MSG observing system. Models are evaluated based on statistical results-minimum of squared sum of residuals (SSR) and maximum of explained variance-after adjustment on reflectance data corresponding to a wide set of land cover types. Since the matrix of the model is almost singular, we identified an optimal subset model consisting of eight kernels, which has higher conditioned index and falls within the 95% confidence interval. It was found that the reflectance predicted by multi-kernel model is consistent with measurements. The idea in opting for a multi-kernel approach comes from the necessity to perform a higher angular resolution for the BRDF retrieval. Inversion experiments confirmed an advantage of the composite model over conventional three-parameter models in accuracy assessment of reflectance and albedo in the case of uniform and restricted angular samplings. Three methods are considered: statistical inversion (provided by the LSS), ridge regression and statistical regularization. The two latter are advised to solve the ill-conditioned inverse problem. Statistical regularization uses a priori statistical information. The inversion numerical experiment with SEVIRI/MSG angular geometry shows that only ridge regression provides a reasonable solution when a composite model is used. In addition, ridge regression and statistical regularization methods provide physically acceptable solutions in terms of BRDF and albedo predictability, even for three-parameter models. It is advised that LSS be implemented only at the middle of the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere. Otherwise, the use of ridge regression and statistical regularization is recommended to retrieve BRDF and albedo at other time periods in extra-tropical latitudes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB With the successful launch of the IKONOS satellite, very high geometric resolution imagery is within reach of civilian users. In the 1-m spatial resolution images acquired by the IKONOS satellite, details of buildings, individual trees, and vegetation structural variations are detectable. The visibility of such details opens up many new applications, which require the use of geometrical information contained in the images. This paper presents an application in which spectral and textural information is used for mapping the leaf area index (LAI) of different vegetation types. This study includes the estimation of LAI by different spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) combined with image textural information and geostatistical parameters derived from high resolution satellite data. It is shown that the relationships between spectral vegetation indices and biophysical parameters should be developed separately for each vegetation type, and that the combination of the texture indices and vegetation indices results in an improved fit of the regression equation for most vegetation types when compared with one derived from SVIs alone. High within-field spatial variability was found in LAI, suggesting that high resolution mapping of LAI may be relevant to the introduction of precision farming techniques in the agricultural management strategies of the investigated area.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Accurate measurements of regional to global scale vegetation dynamics (phenology) are required to improve models and understanding of inter-annual variability in terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions. Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success.

AB The development of appropriate ground-based validation techniques is critical to assessing uncertainties associated with satellite data-based products. Here we present a method for validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) product with emphasis on the sampling strategy for field data collection. This paper, the first of two-part series, details the procedures used to assess uncertainty of the MODIS LAI product. LAI retrievals from 30 to ETM+ data were first compared to field measurements from the SAFARI 2000 wet season campaign. The ETM+ based LAI map was thus as a reference to specify uncertainties in the LAI fields produced from MODIS data (250-, 500-, and 1000-m resolutions) simulated from ETM+. Because of high variance of LAI measurements over short distances and difficulties of matching measurements and image data, a patch-by-patch comparison method, which is more realistically implemented on a routine basis for validation, is proposed. Consistency between LAI retrievals from 30 to ETM+ data and field measurements indicates satisfactory performance of the algorithm. Values of LAI estimated from a spatially heterogeneous scene depend strongly on the spatial resolution of the image scene. The results indicate that the MODIS algorithm will underestimate LAI values by about 5% over the Maim site if the scale of the algorithm is not matched to the resolution of the data.

AB Plot- and stand-level errors associated with satellite image-based multisource forest inventory (MSFI) applications have been relatively high. The reasons suggested for that are related to the limited spatial resolution of the image material. The introduction of very high spatial resolution (VHR) images to MSFI applications should, therefore, diminish these errors. The use of VHR images is, however, problematic, because pixel-by-pixel analysis methods are no longer applicable. The paper presents an image segment-based approach to the determination of feature extraction and image analysis units. The study was carried out in Southern Finland and employed a spectrally averaged imaging spectrometer (AISA) image and field data gathered from sample plots. A two-phase segmentation method was applied and a large number of segment-based spectral features was extracted and used as input to a feature selection procedure. Forward selection based on an improvement of RMSE was applied. The performance of segment-based features (SF) was compared to that of reference features (RF) extracted from square-shaped windows. The estimation results revealed that even though the applied segmentation method succeeded well in the determination of units of feature extraction and image analysis, the differences between the performance of SF and RF were small and the plot-level estimation errors remained high. The study suggests that large estimation errors are due to the local nature of the field data and may be diminished using data that is representative at the segment level.

AB Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In May 1999, the airborne thermal infrared hyporspectral imaging system, spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS), was flown over Mormon Mesa, NV, to provide the first test of such a system for geological mapping, Several types of carbonate deposits were identified using the 11.25-mum band. However, massive calerete outcrops exhibited weak spectral contrast, which was confirmed by field and laboratory measurements. Because the weathered calcrete surface appeared relatively smooth in hand specimen, this weak spectral contrast was unexpected. I lore we show that microscopic roughness not readily apparent to the eye has introduced both a cavity effect and volume scattering to reduce spectral contrast. The macroroughness of crevices and cobbles may also have a significant cavity effect. The diminished spectral contrast is important because it places higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for spectroscopic detection and identification. This effect should be factored into instrumentation planning and interpretations, especially interpretations without benefit of ground truth. SEBASS had the required high SNR and spectral resolution to allow us to demonstrate for the first time the ability of an airborne hyperspectral thermal infrared scanner to detect and identify spectrally subtle materials.

ID VEGETATION INDEX; AGE; INFORMATION; WATER
AB A simple and relatively accurate technique for classifying time-scales Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to detect levels of forest harvest is the topic of this research. The accuracy of multidate classification of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were compared and the effect of the number of years (1-3, 3-4, 5-6 years) between image acquisition on forest change accuracy was evaluated. When Landsat image acquisitions were only 1-3 years apart, forest clearcuts were detected with producer's accuracy ranging from 79% to 96% using the RGB-NTDMI classification method. Partial harvests were detected with lower producer's accuracy (55-80%) accuracy. The accuracy of both clearcut and partial harvests decreased as time between image acquisition increased. In all classification trials, the RGB-NDMI method produced significantly higher accuracies, compared to the RGB-NDVI. These results arc interesting because the less common NDMI (using the reflected middle infrared band) outperformed the more popular NDVI. In northern Maine, industrial forest landowners have shifted from clearcutting to partial harvest systems in recent years. The RGB-NDMI change detection classification applied to Landsat TM imagery collected every 2-3 years appears to be a promising technique for monitoring forest harvesting and other disturbances that do not remove the entire overstory canopy.

ID SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; DYNAMICS; FIELD
AB Synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have higher spatial resolution than scatterometers and we can obtain more detailed wind vector information from space-borne SAR data. This type of high spatial resolution wind information can be very useful particularly in coastal regions, where the scatterometer wind information can be altered by the coastal effects because the larger footprint spatial averaging of backscattered energy is unavoidable. This paper tested RADARSAT data with CMOD_4 and CMOD_IFR2 algorithms for extracting wind information over selected coastal test areas around the Korean peninsula. Because the CMOD algorithms were originally developed for the C-band, W-Polarized scatterometer data, we applied currently available polarization ratio models (e.g., Kirchhoff, Elfouhaily, and Thompson models) for RADARSAT data processing. Three test areas, the West Sea and East Sea on both sides of the Korea peninsula and the open sea off Jeju Island, were tested with the RADARSAT Fine, Standard, and ScanSAR beam mode data. The correlation of the wind vector results with the buoy and meteorological station data agrees well with each other but with some variations. The RMS error for the SAR-derived wind direction is somewhat great, and the wind speed RMS error using CMOD_4 algorithm is about 1.7 m/s (Kirchhoff), 1.84 m/s (Elfouhaily), and 2.4 m/s (Thompson polarization ratio model), respectively.

TI Recovery of forest canopy characteristics through inversion of a complex
   3D model
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB Radiative transfer models for vegetation serve as a basis for extracting vegetation variables using directional/spectral data from modern-borne sensors (e.g., MODIS. MISR, POLDER, SeaWiFS). Only recently have significant efforts been made to provide operational algorithms to invert these models. These efforts have exposed a need to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional methods for inverting these physically based models. In an effort to overcome the limitations of traditional inversion methods. a neural network method was designed and tested. In this study, a complex 3D model (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer, DART) was inverted for a wide range of simulated forest canopies using POLDER-like data. The model was inverted to recover three forest canopy variables: forest cover, leaf area index, and a soil reflectance parameter. The ranges of these variables were 0.4-1.0, 0.8-9.3, and 0.0-1.0, respectively. Two inversion methods were used - a traditional inversion technique using a modified simplex method, and a neural network method in combination with an exhaustive variable selection technique. A comparison of the methods' efficiency, accuracy, and stability was made. The neural network method gave relatively accurate solutions to the inversion problem given a small subset of directional/spectral data using only one to five view angles. Using only nadir data, the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the forest cover, leaf area index. and the soil reflectance parameter were 0.025, 0.23, and 0.15, respectively, and using the "best" view directions (2-5) were 0.021, 0.21, and 0.11, respectively. In general, the neural network method was more accurate than the simplex method. The results from both methods showed that the addition of directional view angles, as opposed to only a nadir view, can significantly improve the accuracy of recovering forest canopy characteristics. The traditional simplex method is computationally intensive and may not be appropriate for many operational applications on a per-pixel basis for regional and global data. The neural network method was computationally efficient and can be applied on a per-pixel basis. In general, the neural network technique had significantly lower RMSE values at the low noise levels. However. at moderate noise levels. the simplex method was equal to the neural network method in RMSE values. At high noise levels. the simplex method had significantly lower RMSE values than the neural network method. The neural network approach can provide an accurate, efficient, and stable inversion method for radiative transfer models using directional/spectral data from modern-borne sensors.

AB A remotely sensed image of Loch Leven, a shallow meso-cutrophic take in Central East Scotland, UK, revealed a strong gradient in chlorophyll-alpha (chl-alpha) concentration. As a means of interpreting the spatial distribution of chl-alpha in this image, a combined three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and ecological model was run using estimates of the environmental and planktonic conditions concurrent with and preceding the time of image acquisition. The post facto modelling of the dynamics of the lake produced spatial distributions of surface chl-alpha that were consistent with that evident in the remotely sensed image, It is proposed that CFD modelling benefits the interpretation of remotely sensed images of water bodies in that it may be used to infer the causes of the spatial distributions evident in the remotely sensed imagery. This is because modelling extends the analysis into the temporal and vertical domains. However, the value of combining CFD with remote sensing is limited by the quality and quantity of data available through surface observation and remote sensing, and the implications of this to the integration of CFD with remote sensing are discussed.

TI Improving the accuracy of multisource forest inventory estimates by
   reducing plot location error - a multicriteria approach
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A procedure is introduced to reassign satellite image information to field plot data of forest inventory by a multicriteria approach. The method can be utilised in satellite-image-aided forest inventories, e.g., as in the Finnish Multi-Source National Forest Inventory (FMS-NFI) since 1990. This inventory method presumes that the field sample plots are geographically accurately located and each individual field plot can be identified with a specific picture element of the applied satellite image. Small area estimation errors are highly sensitive to the location errors of field plots with respect to the satellite image. In spite of current GPS systems, an accurate location is extremely difficult to achieve due to map errors and errors in rectifying a satellite image on a map. Satellite image information is reassigned to the field plots within an n x n image window around the assumed location. A weighted function of the correlation coefficients of the selected image and field variables is used as a scaling function in this multicriteria optimisation approach. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of estimates, produced with a nonparametric k-nearest-neighbour (k-nn) estimation method, are applied as a criterion when judging the final goodness of the relocation. The relocation reduces, the pixel-level RMSE of total volume per hectare by 36%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospheric correction of Landsat/TM and Landsat-7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) over aquatic environments is generally more demanding than over land because the signal from the water column is small. Because the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS; Orbview-II satellite) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Terra satellite) provide highly improved radiometric calibration, sensitivity, and spectral bands specifically designed for estimating aerosol radiance and its spectral quality, we attempted a multiplatform assessment of the path radiance and diffuse transmittance. Using SeaWiFS and ancillary data, we estimated the ETM+ path radiance and found that for a typically clear atmosphere, without knowledge of aerosol type (difficult to estimate with ETM+ data alone), the errors in the estimated aerosol radiance in Bands 1 and 2 can be a few counts (1 count corresponds to 0.0786 and 0.0817 mW cm(-2) mum(-1) sr(-1) for Bands 1 and 2, respectively), comparable to errors in the estimated Rayleigh radiance by ignoring polarization correction. The same method can also be used to cross-calibrate the ETM+ over clear water where the target radiance (water-leaving radiance) is known. For a windless day (28 July 1999, wind < 2 in s(-1)), ETM+ Bands 2 and 3 agreed with the SeaWiFS-predicted values to within 0.5 count (similar to 1.5-3.3% of the total signal), while Band 1 was a few counts higher (similar to 5%) than predictions, possibly due to polarization or calibration effects. For a high-wind day (5 February 2000, wind speed similar to 10 in s(-1)), the agreement is less satisfactory due to uncertainties in estimating the whitecap contribution. However, the overall trend for all the bands remains the same over the period: the difference for Band 1 is consistently larger than for Bands 2 and 3. Based on these results, we propose to use Rayleigh and aerosol data estimated with SeaWiFS and/or MODIS for atmospheric correction of ETM+ over aquatic environments. We also propose to use SeaWiFS/MODIS for monitoring the long-term stability of the Landsat-7/ETM+ calibration as the mission progresses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Landsat-7 ETM+ sensor offers several enhancements over the Landsat-4,5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor, including increased spectral information content, improved geodetic accuracy, reduced noise, reliable calibration, the addition of a panchromatic band, and improved spatial resolution of the thermal band. In this paper, we present some initial comparisons between Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery in order to quantify these improvements. We find that the ETM+ continues the record of TM observations, and, in many respects, substantially improves upon the earlier sensor. Specific improvements include lower spatial noise levels, improved information content, and geodetic accuracy of systematically corrected products to 50-100 in. These improvements are likely to have significant benefits for land-cover mapping and change detection applications. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The newest in the Landsat series of satellites was launched April 15, 1999. The imagery collected by Landsat is used for a myriad of applications, from coral reef studies to land management. In order to take advantage of Landsat 7 data, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) instrument must be calibrated. This study focuses on the immediate postlaunch calibration verification of the Landsat 7 thermal band (Band 6), specifically so that it can be useful in water resource studies. Two year's worth of thermal calibration results using a combination of underflight data and ground truth show the ETM+ to be extremely stable, though the prelaunch calibration produces an offset of 0.261 W/m(2) sr mum. This paper focuses on the details of the calibration process, including problems faced with ground truth instrumentation. While the technical emphasis in this paper is the calibration of Landsat thermal data, it is presented in the context of the water resource studies for which calibrated thermal data are required. At certain times in the year, water quality in large lakes, particularly the spatial structure of water quality, is driven by temperature of lake waters. During the spring warming, a phenomena called the thermal bar drives the current and sedimentation of large water bodies. A long-term goal of this study is to use thermally driven hydrodynamic models of lake processes to better understand and monitor water quality in large lakes. This paper presents the hydrodynamic model and the relationship between temperature and water quality in the Great Lakes as one example of why high-resolution, well-calibrated data are critical to earth observing.

AB Microwave emissivity is an important parameter for rainfall estimation over land. as well as for atmospheric temperature and humidity retrievals. However, over land surfaces, it varies over a considerable range depending principally on vegetation cover and soil moisture. This study examines the feasibility of estimating emissivity from satellite-based vegetation and moisture indicators for a semiarid region in the African Sahel. Microwave emissivity was calculated from SSM/I observations at 19, 37, and 85 GHz horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarisation. The technique was validated by comparing the measured emissivity of a sea surface area with the theoretically predicted emissivity. For a dry atmosphere, there was good agreement between theory and measurement. However, the discrepancy was considerably higher in an area where the atmosphere was humid, particularly at 85 GHz. This is attributable to increased uncertainty in atmospheric correction. The land surface emissivity over a 5 degrees square area, which included the Hapex Sahel site, was studied from August to October 1992. The horizontally polarised emissivity CH and polarisation difference measured over dry land areas were found to be well-correlated with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) such that NDVI can be used to estimate Pixel e(H) to within +/-0.02. For a wet land surface, there is a general trend for the emissivity to increase with increasing NDVI and for the polarisation difference to decrease. However, the trend is much less well defined than in the dry case. A weak relationship was observed between areal averages of previous day's rainfall (PDR) and emissivity for various vegetation cover classes. A similar relationship was observed with ground-based soil moisture measurements. The results show that emissivity can be estimated with a S.E. < 0.015 at 19 GHz from a combination of NDVI and rainfall or soil moisture information. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A review of methods used for deriving seafloor reflectance and water diffuse attenuation form remotely sensed data is conducted Emphasis is made on inverse methods applied to remote sensing of ocean properties. Then an inverse scheme for the retrieval of optically active components in coastal shallow: waters is described and validated through simulation. The proposed method is based on a synthetic reflectance database and an optimization scheme. A sensitivity analysis is performed. It shows that the method is robust, even when applied to extreme environment conditions, given that the database covers the optical properties of the water body under consideration.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; MODEL
AB Interpretation of thermal images is often complicated because the physical property information is contained in both the spatial and temporal variations of the data and thermal models are necessary to extract and display this information. A linearized radiative transfer solution to the surface flux has been used to derive a function that is variant with respect to thermal inertia. This relationship makes it impossible to predict the temperature variation at any time in the diurnal cycle using only two distinct measurements (e.g., noon and midnight). An animation can then be constructed from a pair of day-night images to view both the spatial and temporal temperature changes throughout the diurnal cycle. A more complete solution for the invariant function, using the method of Laplace transforms and based on the linearized solution, was introduced. These results indicate that the linear model does not provide a sufficiently accurate estimate. Using standard conditions (latitude 30 degrees, solar declination 0 degrees, acquisition times at noon and midnight), this new relationship was used to predict temperature throughout the diurnal cycle to an rms error of 0.2 degrees C, which is close to the system noise of most thermal scanners. The method was further extended to include the primary effects of topographic slope with similar accuracy. The temperature was computed at 48 equally spaced times in the diurnal cycle with this algorithm using a co-registered day and night TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) data pair (330 pixels, 450 lines) acquired of the Carlin, Nevada, area and a co-registered DEM (Digital Elevation Model). (Any reader can view the results by downloading the animation file from an identified ftp site.) The results illustrate the power of animation to display subtle temporal and spatial temperature changes, which can provide clues to structural controls and material property differences. This 'visual change' approach could significantly increase the use of thermal data for environmental, hazard, and resource studies. Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB In this paper, local structure of bare soil is analyzed from the fractal point of view. Soil surface profiles were created from three dimensional (3-D) stereoscopic images of soil surface leading to 3-D numerical reconstruction of the soil topography with very fine resolution. Investigations are done with a database (four soils) that includes three main soil classes according to the way of tillage: smoothed field from rainfalls, ploughed, and sowed fields. The fractional Brownian model developed by Mandelbrot is used to describe local structure of soil roughness. For the database soils, fractal nature of the profiles is demonstrated over a finite range of scales showing a good stability of fractal dimension for each one. This model also provides an excellent analytic fit to the experimental correlation function of the soil. Therefore, a new method to calculate its shape at the origin and a more stable correlation length is presented. To study the influence of the band-limited fractal nature of the soil on radar signal, the Moment Method is used to evaluate the backscattered field and to obtain the radar cross-section by statistical averaging. Surfaces used for this electromagnetic simulation are cylindrical and perfectly conducting. A method is developed to generate soil surface profiles that have the same statistical properties and the sam roughness parameters values (rms height, correlation length, and fractal dimension) as what has been found on our database soils. The generation method is based on an initially Gaussian correlated random profile, modified by the random mid-point displacement method to introduce the short-range disorder that depends on fractal dimension. The radar disorder that depends on fractal dimension. The radar signal level computed on these surfaces by the Moment Method shows the dependence of backscattering on fractal dimension and new aspects in electromagnetic scattering behavior over soils.

AB Spatial pattern defined as the distribution of individuals in space, is an important characteristic of forest stands. It provides an insight into the allocation of above-and below-ground resources to a tree, as well as reflecting,a the stand history, microclimate, and competition between different species over time. The spatial arrangement of trees carl be described as random, aggregated, or regular with a number of statistics existing that characterize the spatial pattern of a given tree population. High spatial resolution remote sensing is an obvious tool to facilitate the measuring and monitoring of spatial patterns in forest stands. Remote sensing imagery provides detailed information about forest structure while still allowing large areas of forest to be mapped and monitored. The increased availability of high resolution imagery coupled with improvements in scene processing and interpretation techniques allow additional information, such as texture, to be extracted from this type of imagery. In this paper the spatial pattern of trees within a forest stand is related to high spatial resolution imagery. This relationship is developed using a technique that relates scene texture variance to a statistic describing spatial pattern. The technique was tested on a number of simulated remote sensing scenes by systematically varying the size and spatial distribution of trees using a geometric-optical model. Results indicate that it is theoretically possible to derive the spatial pattern of trees within a high spatial resolution forested scene provided crown size is estimated a priori. It is also likely that the coral projected foliage cover of the canopy will affect the ability to predict spatial distribution based on texture variance. It was concluded that the spatial pattern of trees within a scene can play a vital role in the amount and degree of variation existing within imagery. It is important to consider the implications of these type of relationships when developing variance-based models of forest structure. (C) Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

ID RADIANCES; WATERS
AB Observed angular distributions of spectral sky radiance clearly demonstrate the anisotropic nature of the radiance and lead to significant deviations from the isotropic case when the optical quantities resulting from these distributions are calculated The ratio of diffuse downward irradiance and zenith radiance is determined at seven wavelengths from 370 nm to 650 nm, varying between 1.8 and 5.1 at 370 nm for the solar zenith angle range theta(s)=17 degrees-67 degrees, and between 1.2 and 8.5 at 650 nm for the range theta(s)=16 degrees-76 degrees. A consequence of these observations is that the frequently applied assumption of isotropic sky radiance may lead to errors of up to 170% for the contribution to nadir radiance from zenith radiance reflected on the surface of the sea. The surface reflectance of diffuse irradiance obtains values between 0.053 and 0.088 at 370 nm (theta(s)=12 degrees-67 degrees) and between 0.048 and 0.124 at 650 nm (theta(s)=13 degrees-76 degrees). The assumption of isotropic sky radiance may in this case lead to errors of up to 85% for the reflectance. The values for the average cosine of downward sky radiance lie in the range 0.43-0.60 at 370 nm (theta(s)=12 degrees-67 degrees) and in 0.31-0.62 at 650 nm (theta(s)=13 degrees-76 degrees), which again are significant deviations from the value 0.50 for the average cosine of the isotropic radiance distribution. Beneath the surface of the sea the transmitted sky radiance produces an average cosine that only varies between 0.82 and 0.89 at 370 nm (theta(s)=12 degrees-67 degrees) and between 0.78 and 0.89 at 650 nm (theta(s)=13 degrees-76 degrees). Linear relations approximating the ratio of diffuse irradiance and zenith radiance, the diffuse reflectance, and the average cosines as functions of the solar zenith angle are presented. The determining factors in predictions of the mentioned optical quantities become the diffuse downward irradiance, the ratio of diffuse and total irradiance, and the solar zenith angle.

AB Predicting fire hazard in fire-prone ecosystems in urbanized landscapes, such as the chaparral systems of California, is critical to risk assessment and mitigation. Understanding the dynamics of fire spread, topography and vegetation condition are necessary to increase the accuracy of fire risk assessment. One vital input to fire models is spatial and temporal estimates of canopy water content. However, timely estimates of such a dynamic ecosystem property cannot be provided for more than periodic point samples using ground based methods. This study examined the potential of three quasiphysical methods for estimating water content using remotely sensed Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data of chaparral systems in the Santa Monica Mountains, California. We examined estimates of water content at the leaf, canopy, and image level and compared them to each other and to ground-based estimates of plant water content. These methods predicted water content (with R-2 between 0.62 and 0.95) but differ in their ease of use and the need for ancillary data inputs. The prospect for developing regional estimates for canopy water content at high spatial resolution (20 m) from high resolution optical sensors appears promising. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1988

AB Effects of the surface wind speed and direction of the radiation field in the model atmosphere-ocean system is theoretically investigated for the wavelength of 865 nm. The wind direction is considered for 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, and 180 degrees from the solar direction, where the ind speed is assumed to be 5 m/s and 11 m/s. The computational scheme is the doubling-adding method where polarization effect is included. Computational results show that the effect of the wind direction on the radiance at the top of the atmosphere is generally smaller than the effect of a change in wind speed from 5 m/s to 11 m/s. However, the opposite trend is shown at some viewing angles wizen wind speed is 11 m/s. For small optical thickness of aerosol (0.052), the effect of the wind direction on the radiance at the top of the atmosphere becomes larger than 20% even if the wind speed is 5 m/s. It is also shown that the degree of polarization is generally less sensitive to the wind speed and direction than the radiance. Therefore, measurements of the polarization from satellites may provide useful additional information for retrieval of the optical characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol.

AB This article paper evaluates the effectiveness of ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for mapping movement of the transient snow line in a temperate glacier basin during an ablation season. The two primary objectives of this study are to normalize the topographically induced distortions (radiometric and geometric) inherent in SAR imagery of rugged terrain and to delineate the snore line in the normalized imagery. The radiometric distortions are normalized with a cosine correction, and the image texture is enhanced to take advantage of the spatial distribution of tonal variations within each image. To minimize geometric distortions and georeference the imagery, each cosine corrected/texture enhanced SAR image is orthorectified to an error of approximately 60 m using a DEM and satellite orbital and ephemeris data. A supervised classification is performed on the orthorectified imagery to map the spatial distribution of snow and glacial ice within the basin. The visual boundary between the wet snow and glacier ice surfaces on the orthorectified images is within 75 m horizontally of the snow line obtained from field data. The glacier boundary is also discernible to within 75 m of the surveyed glacier outline. Several isolated bare ice areas on the lower glacier give a low return, similar to wet snow, resulting in so me confusion between glacier ice and wet snow. It is speculated that the incident wave is lost within the crevasses and surface runoff runnel due to specular reflection within. the features. Despite the localised confusion between glacier ice and wet snore, the wet-snow line and can be mapped reasonably well and in a timely manner using ERS-1 SAR imagery. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm) and color attributes of samples from the major horizons of six soil classes with broad distribution in Brazil were analyzed for intrinsic relationships (principal components analysis) as well as for correlations with chemical components. The objective was to detect the spectral changes with depth that are related to the soil chemical properties, thus improving the pedological characterization of the soil profile and vertically extending the links between topsoil properties and remote sensing data. The albedo (first principal component) differentiated the studied soil profiles in all horizons and was inversely rebated to Fe2O3 (total iron), TiO2, and Al2O3 contents. The spectral variability within each soil profile tons associated with changes in the shape (slope) of the spectra (second principal component). Such changes produced ratio values between longer and shorter wavelengths that tended to decrease with depth because of the increasing quantities of clay components, and the interplay between iron and carbon, respectively. Thus, in each profile, the albedo was generally preserved, but the shape of the spectra was not, except for soils with very low albedo. Hematite-rich soils were distinguished from goethite-which soils by the redness index, which runs estimated from the three color parameters: dominant wavelength, purity, and luminance. The results suggested that the use of spectroradiometers to measure reflectance of samples front several horizons can expedite soil surveys, and also optimize laboratory analysis for soil chemical evaluation. Also, they can be important to characterize the relative distribution of some soil constituents in large unvegetated areas. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Vegetation indices derived from satellite image data have become one of the primary information sources for monitoring vegetation conditions and mapping land cover change. The most widely used vegetation index in this context is NDVI, the normalized difference vegetation index, which is a function of red and near-infrared spectral bands. Given that the spectral and spatial characteristics of imagery in the red and near-infrared vary from sensor to sensor, NDVI values based on data from different instruments will not be directly comparable. The present study demonstrates the impact of changes in spectral bandwidth and spatial scale on NDVI derived from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVRIS) data acquired at 20-m resolution over a forested region in southeastern British Columbia. For this purpose, the 10-nm AVIRIS data were spectrally and spatially aggregated in the red and near-infrared to simulate bandwidths from 10 nm to 150 nm for ground resolutions varying from 20 m to 1100 m. Sensor-specific spectral bands and spatial resolutions such as those for SPOT HRV, Landsat TM, NOAA AVHRR, EOS MODIS, and Envisat MERIS were also generated. NDVI values were then calculated using atmospherically corrected surface reflectances for forestry-related targets for the entire simulated band set at the various scales. The results indicate that the NDVI is significantly affected by differences in spectral bandwidth, especially for the red band, and that changes in spatial resolution lead to less pervasive but more land cover specific effects on NDVI. Results for the forested regions also indicate that NDVI is not very sensitive to the location of the near-infrared spectral band, provided that the bandwidth is no wider than 50 nm and the atmospheric correction for water vapor absorption is adequate. If either proviso is relaxed, the wavelength placement of the near-infrared spectral band is more critical, the optimum location being in the 850-880 nm range. Finally, for the same forest targets, some results were also generated for several other vegetation indices that make straightforward use of atmospherically corrected red and near-infrared spectral bands.

AB A set of Landsat Thematic Mapper images representing a wide range of vegetation conditions from the NASA Landsat Pathfinder, global land cover test site (GLCTS) initiative were processed to simulate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), global vegetation index imagery at 250 m pixel size resolution. The sites included boreal forest, temperature coniferous forest, temperature deciduous forest, tropical rainforest, grassland, savanna, and desert biomes. Differences and similarities in sensitivity to vegetation conditions were compared among various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). All VIs showed a qualitative relationship to variations in vegetation. However, there were significant differences among the VIs over desert, grassland, and forested biomes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was sensitive to and responded primarily to the highly absorbing red reflectance to variations in the near-infrared (NIR) band. As a result, we found the NDVI to mimic red reflectances and saturate over the forested sites while the SARVI, by contrast, did not saturate and followed variations in NIR reflectances. In the arid and semiarid biomes, the NDVI was much more sensitive to canopy background variations than the SARVI. Maximum differences among vegetation index behavior occurred over the evergreen needleleaf forest sites relative to the deciduous broadleaf forests and drier, grassland, and shrub sites. These differences appear to be useful in complementing the NDVI for improved monitoring of vegetation, with the NDVI sensitive to fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation and the SARVI more sensitive to structural canopy parameters such as leaf area index and leaf morphology.

AB This paper presents results related to the shuttle imaging radar C and X-band synthetic aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) Italian experiments carried out at the calibration backup supersite CB1 (Matera, in southern Italy). C-, L- and X-band active radar calibrations (ARC) were deployed for radiometric analysis of the microwave instrument on board the NASA space shuttle. The main objectives of this investigation-namely, ground instrumentation validation, image quality assessment, and radiometric calibration-are accomplished by making measurements from the signatures of the ARCs, whose radar cross section (RCS) was known from laboratory measurements. The expected RCS of each deployed target, as seen by the sensor, is reconstructed on the radiometrically calibrated images, faking into account the uncertainties in the measurements made on the impulse response function and the accuracy of the laboratory tests. Numerical results derived from the standard single-look complex (SLC) products provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and by the German and Italian processing and archiving facilities show good performance of the ARCs and of the SAR processors, also indicating acceptable stability of the calibration parameters of SIR-C and X-SAR. A simple self-organizing clustering algorithm is applied to the areas centered on the ARCs to obtain histograms of scattering properties of bare and ploughed soil. The comparison with backscattering statistics databases gives good agreement with the backscatter data derived from the calibrated SAR imagery. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB This article presents a methodology for selecting texture measures to maximize the discrimination of agricultural land use classes in SAR images. The images were acquired during the first flight of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) experiment, in April 1994. L (24 cm)- and C (5-cm)-band SAR data at HH (horizontal transmitting and receiving), HV (horizontal transmitting, vertical receiving), and VV (vertical transmitting and receiving) polarizations both in ground range and slant range and in two different passes were analyzed. The kappa statistic was used to identify meaningful texture measures to discriminate seven classes. The results show that the classifications of land use based only on tonal averages produced a kappa coefficient only slightly higher than 0.50. A kappa threshold of 0.90 was reached with the simultaneous inclusion of 15 texture measures for the six images (two bands, three polarizations). It was also found that the inclusion of texture features when only one band and one polarization was used could produce kappa values higher than 0.85. (C)Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.

AB A feedforward neural network model based on the multilayer perceptron structure and trained using the backpropagation algorithm responds to subpixel class composition in both simulated and real data. Maps of the network response surfaces for simulated data illustrate that the set of network outputs successfully characterizes the level of class dominance and the subpixel composition for controlled data that contain a range of class mixtures. For a Sierra Nevada test site, the correspondence between 250 m reference data and a network class map produced using 250 m degraded TM data depends on the degree of subpixel class mixing as determined from coregistered 30 m reference data. For most mislabeled pixels, classification error results from confusion between the first and second largest subpixel components, and the first and second largest network outputs. Overall map accuracy increases from 62% to 79% when mislabeled pixels are reclassified using the second largest network output. Accuracy increases to 84% if, for mislabeled pixels, the second largest subpixel class is used as a reference. Maps of the network response surfaces for a controlled subset of the Plumas data complement the findings of the simulated data and show that the network responds in a systematic way to changing proportions of subpixel components. Based on our results we suggest that interpretation of the complete set of network outputs can provide information on the relative proportions of subpixel classes. We outline a threshold-based heuristic that would allow the labeling of pure classes, mixed classes, and primary and secondary class types based on the relative magnitudes of the two largest network signals.

AB The amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by canopy (APAR(CAN)) is essential to the productivity of vegetation. Monitoring APAR(CAN) from space has been achieved through the retrievals of two quantities, namely, the PAR incident at the surface (PAR(SFC)down arrow) and the fraction of PAR intercepted by the canopy, FPAR. We propose a new approach that splits APAR(CAN) into the PAR absorbed in the surface layer below the top of the canopy (APAR(SFC)) and the ratio of APAR(CAN)/APAR(SFC), RPAR. The method is introduced in two parts. Part I develops a simple parameterization that retrieves APAR(SFC) more readily and accurately than PAR(SFC)down arrow. Part II, presented in this paper, deals with the retrieval of RPAR. It is shown that RPAR can be derived as accurately and readily as FPAR. Hence, it is envisaged that the new approach offers an easier and more accurate means of estimating APAR(CAN) than the traditional one. As an investigation tool, a one-dimensional multistream and multilayer model of canopy radiative transfer is first formulated. Extensive canopy modeling is conducted with input parameters of large ranges to represent a variety of canopies and ground conditions. For vegetated land, RPAR is found to correlate well with FPAR and thus RPAR can be estimated from FPAR. RPAR is also related with the surface vegetation indices (VIs) such as NDVI, SAVI, and DVI. The relationships between RPAR and VIs are driven by the changes in leaf area index. They are not sensitive to the solar zenith angle and the fractions of direct and diffuse radiation, but to the optical properties of the canopy. The models for inferring RPAR from various VIs are given, together with the correction models to account for the dependencies of RPAR on time and cloud cover.

AB An experiment was designed to determine whether chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations could be predicted from reflectance (R) spectra of fresh bigleaf maple leaves in the laboratory, and, if so, whether the predictive spectral features could be correlated with chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration or content of simple canopies of maple seedlings. The best predictors for nitrogen and chlorophyll of fresh leaves appeared with first-difference transformations of log 1/R, and the bands selected were similar to those found in other studies. Shortwave infrared bands were best predictors for nitrogen, visible bands best for chlorophyll. In the shortwave infrared region, however the absolute differences in reflectance at critical bands was extremely small, and the bands of high correlation were narrow. High spectral and radiance resolution are required to resolve these differences accurately. The best shortwave infrared bands from the leaf scale were not good predictors of chemical content or concentration at the canopy scale; variability in canopy reflectance in the shortwave infrared region was at least an order of magnitude beyond that necessary to detect signals from chemicals. The variability in first-difference log 1/R on the canopy scale was related to the arrangement of trees with respect to direct solar radiation, instrument noise, leaf fluttering, and small changes in atmospheric moisture.

AB For many applications, extraction of useful data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or other sensor imagery of the Earth's surface can be expedited by encoding terrain relief cues within the image. Shadowing may provide qualitative cues, but the most accurate relief information results from direct measurement of terrain elevation on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Airborne interferometric SAR (IFSAR) offers a method for the generation of digital elevation maps (DEMs) which has recently come of age technologically. Before semiautomated IFSARE (IFSAR elevation) mapping becomes commercially practical, concerns in the areas of accuracy, reproducibility, throughput, and cost must be addressed. This article considers these issues in the context of a study which was conducted with a production military SAR system flown in an experimental IFSARE mode. Example IFSARE imagery from an associated Army/ARPA mapping program is presented and analyzed for detail. Geopositioning accuracy and reproducibility are discussed; one standard was a set of high accuracy, high resolution DEMs which were produced from optical photo stereo pairs and controlled by a GPS-based ground survey. Computer throughput requirements are assessed from the standpoint of near real-time processing and low cost.

ID CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES
AB Techniques to locate end estimate the areas of fires in the boreal forests of Alaska using satellite imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are described. The basis for these techniques is the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the AVHRR data, which is reduced by the damage to the plant canopy during fires. AVHRR data collected during three years (1990, 1991, and 1992) were analyzed in order to determine the locations and estimate the areal extent of fires that occurred in 1990 and 1991 (when 2 million ha of land in Alaska were affected by fire). Fires in Alaska tend to take place in large events, with > 96% of the total area burned occurring in fires greater than 20,000 ha in size. The analysis techniques developed in this paper resulted in detection of > 83% of all fires )20,000 ha in size over the two years, and detected > 78% of the area burned in the state during this time period.

AB During the four American space Shuttle missions of year 1985, the crew members took pictures of the Earth in polarized light. This data set is a unique experiment involving extensive measurements in polarization. The results that have been already reported in the literature illustrate different potential applications on a qualitative basis. We examine here the possibilities of achieving quantitative analysis of the images. The first step was to validate the experiment. Different problems have been encountered: calibration, uncertainties on the direction of polarization, induced polarization by the Shuttle window, and nonlinearity of the film response. The second part of the article is devoted to the analysis of a set of selected images. The consistency of the calibration is proven for snow or sand observations for which ground measurements, reported in the literature, can be used for comparison with respect to the spatial homogeneity of the target. The potential of polarization for agriculture inventory use is then illustrated by relating space observations to existing ground measurement. Finally, during an atmospheric contamination event, the analysis of the polarization allows us to characterize the origin of the pollution as forest fire smoke.

ID REMOTE-SENSING SYSTEM; MULTISPECTRAL VIDEO; IMAGERY
AB This research was designed to evaluate the operational utility of airborne bispectral video data for reconnaissance assessment of land-cover variability and to document the viability of the video data for classification accuracy assessment. There are distinct logistical advantages utilizing airborne video data in isolated and environmentally sensitive regions where there is limited preexisting aerial photography and poor infrastructure and where ground accessibility is difficult and expensive. In a study of land-cover characteristic in Mato Grosso, Brazil, video data provided important insights into the variability and transitions in land-cover that could be used to identify targets for field work and training areas for subsequent satellite image (Landsat TM) classifications. Comparisons of Landsat TM classification accuracy assessments derived from the airborne video and standard color photography revealed that comparable results can be achieved at a high statistical level of significance (0.01). These results demonstrated that the video data can provide information for accuracy assessments equivalent to more standard photographic point-sample data acquisition missions with the added benefit of easily acquiring far more data. Results of the supervised Landsat TM classification coupled with a topographic model produced an overall accuracy of 68% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.60, based upon a priori classes identified through evaluation of the airborne data and a site visit.

TI TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN DIELECTRIC-CONSTANT AND WATER STATUS
   OF DOMINANT FOREST SPECIES FROM NEW-ENGLAND
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TREES; STEMS
AB Temporal and spatial characteristics of microwave dielectric properties and water status of several forest species were investigated during the 1990 and 1991 growing seasons as part of the NASA FED MAC. Data presented were acquired from Durham, New Hampshire (white pine, eastern hemlock, and American beech), and Howland, Maine (eastern hemlock and red spruce). Dielectric properties of trunk wood were measured using C-band, L-band, and P-band dielectric probes. For the Durham specimens, electrical resistance was measured using a digital ohmmeter. Water status of the trees studied was determined either by use of a Scholander pressure bomb on branch samples or by fresh weight/dry weight assessment of wood core samples. Results indicate the following: 1) Radial dielectric profiles matched the regions of the functional sapwood such that the sapwood was characterized by a higher dielectric than the bark and heartwood tissues. 2) A hysteresis exists between diurnal variations in branch water potential and trunk sapwood dielectric. 3) The dielectric properties were positively correlated with wood core moisture content, while the electrical resistance was poorly correlated with moisture content. 4) Using categories of electrical resistance measurements as a qualitative assessment of relative ion concentrations the dielectric measurements were not sensitive to the different ion concentrations within the xylem and phloem exudate. These results support the view that dielectric properties are strongly correlated with moisture status in trunk wood and that diurnal variations in dielectric are related to diurnal fluctuations in water potential. The lag between changes in branch water potential and trunk dielectric varies, depending on the structure, evaporative demand, and water storage capacity of the sapwood.

AB Measurements of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence of living leaves were compared to ecophysiological parameters, both in near and far field conditions. Near field measurements were carried out with a two-wave-length portable fluorometer, both in the laboratory and in the field. Results show significant changes of the 690 nm and 730 nm chlorophyll fluorescence bands in different environmental conditions. Water stress and carboxylation limitations also affect the fluorescence spectra. Far field measurements from a ground-operated fluorescence LI-DAR system confirm those results. The F690/F730 fluorescence ratio is then demonstrated as a good index for vegetation remote sensing.

AB We used a decorrelation-stretched image of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Bands 1, 4, and 7 and field data to map and describe the main surficial units in the hyperarid Safsaf region in south-central Egypt. We show that the near-infrared bands on Landsat TM, which are sensitive to very subtle changes in mineralogy common to arid regions, significantly improve the geologist's capability to discriminate geologic units in desert regions. These data also provide the spatial and spectral information necessary to determine the migration patterns and provenance of eolian materials. The Safsaf area was the focus Of our post-flight field studies using Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) data following the discovery of buried paleo-channels in North Africa. Most of the channels discernible on SIR images are not expressed in TM data, but traces of a few channels are present in both the SIR and the TM data within the Wadi Safsaf area. Here we present a detailed digital examination of the SIR and the TM-band reflectance and reflectance-ratio data at three locations of the more obvious surface expressions of the buried channels. Our results indicate that the TM expressions of the channels are not purely topographic but are more compositional in nature. Two possibilities may account for the TM expressions of the buried channels: 1) concentrations of windblown, iron-rich materials that accumulated along subtle curvilinear topographic traps, or 2) curvilinear exposures of an iron-rich underlying unit Of the flat sand sheet.

AB The problems in moving from a radiance measurement made for a particular sun-target-sensor geometry to an accurate estimate of the hemispherical reflectance are considerable. A knowledge-based system called VEG was used in this study to infer hemispherical reflectance. Given directional reflectance(s) and the sun angle, VEG selects the most suitable inference technique(s) and estimates the surface hemispherical reflectance with an estimate of the error. Ideally, VEG is applied to homogeneous vegetation. However, what is typically done in GCM (global circulation model) models and related studies is to obtain an average hemispherical reflectance on a square grid cell on the order of 200 km x 200 km. All available directional data for a given cell are averaged (for each view direction), and then a particular technique for inferring hemispherical reflectance is applied to this averaged data. Any given grid cell can contain several surface types that directionally scatter radiation very differently. When averaging over a set of view angles, the resulting mean values may be atypical of the actual surface types that occur on the ground, and the resulting inferred hemispherical reflectance can be in error. These errors were explored by creating a simulated scene and applying VEG to estimate the area-averaged hemispherical reflectance using various sampling procedures. The reduction in the hemispherical reflectance errors provided by using VEG ranged from a factor of 2-4, depending on conditions. This improvement represents a shift from the calculation of a hemispherical reflectance product of relative value (errors of 20% or more), to a product that could be used quantitatively in global modeling applications, where the requirement is for errors to be limited to around 5-10%. The results suggest sampling and averaging strategies for creating hemispherical reflectance maps for photosynthetic, carbon cycle, and climate change studies.

DT Article
AB The tide-related parameters of the Delaware Bay are derived from space shuttle time-series photographs. The water areas in the bay are measured from interpretation maps of the photographs with a CALCOMP 9100 digitizer and ERDAS Image Processing System. The corresponding tidal levels are calculated using the exposure time annotated on the photographs. From these data, an approximate function relating the water area to the tidal level at a reference point is determined. Based on the function, the water areas of the Delaware Bay at mean high water (MHW) and mean low water (MLW), below 0 m, and for the tidal zone are inferred. With MHW and MLW areas and the mean tidal range, we calculate the tidal influx of the Delaware Bay, which is 2.76 x 10(9) m3. Furthermore, the velocity of flood tide at the bay mouth is determined using the tidal flux and an integral of the velocity distribution function at the cross section between Cape Henlopen and Cape May. The result is 132 cm/s, which compares well with the data on tidal current charts.

TI MAPPING PLAYA EVAPORITE MINERALS WITH AVIRIS DATA - A 1ST REPORT FROM
   DEATH-VALLEY, CALIFORNIA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Efflorescent salt crusts in Death Valley, California, were mapped by using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data and a recently developed least-squares spectral band-fitting algorithm. Eight different saline minerals were remotely identified, including three borates, hydroboracite, pinnoite, and rivadavite, that have not been previously reported from the Death Valley efflorescent crusts. The three borates are locally important phases in the crusts, and at least one Of the minerals, rivadavite, appears to be forming directly from brine. Borates and other evaporite minerals provide a basis for making remote chemical measurements of desert hydrologic systems. For example, in the Eagle Borax Spring area, the AVIRIS mineral maps pointed to elevated magnesium and boron levels in the ground waters, and to the action of chemical divides causing subsurface fractionation of calcium. Many other chemical aspects of playa brines should have an expression in the associated evaporite assemblages. Certain anhydrous evaporites, including anhydrite, glauberite, and thenardite, lack absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range, and crusts composed of these minerals could not be characterized by using AVIRIS. In these situations, thermal-infrared remote sensing data may complement visible and near-infrared data for mapping evaporites. Another problem occurred in wet areas of Death Valley, where water absorption caused low signal levels in the 2.0-2.5 mum wavelength region that obscured any spectral features of evaporite minerals. Despite these difficulties, the results of this study demonstrate the potential for using AVIRIS and other imaging spectrometer data to study playa chemistry. Such data can be useful for understanding chemical linkages between evaporites and ground waters, and will facilitate studies of how desert ground-water regimes change through time in response to climatic and other variables.

AB The Center for the Study of Earth from Space (CSES) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, has developed a prototype interactive software system called the Spectral Image Processing System (SIPS) using IDL (the Interactive Data Language) on UNIX-based workstations. SIPS is designed to take advantage of the combination of high spectral resolution and spatial data presentation unique to imaging spectrometers. It streamlines analysis of these data by allotving scientists to rapidly interact with entire datasets. SIPS provides visualization toolsfor rapid exploratory analysis and numerical tools for quantitative modeling. The user interface is X-Windows-based, user friendly, and provides ''point and click'' operation. SIPS is being used for multidisciplinary research concentrating on use of physically based analysis methods to enhance scientific resultsfrom imaging spectrometer data. The objective of this continuing effort is to develop operational techniques for quantitative analysis of imaging spectrometer data and to make them available to the scientific community prior to the launch of imaging spectrometer satellite systems such as the Earth Observing System (EOS) High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (HIRIS).

TI 2-TEMPERATURE METHOD FOR MEASURING EMISSIVITY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Spectral emissivity can be uniquely determined from radiance measurements if the object can be observed at two different temperatures. The advantage of this approach is that the spectral emissivity is determined without a priori assumptions about spectral shape. Because the different temperatures are obtained by observing the scene at two times in the diurnal cycle (optimally after midday and midnight), the method assumes that emissivity is temporally invariant. This is valid for rocks and dry soils, not well established for vegetation, and not true when changes in soil moisture occur between the measurements. Accurate image registration and satisfactory signal:noise are critical factors that limit extensive use of this method.

AB To help determine the utility Of satellite data for analysis and inventory of Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests west of the Cascade Mountains crest in Oregon and Washington, USA, we evaluate relationships between spectral and texture variables derived from SPOT HRV 10 m panchromatic and LANDSAT TM 30 m multispectral data and 16 forest stand structural attributes. Texture of the HRV data was strongly related to many of the stand attributes evaluated, whereas TM texture was weakly related to all attributes. Wetness, a feature of the TM Tasseled Cap, was the spectral variable most highly correlated to all stand attributes. Wetness appears to respond to the degree of maturity in a forest stand. One of the primary reasons HRV texture and TM wetness exhibited strong relationships with stand attributes is their relative insensitivity to topographically induced illumination angle. Although TM texture also was insensitive to topography, the spatial resolution of TM data is too coarse to detect the spatial variability within the forest stands evaluated. Regression models used to estimate values for the stand attributes from the satellite data indicate that both TM and HRV imagery should yield equally accurate estimates Of forest age class and stand structure. Of all stand attributes evaluated, the standard deviation of tree sizes, mean size and density of trees in the upper canopy layers, a structural complexity index, and stand age can be most reliably estimated using the satellite data.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID INDEX; RED
AB We consider the inference of vegetation status from measurements in the visible and near infrared, in the presence of variable soil reflectance, There are two cases, depending on spatial variability within the instrumental field of view. The first, or "field" case, assumes a spatially uniform vegetation canopy, which is treated in a simple two-stream approximation. In this case, appropriate to Landsat or SPOT data, a value for leaf area index (LAI) may be obtained from reflectance measurements in the visible and near infrared. The second, or "mixed pixel" case, applies for spatial inhomogeneity on a scale larger than individual plant groupings, that is, surface types with varying amounts of vegetation and bare soil. In this case, appropriate to AVHRR observations of agricultural areas, a fractional cover f, corresponding to dense vegetation, may be obtained from the two measurements. A leaf vegetation index V(L), having limits 0 and 1, is introduced for the field case. For a thin canopy (LAI << 1) the leaf vegetation index is shown to equal the vegetation fraction f. Analysis results are compared to commonly used vegetation indices.

TI BIDIRECTIONAL CALIBRATION RESULTS FOR 11 SPECTRALON AND 16 BASO4
   REFERENCE REFLECTANCE PANELS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Eleven Spectralon1 (a sintered polytetrafluoroethylene-based material) and 16 BaSO4 reference reflectance panels were calibrated using a field calibration technique. The Spectralon panels differed both in their directional/hemispherical and directional/directional reflectance. However, the differences were sufficiently small that "general" calibration equations were developed. For panels constructed of the same material and with the same methods as those used in these experiments, the directional/directional reflectance may be within +/- 0.020 at 10-degrees, +/- 0.015 at 45-degrees, and +/- 0.041 at 80-degrees of that predicted by the "general" equations. For field measurements, these values are considerably better than those that would be obtained using a value of the directional/hemispherical reflectance. The directional/directional reflectance of the 16 BaSO4 panels varied considerably among panels, so much so that it was not feasible to develop "general" calibration equations. Apparently, the nonlambertian properties of BaSO4 panels are dependent upon the method of applying the barium sulfate coating.

TI REMOTE-SENSING OF LAKE CHICOT, ARKANSAS - MONITORING SUSPENDED
   SEDIMENTS, TURBIDITY, AND SECCHI DEPTH WITH LANDSAT MSS DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-QUALITY; TROPHIC STATE; MISSISSIPPI
AB This research used water quality data from Lake Chicot, Arkansas and a corresponding set of Landsat MSS data to compare the ability of satellite-based sensor systems to monitor suspended sediment concentration, Secchi disk depth, and nephelometric turbidity.  Lake Chicot was selected, in part, because of the availability of a wide range of water quality conditions.  Secchi disk depth and nephelometric turbidity are both optical measures of water quality and differ from suspended sediment concentration, which is a measure of the weight of inorganic particulates suspended in the water column.  Four different models for these relationships between the satellite data and the water quality data were tested:  1) simple linear regression analysis with the satellite data transformed to exoatmospheric reflectance, 2) a simple linear regression involving a natural logarithm transformation of the satellite and water quality variables, 3) simple linear regression analysis of the digital chromaticity transformation of the satellite data and the natural logarithm of the water quality data, and 4) optimized curve fitting of a theoretically derived exponential model for the relationship between exoatmospheric reflectance and the water quality data.  Two different solar spectral irradiance curves and an orbital eccentricity correction factor are tested using the exponential model.  Results suggest:  1) Remote sensing from space-based platforms can provide meaningful information on water quality variability; 2) an exponential model best characterizes the relationship between the satellite data and the water quality measures investigated; 3) slight differences result from using the solar curve proposed by the World Radiation Center (as opposed to the NASA standard); and 4) predictions based on optical measures of water quality, rather than measures of the weight of particles in the water column, are slightly better when using Landsat MSS data.

ID REFLECTANCE
AB A mixture model was utilized to extract soil biophysical properties from fine resolution soil spectra (400-900 nm) measured outdoors with a portable spectroradiometer.  The objective of this study was to fully characterize soil spectral signatures in the visible and near-infrared in terms of underlying "basis" curves, key wavelengths, and dimensionality.  Through spectral decomposition and mixture modeling, the reflectance response of a wide, genetic range of soil materials were separated into four independent sources of spectral variability (basis curves), which in linear combination were able to reconstitute the experimental data set.  Stepwise spectral reconstruction was then utilized to isolate organic carbon and free iron oxide "basis" curves.  This enabled a good "global" measure of soil properties irrespective of soil type or brightness.  We anticipate the EOS-MODIS and HIRIS sensors to provide the spectral data needed for inversion of satellite data into soil surface properties and processes.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article

AB Although Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations are well-known in the literature, their evolution and kinematics are still poorly understood. Their behavior is often complex and characterized by small movements associated with steady-state creep, alternating with periods of stasis, or accelerating downslope movements that, in some cases, could result in sudden and catastrophic failure events. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is often required. In this work, we shed light on the complex geometry and kinematics of the Pisciotta DSGSD, a deep-seated roto-translational sliding involving structurally complex turbiditic rock mass and interacting with man-made infrastructures. To reveal the geometrical features and the spatial and temporal behavior of the analyzed phenomenon, a multidisciplinary investigation was performed. Typical DSGSD landforms were mapped employing in-situ surveys, aided by stereoscopic analysis of historical aerial images and high-resolution dronebased mapping. Structural data and ancillary ground-based surveys revealed the presence of a highly weathered and folded turbiditic sequence, with competent sandstone and calcarenite units alternated by tectonically disrupted, weak argillite and mudrock layers. Remote sensing measurements from optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data assessed the DSGSD's past and current kinematics, allowing to distinguish a prefailure period with accelerating displacement rates, a failure period with maximum displacement rates, and a current post-failure period with decelerating displacement rates. Analytical modeling established the deep reach (up to 85 m) of the studied DSGSD as it allowed the estimation of its bottom surface and volume, as verified by available boreholes and inclinometric measurements. Furthermore, numerical modeling outcomes highlighted how the progressive weakening and alteration of the DSGSD material, in conjunction with changes in groundwater dynamics, serve as the primary mechanisms driving the observed kinematics. The models also revealed the intricate interaction between the DSGSD and the neighboring infrastructures.

AB Australia's Great Western Woodlands are the largest intact temperate woodland ecosystem on Earth, spanning an area the size of the average European country. These woodlands are part of one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and, despite subsisting on just 200-400 mm of rainfall a year, can store considerable amounts of carbon. However, they face growing pressure from a combination of climate change and increasingly frequent and large wildfires, which have burned over a third of these slow-growing, fire-sensitive woodlands in last 50 years alone. To develop conservation strategies that bolster the long-term resilience of this unique ecosystem, we urgently need to understand how much old-growth woodland habitat remains intact and where it is distributed across this vast region. To tackle this challenge, we brought together data from an extensive network of field plots distributed across the region and combined this with information on vegetation 3D structure derived from drone, airborne and spaceborne LiDAR. Using this unique dataset, we developed a novel modelling framework to generate the first high-resolution maps of woodland tree size and age structure across the entire region. We found that 41.2% of the woodland habitat is covered by old-growth stands, equivalent to an area of approximately 39,187 km2. Only 10% of these old-growth woodlands fall within current protected areas managed by the state government. Instead, most remaining old-growth woodlands are found either within the Ngadju Indigenous Protected Area (26.9%) or outside of formal protected areas on leaseholds and privately owned lands (57.2%). Our maps of woodland size and age structure will help guide the targeted management and conservation of the Great Western Woodlands. Moreover, by developing a robust pipeline for integrating LiDAR data from multiple platforms, our study paves the way for mapping the 3D structure and carbon storage of open and heterogeneous woodland ecosystems from space.

AB With an identical design and build, the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI2) aboard Landsat-9 (L9) complements OLI observations by reducing the global revisit rate of Landsat to 8 days. This study takes advantage of near-coincident OLI2 and OLI observations obtained on 11-17 November 2021 to assess the relative quality of the standard United States Geological Survey (USGS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(t)) and atmospherically corrected reflectance (aquatic reflectance; rho(AR)(w)) products over bodies of water. The TOA assessment was carried out for all the visible bands, including the panchromatic band, as well as the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, whereas rho(AR)(w) products were analyzed in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands. The overlapping areas of OLI-OLI2 rho(w) product pairs were further analyzed for the rigor in corrections for the viewing geometry implemented in selected atmospheric correction (AC) processors, including SeaDAS, ACOLITE, and POLYMER, with products denoted as rho(AR)(w), rho(ac)(w), and rho(pol)(w) , respectively. Overall, we found the OLI2-OLI rho(t) products to be consistent within 0.4% in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR) bands except in the green band (561 nm), where OLI2 records similar to 0.8% larger values than OLI. The two SWIR bands (1610 and 2200 nm) were also found to agree within similar to 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, with OLI2 being lower in magnitude. The median differences in the standard rho(w) (rho(AR)(w)) were estimated to be similar to 2.4%, 1.5%, 2.3%, and 2.5% in the 443, 482, 561, and 655 nm bands, respectively, which are well within the accepted differences in cross-mission data merging schemes. Further, we show that OLI2's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 7-30% higher than that of OLI in all the bands, likely due to its 14-bit digitization rate, as compared to OLI's 12-bit digitization rate. Our self-consistency assessment of the AC processors for handling the differences in the view zenith angles (Delta VZA) and relative azimuth angles (Delta RAA) of OLI2 and OLI observations suggests that, overall, the processors account for the Sun-sensor geometry differently at different spectral bands. These differences (inconsistencies) amount to average median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) in rho(w) from 0.3 to 5.3% (e.g.,Delta rho(AR)(w) (443 nm, Delta VZA, Delta RAA) = rho(AR,OLI)(w) (443, +6.3,10) - rho(AR,OLI2)(w) (443, +3.9,-13) < 0.5%).More specifically, we found that SeaDAS provides the most optimal corrections for the angular variability as a function of VZA, rho(ac)(w) are most consistent for different ranges of RAAs, and POLYMER performs best in the 443 nm band. We surmise that future (and other existing) AC methods should be tested with Landsat-8/-9 underfly imagery to quantify their performance for tackling the variability in imaging geometry and minimize associated uncertainties. With several missions planned for launch by the end of this decade, it is further emphasized that post-launch tandem maneuvers are essential to creating harmonized multimission data products and, therefore, similar operations should be considered and extended to ensure a broad range of environmental conditions are captured for comprehensive cross-mission analyses.

AB The launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, And Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) in September 2018 provides the scientific community an opportunity to observe high-resolution and three-dimensional surface elevations with global coverage. ICESat-2's Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data product focuses on the along-track terrain and canopy heights observations at a 100 m x 11 m spatial resolution. This work expands on past ATL08 validation studies to assess a higher spatial resolution (30 m x 11 m) version of ATL08's height product. This new dataset enables higher resolution mapping and fusion with Landsat data, but has not previously been validated across large geographic extents. In this paper, we examine the accuracy of multi-resolution ICESat-2 ATL08 across North America boreal forests using Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS), an airborne laser ranging system as reference datasets. Overall, strong agreements of terrain elevation and canopy height were found between ATL08 and LVIS at both 100 m x 11 m (RMSEterrain = 2.35 m; biasterrain=-0.17 m; RMSEcanopy = 4.17 m; biascanopy = 0.08 m) and 30 m x 11 m (RMSEterrain = 3.19 m; biasterrain = 0.49; RMSEcanopy = 4.75 m; biascanopy = 0.88 m) spatial resolutions. We found the accuracy of high-resolution terrain and canopy height measurements were constrained by sensor and external conditions during the time of data acquisition with lower uncertainties observed from samples along high-intensity ground tracks and with low topography/slope variabilities. Through this work, we provide insight into the use of multi-resolution ICESat-2 ATL08 for terrain and canopy heights characterization in northern forests. The results found in our study serve as a benchmark for end users to select high-quality ATL08 for a variety of scientific applications.

AB Bull kelp populations in northern California declined drastically in response to the 2014-2016 marine heatwave, sea star wasting disease, and subsequently large increases in herbivorous purple urchin populations. Despite the regional kelp forest collapse, there were small, remnant populations where bull kelp was able to survive. Moderate resolution satellites (i.e., Landsat) have been important for creating long-term, large-scale time series of bull kelp forests, however, these have been shown to underestimate or entirely exclude refugia due to their low densities and proximity to the coastline. While measurements from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are spatially detailed, they are temporally limited and difficult to collect over regional scales. The development of CubeSat constellations has enabled a workaround for these tradeoffs, with global imagery available near-daily at meter-scale. We developed a method for mapping bull kelp canopy across the different sensor cohorts in the PlanetScope constellation. This required correcting surface reflectance measurements to account for differences in the spectral response functions among the sensors and leveraging the temporal frequency of PlanetScope data to increase the automation of classifying kelp canopy in imagery with increased noise. Using the PlanetScope derived kelp canopy extents, we identified locations where bull kelp refugia have persisted in northern California. We found that bull kelp refugia occupied about 2% of the total available habitat in the region and about 9.4% of the average canopy area observed prior to 2014. These areas may be critical to the success of kelp forest re-establishment in northern California, which increases their importance for ongoing monitoring, conservation, and restoration efforts.

AB Estimating crop leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, %) with the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is an effective method for detecting the nitrogen (N) deficiency in crops. It is challenging to remotely estimate LNC across growth stages and seasons with a general empirical model, since the complex change in canopy structure under N deficiencies and across growth stages affects the accuracy of the estimations. The canopy scattering coefficient (CSC), the ratio of the BRF to the directional area scattering factor (DASF), has been suggested to reduce the canopy structural effect on BRF. However, the DASF can only be calculated for closed canopies and is not applicable to the early growth stages of crops when the fields are sparsely vegetated. This study proposed a new method for decoupling the canopy structural effect and canopy BRF using the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV). NIRV is driven by the change in canopy structure while mitigates the soil contribution. The method was tested through six field experiments on ten farmers' fields of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) using both in-situ hyperspectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images. The results demonstrated that NIRV was closely related to the leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.79) across growth stages and seasons. The CSC was derived with NIRV based on the linear relationship between NIRV and DASF for the closed canopies. The LNC predicted by the NIRV-derived CSC (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.51 for in-situ hyperspectral data and R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.49 for UAV multispectral images) was more accurate than the results derived from the BRF (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.62 for in-situ hyperspectral data and R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.60 for UAV multispectral images) with the independent dataset, suggesting that correcting for the canopy structural effect with NIRV provided a new alternative for suppressing the impact of canopy structure on the canopy BRF. As NIRV is easily calculated with diverse remote sensing data sources, this study proved the potential of applying NIRV to improving the accuracy and transferability of the LNC prediction model at different scales.

AB By tracking the feature displacement between satellite images spaced approximately one year apart, surface runoff has been shown to have a long-term impact on the average ice flow of a land-terminating sector of Greenland. In this study, we revisit the multi-year trends in ice flow by assessing more carefully the impact of seasonal fluctuation in velocity on the annual mean ice velocity. We find that, depending on the length and period used to measure displacement, seasonal fluctuations do have an impact on observed velocities on up to 15%, and can affect decadal trends. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this fluctuation is small enough to confirm the general slowdown observed during the 2000-2012 period. Between 2012 and 2019, we find significant re-acceleration of low-lying glaciers tongue but velocity trends elsewhere are generally insignificant and not spatially consistent. Finally, we propose a more selective approach to recovering velocity trends using satellite imagery that involves using only measurements where the image pair starting date is before summer, in order to have comparable measurements for every year, sampling a melt season and the following winter.

AB The SM2RAIN algorithm developed a simple analytical relationship by inverting the soil-water equation to es-timate rainfall through the knowledge of soil moisture. The recently developed SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm offers an improvement in estimating rainfall by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the net water flux (NWF) model. The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture products were used to estimate rainfall and evaluate the reliability of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm compared to the SM2RAIN on a national scale. Besides, the impact of Land cover-Soil texture-Climate (LSC) characteristics and the intensity of rainfall (four classes of intensity) on the performance of algorithms were discussed. Five performance metrics, including Correlation Coefficient (R), Kling-Gupta (KGE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), False Alarm Ration (FAR), and Probability of Detection (POD) were used to validate the estimated cumulative 5-, 14-, and 30-day rainfall. Furthermore, the effect of evapotranspiration (ET) and drainage terms were investigated in the performance of rainfall estimation through the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm for the first time on a national scale. Results showed the rainfall estimations through the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm improved approximately up to 7.5% in each accumulation (e.g. rainfall aggregation intervals (AGGR) 5 to 14 and 14 to 30) based on R and KGE indices. In addition, the SM2RAIN-NWF improved rainfall estimations up to 50% based on the KGE index in the southern half of Iran (arid and semi-arid climate) compared to the SM2RAIN estimates. The comprehensive evaluation and uncertainty analysis of rainfall estimations under the supervised classification of 11 LSC and 4 rainfall classes also showed the calibration of the SM2RAIN-NWF was highly affected by environmental and climatic circumstances. Uncertainty analysis showed the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm can estimate rainfall more consistently in the five LSC classes namely 1) barren -clay loam-arid-desert, 2) barren-loam-arid-steppe, 3) barren-clay loam-arid-steppe, 4) urban-clay loam-arid -desert, and 5) urban-loam-arid-steppe. Similarly, estimating rainfall in the region with precipitation under 267 mm/year can be retrieved more reliably through the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm. Results obtained from the ET analysis revealed an insignificant (<4%) effect of this term in improving the performance of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm. Also, the NWF equation confirmed the paramount role of the drainage term in enhancing the accuracy of rainfall estimates compared to the SM2RAIN method.

AB Field spectroscopy is a rapid and non-destructive tool used for the estimation of nitrogen concentration (N%) of vegetation. Empirical and physically-based models are widely used for retrieving N%. However, model transferability to different times and locations, and feature redundancy remain the two key challenges of field spectroscopy analysis. Here we addressed these problems by developing a hybrid method (i.e., a combination of physically-based (PROSAIL) and empirical models) to retrieve N% in grasslands. We used a large spectral dataset with >6000 samples collected over 8 years (2009-2016) for grassland farms across New Zealand. The hybrid model combines the features derived from PROSAIL inversion and an empirical model and develops a predictive model using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm. The model performance is tested on spatially and temporally independent data and compared with PROSAIL and empirical models. The hybrid model achieves a higher performance with an RMSE (%N), R-2 and Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW) of 0.27, 0.78 and 0.26 as compared to empirical (RMSE = 0.28, R-2 = 0.77 and MPIW = 0.32) and physically-based models (RMSE = 0.33, R-2 = 0.65 and MPIW = 0.56). In addition, the hybrid model significantly outperforms the physically-based and empirical models during autumn (RMSE = 0.32, R-2 = 0.78 and MPIW = 0.11) and summer (RMSE = 0.27, R-2 = 0.80 and MPIW = 0.16) seasons.

AB Arctic rivers operate as integrators of northern high latitude regions, where large stocks of soil organic carbon (OC) are currently experiencing rapid warming. Here we show that tracking total OC in the Mackenzie Delta whose upstream catchment is underlain by permafrost soils is now possible using polar-orbiting satellite ocean color observations. A non-parametric trend analysis that is valid for hydrological data shows a significant in-crease in dissolved OC (DOC) as well as particulate OC (POC) concentrations in late summer (0.019 and 0.069 g m(-3) year(-1); p < 0.05 for both). Uncertainties of the satellite estimates of DOC and POC do not influence our results. These concentration increases are not related to changes in river discharge. Parallel increases of independent long-term (1979-2018) in situ measurements of thaw depth of the active layer, as well as meteorological and hydrological patterns suggest that these late summer increases can likely be explained by increasing inputs of permafrost OC. This study shows great promise for remote, large-scale detection of catchment-scale thaw impacts from space.

AB Knowledge about the forest canopy stratification is of essential importance for forest management and planning. Collecting structural information (e.g. natural regeneration) still depends on cost and labour intensive forest inventories with a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Remote sensing partly overcomes these limitations and particularly active sensors of type light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have proven their great potential of separating forest strata. The applicability of LiDAR metrics for the differentiation of the spruce dominated forest strata in Central Germany has not been tested yet. Additionally, studying the potential of Sentinel-2 metrics for the classification of forest strata is lacking too.
   In this study, we investigated the capabilities of six different classification approaches for the differentiation of five forest strata that are typical for the study region. Reference data were derived from forest inventory measurements surveyed on a dense 200 x 200 m grid. The six classification approaches were trained with fused and un-fused LiDAR and Sentinel-2 inferred metrics. The classification results were compared using the overall mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity via receivers operating characteristics of multi-class problems. We were interested in the classification abilities of Sentinel-2 metrics due to the obvious advantages of Sentinel-2 based metrics (free of charge, high spatio-temporal coverage). We assumed that the canopy structure determines the reflection on stand level and thus might facilitate the classification of different canopy strata. Beforehand, it was important to examine the influence of distinctly imbalanced and collinear reference data on the classification results.
   We found that the Random Forest classifier most accurately separated the five forest strata with a mean overall accuracy of 83.3% (Kappa = 76.2%). These values were achieved from balanced training data and the classification capability was confirmed by classification results from an independent test data set. Fused predictors of active (LiDAR) and passive (Sentinel-2) remote sensing revealed no substantial improvement in the classification accuracy due to the dominant role of LiDAR metrics. Herein, we identified that especially the height variability, top height, portion of LiDAR-returns between 2 m and 10 m and the standard deviation of the return number between the 25th and 50th height percentile, predominately contributed to the classification accuracy. Classification results purely based on Sentinel-2 metrics revealed a rather small overall mean accuracy of 54.7%. The metrics (e.g. median, variance, entropy) were derived from Sentinel-2 indices, covering the visible and near to short infrared spectrum. Variable importance computations unraveled a detectable but minor contribution of MSI, TCG, NDVI to the classification result. Finally, our data driven observations illustrated serious drawbacks associated to data imbalance, collinearity and autocorrelation and presented practical guidance to cope with these issues.

AB High spatial resolution commercial satellite data provide new opportunities for terrestrial monitoring. The recent availability of near-daily 3 m observations provided by the PlanetScope constellation enables mapping of small and spatially fragmented burns that are not detected at coarser spatial resolution. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential for automated PlanetScope 3 m burned area mapping. The PlanetScope sensors have no onboard calibration or short-wave infrared bands, and have variable overpass times, making them challenging to use for large area, automated, burned area mapping. To help overcome these issues, a U-Net deep learning algorithm was developed to classify burned areas from two-date Planetscope 3 m image pairs acquired at the same location. The deep learning approach, unlike conventional burned area mapping algorithms, is applied to image spatial subsets and not to single pixels and so incorporates spatial as well as spectral information. Deep learning requires large amounts of training data. Consequently, transfer learning was undertaken using pre-existing Landsat-8 derived burned area reference data to train the U-Net that was then refined with a smaller set of PlanetScope training data. Results across Africa considering 659 PlanetScope radiometrically normalized image pairs sensed one day apart in 2019 are presented. The U-Net was first trained with different numbers of randomly selected 256 x 256 30 m pixel patches extracted from 92 pre-existing Landsat-8 burned area reference data sets defined for 2014 and 2015. The U-Net trained with 300,000 Landsat patches provided about 13% 30 m burn omission and commission errors with respect to 65,000 independent 30 m evaluation patches. The U-Net was then refined by training on 5,000 256 x 256 3 m patches extracted from independently interpreted Plan-etScope burned area reference data. Qualitatively, the refined U-Net was able to more precisely delineate 3 m burn boundaries, including the interiors of unburned areas, and better classify "faint " burned areas indicative of low combustion completeness and/or sparse burns. The refined U-Net 3 m classification accuracy was assessed with respect to 20 independently interpreted PlanetScope burned area reference data sets, composed of 339.4 million 3 m pixels, with low 12.29% commission and 12.09% omission errors. The dependency of the U-Net classification accuracy on the burned area proportion within 3 m pixel 256 x 256 patches was also examined, and patches < 6.5% burned were less accurately classified. A regression analysis between the proportion of 30 m grid cells classified as burned against the proportion labelled as burned in the 3 m reference maps showed high agreement (r2 = 0.91, slope = 0.93, intercept < 0.001), indicating that the commission and omission errors largely compensate at 30 m resolution.

AB From its initial measurements 20 years ago, the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) has produced large validation data sets to assess the ocean color satellite data records. This study, applied to the standard atmospheric correction algorithm l2gen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, analyses the populations of residuals (differences between matching satellite and field data) of remote sensing reflectance R-RS and, secondarily, aerosol optical thickness za, and their validation statistics associated with data collected at seven AERONET-OC sites located in European coastal regions for six satellite missions. Validation statistics do not appear particularly sensitive to observation conditions, represented by viewing and solar geometry, aerosol optical thickness tau(a), angstrom ngstrom exponent or water properties indexed by R-RS, the most obvious exceptions being a systematic increase of the residuals for high solar zenith angles for all missions and sites. Residuals of R-RS and tau(a) tend to be inversely correlated as deviations in aerosol radiance and water-leaving radiance compensate each other. The spectra of a R-RS uncertainty estimate sigma decrease in a monotonous manner from 0.7 to 1.5 10(-3) sr(-1) for wavelengths around 412 nm to 0.1-0.35 10(-3) sr(-1) around 667 nm, with sigma usually relatively high for waters associated with high amplitudes of R-RS. At 412 nm, sigma for tau(a) is mostly in the interval 0.03-0.04. For R-RS, variations across missions of a or of the relative differences between satellite and field data are overall smaller than variations across sites, which suggests that the products derived from various missions are rather consistent at a given location when processed with the considered algorithm. For a given mission, R-RS residuals are well correlated between bands (inter-band correlation coefficient mostly larger than 0.5), which has implications on the propagation of uncertainties through bio-optical algorithms. For a given wavelength, residuals are correlated between missions to various degrees (most often with inter-mission correlation coefficients larger than 0.5). Besides implications as far as uncertainties of multi-mission merged products are concerned, this inter-mission correlation among residuals suggest that the residuals are not random and could be reduced.

AB Recent advances in remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have provided an exciting and promising opportunity for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies mainly focused on the linear correlation between SIF and GPP and the slope of the SIF-GPP relationship, both of which lack rigorous consideration of the seasonal trajectories of SIF and GPP. Here, we investigated the timing of seasonal peaks of far-red SIF and GPP in soybean fields by integrating tower data, satellite data, and process-based Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE, v2.0) model simulations. We found inconsistency between the seasonal peak timing of far-red SIF and GPP in three of four soybean fields based on tower far-red SIF and eddy-covariance measurements. In particular, far-red SIF reached its seasonal maximum 14-17 days earlier than GPP. This far-red SIF-GPP difference in peak timing degraded the correlation between sunny-day far-red SIF and GPP at daily scale (Pearson r = 0.83-0.87 at the site with 14-17 days difference and Pearson r = 0.96 at the site with no difference), and it can be explained by a divergence in the seasonality between absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (Chl(Canopy)). We found that the seasonality of far-red SIF - a byproduct of the light reactions of photosynthesis - was primarily controlled by APAR, whereas GPP seasonality was dominated by Chl(Canopy). Further, SCOPE model simulations showed that the seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) could affect the different peak timing of SIF and GPP and consequently the seasonal relationship between far-red SIF and GPP. A further increase in LAI after the fraction of light absorption (FPAR) saturates and a later peak of Chl(Leaf) compared to LAI results in a later peak of GPP compared to far-red SIF. More horizontal leaf angles can further exacerbate this difference. Our results advance mechanistic understanding of the SIF-GPP relationships and combining chlorophyll content information with SIF could potentially improve remote-sensing-based GPP estimation.

AB Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is widely used to measure deformation of the Earth's surface over large areas and long time periods. A common strategy to overcome coherence loss in long-term interferograms is to use multiple multilooked shorter interferograms, which can cover the same time period but maintain coherence. However, it has recently been shown that using this strategy can introduce a bias (also referred to as a "fading signal") in the interferometric phase. We isolate the signature of the phase bias by constructing "daisy chain" sums of short-term interferograms of different length covering identical 1-year time intervals. This shows that the shorter interferograms are more affected by this phenomenon and the degree of the effect depends on ground cover types; cropland and forested pixels have significantly larger bias than urban pixels and the bias for cropland mimics subsidence throughout the year, whereas forests mimics subsidence in the spring and heave in the autumn. We, propose a method for correcting the phase bias, based on the assumption, borne out by our observations, that the bias in an interferogram is linearly related to the sum of the bias in shorter interferograms spanning the same time. We tested the algorithm over a study area in western Turkey by comparing average velocities against results from a phase linking approach, which estimates the single primary phases from all the interferometric pairs, and has been shown to be almost insensitive to the phase bias. Our corrected velocities agree well with those from a phase linking approach. Our approach can be applied to global compilations of short-term interferograms and provides accurate long-term velocity estimation without a requirement for coherence in long-term interferograms.

AB The oak wilt disease caused by the invasive fungal pathogen Bretziella fagacearum is one of the greatest threats to oak-dominated forests across the Eastern United States. Accurate detection and monitoring over large areas are necessary for management activities to effectively mitigate and prevent the spread of oak wilt. Canopy spectral reflectance contains both phylogenetic and physiological information across the visible near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) ranges that can be used to identify diseased red oaks. We develop partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models using airborne hyperspectral reflectance to detect diseased canopies and assess the importance of VNIR, SWIR, phylogeny, and physiology for oak wilt detection. We achieve high accuracy through a three-step phylogenetic process in which we first distinguish oaks from other species (90% accuracy), then red oaks from white oaks (Quercus macrocarpa) (93% accuracy), and, lastly, infected from noninfected trees (80% accuracy). Including SWIR wavelengths increased model accuracy by ca. 20% relative to models based on VIS-NIR wavelengths alone; using a phylogenetic approach also increased model accuracy by ca. 20% over a single-step classification. SWIR wavelengths include spectral information important in differentiating red oaks from other species and in distinguishing diseased red oaks from healthy red oaks. We determined the most important wavelengths to identify oak species, red oaks, and diseased red oaks. We also demonstrated that several multispectral indices associated with physiological decline can detect differences between healthy and diseased trees. The wavelengths in these indices also tended to be among the most important wavelengths for disease detection within PLS-DA models, indicating a convergence of the methods. Indices were most significant for detecting oak wilt during late August, especially those associated with canopy photosynthetic activity and water status. Our study suggests that coupling phylogenetics, physiology, and canopy spectral reflectance provides an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach that enables detection of forest diseases at large scales. These results have potential for direct application by forest managers for detection to initiate actions to mitigate the disease and prevent pathogen spread.

AB Recent studies have suggested that global climate models tend to underestimate dust particle size in particular, the very coarse mode, leading to an underestimated direct radiative effect (DRE) of dust in the longwave (LW) thermal infrared (TIR) region. However, the magnitude of LW DRE remains highly uncertain, because of limited observations of dust optical depth at the TIR (DAOD(TIR)). This study presents a simple approach to retrieve the DAOD(TIR) over the oceans during nighttime through synergistic use of observations from the Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), both onboard of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission. For each cloud-free dust-laden profile identified by the IIR-CALIOP observation, a Lookup-Table (LUT) of the 10.6 mu m IIR band brightness temperatures (BT) difference (dBT) under different DAOD(TIR) with respect to their dust-free BTs is constructed based on the CALIOP retrieved dust vertical profile and a priori dust scattering properties using a fast radiative transfer model. Then the DAOD(TIR) is retrieved by projecting the IIR-observed dBT on the LUT. Sensitivity studies show that the DAOD(TIR) retrieval at 10.6 mu m is more susceptible to the dust particle size distribution (PSD) assumption than dust refractive indices. To estimate the uncertainty caused by PSD assumption, two DAOD(TIR) retrieval products, one based on the dust PSD from the AERONET at Cape Verde and the other on an in situ measured PSD from the recent Fennec campaign, are provided. The retrieval uncertainty is mainly contributed by the BT difference between the observation and simulation using auxiliary atmospheric data. The climatology of the retrieval from 2013 to 2019 shows reasonable spatiotemporal variations of DAOD(TIR) with the global-averaged value of 0.008 and 0.013 based on different pre-assumed dust PSDs. Climatological results agree reasonably well with two independent DAOD(TIR) retrieval products based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) over the active dust transport regions, such as North and Tropical Atlantic (r = 0.9 and r = 0.8) and Indian Ocean (r = 0.8). The seasonal and interannual variation is also well-compared (r = 0.76) with AERONET coarse-mode AOD at 97 selected sites. The synergic CALIOP observation allows the retrieved DAOD(TIR) to directly compare with the extrapolated DAOD(TIR) from DAOD in the visible (i.e., 532 nm), which helps evaluate the observational constraints on DAOD(TIR). Our study clearly reveals that the retrieved DAOD(TIR) from IIR is much less susceptible to various uncertainties than converted results from CALIOP. It also offers a unique prospect of collocated active lidar and passive IR observations for retrieving dust DAOD(TIR).

AB The arctic and boreal biomes are changing as temperatures increase, including changes in the type, frequency, intensity, and seasonality of disturbances. However, our understanding of the frequency, extent, and causes of disturbance events remains incomplete. Disturbances such as fire, forest harvest, drought, wind, flooding, and insects and pathogens occur at different frequencies and severities, posing challenges to characterize and assess them under a single framework. We used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm on all available Landsat observations from 1984 to 2014 to detect land cover and land condition change. We mapped the following causes of disturbances annually across the study domain of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE): fire, logging, and pest damage. Differences between Landsat Tasseled Cap (TC) values pre- and post-disturbance were used in a random forest classifier to map causal agents. For forested ecosystems, we mapped causal agents including fire, insect, and logging. In areas that were not forest before disturbance, only the fire class was mapped. The result shows that multidimensional spectral-temporal change information is useful for mapping the causes of disturbance in arctic and boreal biomes. We employed two rounds of post-processing and used the information obtained from the comparison between the map and reference data to improve the final map. The user's and producer's accuracies of an aggregated disturbance map were 94.6% (+/- 2.37%) and 89.3% (+/- 21.78%) (95% confidence intervals in parenthesis). When evaluating the causal agents, insect damage was found the most challenging to map and validate. We estimated that 10.8% of the ABoVE core domain was disturbed between 1987 and 2012, with a margin of error of 0.5% at the 95% confidence level. Rates of disturbance due to logging remained constant over time, while fires were more episodic, and insect damage was highest between 2005 and 2010. Overall, fires affected 8.8% of the study area, while logging was 1.4% and insect damage 0.6%. Our maps indicate that pest damage became a significant issue after 2000, but it was more severe for forest ecosystems in Western Canada than in Alaska.

TI Using radiant intensity to characterize the anisotropy of
   satellite-derived city light at night

AB Recent studies have described the anisotropy of ALAN based on statistical analysis of a quadratic model-based relationship between radiances derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band sensor onboard Suomi-NPP and viewing zenith angle (VZA) (Li et al., 2019). Contrary to conventional wisdom, the satellite-observed radiance of ALAN always decreases at first and then increase with VZA, especially for high building areas. This leads to a socalled 'cold-spot' effect (i.e. radiance reaches local minimum in a specific VZA) in the VZA-radiance relationship, one that has not been understood using existing remote sensing methods. In this paper, we propose using radiant intensity - a measure of light power in a specific direction- to characterize the anisotropy of satellite-observed artificial lights at night (ALAN). Accordingly, we propose a new study design based on analysis across fourteen global cities. A linear regression model describing the relationship between VZA and radiant intensity resulted in an averaged regression R-2 between 0.26 and 0.73 for the cities, suggesting a decay of radiant intensity with increased VZA. We then introduced a cosine-corrected linear model to describe the VZA-radiance relationship, which is mathematically transformed from the linear VZA-intensity model. Our results suggest that the 'cold spot' effect in the VZA-radiance relationship is consistent with the revealed phenomenon that the radiant intensity decays with increased VZA. We also constructed indexes related to urban morphology derived from LiDAR data, including the Blocking Index (BI), the Standard Deviation of Building Height (SDBI) and Average Building Height (ABH). These variables were all moderately or strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient < -0.45) to the Change Index (CI), which describes the anisotropic pattern of ALAN in the VZA-intensity relationship, in the four U.S. cities where LiDAR data is accessible. We conclude that radiant intensity is a suitable physical index to characterize the directional distribution of ALAN that can help understand the anisotropy of ALAN.

AB The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectraltemporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7% to 90.1% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., % red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.

AB Coastal wetlands are main components of the "blue carbon" ecosystems in coastal zones. Salt-marsh biomass is especially important regarding climate-change mitigation. Generating high precision biomass maps for evalu-ating the ecological functions of coastal wetlands is essential; however, conducting accurate biomass inversions with limited in situ observations from coastal wetlands is challenging. We propose a generative adversarial network with a constrained factor model (GAN-CF) for expanding limited in situ salt-marsh biomass observa-tions. We used Sentinel-2 images and a deep belief network based on the conjugate gradient method (CG-DBN) for obtaining land-cover maps and the salt-marsh distribution (species: Phragmites australis, Suaeda glauca, Spartina alterniflora, and mixed species dominated by Tamarix chinensis) in the study area. This study bridges in situ hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 multispectral data by a satellite-band equivalent conversion model. The biomass and multispectral data derived from Sentinel-2 were used as input for the proposed GAN-CF model, which produced and constrained the generated samples based on the features (i.e., spectra, vegetation index, and biomass) of the in situ observations. Aboveground biomass (AGB) maps at 10-m spatial resolution were produced by constructing multiple linear regression models (MLRMs) based on the generated samples of each salt-marsh type using Sentinel-2 images. The quantity and richness of the generated samples improved the AGB estimations in the study area. The inversion accuracy of S. alterniflora was significantly improved (RMSE = 3.71 Mg/ha); the estimated AGB was strongly related to the in situ observations (R = 0.923). The estimated AGB was validated using in situ observations. The total amount of salt-marsh AGB in the study area in 2019 was estimated at 2.36 x 10(5) Mg, with 7.95 Mg/ha average. The salt-marsh biomass in decreasing order was as follows: P. australis (12.7 Mg/ha) > S. alterniflora (11.5 Mg/ha) > mixed species (8.97 Mg/ha) > S. glauca (2.18 Mg/ha). The salt-marsh area in decreasing order was as follows: S. glauca (10,410 ha) > P. australis (7320 ha) > mixed species (6740 ha) > S. alterniflora (5240 ha). By a feasibility analysis we estimated the biomass based on the Sentinel-2 data covering the Yellow River delta wetland in May, July, and September 2019 and the Jiaozhou Bay wetland in September 2019 by using the generated samples. The generated samples based on the 2013-2019 in situ ob-servations constitute a salt-marsh biomass database, which can be useful for quantifying the regional carbon storage and ecological restoration monitoring.

AB NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD). This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI's footprint-level (similar to 25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI's waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.

AB Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) undergoes significant thawing and degradation, which affects the hydrological processes, ecosystems and infrastructure stability. The ground deformation, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, can be quantified via geodetic observations, especially using multi-temporal InSAR techniques. The previous InSAR studies, however, either rely on data-driven models or Stefan-equation-based models, which are both lacking of consideration of the spatial-temporal variations of freeze-thaw processes. Furthermore, the magnitudes and patterns of the permafrost-related ground deformation over large scales (e.g., 1 x 10(5) km(2) or larger) is still insufficiently quantified or poorly understood. In this study, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of freeze-thaw processes, we develop a permafrost-tailored InSAR approach by incorporating a MODIS-land-surface-temperature-integrated ground deformation model to reconstruct the seasonal and long-term deformation. Utilizing the approach to Sentinel-1 SAR images on the vast regions of about 140,000 km(2) of the central QTP during 2014-2019, we observe widespread seasonal deformation up to about 80 mm with a mean value of about 10 mm and linear subsidence up to 20 mm/year. We apply the geographical detector to determine the controlling factors on the permafrost-related deformation. We find that the slope angle is the primary controller on the seasonal deformation: strong magnitudes and variations of seasonal deformation are most pronounced in flat or gentle-slope regions. The aspect angle, vegetation and soil bulk density exhibit a certain correlation with seasonal deformation as well. Meanwhile, we find that a linear subsidence is higher in the regions with high ground ice content and warm permafrost. It indicates that warm and ice-rich permafrost regions are more vulnerable to extensive long-term subsidence. We also observe that the cold permafrost regions experience lower linear subsidence even with high ground ice content, which indicate ice loss is limited. Thus, we infer that under continuously warming, the transition from cold permafrost to warm permafrost may lead to more extensive ground ice melting. Moreover, the strong subsidence/uplift signals surrounding some lakes suggesting that the change of local hydrological conditions may induce localized permafrost degradation/aggradation. Our study demonstrates the capability of the permafrost-tailored InSAR approach to quantify the permafrost freeze-thaw dynamics as well as their spatial-temporal patterns over large scales in vast permafrost areas.

AB Precise information on tree species composition is critical for forest management and conservation, but mapping tree species with satellite data over large areas is still a challenge. Since 2017, Sentinel-2A/B provide multispectral time series with global coverage at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This is a new opportunity for mapping tree species over large areas that has not yet been fully explored. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5%, ranged between 98.9% and 66.8%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible.

AB The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is the most recent U.S. geostationary satellite and has improved resolution and potential for land surface monitoring over previous GOES sensors. The ABI reflectance has diurnal variation due to surface reflectance anisotropy that can be significant, particularly when ABI observations are sensed under hot-spot sensing conditions when the solar and viewing directions coincide. The incidence and magnitude of the hot-spot signature in geostationary satellite data has not been well documented. In this study all the available GOES-16 ABI observations acquired every 15 min in 2018, and every 10 min in 2020, over the Conterminous United States, the southern states of Canada, and the northern states of Mexico, were examined. First, hot-spot sensing conditions were identified by finding ABI 1 km observations with scattering angles ((c)) > 175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees. ABI observations sensed near or in the hot-spot ((c) >175 degrees) were found to occur across the study area but only over a 36 day period in the spring (days 46-81 in 2018, and 47-82 in 2020) and over a 36 or 37 day period in the autumn (days 263-299 in 2018, and 264-299 in 2020). Considering either season in each year, about 3.4%, 1.2%, 0.5%, 0.14%, 0.0015%, and 0.000015% of the daytime observations were acquired with (c) >175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees, respectively. For certain days up to 5.85%, 3.32%, 2.04%, 0.65%, 0.01%, and 0.0001% of the daytime ABI observations across the study area were sensed with (c) > 175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees, respectively. These incidence percentages are not negligible. Even with the strictest hot-spot scattering angle definition ((c) >179.99 degrees) there were 3985 and 4484 hot-spot observations sensed in the spring and autumn of 2018, and 4753 and 5252 hot-spot observations sensed in the spring and autumn of 2020. The dates, times, and locations of the 2018 and 2020 hot-spots acquired with (c) >179.99 degrees are tabulated so that readers may obtain hot-spot ABI data for their own investigations. Second, the magnitude of the hot-spot reflectance in the ABI data was quantified by the difference between the ABI reflectance acquired in the hot-spot ((c) >179.99 degrees) and in the ABI observations sensed immediately before and after. A total of 1833 hot-spot observations in ten geographically elliptical regions (six in 2020 and four in 2018) over land each composed of >120 ABI observations acquired where the ABI reflectance appeared to be unambiguously cloud-free, cloud shadow-free, and uncontaminated by haze or smoke, were considered. For the 2020 ABI data, the hot-spot peak was characterized by an up to 36%, 38%, 42%, and 43% increase in red (0.64 mu m), near-infrared (NIR, 0.86 mu m), short-wave infrared 1 (SWIR1, 1.61 mu m), and SWIR2 (2.2 mu m) reflectance, respectively, for a 2.48 degrees scattering angle difference in the 10 min between successive ABI observations. For the 2018 ABI data, the hot-spot peak was characterized by an up to 43%, 46%, 47%, and 45% increase in red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 reflectance, respectively, for a 3.73 degrees change in scattering angle in the 15 min between successive ABI observations. The magnitude of the GOES-16 ABI hot-spot is significant and given its non-negligible incidence in the spring and autumn over north America should be taken into consideration for terrestrial applications.

AB Mangrove forests have witnessed significant changes resulted from both anthropogenic and natural disturbances in the last four decades. Although a few attempts have been reported, effective methods that can repeatedly generate large-scale mangrove maps on a timely basis are still lacking due to the difficulty in gathering sufficient training samples in large geographical areas. In this study, we have addressed three objectives in the following manner: (1) we aim to develop a method to automatically collect ample mangrove training samples; Corre-spondingly, we developed an automatic training sample collection method which extracted unchanged mangrove samples from a historical mangrove map; In addition, we employed a region growing method to include more diversified training samples; (2) we strive to foster compatible classifiers that can leverage the collected one-class training samples; To this end, we came up with two representative one-class classifiers: the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), and the Positive and Unlabeled Learning algorithm (PUL); (3) we endeavor to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of training samples, classifiers, and input images; As a result, we developed 32 classification models by varying four different variables: training samples (unchanged vs. expanded), input data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2), classifiers (SVDD vs. PUL), and study sites (Florida, the United States and Guangxi, China). We found that our developed automatic training sample collection methods performed well (user's accuracy >97%). Inter-annual NDVI combined with geometric restrictions warranted the effective extraction of unchanged training samples while the region growing method further reduced the omission due to its addition of recently emerged mangroves. In addition, PUL performed better than SVDD. This is attributed to the fact that PUL draws upon not only mangrove samples, but also unlabeled ones unaccounted for in SVDD. Lastly, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 is recommended among all the compared models. In sum-mary, we developed an effective method to automatically extract mangrove training samples, based on which a one-class classification method for large-scale mangrove mapping is made possible. We envision our methods will contribute to a wide spectrum of timely large-scale mangrove mapping tasks.

AB Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is a subtle but informative optical signal of vegetation photosynthesis. Remotely sensed SIF integrates environmental, physiological and structural changes that alter photosynthesis at leaf, plant and canopy scales. Radiative transfer models are ideally suited to investigate the complex sources of variability in the SIF signal to guide the interpretation of SIF retrievals from airborne and space-borne platforms. Here, we coupled the Fluspect-Cx model of leaf optical properties and chlorophyll-a fluorescence with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to upscale SIF from individual leaves to three-dimensional (3D) structurally explicit canopies. For one-dimensional homogeneous (turbid-like) canopies, DART-SIF was nearly identical to SIF simulated in two existing models, SCOPE and mSCOPE (RMSE <0.221 W.m(-2).mu m(-1).sr(-1)). DART simulations in geometrically explicit 3D canopies offered four important insights regarding the influence of vegetation structure on the multiangular top-of-canopy SIF signal. First, changes in the 3D canopy architecture of maize crops, represented by leaf density (leaf area index), and plant clumping (canopy closure) had a larger impact on SIF than the modelled photosynthetic efficiency distinction between sun-adapted and shade-adapted foliage. Second, clumping of leaves at the crop and stand levels was identified as one of the key driving factors of multi-angular anisotropy of red and farred SIF (686 and 740 nm) for both maize and eucalyptus canopies. Third, non-photosynthetic woody material had a significant impact on top-of-canopy SIF in modelled 3D forest stands. Wood shadowing decreased the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green leaves, and consequently the SIF emissions, by 10% in sparse and 17% in dense eucalyptus stands. The wood obstruction (blocking) effect, quantified as a relative difference of SIF escape probabilities from canopies with and without wood in the nadir viewing direction, decreased far-red SIF by 4-6% but it had a smaller and sometimes positive influence (by less than 2%) on red SIF. Fourth, DART 3D radiative budget profiles revealed that the majority of the SIF signal from a dense eucalyptus stand originated from the top 25% of the simulated canopy. Interestingly, the introduction of bark-covered woody elements did not alter the simulated balance and omnidirectional escape factor of red SIF in this upper canopy part but did raise significantly both of them in case of far-red SIF. These results demonstrate the importance of 3D radiative transfer and radiative budget simulations for investigating SIF interactions in structurally complex plant canopies and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal and multi-angular remote sensing SIF observations.

AB We develop a Bayesian Land Surface Phenology (LSP) model and examine its performance using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) observations derived from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. Building on previous work, we propose a double logistic function that, once couched within a Bayesian model, yields posterior distributions for all LSP parameters. We assess the efficacy of the Normal, Truncated Normal, and Beta likelihoods to deliver robust LSP parameter estimates. Three case studies are presented and used to explore aspects of the proposed model. The first case study, conducted over forested pixels within an HLS tile, explores choice of likelihood and space-time varying HLS data availability for long-term average LSP parameter point and uncertainty estimation. The second case study, conducted over the same pixels using only 2018 data, compares annual LSP parameter estimates from our proposed models with those generated using methods described in Bolton et al. (2020). The third case study, conducted on a small area of interest within the HLS tile on an annual time-step (2014-2019), further examines the impact of sample size and choice of likelihood on annual LSP parameter estimates in addition to assessing potential for the proposed models to inform LSP change detection analysis. Results indicate that while the Truncated Normal and Beta likelihoods are theoretically preferable when the vegetation index is bounded, all three likelihoods performed similarly when the number of index observations is sufficiently large and values are not near the index bounds. The case studies demonstrate how pixel-level LSP parameter posterior distributions can be used to propagate uncertainty through subsequent analysis. As a companion to this article, we provide an open-source R package rsBayes and supplementary data and code used to reproduce the analysis results. The proposed model specification and software implementation delivers computationally efficient, statistically robust, and inferentially rich LSP parameter posterior distributions at the pixel-level across massive raster time series datasets. Modeling functions in the rsBayes package and supplementary code sections are threaded, allowing for the use of multiple processing cores to further speed up model fitting for massive datasets. Using a 64 CPU workstation, the first case study analysis took similar to 3 days to run using the Beta likelihood model. However, processing time decreases linearly as the number of CPU cores increases. We expect that run times for this LSP modeling approach will decrease substantially as the power of new computing systems increases over time.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) vegetation canopy structure plays an important role in the way radiation interacts with the land surface. Accurately representing this process in Earth System models (ESMs) is crucial for the modeling of the global carbon, energy, and water cycles and hence future climate projections. Despite the importance of accounting for 3D canopy structure, the inability to represent such complexity at regional and global scales has impeded a successful implementation into ESMs. An alternative approach is to use an implicit clumping index to account for the horizontal heterogeneity in vegetation canopy representations in ESMs at global scale. This paper evaluates how modeled hyperspectral shortwave radiation partitioning of the terrestrial biosphere, as well as Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) are impacted when a clumping index parameterization is incorporated in the radiative transfer scheme of a new generation ESM, the Climate Model Alliance (CliMA). An accurate hyperspectral radiative transfer representation within ESMs is critical for accurately using of satellite data to confront, constrain, and improve land model processes. The newly implemented scheme is compared to Monte Carlo calculations for idealized scenes from the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison for the Project for Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterizations (RAMI4PILPS), for open forest canopies both with and without snow on the ground. Results indicate that it is critical to account for canopy structural heterogeneity when calculating hyperspectral radiation transfer. The RMSE in shortwave radiation is reduced for reflectance (25%), absorptance (66%), and transmittance (75%) compared to the scenario without considering clumping. Calculated SIF is validated against satellite remote sensing data with the recently launched NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) 3, showing that including vertical and horizontal canopy structure when deriving SIF can improve model predictions in up to 51% in comparison to the scenario without clumping. By adding a clumping index into the CliMA-Land model, the relationship between canopy structure and SIF, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), hyperspectral radiative transfer, and viewing geometry at the canopy scale can be explored in detail.

AB Arctic glaciers and ice caps (GIC) are losing mass rapidly, and this process is expected to continue during the 21st century owing to polar amplification of climate warming. Here, we use seven years of CryoSat-2 swath interferometric altimetry to track changes in the volume of Arctic GIC. From these data, we produce a pan-Arctic assessment of GIC mass imbalance, and we partition their losses into signals associated with atmospheric processes and glacier dynamics. Between 2010 and 2017, Arctic GIC lost 609 +/- 7 Gt of ice, contributing 0.240 +/- 0.007 mm per year to global sea level rise. While surface ablation is responsible for 87% of losses across the Arctic, dynamic imbalance is increasing in the Barents and Kara Sea region where it now accounts for 43% of total ice loss. Arctic GIC's dynamic imbalance is associated with a northward shift of Atlantic climate, and this effect should be considered in global sea level projections.

AB Rapid climate warming has widely been considered as the main driver of recent increases in Arctic tundra productivity. Field observations and remote sensing both show that tundra "greening" has been widespread, but heterogeneity in regional and landscape-scale trends suggest that additional controls are mediating the response of tundra vegetation to warming. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity in the western Canadian Arctic and biophysical variables by analyzing trends in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from nonparametric regression of annual Landsat surface reflectance composites. We used Random Forests classification and regression tree modelling to predict the trajectory and magnitude of greening from 1984 to 2016 and identify biophysical controls. More than two-thirds of our study area showed statistically significant increases in vegetation productivity, but observed changes were heterogeneous, occurring most rapidly within areas of the Southern Arctic that were: (1) dominated by dwarf and upright shrub cover types, (2) moderately sloping, and (3) located at lower elevation. These findings suggest that the response of tundra vegetation to warming is mediated by regional- and landscape-scale variation in microclimate, topography and soil moisture, and physiological differences among plant functional groups. Our work highlights the potential of the joint analysis of annual remotely sensed vegetation indices and broad-scale biophysical data to understand spatial variation in tundra vegetation change.

AB Individual tree identification is a key step for forest surveying and monitoring. To identify individual trees with airborne LiDAR data, a local maximum (LM) filter technique is typically performed. With LM, the highest point in a filtering window is generally considered to represent the tree position. This assumption, however, has great limitations, especially for mixed forests. To address this problem, we developed a new approach, the cluster center of higher points (CCHP), for tree position detection with LiDAR data. CCHP assumes that a tree position is located at the clustering center of higher points within a spatial neighborhood, and the center can be detected by a location-based recursive algorithm. The developed CCHP method was applied to a simulated forest and then verified in two real urban forests. In comparison with the variable window-sized LM filter method and layer stacking method, CCHP successfully identified 97% of trees in the simulated forest, while only 78% and 81% of the trees were recognized by LM and layer stacking methods respectively. The average absolute and relative offsets of CCHP are 0.33 m and 6.59%, respectively, and over 80% of the detected trees have an offset of less than 10% of the tree crown radius. CCHP also correctly detected 93.80% and 88.74% of individual trees in the first and second real forests, respectively, but the detection rates from the variable window-sized LM approach and layer stacking were less than 80%. In addition, the tree positions located by CCHP are considerably more accurate than the other two methods. Therefore, CCHP is proven to be promising for detecting individual tree positions from airborne LiDAR data for both simulated and real forests.

AB Extending from central California to Alaska, bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) forms seasonal kelp forests that are iconic coastal ecosystems in much of the eastern Pacific. Historical and ongoing field surveys and aerial imagery are used to provide biological data on kelp canopy cover and health, but satellite remote sensing provides the opportunity to generate consistent, long-term datasets over a large spatial scale. Robust satellite-based timeseries measurements of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) are available for much of the California coastline (e.g., Santa Barbara to Santa Cruz), but there have been no equivalent publications for bull kelp. Recent loss of bull kelp in northern California emphasized the need for more expansive long-term monitoring of canopy trends. We tested various kelp classification approaches using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to Landsat imagery, which allowed sufficient temporal and spatial data collection during bull kelp's narrow seasonal maximum, and compare with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) aerial survey canopy area product. We addressed five main topics that have relevance to enabling Landsat in long-term monitoring of bull kelp canopy coverage in northern California: (1) the effect of MESMA configurations applied to Landsat imagery, including software dependencies and endmember configurations, (2) comparison of Landsat to traditional surveys, (3) differences across Landsat sensors, (4) tidal influence on canopy area, and (5) trends in the decadal timeseries. We found that there was no statistical difference (p = 0.53) between MESMA platforms (IDL-based and a Python-scripted method; RMSE 1.5 km(2) or 17.6% when normalized by the range in CDFW), and that a 7-endmember MESMA model provided the lowest RMSE (1.4 km(2) or 16.9%). Furthermore, while tidal phases can submerge or emerge kelp canopy and thus potentially affect kelp detection, we found a weak and statistically insignificant correlation between tides and performance of our remote estimate of kelp canopy area. Canopy estimations from Landsat-8 images yielded a higher NRMSE than Landsat-4 and -5 images, but the lack of matchup limits comparison. Imagery from early fall yielded the largest coverage estimates. Overall, our results show that Landsat enables broad remote measurement of bull kelp canopy coverage to supplement existing survey methods and increase continuity of timeseries for monitoring long-term trends.

TI Sensitivity of voxel-based estimations of leaf area density with

   simulation experiment

AB The need for fine scale description of vegetation structure is increasing as Leaf Area Density (LAD, m(2)/m(3)) becomes a critical parameter to understand ecosystem functioning and energy and mass fluxes in heterogeneous ecosystems. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has shown great potential for retrieving the foliage area at stand, plant or voxel scales. Several sources of measurement errors have been identified and corrected over the past years. However, measurements remain sensitive to several factors, including, 1) voxel size and vegetation structure within voxels, 2) heterogeneity in sampling from TLS instrument (occlusion and shooting pattern), the consequences of which have been seldom analyzed at the scale of forest plots. In the present paper, we aimed at disentangling biases and errors in plot-scale measurements of LAD with TLS in a simulated vegetation scene. Two negative biases were formerly attributed to (i) the unsampled voxels and to (ii) the subgrid vegetation heterogeneity (i.e. clumping effect), and then quantified, thanks to a the simulation experiment providing known LAD references at voxel scale, vegetation manipulations and unbiased point estimators. We used confidence intervals to evaluate voxel-scale measurement accuracy.
   We found that the unsampled voxel effect (i) led to underestimations with the "mean layer" method -commonly used to fill unsampled voxels- for small voxels (0.1-0.2 m) and/or low number of scans (<4). It was explained by the spatial correlations in vegetation, which induced that dense voxels were more often occluded by dense neighbors than light voxels. The distribution of the bias was heterogeneous in canopy, the bias being stronger at mid canopy where occlusion started, but smaller in highly-occluded upper layers. This somehow counterintuitive result was explained by a more random sampling of upper layers, but could highly depend on vegetation structure.
   The subgrid vegetation heterogeneity effect (ii) was confirmed to increase with voxel size, yet, the magnitude of this bias -quantified with vegetation manipulation- was found to be more homogeneously-distributed than the unsampled voxel effect.
   Overall, we found that no scenario was unbiased. However, an intermediate voxel size (0.5 m) was the best option, because the relatively homogeneous subgrid effect could be handled with a single correction factor and voxel-scale measurements errors were reasonable. On the contrary, smaller voxels led to poor voxel-scale measurements and variable biases in magnitude and spatial distribution with sampling design. However, more similar research in other context is required to adapt these conclusions to other forest plots.

AB Sea ice leads promote mass and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the Arctic Ocean. The continuous thinning of sea ice and the enhanced sea ice mobility in the past decades can potentially change the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of lead distribution in the Arctic, especially during spring. However, the long-term trend in Arctic leads, associated with sea ice loss, remains inconclusive. Sequential lead distribution data from serial middle-or high-resolution satellite observations are needed to obtain realistic variation, trends, and lead characteristics on a regional or basin scale. This study proposed a modified algorithm to retrieve daily spring leads in the Beaufort Sea using temperature anomaly from Terra/MODIS thermal imagery. Our lead map was compared to existing lead datasets and validated by Landsat-8 images, showing that the modified method gave better results in identification of open water leads and refrozen leads covered by thin ice. The development and interannual trend for April leads were explored for the study period 2001-2020. We found a positive interannual trend in the April lead area of about 2612 +/- 1245 km(2)/year (90% confidence). Higher increasing rate was identified in the early April, which would be 26.4 - 29.2% lower if the influence from cloud variation was removed. Lead area presents a close correlation with the 11-day average of ice drift speed before lead detection, while the influence of regional pressure gradient and easterly wind on the lead area is limited to the synoptic scale and recedes within a week. In the years with anomalous large lead area, we found the detected lead area are closely related to enhanced ice motion driven by strengthening Beaufort High and persistent easterly wind.

AB Knowledge about spatiotemporal error characteristics of remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products is essential for correctly interpreting observational information and optimally assimilating them into hydrological models. This work aims to (i) investigate the relative difference between time-invariant and time-variant daily SM errors of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products and (ii) analyze correlation of the daily SM errors with surface biomass quantified by the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and rainfall. The time invariant error denotes an aggregate error magnitude during the whole investigation period and the time-variant error at daily time scale also refers to an aggregate error magnitude but for the period of the 100-day time window centered at the day to be processed. The time-invariant and daily SM errors are estimated using the Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA) applied to ASCAT and SMAP SM retrievals along with the Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2.1 (GLDAS2) SM product for the period of April 2015 ? January 2020. Results indicate the relative difference between time-invariant and time-variant daily errors is notable for both ASCAT and SMAP SM products. The relative difference in units percentage denotes the ratio of difference value between time-invariant and daily errors to time-invariant error itself. The daily TCA error fluctuated at 43% value from time-invariant error for ASCAT SM and at 47% value for SMAP SM on a global average. When averaged globally, temporal mean of time-variant daily errors was relatively smaller than time-invariant error by-27% for ASCAT SM and-18% for SMAP SM, respectively. In tropical areas, the relative difference between time-invariant and daily errors is large during the dry season and becomes small when rainy season comes. When the peak lagged correlation is used, daily errors exhibit a stronger correlation with rainfall than they do with LAI in 61% of landmass pixels for ASCAT SM and 66% of landmass pixels for SMAP SM. LAI cannot be used to predict temporal variability of time-variant SM errors in barren land. Lagged correlation analysis reveals rainfall peak coincides with SM error peak in areas featured with low vegetation cover, including barren land, grasslands, and open shrublands. By contrast, the LAI peak comes after the SM error peak in all cases. Savannas and woody savannas are a special case as SM error peak comes first, followed by rainfall then LAI peaks. In summary, ASCAT and SMAP time-variant error varies with a large deviation from time-invariant errors and its temporal variation shows a stronger association with rainfall than changing LAI.

AB Reliable satellite estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) are needed in coastal waters for applications such as eutrophication monitoring. However, because of the optical complexity of coastal waters, retrieving accurate Chl-a is still challenging. Many algorithms exist and give quite different performance for different optical conditions but there is no clear definition of the limits of applicability of each algorithm and no clear basis for deciding which algorithm to apply to any given image pixel (reflectance spectrum). Poor quality satellite Chl-a data can easily reach end-users. To remedy this and provide a clear decision on when a specific Chl-a algorithm can be used, we propose simple quality control tests, based on MERIS water leaving reflectance (rho(w)) bands, to determine on a pixel-by-pixel basis if any of three popular and complementary algorithms can be used. The algorithms being tested are: 1. the OC4 blue-green band ratio algorithm which was designed for open ocean waters; 2. the OC5 algorithm which is based on look-up tables and corrects OC4 overestimation in moderately turbid waters and 3. a near infrared-red (NIR-red) band ratio algorithm designed for eutrophic waters.
   Using a dataset of 348 in situ Chl-a/MERIS matchups, the conditions for reliable performance of each of the selected algorithms are determined. The approach proposed here looks for the best compromise between the minimization of the relative difference between In situ measurements and satellite estimations and the number of pixels processed. Conditions for a reliable application of OC4 and OC5 depend on rho(w)412/rho(w)443 and rho(w)560, used as proxies of coloured dissolved organic matter and suspended particulate matter (SPM), as compared to rho(w)560/rho(w)490, used as a proxy for Chl-a. Conditions for reliable application of the NIR-red band ratio algorithm depend on Chl-a and SPM. These conditions are translated into pixel-based quality control (QC) tests with appropriately chosen thresholds. Results show that by removing data which do not pass QC, the performance of the three selected algorithms is significantly improved. After combining these algorithms, 70% of the dataset could be processed with a median absolute percent difference of 30.5%. The QC tests and algorithm merging methodology were then tested on four MERIS images of European waters. The OC5 algorithm was found to be suitable for most pixels, except in very turbid and eutrophic waters along the coasts where the NIR-red band ratio algorithm helps to fill the gap. Finally, a test was performed on an OLCI-S3A image. Although some validations of water reflectance are still needed for the OLCI sensors, results show similar behavior to the MERIS applications which suggests that when applied to OLCI data the present methodology will help to accurately estimate Chl-a in coastal waters for the next decade.

AB Many plant species have distinct optical properties between upper and lower leaf faces. These differences between faces are mainly attributed to the non-homogeneous distribution of absorbing and scattering materials within the leaf depth as well as particular surface features of both epidermises. We proposed the FASPECT model which is an evolution of the PROSPECT model to describe the differences in reflectance and transmittance between leaf faces. The upper and lower epidermis layers are characterized by distinct wavelength-independent reflectivities. Leaf mesophyll is made of a palisade and a spongy parenchyma layers using two parameters that describe the distribution of pigments and leaf structure between these two layers. As compared to the original PROSPECT model that treats the two leaf faces symmetrically, six additional parameters are required to describe the differences in leaf optical properties between the two faces. The specific absorption coefficients of chlorophyll and carotenoids have been recalibrated for the FASPECT model over a dedicated dataset. FASPECT was validated over eight datasets and compared with PROSPECT-5 and PROSPECT-D as well as with the DLM model that also accounts for the differences between the two faces. Results show that the FASPECT model simulates accurately the reflectance and transmittance of the two faces for species presenting distinct reflectance and transmittance properties between the faces. FASPECT outperforms PROSPECT-5 and PROSPECT-D, while providing generally more realistic simulations as compared to DLM. The capacity of the FASPECT model to retrieve leaf biochemical composition from reflectance and transmittance measurements was also evaluated. Marginal improvement is observed for the estimation of chlorophyll, carotenoids, and water content. Conversely, significant improvement is observed for dry matter content estimation. Conclusions are finally drawn on the interest and limits of the FASPECT model.

AB Consistent, large-scale operational monitoring of forest height is essential for estimating forest-related carbon emissions, analyzing forest degradation, and quantifying the effectiveness of forest restoration initiatives. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument onboard the International Space Station has been collecting unique data on vegetation structure since April 2019. Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R-2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R-2 = 0.61). The demonstrated integration of GEDI data with time-series optical imagery is expected to enable multidecadal historic analysis and operational forward monitoring of forest height and its dynamics. Such capability is important to support global climate and sustainable development initiatives.

AB This study first compares two different passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals, namely the retrieval from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and that from the Global Change Observation Mission - Water (GCOM-W1) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2); it further creates an optimal blending mechanism that merges the two retrievals with in situ observations from the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) and Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) networks. The assessments of the two products are done over conterminous United States (CONUS) for the snow seasons (November-June) of the water years 2017-2019 using in situ data and the SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) SWE analysis. Both satellite products tend to underestimate SWE. Between the two, AMSR2 retrieval outperforms in terms of correlation with observations and depth of saturation, but it exhibits a distinctive, seasonally varying bias that is not seen in ATMS retrieval. The negative bias over the early snow season, as further analysis indicates, most likely stems from AMSR2 retrieval's use of a high frequency channel (i. e., 89 GHz) for shallow snow detection, while the impact of differing assumptions of snow density is marginal. The blending scheme, developed on the basis of the validation experiment, features a histogram-based bias correction as a supplement to optimal interpolation. Cross-validation suggests that interpolated station product without the satellite background broadly underperforms the blended in situ-satellite product, confirming the utility of the satellite retrievals. Furthermore, the a priori bias correction mechanism is shown to be effective in mitigating large fluctuations in bias. Finally, the bias-corrected, blended in situ-satellite product performs comparably or even favorably against SNODAS over many parts of the CONUS, with important implications for joint use of satellite and in situ observations for hydrological monitoring and forecasting.

TI Nadir altimetry Vis-a-Vis swath altimetry: A study in the context of
   SWOT mission for the Bay of Bengal
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Conventional nadir looking altimeters make along track measurements on a line and mapped sea level anomaly (SLA) information is obtained using a combination of several such altimeters (Jason, SARAL, Cryosat etc.). Mapping techniques, in general, introduce a lot of uncertainties in sea level representation and sub-mesoscale variability. Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, based on radar interferometry, will measure SLA along wide swath thus providing detailed ocean information. This study aims to evaluate the advantages of SWOT measurements over nadir looking altimeters by making use of SWOT-simulator tool in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Although, BoB is a small basin but interestingly it is full of mesoscale and sub-mesoscale features. The study performs several sensitivity experiments to allow a comparison of gridded SLA product from SWOT with the product from a constellation of nadir altimeters. Space-time scales for mapping the SLA from SWOT were obtained by performing a series of sensitivity experiments involving different spatial resolutions and temporal sampling. Sensitivity to different type of errors on the quality of mapped SLA fields from nadir-altimeters and SWOT is also carried out. In case of SWOT, mapped SLA fields generated using correlated noise were better as compared to the maps that were generated by making an assumption that the noise is uncorrelated. It is found that gridded SLA from SWOT have less error in the eddy dominant (high variability) regions as compared to the mapped SLA field from nadir altimeters, which perform better in the regions of low SLA variability. Apart from this, the position and strength of mesoscale eddies is well resolved by SWOT-mapped SLA fields as compared to nadir-altimeter mapped fields.

AB Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.

DE Drought indices; SMOS; MODIS; Brazilian semiarid; Drought impacts
AB The Brazilian state of Pernambuco has approximately 88% of its territory located in the semiarid region, suffering from the irregularities of precipitation and the phenomenon of droughts, which increases the need for constant monitoring of climatic events. This study consisted of estimating meteorological and agricultural drought for the study area with soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite and MODIS products, covering the period from 2010 to 2017 and considering three climatic regions in Pernambuco: Mata, Agreste and SertAo. This research was divided into two main phases: the first was to obtain drought indices calculated from the remote sensing information, with emphasis on producing the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) that uses the soil moisture data in its calculation; the second phase was to correlate the response of the severity of SMADI and other indices with the results of productivity and harvested area for corn and sorghum crops, as obtained from official databases. The results found in the first phase of the study using the SMADI index obtained for the agricultural areas of the state showed long consecutive periods of drought, lasting longer than one year. The hydrological year from 2012 to 2013 presented the longest duration of the event for the Mata and SertAo regions, while for the Agreste the longest period was from 2016 to 2017. The correlations of corn production with the severity of the SMADI values were more significant than sorghum because corn is more sensitive to water stress. The study also concluded that the severity detected by SMADI correlated more significantly with sorghum culture than any of the other indices; that is, SMADI was more sensitive to identify water stress in this crop than the other indices used. The results demonstrated that SMADI can provide early warnings of drought impacts on rainfed agricultural systems and may serve to indicate the adoption of more resistant crops to water stress conditions.

AB Timely and accurate knowledge about the geospatial distribution of crops at regional to continental scales is crucial for forecasting crop production and estimating crop water use. The United States (US) is one of the leading food-producing countries, but lacks a nationwide high resolution crop-specific land cover map available publicly during the current growing season. The goal of this study was to map crops across the Continental US (CONUS) before the harvest, and to estimate the earliest date of classification by which crops can be mapped with sufficient accuracy (90% of full-season accuracy). The study employed a scalable cluster-then-label model that was trained on multiple years of MODIS NDVI using ground truth data in the form of US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) products. The first step in the crop classification was to perform Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) of annual MODIS-derived NDVI trajectories to create phenologically similar regions, or phenoregions. The second step was to assign crop labels to phenoregions based on spatial concordance between phenoregions and crop classes from CDL using Mapcurves. Assigning crop labels to phenoregions was performed within ecoregions to reduce classification errors due to spatial variability in phenology caused by variations in climate, agricultural practices, and growing conditions. The crop classifier was trained and validated on the years 2008-2014, then tested independently on 2015-2018. Ecoregion-level crop classification performed better than state-level and CONUS-level classification. Pixel-wise accuracy of classification for eight major crops by area was around 70% across the major corn-, soybeansand winter wheatproducing areas, whereas regions characterized by high crop diversity had slightly lower accuracy. Classification accuracy for dominant crops like corn, soybeans, winter wheat, fallow/idle cropland and other hay/non alfalfa improved with time as they grew, reaching 90% of year-end accuracy by the end of August over each of the four unseen years in the test period. For corn and soybeans, the earliest dates of classification were found to be much earlier in the central regions of the Corn Belt (parts of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana) than in peripheral areas. The ability to map growing crops may permit near real-time monitoring of the health status and vigor of agricultural crops nationally.

AB The fine-mode aerosols (FMA), generally generated from anthropogenic sources, play an essential role in global radiation balance, climate change, atmospheric environment, and human health. However, the FMA retrieval remains a challenge. An improved high resolution FMA retrieval algorithm based on the Spectral Neutrality of Surface Polarized Reflectance (SNOSPR) was developed using polarized satellite data. SNOSPR utilizes a lookup table approach to simultaneously retrieve high spatial resolution FMA parameters, such as FMA optical depth (AODf), Angstrom exponent (AE), and surface polarized reflectance (SPR), without using the surface Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF) model, which may yield relatively more significant errors of SPR estimation in certain surface types. Besides, a new cost function (CF) based on the hypothesis of invariance of SPR was used to select the best retrievals. SNOSPR algorithm was applied to POLDER-3 polarized observation data (i.e., 2010-2012). Inter-comparison between SNOSPR (6 km) and POLDER-3 (L2_LGC,18 km) for two typical cases and monthly averaged AODf products showed a generally consistent spatial distribution, while SNOSPR provided more details, and better coverage over barren and coastal areas at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, all retrieved AODf, AE products of SNOSPR and L2_LGC were validated using AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements. The AODf results showed fine correlation coefficients, i.e., R of 0.9 and 0.89, respectively. However, products of SNOSPR had the expected error range which was higher than that of L2_LGC over all surface types (i.e., 77.3% vs 70.6%), urban (i.e., 76.0% vs 60.6%) and wetland (i.e., 82.4% vs 68.4%). Time-series comparison over grassland showed that SNOSPR had better coverage and more accurate retrievals. Considering AE, both SNOSPR and L2_LGC underestimated its value when validated against AERONET measurements. On the other hand, SPR was retrieved at higher retrieval accuracy by SNOSPR than L2_LGC, which used BPDF. Accuracies of the retrieved AODf improved significantly when multi-directional data was used, especially when the viewing angle number increased from one to four. The uncertainty analysis of spectral neutrality and spatial invariance of SPR was discussed for future improvements of SNOSPR. Last, SNOSPR was applied on Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC), i.e., a POLDER-like sensor onboard the Chinese Gao Fen-5 satellite. The results in this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the SNOSPR algorithm and its potential for more reliable AODf/SPR retrievals for monitoring local atmospheric pollution and related studies.

AB Quantifying the spectral variation of column aerosol absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) wavelengths is required for accurate satellite-based aerosol and trace-gas retrievals. Retrievals of the column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index and single scattering albedo (SSA) in the UV-Vis range have been performed at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, since 2016 by combining co-located measurements from the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Cimel sun-sky photometer, the Ultraviolet Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (UV-MFRSR), the SKYNET Prede sky radiometer, and the NASA Pandora sun spectrometer. We investigated the spectral variation of column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index for UV-Vis wavelengths to refine models used in our aerosol retrieval algorithm to process measurements from the upcoming Geostationary Environment Monitoring Satellite (GEMS). The retrieved imaginary part of refractive index for highly absorbing fine pollution particles (BC), dust (DS), and non-absorbing (NA) particles in the selected UV-Vis range (380-440 nm) showed 0-20%, 30%, and 0-40% of spectral dependence, respectively. Retrievals of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurement data using the improved aerosol model showed improved correlation with AERONET data compared to the old algorithm that did not properly account for aerosol absorption effects. These results corroborate the advantage of using local climatology derived from ground-based UV-Vis spectral aerosol absorption measurements for satellite GEMS aerosol retrievals over East Asia. Moreover, this study reveals that spectral variations in the UV column aerosol absorption in East Asia differ from those in other regions.

AB Change detection between images is a procedure used in many applications of remote sensing data. Among these applications, the identification of damaged infrastructures in urban areas due to a large-scale disaster is a task that is crucial for distributing relief, quantifying losses, and rescue purposes. A crucial consideration for change detection is that the images must be co-registered precisely to avoid errors resulting from misalignments. An essential consideration is that some large-magnitude earthquakes produce very complex distortions of the ground surface; therefore, a pair of images recorded before and after a particular earthquake cannot be co-registered accurately. In this study, we intend to identify changes between images that are not co-registered. The proposed procedure is based on the use of phase correlation, which shows different patterns in changed and non-changed areas. A careful study of the properties of phase correlation suggests that it is robust against misalignments between images. However, previous studies showed that, in areas with no-changes, the signal power in the phase correlation is not concentrated in a single component, but rather in several components. Thus, we study the performance of the l(1)-regularized logistic regression classifier to identify the relevant components of phase correlation and learn to detect non-changed and changes areas. An empirical evaluation consisting of identifying the changes between pre-event and post-event images corresponding to the 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami was performed for this purpose. Pairs of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands of medium-resolution were used to compute the phase correlation to set feature space. The phase correlation-based feature space consisted of 484 features. We evaluate the proposed procedure using a damage inventory performed from visual inspection of optical images of 0.5-m resolution. A third-party provided the referred inventory. Because of the limitation of medium-resolution imagery, the different damage levels in the damage inventory were merged into a binary class: "changed" and "non-changed". The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced 85 +/- 6% of the damage inventory. Furthermore, our results identified tsunami-affected areas that were not previously identified by visual inspection.

AB Air temperature (Ta) is an essential climatological component that controls and influences various earth surface processes. In this study, we make the first attempt to employ deep learning for Ta mapping mainly based on space remote sensing and ground station observations. Considering that Ta varies greatly in space and time and is sensitive to many factors, assimilation data and socioeconomic data are also included for a multi-source data fusion based estimation. Specifically, a 5-layers structured deep belief network (DBN) is employed to better capture the complicated and non-linear relationships between Ta and different predictor variables. Layer-wise pre-training process for essential features extraction and fine-tuning process for weight parameters optimization ensure the robust prediction of Ta spatio-temporal distribution. The DBN model was implemented for 0.01 degrees daily maximum Ta mapping across China. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicate that the DBN model achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996 degrees C, MAE of 1.539 degrees C, and R of 0.986 at the national scale. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) method, the DBN model reduces the MAE values by 1.340 degrees C, 0.387 degrees C and 0.222 degrees C, respectively. Further analysis on spatial distribution and temporal tendency of prediction errors both validate the great potentials of DBN in Ta estimation.

AB This study presents an algorithm for globally retrieving chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) from multi-sensor merged ocean color (OC) products or Sentinel-3A (S3) Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data from the GlobColour archive in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002-2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.

AB The worldwide demand for timely and accurate information about ecosystem dynamics at Landsat spatial scale is growing and as of today still exceeds the availability of information. The diversity of required disturbance metrics and trade-offs between sensitivity, reliability, timelines of information generation, and flexibility toward potential customizations suggests that a single system is not likely to fill such demand in the near future. To address this challenge, the scientific community has been developing and improving various Landsat-based algorithms for land change monitoring. We describe the Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker (eDaRT) version 2.9 - a highly automated prototype system in continuous development, which has been operated since 2012 by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region to generate most current disturbance maps at Landsat scale and provide customized information services and inputs to science and land management applications in the Region.
   The eDaRT processing system utilizes all three dimensions of dense Landsat image time series: spectral, temporal, and spatial. Two anomaly detection algorithms are sequentially applied, one estimating pixels' disturbance status metrics in every processed image and the other detecting disturbance events, the primary output of eDaRT. The first algorithm initially estimates change relative to a user-defined fixed baseline time period, using a stratified version of the Dynamic Detection Model (DDM; Koltunov et al., 2009) applied to Landsat bands and vegetation indexes that reflect canopy greenness, abundance, and moisture content. Using the model residuals and a probabilistic context analysis, the detected anomalies are further classified as disturbed, cloud/snow, or recovered. The resulting residuals, classification maps, and the associated disturbance confidence values provide the most rapid preliminary snapshot of the current cumulative effect of disturbance and regeneration. The second algorithm detects discrete disturbance events as regime changes in the dense time series of the residuals for each pixel. First, the residuals are compared against a recent baseline window and classified to find candidates for disturbance events. Next, candidate-events are accepted based on temporal consistency of their detection. The standard outputs from this algorithm include disturbance event timing (down to 8-16 day precision) and a detection confidence as a proxy for event magnitude.
   We initially evaluated eDaRT performance with high-resolution imagery and airborne LiDAR data in a test area in California for several types of annual disturbance events at 30-m scale. These tests modeled detection probabilities as functions of canopy cover loss, which estimated detection rates of 96%, 87% and 92% respectively for fire, harvest, and tree mortality events, when canopy loss values follow a uniform prior distribution. The error of commission varied between 10-20% for most forest types (12% on average). Following ongoing optimizations and extended validations, eDaRT will expand beyond Landsat instruments to improve ecosystem monitoring, as an independent system and potentially as a part of an ensemble method.

AB Land surface emissivity is a directional quantity and most natural surfaces are anisotropic emitters. Experimental studies show that for homogeneous surfaces like bare soils, the emissivity decreases with view angle. Translation of the directionality of emissivity as obtained from experiments or models to satellite spatial scales of kilometers or more is challenging given the natural heterogeneity of the land surface at those scales. We propose a multi-sensor approach to retrieve TIR emissivity angular dependence from satellite observations. The method is based on simultaneous radiance measurements over stable and homogeneous targets, performed by multiple remote sensing platforms in low-earth orbit (MODIS/VIIRS) and geostationary orbits (SEVIRI) with different viewing configurations. In the case of homogeneous scenes, we assume that differences in observed brightness temperatures are exclusively due to differences in the atmospheric optical path and in surface emissivity within each view angle, as surface temperature is the same for both sensors. We then use radiative transfer simulations to derive the emissivity changes between the sensors due to the viewing position. It is shown that emissivity values decrease with view angle for all thermal infrared channels considered, with the highest variations for channel centered at 8.7 mu m, followed by 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, respectively. The MODIS MYD21 product agrees with the multi-sensor approach for the 8.7 mu m channel but shows negligible dependence on view angle for 10.8 and 12.0 mu m bands. Results suggest that the emissivity calibration curve used in the MYD21 algorithm restricts the retrieval of the full angular variation of emissivity at these channels. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed multi-sensor method is robust, with reduced impact of the uncertainty of the atmospheric correction on the retrieval. The impact of emissivity angular dependence on retrieved LST may be as high as 3.0 and 1.0 K, respectively, for the GSW and the TES algorithms for angles up to 65 degrees.

AB This paper applies the Fully-Focussed SAR (FF-SAR) algorithm to CryoSat-2 full-bit-rate data to measure water levels of lakes and canals in the Netherlands, and validates these measurements by comparing them to heights measured by gauges. Over Lake IJsel, a medium-sized lake, the FF-SAR height is biased about 6 cm below the gauge height, and a similar bias is found at six sites where CryoSat-2 crosses rivers and canals. The precision of the FF-SAR measurements depends on the extent of multi-looking (incoherent averaging along-track) applied. Over Lake IJssel the precision varies from 4 to 11 cm, decreasing as multi-looking increases. The precision of FF-SAR with 100 m of multi-looking is equivalent to that of the standard delay/Doppler processing, which has an along-track resolution of about 300 m. The width and orientation of rivers and canals limits the maximum available multi-looking. After removing the 6 cm bias, FF-SAR heights of rivers and canals have an accuracy between 2 cm and several decimeters, primarily depending on the presence of other water bodies lying within the cross-track measurement footprint, as these contaminate the waveform. We demonstrate that FF-SAR processing is able to resolve and measure small ditches only a few meters in width. The visibility of these signals depends on the angle at which CryoSat-2 crosses the ditch and on whether or not the ditch remains straight within CryoSat-2's field of view. In the best-case scenario, straight ditches at nearly 90 to the CryoSat-2 ground track, the ditch signal has high enough signal-to-noise to allow sub-decimeter accuracy of FF-SAR height measurement.

AB Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.

TI Integrating Google Earth imagery with Landsat data to improve 30-m
   resolution land cover mapping

AB Land use and land cover maps provide fundamental information that has been used in different kinds of studies, ranging from climate change to city planning. However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km(2) confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps.

AB Rice growth monitoring using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as a promising approach for tracking the development of this important crop. Accurate spatio-temporal information of rice inventories is required for water resource management, production risk occurrence, and yield forecasting. This research investigates the potential of the proposed Generalized volume scattering model based Radar Vegetation Index (GRVI) for monitoring rice growth at different phenological stages. The GRVI is derived using the concept of a geodesic distance (GD) between Kennaugh matrices projected on a unit sphere. We utilized this concept of GD to quantify a similarity measure between the observed Kennaugh matrix (representation of observed Polarimetric SAR information) and the Kennaugh matrix of a generalized volume scattering model (a realization of scattering media). The similarity measure is then modulated with a factor estimated from the ratio of the minimum to the maximum GD between the observed Kennaugh matrix and the set of elementary targets: trihedral, cylinder, dihedral, and narrow dihedral. In this work, we utilize a time series of C-band quad-pol RADARSAT-2 observations over a semi-arid region in Vijayawada, India. Among the several rice cultivation practices adopted in this region, we analyze the growth stages of direct seeded rice (DSR) and conventional tansplanted rice (TR) with the GRVI and crop biophysical parameters viz., Plant Area Index - PAI. The GRVI is compared for both rice types against the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) proposed by Kim and van Zyl. A temporal analysis of the GRVI with crop biophysical parameters at different phenological stages confirms its trend with the plant growth stages. Also, the linear regression analysis confirms that the GRVI outperforms RVI with significant correlations with PAI (r >= 0.83 for both DSR and TR). In addition, PAI estimations from GRVI show promising retrieval accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) < 1.05m(2) m(-2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) <0.85m(2) m(-2).

AB The remote sensing of algal pigments is essential for understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of harmful algal blooms (HABs). In particular, the vertical distribution of cyanobacterial pigment (e.g., phycocyanin (PC)) is critical factor in remote sensing because the diel vertical migration of cyanobacteria may affect the spectral signals according to observational time. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the remote sensing of algal bloom using pigments, few studies considered the vertical distribution of the pigments for the remote sensing of cyanobacteria in inland waters. In this regard, the objective of this study was to develop an improved bio-optical remote-sensing method using in-situ remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) at different water depths and cumulative PC and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, which was cumulated from the surface to a 5-m water depth. The results showed that the bio-optical algorithm using surface Rrs and surface pigment concentration was more accurate than that using the subsurface Rrs and surface pigments. The bio-optical algorithm using subsurface Rrs showed the highest R-squared (R-2) values (0.87-0.94) in each regression with the cumulative PC concentration from surface to each depth. The regressions between drone-based surface reflectance and cumulative PC concentration for each depth indicated a better performance than those between the reflectance and surface PC concentration; the highest R-2 value of 0.82 was obtained from a bio-optical algorithm using drone-based reflectance and a 1.0-m cumulative PC concentration, which was the best-performing algorithm. The PC maps developed using the best bio-optical algorithm accurately described the spatial and temporal distributions of the PC concentrations in the reservoir. This study demonstrates that the application of vertical cumulative pigment concentration and subsurface Rrs measurement in bio-optical algorithms can improve their performance in estimating pigments, and that drone-based hyperspectral imagery is an efficient tool for the remote sensing of cyanobacterial pigments over a wide area.

AB We developed a Time-series-based Reflectance Adjustment (TRA) approach for reducing the reflectance differences between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations. This TRA approach used the time series of matched Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations to build linear regression models to adjust reflectance differences between the two sensors for each individual pixel and each spectral band. We evaluated this approach for the NASA harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance product (V1.4; https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/v1.4/) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance with approximately 4 years of temporal coverage at five Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. Using this approach, the surface reflectance difference between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 in the HLS product reduced 45% for the blue band, 42% for the green band, 38% for the red band, 30% for the Near Infrared (NIR) band, 37% for the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) 1 band, and 32% for the SWIR2 band. The TRA approach also reduced TOA reflectance difference between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 substantially, in which the blue band reduced 46%, the green and. NIR bands reduced 42%, the red band reduced 48%, and the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands reduced 44%. If the high aerosol observations were screened, the reflectance differences in the HLS product could be further reduced by 2-4% and the TOA reflectance differences could be further reduced by 3-6% for the six spectral bands. The TRA approach has also shown good results in reserving the spatial patterns and the heterogeneity of land surface. The transformation parameters estimated from the TRA approach can be directly used for future Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 reflectance adjustment, with slightly lower (5%) reduction of reflectance difference.

AB Developing accurate models of crop stress, phenology and productivity is of paramount importance, given the increasing need of food. Earth observation (EO) remote sensing data provides a unique source of information to monitor crops in a temporally resolved and spatially explicit way. In this study, we propose the combination of multisensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data for crop yield estimation and forecasting using two novel approaches. We first propose the lag between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) derived from SMAP as a new joint metric combining the information from the two satellite sensors in a unique feature or descriptor. Our second approach avoids summarizing statistics and uses machine learning to combine full time series of EVI and VOD. This study considers two statistical methods, a regularized linear regression and its nonlinear extension called kernel ridge regression to directly estimate the county-level surveyed total production, as well as individual yields of the major crops grown in the region: corn, soybean and wheat. The study area includes the US Corn Belt, and we use agricultural survey data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) for year 2015 for quantitative assessment. Results show that (1) the proposed EVI-VOD lag metric correlates well with crop yield and outperforms common single-sensor metrics for crop yield estimation; (2) the statistical (machine learning) models working directly with the time series largely improve results compared to previously reported estimations; (3) the combined exploitation of information from the optical and microwave data leads to improved predictions over the use of single sensor approaches with coefficient of determination R-2 >= 0.76; (4) when models are used for within-season forecasting with limited time information, crop yield prediction is feasible up to four months before harvest (models reach a plateau in accuracy); and (5) the robustness of the approach is confirmed in a multi-year setting, reaching similar performances than when using single-year data. In conclusion, results confirm the value of using both EVI and VOD at the same time, and the advantage of using automatic machine learning models for crop yield/production estimation.

AB Sea surface salinity (SSS) subfootprint variability (SFV) is estimated using high-resolution, realistically forced regional simulations of the Arabian Sea and western Pacific with an integration period of one year. A weighted standard deviation was calculated for footprint sizes of 100 km, 40 km, 20 km, and 10 km for all model time steps and then median (sigma(50)) and 95th percentile (sigma(95)) values were calculated along the time dimension. An additional method, wavenumber spectral analysis (sigma(k)), was also employed to obtain a different but comparable estimate. ass and sigma(95) maxima ( > 1 psu) are found in shallow waters along the continental shelves where strong river outflow is present. Open ocean values of both statistics are much lower (similar to 0.1 psu). The wavenumber spectral analysis allowed the estimation of total SSS spatial variance over 640 km, which was then compared to the estimates obtained by integrating time-averaged SSS power spectral density (PSD) at wavelengths <= 100 km, 40 km, 20 km, and 10 km. For both geographic regions, the ratio of variance at and below each wavelength to the total variance across all estimated wavelengths is approximately 50%, 30%, 15%, and 5%, respectively. sigma(50), sigma(95), and sigma(k) magnitudes as a function of footprint size follow a power-law relationship. The observed strong decline in SSS SFV below 40 km suggests that the current effective resolution of the SMAP and SMOS satellites is advantageous for limiting the impact of SFV on the satellites' error budget.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to be a suitable remote sensing proxy of photosynthesis at multiple scales. However, the relationship between fluorescence and photosynthesis observed at the leaf level cannot be directly applied to the interpretation of retrieved SIF due to the impact of canopy structure. We carried out a SIF modelling study for a heterogeneous forest canopy considering the effect of canopy structure in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. A 3D forest simulation scene consisting of realistic trees and understory, including multi-scale clumping at branch and canopy level, was constructed from terrestrial laser scanning data using the combined model TreeQSM and FaNNI for woody structure and leaf insertion, respectively. Next, using empirical data and a realistic range of leaf-level biochemical and physiological parameters, we conducted a local sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the potential of the approach for assessing the impact of structural, biochemical and physiological factors on top of canopy (TOC) SIF. The analysis gave insight into the factors that drive the intensity and spectral properties of TOC SIF in heterogeneous boreal forest canopies. DART simulated red TOC fluorescence was found to be less affected by biochemical factors such as chlorophyll and dry matter contents or the senescent factor than far-red fluorescence. In contrast, canopy structural factors such as overstory leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution and fractional cover had a substantial and comparable impact across all SIF wavelengths, with the exception of understory LAI that affected predominantly far-red fluorescence. Finally, variations in the fluorescence quantum efficiency (Fqe) of photosystem II affected all TOC SIF wavelengths. Our results also revealed that not only canopy structural factors but also understory fluorescence should be considered in the interpretation of tower, airborne and satellite SIF datasets, especially when acquired in the (near-) nadir viewing direction and for forests with open canopies. We suggest that the modelling strategy introduced in this study, coupled with the increasing availability of TLS and other 3D data sources, can be applied to resolve the interplay between physiological, biochemical and structural factors affecting SIF across ecosystems and independently of canopy complexity, paving the way for future SIF-based 3D photosynthesis models.

AB Globally, the area of agricultural land is shrinking in part due to environmental degradation. Acquisition and restoration of degraded lands no longer used for agriculture may present a major conservation opportunity with minimal social and political opposition. The ability to efficiently and accurately identify these lands from regional to global scales will aid conservation management, ultimately enhancing the global prospects of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Remote Sensing provides a potential tool to identify areas where surface property changes can be mapped and linked with land degradation. In this study, we begin to tackle a small section of this challenge by presenting novel approach to mapping changes in vegetation cover amounts at the pixel level (30 m), using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We illustrate our approach across large-scale rangelands in Queensland Australia, using three decades of Landsat satellite imagery (1988-2017) along with field observations of land condition scores for validation. The approach used an existing method for dynamic reference cover to remove the rainfall variability and focused on the human management effects on the vegetation cover changes.
   Results showed the identified vegetation cover changes could be categorized into five classes of decrease, increase or stable cover compared with a set reference level, which was obtained from locations of the most persistent ground cover across all dry years. In total, vegetation cover decrease was observed in 20% of our study area, with similar portion of lands recovering and the rest (similar to 60%) staying stable. The lands with decrease in vegetation cover, covering a considerable area of similar to 2 x 10(5) km(2), exhibited a markedly reduced resilience to droughts. The accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 82.6% (+/- 3.32 standard error) with 75.0% (+/- 5.16%) and 70.0% (+/- 4.13%) producer's and user's accuracy for areas experiencing a significant decrease in vegetation cover, respectively. Identifying areas of degraded land will require multiple stages of spatial data analysis and this work provided the first stage for identifying vegetation cover changes in large-scale rangeland environment, and provides a platform for future research and development to identify degraded lands and their utility for achieving conservation endeavours.

AB Understanding biodiversity changes in time is crucial to promptly provide management practices against diversity loss. This is overall true when considering global scales, since human-induced global change is expected to make significant changes on the Earth's biota. Biodiversity management and planning is mainly based on field observations related to community diversity, considering different taxa. However, such methods are time and cost demanding and do not allow in most cases to get temporal replicates. In this view, remote sensing can provide a wide data coverage in a short period of time. Recently, the use of Rao's Q diversity as a measure of spectral diversity has been proposed in order to explicitly take into account differences in a neighbourhood considering abundance and relative distance among pixels. The aim of this paper was to extend such a measure over the temporal dimension and to present an innovative approach to calculate remotely sensed temporal diversity. We demonstrated that temporal beta-diversity (spectral turnover) can be calculated pixel-wise in terms of both slope and coefficient of variation and further plotted over the whole matrix / image. From an ecological and operational point of view, for prioritisation practices in biodiversity protection, temporal variability could be beneficial in order to plan more efficient conservation practices starting from spectral diversity hotspots in space and time. In this paper, we delivered a highly reproducible approach to calculate spatio-temporal diversity in a robust and straightforward manner. Since it is based on open source code, we expect that our method will be further used by several researchers and landscape managers.

AB It has been argued that even centimeter-level resolution is needed for mapping vegetation patterns in spatially heterogeneous landscapes such as northern peatlands. However, there are few systematic tests for determining what kind of spatial resolution and data combinations are needed and what the differences in mapping accuracy are when different datasets are omitted or included. We conducted 78 different object-based supervised random forest classifications on a patterned fen and its surroundings in Kaamanen, northern Finland, using remotely sensed optical imagery, topography, and vegetation height datasets from different platforms (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial, satellite) with spatial resolution ranging from 5 cm to 3m. We compared differences in classification performance when we altered (1) classification and segmentation input data and features calculated from the data, or (2) the segmentation scale. We constructed training data with the help of transect-based field sampling and UAV imagery and tested classification accuracy using 412 field-surveyed vegetation plots. The most accurate classifications (75.7% overall accuracy) were obtained when we segmented a 5 cm resolution UAV image with a small segmentation scale and calculated features from all datasets. Classification accuracy was 2.2 percentage points (pp) lower with the most accurate aerial image (50 cm resolution) based classification, and 7.6 pp and 11.9pp lower with the most accurate WorldView-2 (2 m resolution) and PlanetScope (3 m resolution) satellite image based classifications respectively. Classification accuracies were low (46.7-56.0%) when we used only spectral data from one dataset. The inclusion of gray-level co-occurrence matrix textural features increased classification accuracy by 0.4-12.1pp and inclusion of multiple datasets by 8.2-25.0pp. Segmentation scale had a minor effect on classification accuracy (2.5-7.3pp difference between the finest and coarsest segmentation scale); however, both too small and large segmentation scale might lead to suboptimal classification. The differences in land cover type areal coverage were relatively small between classifications with multiple datasets, but if classifications included features from only one dataset, the differences were larger. We conclude that multiple different optical, topographical, and vegetation height datasets should be used when mapping vegetation in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, and that sub-meter resolution data (e.g. UAV or aerial) are necessary for the most accurate maps. Although UAV data is not essentially needed for classification, it is useful for training dataset construction and especially helpful in areas lacking other sub-meter resolution data.

AB A high degree of consistency and comparability among chlorophyll algorithms is necessary to meet the goals of merging data from concurrent overlapping ocean color missions for increased coverage of the global ocean and to extend existing time series to encompass data from recently launched missions and those planned for the near future, such as PACE, OLCI, HawkEye, EnMAP and SABIA-MAR. To accomplish these goals, we developed 65 empirical ocean color (OC) chlorophyll algorithms for 25 satellite instruments using the largest available and most globally representative database of coincident in situ chlorophyll a and remote sensing reflectances. Excellent internal consistency was achieved across these OC 'Version -7' algorithms, as demonstrated by a median regression slope and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.985 and 0.859, respectively, among 903 pairwise comparisons of OC-modeled chlorophyll. SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua satellite-to-in situ match-up results indicated equivalent, and sometimes superior, performance to current heritage chlorophyll algorithms. During the past forty years of ocean color research the violet band (412 nm) has rarely been used in empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll concentrations in oceanic surface water. While the peak in chlorophyll specific absorption coincides with the 443 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, the magnitude of chlorophyll-specific absorption at 412 nm can reach upwards of similar to 70% of that at 443 nm. Nearly one third of total chlorophyll-specific absorption between 400 and 700 nm occurs below 443 nm, suggesting that bands below 443 nm, such as the 412 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, may also be useful in detecting chlorophyll under certain conditions and assumptions. The 412 nm band is also the brightest band (that is, with the most dominant magnitude) in remotely sensed reflectances retrieved by heritage passive ocean color instruments when chlorophyll is less than similar to 0.1 mg m(-3), which encompasses similar to 24% of the global ocean. To attempt to exploit this additional spectral information, we developed two new families of OC algorithms, the 005 and 006 algorithms, which include the 412 nm band in the MBR. By using this brightest band in MBR empirical chlorophyll algorithms, the highest possible dynamic range of MBR may be achieved in these oligotrophic areas. The terms oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic get frequent use in the scientific literature to designate trophic status; however, quantitative definitions in terms of chlorophyll levels are arbitrarily defined. We developed a new, reproducible, bio-optically based index for trophic status based on the frequency of the brightest, maximum band in the MBR for the OC6_SEAWIFS algorithm, along with remote sensing reflectances from the entire SeaWiFS mission. This index defines oligotrophic water as chlorophyll less than similar to 0.1 mg m(-3), eutrophic water as chlorophyll above 1.67 mg m(-3) and mesotrophic water as chlorophyll between 0.1 and 1.67 mg m(-3). Applying these criteria to the 40-year mean global ocean chlorophyll data set revealed that oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic water occupy similar to 24%, 67%, and 9%, respectively, of the area of the global ocean on average.

AB Surface elevation estimates from high resolution spaceborne image (HRSI) stereogrammetry are used to examine fine-scaled structure of boreal forest canopies. These data can depict detailed spatial patterns of vertical forest structure at remote sites across the circumpolar domain where these estimates would otherwise be unavailable. This work examines where these estimates are most effective at describing vertical forest structure to explain which canopy surfaces they represent. We evaluated the variation in canopy surface estimates captured from four general types of HRSI digital surface models (DSMs) across the full range of boreal canopy cover. These DSMs, classified into 4 types by grouping them according to the acquisition's (1) sun elevation angle (low or high) and (2) seasonality-driven ground surface condition (snow presence/absence), vary with acquisition characteristics and the details of this variation continues to be studied. We explored some of this variation by comparing the distributions of differences in boreal canopy percentile heights derived from reference small footprint lidar in Tanana Valley, Alaska with canopy surface elevations derived from these 4 types of HRSI DSMs. We examined how canopy surface estimates from HRSI DSMs differ according to acquisition characteristics and canopy cover, and ultimately which canopy surfaces are represented in these DSMs. Our results help clarify which boreal canopy surfaces are representative of those captured with HRSI DSMs. They show that in the Tanana Valley (1) DSMs grouped by sun elevation angle and ground surface condition provide different surface estimates of boreal canopies; (2) the two DSM types that appear to most differently capture boreal forest canopy surfaces are DSMs from snow-free images acquired at sun elevation angles < 30 degrees (Low sun elev. & snow-free) and those with snow-cover at sun elevation angles >= 30 degrees (High sun elev. & snow-free); (3) DSMs with snow most often do not capture upper canopy surfaces; (4) the "Low sun elev. & snow-free" DSMs resolve surfaces that are most representative of upper canopy surfaces (dense forests > 60% cover, 70th-80th percentile heights); and (5) in the most dense forests (> 80% cover) where canopy gaps are least likely to bias downward the average surface estimates, the snow-free DSM types are representative of 70th - 80th percentile heights ("Low sun elev. & snow-free") and 60th-70th percentile heights ("High sun elev. & snow-free"). The combination of horizontal structure (canopy cover) and acquisition characteristics affect the boreal vertical structure (canopy surface height) estimates from spaceborne stereogrammetry. These effects should be considered when analyzing products derived from HRSI DSMs, and as part of a comprehensive approach to spaceborne remote sensing of circumpolar boreal forests.

AB The United States (U.S.) federal government provides imagery obtained by federally funded Earth Observation satellites typically at no cost. For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program. Here, we describe important aspects of the Landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy.

AB Surface temperatures derived from remote sensing data over heterogeneous, non-isothermal land surfaces depend on the viewing and solar angles mainly due to variations in sunlit and shaded fractions of the different elements in the field of view. The near-simultaneous dual-view capability of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) can be used to estimate differences in brightness surface temperatures (BSTs) between the nadir (satellite zenith angle of 0 degrees-21.7 degrees) and forward views (53 degrees-55.6 degrees) in the 11 and 12 mu M bands. BST is defined as the black-body temperature corresponding to the radiance at surface level (that is, corrected for atmospheric absorption and emission). We developed an automated, pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction method to obtain the BST for the 11 and 12 pm bands at nadir and forward views. It uses atmospheric profiles from the NCEP reanalysis product provided at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution every 6 h, the MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer model, and a digital elevation model with spatial resolution of 1 km. The method provides the atmospheric transmittance and upwelling radiance at the AATSR resolution (1 km) for the two bands and views, taking into account the geographical coordinates, altitude and zenith observation angle of each pixel, and the AATSR overpass time. The method was applied to eight daytime and nighttime AATSR scenes over the Iberian Peninsula on the four seasons, for which the nadir-forward BST differences were obtained. For sea surfaces, the angular BST difference was uniform and independent on the time and season with an average about +0.7 K. This is expected since the sea surface is homogeneous and flat, the only angular effect being due to the known angular variation of emissivity. Nadir-forward BST differences were usually positive for daytime data over land surfaces, since AATSR observes from the North so there is a larger fraction of sunlit elements in the nadir view in the northern hemisphere. We found a clear seasonal dependence as expected, the largest (smallest) angular BST differences being obtained in summer (winter). The spatial variability of the daytime angular BST differences over land was also highest (lowest) in summer (winter). For the nighttime data, the angular variation was much smaller and uniform for all seasons. In order to analyze the daytime angular BST differences over land, we used concurrent Leaf Area Index (LAI) data obtained from the MODIS product MOD15A2. For a given date, the largest differences were found for surfaces with LAI values ranging from 0.5 to 2, due to the large change in the proportions of sunlit and shaded elements observed by the two views. For such cases in summer, differences up to 8 K were found, with average values of 4 K and high variability. For LAI values larger than 3, the angular differences decreased to about 2 K and were more uniform. We also found a positive correlation between the angular BST difference and the nadir BST.

AB This study presents a comprehensive validation of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Enhanced Level-3 radiometer soil moisture (SM) product (Version 2) over 3 years from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2018 using extensive ground measurements from sparse networks covering a range of physical and climatological regimes. Using a common spatial resolution, soil moisture retrievals from the descending (6:00 AM) and ascending (6:00 PM) overpasses were assessed based on static conditions such as the climate zone, soil property and land cover. Then validation considering performance with respect to dynamic attributes such as soil wetness, vegetation density and land surface temperature was reported. Given the above six parameters are cross-correlated, the quality of the SMAP enhanced products was further evaluated based on pairwise factors.
   Overall, higher accuracy was noted over zones where the soil organic carbon is low, the vegetation density is relatively sparse, locations in the temperate and arid climate zones, and the mean LST is high. Results also indicate that the descending (AM) and ascending (PM) products exhibit mean temporal correlation over the ground stations equaling 0.667 and 0.651, and mean unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) equaling 0.055 and 0.054 m(3)/m(3) respectively which is close to the ubRMSE requirement of the SMAP mission, 0.04 m(3)/m(3). While the ascending (PM) SM retrievals have been frequently excluded from applications due to its poor performances reported form validation studies, these comparable performances between the two products suggest that the ascending (PM) SM retrievals can be an additional data source. Based on the results here, it can be concluded that there is room for improving the SMAP product especially in areas of the world with very dense vegetation and average to low land surface temperatures.

AB Land cover and land use maps provide an important basis for characterizing the ecological state and biophysical properties of Earth's land areas. The Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, initially released in 2010, was produced at annual time steps and has been widely used in the land science community. In this paper we describe refinements and improvements, in both the algorithm and the resulting map data sets, that have been implemented in the MODIS Collection 6 Global land Cover Type product. Unlike the Collection 5 product, which was based on the 17-class International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend, the Collection 6 algorithm uses a hierarchical classification model where the classes included in each level of the hierarchy reflect structured distinctions between land cover properties. The resulting suite of nested classifications is combined to create eight distinct classification schemes including the five legacy schemes included in Collection 5, and three new legends based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LEGS) that distinguish between land cover, land use, and surface hydrologic state. The Collection 6 algorithm also incorporates a state-space multitemporal modeling framework based on hidden Markov models that reduce spurious land cover changes introduced by classification uncertainty in individual years. Among other changes, relative to Collection 5, the Collection 6 product includes less area mapped as forests, open shrublands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, and more area mapped as woodlands and grasslands. Accuracy assessment indicates that the Collection 6 product has an overall accuracy of 73.6% for the primary LCCS layer and that the amount of spurious land cover change has been substantially reduced in Collection 6 relative to Collection 5 (1.6% in C6 and 11.4% in C5).

AB Since small aerosol particles are mostly anthropogenic, the fine-mode aerosol optical thickness (fAOT) can be used to infer PM2.5 amounts. However, satellite-based fAOT products such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are highly uncertain over land. An improved fAOT retrieval method called the look-up table spectral deconvolution algorithm (LUT-SDA) was tested and improved using data from Asia. The improvement is achieved by accounting for seasonal changes instead of using constant annual mean values of the aerosol parameters used in the LUT-SDA derived from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data from 2010 to 2014. Compared with the previous version of the LUT-SDA developed for Beijing, Hong Kong, and Osaka, the updated LUT-SDA generates more accurate fine-mode fractions (FMFs) with the total mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreasing from 0.24 to 0.18. The updated LUT-SDA was then applied to retrieve fAOT and was validated by retrievals from 45 AERONET sites over the period 2015 to 2016. A good accuracy was achieved by this method with 31% of the validation sites having > 50% of retrievals falling within the estimated error (EE) envelope +/- (0.05 + 0.15 x AERONET fAOT) and 42% of the validation sites having 40-50% of retrievals falling within the RE envelope. In the total validation and comparison with the MODIS Collection 6 fAOT, the fAOT retrievals from the LUT-SDA agreed more closely with AERONET retrievals, showing a low bias. About 48% of the LUT-SDA-based fAOT retrievals fell within the EE envelope (RMSE = 0.29), while similar to 22% of the MODIS-based fAOT retrievals fell within the EE envelope (RMSE = 0.42). The fAOT was significantly underestimated by the MODIS algorithm in most areas of Asia with many values of zero. This study demonstrates that the refined LUT-SDA method is valid for the large-scale estimation of fAOT from satellite images.

AB The convergence of new EO data flows, new methodological developments and cloud computing infrastructure calls for a paradigm shift in operational agriculture monitoring. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale, cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide 10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near real-time the observation acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives.

AB We use near simultaneous ocean color satellite imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 and ESA's Sentinel-2 missions to reconstruct surface currents along the northeastern shore of the Black Sea and study the spread of a small river plume formed in this area. Several times a year Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites both pass over the study area within a time interval of < 10 min. Analysis of near simultaneous ocean color composites obtained during these periods provides an opportunity for accurate reconstruction of surface currents. It is especially efficient for detecting motion of frontal zones associated with river plumes which are visible in optical satellite imagery. Using an optical flow algorithm we reconstructed surface currents associated with the motion of a small plume formed by the Mzymta River in response to different wind forcing conditions. We show that the dynamics of the Mzymta plume are significantly different to those of large plumes. First, a near-field jet of the small plume is abruptly decelerated by friction with the subjacent ocean and does not form a recirculating bulge even under low wind forcing conditions. As a result, freshwater discharge does not accumulate near the river mouth and is transported to the far-field part of the plume. Second, under certain external forcing conditions the angle between wind direction and Ekman transport within the plume takes anomalously large values of 60-80 degrees. As a result, onshore winds cause upstream accumulation of the river plume, while offshore/downwelling and up-welling winds result in downstream and offshore transport of freshwater discharge, respectively.

AB Foliar reflectance is readily used in evaluating physiological status of agricultural crops and forest stands. However, in the case of forest trees, underlying genetics of foliar spectral reflectance and pigment content have rarely been investigated. We studied a structured population of Scots pine, replicated on two sites, with the selected trees pedigree reconstructed via DNA markers. This allowed us to decompose phenotypic variance of pigment and reflectance traits into its causal genetic components, and to estimate narrow-sense heritability (h(2)).
   We found statistically significant h(2) ranging from 0.07 to 0.22 for most of the established reflectance indices. Additionally, we investigated the profile of heritable variation along the reflectance curve in 1 nm wavelength (WL) bands. We show that the maximum h(2) value (0.39; SE 0.13) across the 400 to 2500 nm spectral range corresponds to the red edge inflection point, in this case to 722 nm WL band. Resultant h(2) distribution indicates that additive gene effects fluctuate along the reflectance curve.
   Furthermore, h(2) of the most widely used formats of reflectance indices, i.e. the simple ratio and the normalized difference, was estimated for all WL bands combined along the observed reflectance spectrum. The highest h(2) estimates for both formats were obtained by combining WL bands of the red edge spectrum.
   These new genetically driven pigment- and spectral reflectance- based markers (proxies of adaptive traits) may facilitate selection of stress resistant plant genotypes. Recent development of high-resolution spectral sensors carried by airborne and spaceborn devices make foliage spectral traits a viable technology for mass phenotyping in forest trees.

AB Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understand water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. Satellite-driven ET models provide global estimates, but many of the ET algorithms have been designed independently of soil moisture observations. As water for ET is sourced from the soil, incorporating soil moisture into global remote sensing algorithms of ET should, in theory, improve performance, especially in water-limited regions. This paper presents an update to the widely-used Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm to incorporate spatially explicit daily surface soil moisture control on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. The updated algorithm is evaluated using 14 AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers co-located with COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) soil moisture observations. The new PT-JPL(SM) model shows reduced errors and increased explanation of variance, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions. Soil moisture incorporation into soil evaporation improves ET estimates by reducing bias and RMSE by 29.9% and 22.7% respectively, while soil moisture incorporation into transpiration improves ET estimates by reducing bias by 30.2%, RMSE by 16.9%. We apply the algorithm globally using soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP). These new global estimates of ET show reduced error at finer spatial resolutions and provide a rich dataset to evaluate land surface and climate models, vegetation response to changes in water availability and environmental conditions, and anthropogenic perturbations to the water cycle.

AB We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA). The accuracy of the VBA was assessed for 390 wildfires (11-114,500 ha in size) in the western United States. The spatial accuracy was assessed by comparison with a validation dataset of Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) burned area and incident fire perimeter polygons. The VBA temporal accuracy was evaluated using a time series of daily fire perimeter polygons derived from high resolution airborne infrared imagery. The algorithm's burned area mapping accuracy is 59%. The algorithm detected 60% of burned area on the initial day of burning and 73% within 24 h.

AB Monitoring changes in grassland cover is essential in assessment of grassland health as well as the effects of anthropogenic interventions and global climate change on grassland ecosystems. Remote sensing is an effective approach for providing rapid and dynamic monitoring of vegetation cover over large grassland areas. In this study, four types of remote sensing retrieval models (i.e., pixel dichotomy models, univariate vegetation index (VI) regression models, multivariate regression models, and a support vector machine (SVM) model) are built to derive grassland cover based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the measured grassland cover data collected by unmanned aerial vehicle during the grassland peak growing season from 2014 to 2016. The optimal model is then used to map the spatial distribution of grassland cover and its dynamic change in the headwater region of the Huanghe River (Yellow River) (HRHR) of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau over the 16 years period (2001 to 2016). The results show that (1) the pixel dichotomy models based on MODIS VI data are inappropriate for estimating grassland cover in the HRHR when their endmembers (VIsoil and VIved are determined based only on the MODIS data; (2) the multivariate regression models present better performance than the univariate VI (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) models; (3) MODIS NDVI outperforms MODIS EVI for modeling grassland cover in the study area; (4) the SVM model based on nine factors is the optimal model (R-2: 0.75 and RMSE: 6.85%) for monitoring alpine grassland cover in the study area; and (5) majority of the grassland area (59.9%) of the HRHR showed increase in yearly maximum grassland cover from 2001 to 2016, while the average yearly maximum grassland cover for the 16 years exhibited a generally increasing trend from west to east and from north to south. This study provides a more suitable remote sensing inversion model to greatly improve the accuracy of modeling alpine grassland cover in the HRHR, and to better assess grassland health status and the impacts of warming climate to grasslands in regions of remote and harsh environments.

AB An assessment of variance in ocean current signal and noise shared by in situ observations (drifters) and a large gridded analysis (GlobCurrent) is sought as a function of day of the year for 1993-2015 and across a broad spectrum of current speed. Regardless of the division of collocations, it is difficult to claim that any synoptic assessment can be based on independent observations. Instead, a measurement model that departs from ordinary linear regression by accommodating error correlation is proposed. The interpretation of independence is explored by applying Fuller's (1987) concept of equation and measurement error to a division of error into shared (correlated) and unshared (uncorrelated) components, respectively. The resulting division of variance in the new model favours noise. Ocean current shared (equation) error is of comparable magnitude to unshared (measurement) error and the latter is, for GlobCurrent and drifters respectively, comparable to ordinary and reverse linear regression. Although signal variance appears to be small, its utility as a measure of agreement between two variates is highlighted.
   Sparse collocations that sample a dense (high resolution) grid permit a first order autoregressive form of measurement model to be considered, including parameterizations of analysis-in situ error cross-correlation and analysis temporal error autocorrelation. The former (cross-correlation) is an equation error term that accommodates error shared by both GlobCurrent and drifters. The latter (autocorrelation) facilitates an identification and retrieval of all model parameters. Solutions are sought using a prescribed calibration between GlobCurrent and drifters (by variance matching). Because the true current variance of GlobCurrent and drifters is small, signal to noise ratio is near zero at best. This is particularly evident for moderate current speed and for the meridional current component

AB 5 years of Systematic Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) acquisitions and 8 years of observations from the Jason 2 altimeter are used to investigate the signature of the Agulhas Current on high resolution (between 1 and 5 km) satellite-derived winds. The satellite wind observations are analysed together with co-located ocean current, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and significant wave height information. Satellite-derived winds cannot be considered current relative over the Agulhas Current. SAR and altimeter winds increase in magnitude over the Agulhas Current in all up-, down- and cross-current wind conditions, with contributions from both the ocean surface current and SST. When winds blow against the current, strong accelerations in satellite winds are observed at the Agulhas Current's inshore front, with the strongest winds observed 10 km offshore from the location of maximum SST gradient. The strong SST gradient appears to drive a thermal wind with a magnitude of about 1 m/s and which intensifies/abates the predominant alongfront winds at the Agulhas Current's northern wall. The SAR dataset shows abnormally high increases in wind speeds during up-current conditions in comparisons to the Jason-2 derived winds. We argue that these differences are caused by the inability of the CMOD_type algorithms to taken into account the wave field and provide accurate wind speed estimates in conditions where wave height exceed the expected value for a given wind speed. Our analysis suggests that wave-current interactions in regions of strong current shear produce enhanced sea surface roughness signatures and lead to artificially high estimates of SAR-derived wind speeds. There is future potential in using high resolution SAR imagery to map strong ocean current fronts and thus improve our ability to monitor ocean surface currents from space.

AB In Peru landslides have been causing damages and casualties annually due to the high mountain relief and distinct seasonal precipitation distribution. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry represents one possibility for mapping surface deformation at fine spatial resolution over large areas in order to characterize aspects of terrain motion and potentially hazardous processes. We present land surface motion maps derived from satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR) for a part of the Santa River Basin between the Cordilleras Blanca and Negra around the city of Carhuaz in Peru. Using both Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and differential SAR Interferograms (DInSAR) from ALOS-1 PALSAR-1, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 we mapped 42 landslides extending over 17,190,141 m(2) within three classes of activity (i.e. 0-2 cm/a, 2-10 cm/a and > 10 cm/a). A geomorphological inventory of landslides was prepared from optical satellite imagery and field experience and compared to the InSAR-based slope-instability inventory. The two approaches provide slightly different information about landslide spatial and temporal activity patterns, but altogether they can be combined for the assessment of the state of activity of landslides and possibly the development of hazard maps, which are not systematically available in this region. We conclude that ALOS PALSAR (1 and 2) and Sentinel-1 data have a high potential to derive high-quality surface deformation information of landslides in many mountainous regions worldwide due to their global and frequent acquisition strategies.

AB Changes in aerosol loading affect cloud albedo and emission and Earth's radiative balance with a low level of scientific understanding. In this study, we investigate the vertical response of ice clouds to aerosols within the Indian subcontinent during monsoon season (2006-2010) based on multiple satellite observations. As a function of aerosol loading, we find that the cloud optical depth, cloud geometrical depth and ice water path decrease by 0.23 (from 0.39 to 0.16), 0.8 km (from 2.6 to 1.8 km), 5.1 g/m(2) (from 7.9 to 2.8 g/m(2)), respectively, and that ice particles possibly decrease in size and become more spherical in shape as aerosol optical depth (AOD) increases from 0.1 to 1; these changes tend to plateau as AOD increases beyond 1. The absolute negative response between ice clouds and aerosols under moist and unstable atmospheric conditions is stronger than that under drier and stable atmospheric conditions, and vice versa. Moreover, the negative impact of smoke on ice clouds is stronger than dust and polluted dust, which is likely related to the strong absorption properties and poor ice nucleation efficiency of smoke. Aerosol impacts on ice clouds lead to a decrease in the net cloud radiative effect of 7.3 W/m(2) (from 18.5 to 11.2 W/m(2)) as AOD increases from 0.1 to 1. This change in ice cloud properties mainly results in the decrease in downwelling LW radiation to the surface and consequently weakened radiative forcing of ice clouds during the Indian summer monsoon season.

AB Atmospheric methane has been increasing since the beginning of the industrial era due to anthropogenic emissions. Methane has many sources, both natural and anthropogenic, and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the contribution of each source to the total methane budget. Thus, remote sensing techniques for monitoring and measuring methane emissions are of increasing interest. Recently, the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has proven to be a valuable instrument for quantitative mapping of methane plumes. Despite this success, uncertainties remain regarding the sensitivity of the retrieval algorithms, including the influence of albedo and the impact of surfaces that may cause spurious signals. To explore these sensitivities, we applied the Iterative Maximum a Posterior Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) methane retrieval algorithm to synthetic reflected radiances with variable methane concentrations, albedo, surface cover, and aerosols. This allowed for characterizing retrieval performance, including potential sensitivity to variable surfaces, low albedo surfaces, and surfaces known to cause spurious signals. We found that dark surfaces (below 0.10 mu Wcm(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1) at 2139 nm), such as water and green vegetation, and materials with absorption features in the 2200-2400 nm range caused higher errors in retrieval results. We also found that aerosols have little influence on retrievals in the SWIR. Results from the synthetic scene are consistent with those observed in IMAP-DOAS retrievals for real AVIRIS-NG scenes containing methane plumes from a waste dairy lagoon and coal mine ventilation shafts. Understanding the effect of surface properties on methane retrievals is important given the increased use of AVIRIS-NG to map gas plumes from a diversity of sources over variable landscapes.

AB Estimating leaf and plant area density with Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) continues to be more and more popular, as tridimensional point clouds appear as an appealing measurement technique for heterogeneous environments. Some approaches implement a discretization of the point cloud in a grid (referred to as "voxelbased") to account for this vegetation heterogeneity and significant work has been done in this recent research field, but no general theoretical analysis is available. Although estimators have been proposed and several causes of biases have been identified, their unbiasedness (zero bias) and efficiency (smallest error) have not been evaluated. Also, confidence intervals are almost never provided.
   In the present paper, we assumed that the vegetation elements were randomly distributed within voxels and that TLS beams were infinitely thin, in order to focus on the remaining sources of biases and errors. In this simplified context, we both solve the transmittance equation and use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), to derive some new estimators for the attenuation coefficient, which is proportional to leaf area density at voxel scale in this idealized context. These estimators include bias corrections and confidence intervals, and account for the number of beams crossing the voxel (beam number), the inequality of path lengths in voxel, the size of vegetation elements, as well as for the variability of element positions between vegetation samples. These theoretical derivations are complemented by numerous numerical simulations for the evaluation of estimator bias and efficiency, as well as the assessment of the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals. Our simulations reveal that the usual estimators are biased and exhibit 95% confidence intervals on the order of +/- 100% of the estimate, when the beam number is smaller than 30. Second, our bias-corrected estimators -especially the bias-corrected MLE- are truly unbiased and efficient in a wider range of validity than the usual ones, even for beam number as low as 5. Third, we found that the confidence intervals can be as high as approximate to +/- 50% when the projected area of a single element was on the order of 10% of voxel cross-sectional area and vegetation was dense (optical depth of the voxel equal to 2), even for a beam number larger than 1000. This is explained by the variability of element positions between vegetation samples, which implies that a significant part of residual error is caused by random effects. When LAD estimates are averaged over several small voxels -typically to determine a vertical profile at plot scale or to compute the total leaf area of a single plant-, confidence intervals are typically on the order of +/- 5 to 10% with bias-corrected estimators, which is twice as small as with usual estimators.
   Our study provides some new ready-to-use estimators and confidence intervals for attenuation coefficients, which are unbiased and efficient within a fairly large range of parameter values. The unbiasedness is achieved for a fairly low beam number, which is promising for application to airborne LiDAR data. They permit to raise the level of understanding and confidence on LAD estimation. Among other applications, their usage should help determine the most suitable voxel size, for given vegetation types and scanning density, whereas existing guidelines are highly variable among studies, probably because of differences in vegetation, scanning design and estimators. The impact of other sources of biases and errors, such as vegetation heterogeneity inside voxels or TLS specifications are not addressed in the present manuscript and would require further investigations.

AB Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) produces estimates of characteristics related to the state and change of the forest resources in the whole country as well as in smaller regions and domains. The estimates are based on measurements on permanent field plots placed on a systematic grid over the country. Digital stereo aerial images are an important source of auxiliary information that can be used with post-stratified estimation to increase the precision of the estimates. We examined post-stratification based on stereo image information, available on a much denser grid than the field plots, for the estimation of forest area, total growing-stock volume and growing-stock volume per unit of accessible forest area. We considered 31 post-stratification schemes that consisted of (1) forest/non-forest stratification by four alternative methods based on manual or semi-automated stereo image interpretation, and (2) sub-stratification within the forest stratum by regression-tree models constructed between field-measured growing-stock volume and stereo-image-retrieved vegetation height characteristics. We applied the schemes in two real NFI estimation cycles, and found that the most precise schemes reduced the variance of the whole-country estimators of forest area, total growing-stock volume and growing-stock volume per unit of accessible forest area by 81%, 67% and 34%, respectively, compared to the estimator without post-stratification. Based on this study, we consider regression-tree modelling well-suited for post-stratification, as it produces stratum boundaries as a direct result of modelling, appears robust against deviating values in fitting data, and avoids problems with unrealistic model predictions in application.

AB The Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been proposed for estimation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing data. The model relies on a physical linear relationship between the soil moisture content and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and can be parameterized universally (i.e., a single calibration for a given area) based on the pixel distribution within the STR-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoidal space. The main motivation for this study was to evaluate how the universal parameterization of OPTRAM works for long periods of time (e.g., several decades). This is especially relevant for uncovering the soil moisture and agricultural drought history in response to climate change in different regions. In this study, MODIS satellite observations from 2001 to 2017 were acquired and used for the analysis. Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) soil moisture data, collected with the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) at five different sites in the U.S. covering diverse climates, soil types, and land covers, were applied for evaluation of the MODIS-OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates. The OPTRAM soil moisture estimates were further compared to the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) (L-band), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) (L band), and the Advanced AScatterometer (ASCAT) (C-band) soil moisture retrievals. OPTRAM soil moisture data were also analyzed for potential monitoring of agricultural drought through comparison of the OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit Index (OPTRAM-SWDI) with the widely-applied Crop Moisture Index (CMI). Evaluation results indicate that OPTRAM-based soil moisture estimates provide overall unbiased RMSE and R between 0.050 and 0.085 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 to 0.70, respectively, for all investigated sites. The performance of OPTRAM is comparable with the ASCAT retrievals, but slightly less accurate than SMAP and SMOS. OPTRAM and the three microvave satellites captured CRN soil moisture temporal dynamics very well for all five investigated sites. A close agreement was observed between the OPTRAM-SWDI and CMI drought indices for most selected sites. In conclusion, OPTRAM can estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics with reasonable accuracy for a range of climatic conditions (semi-arid to humid), soil types, and land covers, and can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring.

AB Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo is a fundamental component of Earth's energy budget. To date, long-term global land TOA albedo products with spatial resolution higher than 20-km are not available. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve TOA albedo from multispectral imager observations acquired by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which provides the longest continuous record of global satellite observations since 1981. Direct estimation models were established first to derive instantaneous TOA broadband albedo under various atmospheric and surface conditions, including cloudy-sky, clear-sky (snow-free) and snow cover conditions. To perform long-term series analysis, the instantaneous TOA albedo were then converted to daily/monthly mean values based on the diurnal curves from multi-year Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) 3-hourly flux dataset. Calibration differences between sequential AVHRR sensors were further mitigated by invariant targets normalization. The retrieved TOA albedo at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees was validated against two TOA albedo datasets, CM SAF (Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility) flux data and CERES flux data, at spatial resolutions of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees, 20 km x 20 km and 1 degrees x 1 degrees. The instantaneous TOA albedo had an overall Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.047 when compared with 20-km CERES fluxes, whereas the 1 degrees by 1 degrees monthly mean TOA albedo showed closer agreements with both CM SAF and CERES, with RMSE ranging from 0.029 to 0.040 and from 0.022 to 0.031, respectively. Moreover, our product was found to be highly consistent with both CERES and CM SAF at long-term trend detection. The extensive validation indicated the robustness of our algorithm and subsequently, comparable data quality with existing datasets. With global coverage and long time series (1981-2017), our product is expected to provide valuable information for climate change studies.

AB While remote sensing has increasingly been applied to estimate a biodiversity directly through optical diversity, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms behind the optical diversity-biodiversity relationship. Here, we examined the relative contributions of species richness, evenness, and composition to the spectral reflectance, and consider factors confounding the remote estimation of species diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota. We collected hyperspectral reflectance of 16 prairie species using a tram-mounted imaging spectrometer, and a full-range field spectrometer with a leaf clip, and simulated plot-level images from both instruments with different species richness, evenness and composition. Two optical diversity metrics were explored: the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space and classified species derived from Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), a spectral classification method. Both optical diversity metrics (CV and PLS-DA classified species) were affected by species richness and evenness. Diversity metrics that combined species richness and evenness together (e.g. Shannon's index) were more strongly correlated with optical diversity than either metric alone. Image-derived data were influenced by both leaf traits and canopy structure and showed larger spectral variability than leaf clip data, indicating that sampling methods influence optical diversity. Leaf and canopy traits both contributed to optical diversity, sometimes in complex or contradictory ways. Large within-species variation sometimes confounded biodiversity estimation from optical diversity, and a single species markedly altered the optical-biodiversity relationship. Biodiversity estimation from CV was strongly influenced by soil background, while estimation from PLS-DA classified species was not sensitive to soil background. These findings are consistent with recent empirical studies and demonstrate that modeling approaches can be used to explore effects of spatial scale and guide regional studies of biodiversity estimation using high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing.

AB Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) is one of the primary drivers affecting fuel flammability that lead to fires. Satellite observations well-grounded with field data over the highly climatologically and ecologically diverse Australian region served to estimate FMC and flammability for the first time at a continental-scale. The methodology includes a physically-based retrieval model to estimate FMC from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) reflectance data using radiative transfer model inversion. The algorithm was evaluated using 360 observations at 32 locations around Australia with mean accuracy for the studied land cover classes (grassland, shrubland, and forest) close to those obtained elsewhere (r(2) = 0.58, RMSE = 40%) but without site-specific calibration. Logistic regression models were developed to generate a flammability index, trained on fire events mapped in the MODIS burned area product and four predictor variables calculated from the FMC estimates. The selected predictor variables were actual FMC corresponding to the 8-day and 16-day period before burning; the same but expressed as an anomaly from the long-term mean for that date; and the FMC change between the two successive 8-day periods before burning. Separate logistic regression models were developed for grassland, shrubland and forest. The models obtained an "Area Under the Curve" calculated from the Receiver Operating Characteristic plot method of 0.70, 0.78 and 0.71, respectively, indicating reasonable skill in fire risk prediction.

AB The brightness temperature (T-B(P)) observed by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission is significantly affected by the soil permittivity (epsilon(s)), surface roughness and vegetation opacity (tau(P)). This study assesses the impact of these factors on simulating the SMAP horizontally (p = H) and vertically (p = V) polarized T-B(P) K-measurements and retrieving the liquid soil water content (theta(liq)) for both frozen and thawed soils in the typical Tibetan desert and meadow ecosystems. For this investigation, the zero-order approximation of the radiative transfer equations, i.e., tau-omega emission model, is configured with surface roughness and tau(P) parameterizations adopted by current SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithms, and the es is computed with the four-phase dielectric mixing model that epsilon(s) is applicable for both frozen and thawed soils.
   For the Tibetan desert site, the tau-omega emission model with above configurations underestimates year-round the SMAP T-B(H) measurements (bias > 20 K), while T-B(V) are underestimated during the cold season. Implementation of a new surface roughness parameterization reduces the T-B(H) underestimation, and the improved T-B(P) simulations lead to better theta(liq) retrievals produced by the single channel algorithm (SCA) using the T-B(V) as well as T-B(H) measurements. The remaining T-B(H) and T-B(V) underestimations are removed by further adopting a new epsilon(s) parameterization.
   For the Tibetan meadow site, the tau-omega emission model overestimates both T-B(H) and T-B(V) during the warm season and underestimates T-B(H) during the cold season when the vegetation is sparse. Implementation of the new surface roughness parameterization reduces the T-B(H) underestimation, and further the T-B(P) overestimation is mitigated by adopting a new tau(P) parameterization derived from a discrete radiative transfer model previously developed and tested for the same site. The in-situ measured theta(liq) dynamics are better captured by corresponding retrievals for both frozen and thawed soils with implementation of the new surface roughness and tau(P) parameterizations, which reduces the unbiased RMSEs by more than 40%. The parameterizations developed in this study are useful to provide consistent and reasonable T-B(P) simulations and theta(liq) retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau for both frozen and thawed soils based on both SMAP T-B(H) and T-B(V) measurements.

AB Airborne Lidar Bathymetry (ALB) surveys are traditionally used for measuring depths in shallow nearshore and back-bay areas. In this paper, we present a novel ALB waveform processing procedure, namely bottom return residual analysis, for bottom characterization. Waveform features obtained from the bottom return residual analysis are used in a supervised classification approach, i.e. Support Vector Machine, to differentiate between: 1) sand and rock bottoms and subsequently, 2) fine and coarse sand bottoms. The classification procedure was tested on ALB survey data collected with an Optech SHOALS-1000T ALB system that covers a similar to 7 km(2) area within 1 km from shore in the western Gulf of Maine, USA. The bottom classification results, when compared to ground-truth measurements, indicate a 96% overall accuracy for sand and rock classification and 86% overall accuracy for fine and coarse sand classification. Results of ALB-based bottom classification are compared with interpretations of a multibeam echosounder acoustic backscatter mosaic collected from the survey area.

AB Understanding the terrestrial carbon and water cycles is crucial for mitigation and adaptation for climate change. Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical parameter in process-based ecosystem models for simulating gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). The uncertainty in satellite-derived LAI products and their effects on the simulation of carbon and water fluxes at regional scales remain unclear. We evaluated three satellite-derived LAI products - MODIS (MCD15), GLASS, and Four-Scale Geometric Optical Model based LAI (FSGOM) over the period 2003-2012 using fine-resolution (30 m) LAI data and field LAI measurements. GLASS had higher accuracy than FSGOM and MCD15 for forests, while FSGOM had higher accuracy than MCD15 and GLASS for grasslands. The three LAI products differed in magnitude, spatial patterns, and trends in LAI. We then examined the resulting discrepancies in simulated annual GPP and ET over China using a process-based, diagnostic terrestrial biosphere model. Mean annual total GPP for China's terrestrial ecosystems based on GLASS (6.32 Pg C yr(-1)) and FSGOM (6.15 Pg C yr(-5)) was 22.5% and 19.2% higher than that based on MCD15 (5.16 Pg C yr(-1)), respectively. Annual GPP based on GLASS and MCD15 increased over larger fractions of China's vegetated area (15.9% and 17.3%, respectively) than that based on FSGOM (12.6%). National annual ET based on GLASS (379.9 mm yr(-1)) and FSGOM (374.4 mm yr(-1)) was 7.9% and 6.3% higher than that based on MCD15 (352.1 mm yr(-1)), respectively.(-)Simulated ET increased in larger fractions of the vegetated area for GLASS (5.7%) and MCD15 (5.8%) than for FSGOM (3.9%). Our study shows that there were large discrepancies in LAI among satellite-derived LAI products and the biases of the LAI products could lead to substantial uncertainties in simulated carbon and water fluxes.

AB Wetlands provide a wide variety of environmental services globally and detailed wetland inventory maps are always necessary to determine the conservation strategies and effectively monitor these productive ecosystems. During the last two decades, satellite remote sensing data have been extensively used for wetland mapping and monitoring worldwide. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PoISAR) imagery is a complex and multi-dimensional data, which has high potential to discriminate different land cover types. However, despite significant improvements to both information content in PoISAR imagery and advanced classification approaches, wetland classification using PoISAR data may not provide acceptable classification accuracy. This is because classification accuracy using PoISAR imagery strongly depends on the polarimetric features that are incorporated into the classification scheme. In this paper, a novel feature weighting method for PoISAR imagery is proposed to increase the classification accuracy of complex land cover. Specifically, a new coefficient is determined for each element of the coherency matrix by integration of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and physical interpretation of the PoISAR data. The proposed methodology was applied to multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 data in the Avalon Peninsula, Deer Lake, and Gros Morne pilot sites in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Different combinations of input features, including original PoISAR features, polarimetric decomposition features, and modified coherency matrix were used to evaluate the capacity of the proposed method for improving the classification accuracy using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results demonstrated that the modified coherency matrix obtained by the proposed method, Van Zyl, and Freeman-Durden decomposition features were the most important features for wetland classification. The fine spatial resolution maps obtained in this study illustrate the distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the three wetland pilot sites in Newfoundland using the modified coherency matrix and other polarimetric features. The classified maps provide valuable baseline data for effectively monitoring climate and land cover changes, and support further scientific research in this area.

AB Comprehensive polarimetric closure is demonstrated using observations from two in-situ polarimeters and Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) modeling. During the Ship-Aircraft Bio-Optical Research (SABOR) campaign, the novel CCNY HyperSAS-POL polarimeter was mounted on the bow of the R/V Endeavor and acquired hyperspectral measurements from just above the surface of the ocean, while the NASA GISS Research Scanning Polarimeter was deployed onboard the NASA LaRC's King Air UC-12B aircraft. State-of-the-art, ancillary measurements were used to characterize the atmospheric and marine contributions in the VRT model, including those of the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), the AErosol RObotic NETwork for Ocean Color (AERONET-OC), a profiling WETLabs ac-9 spectrometer and the Multi-spectral Volume Scattering Meter (MVSM). An open ocean and a coastal scene are analyzed, both affected by complex aerosol conditions. In each of the two cases, it is found that the model is able to accurately reproduce the Stokes components measured simultaneously by each polarimeter at different geometries and viewing altitudes. These results are mostly encouraging, considering the different deployment strategies of RSP and HyperSAS-POL, which imply very different sensitivities to the atmospheric and ocean contributions, and open new opportunities in above-water polarimetric measurements. Furthermore, the signal originating from each scene was propagated to the top of the atmosphere to explore the sensitivity of polarimetric spaceborne observations to changes in the water type. As expected, adding polarization as a measurement capability benefits the detection of such changes, reinforcing the merits of the full Stokes treatment in modeling the impact of atmospheric and oceanic constituents on remote sensing observations.

AB Accurate knowledge of snow spatial distribution is critical for understanding water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles in mountain areas. Passive microwave measurements of the brightness temperature (T-b) have been widely used to characterize snowpack properties. However, T-b exhibits reduced sensitivity to depth for deep snow and in forests, limiting the ability of many existing algorithms for snow mapping. An alternative approach is to classify snow depth based on its multifrequency T-b signatures. Here, we analyzed airborne T-b measurements of alpine snowpack for five frequencies and two polarizations, and compared them with an estimate of forest cover and concurrent measurements of snow depth and snow wetness collected as part of the NASA Cold Land Processes Field Experiment. We analyzed a total of 900 independent samples, each representing one hectare. Samples were divided into classes based on snow depth, forest fraction, and wetness. We assessed whether the mean Tb spectrum of each class differed from the other classes using the Hotelling's T-squared test, and assessed the separability of classes using the Jefferies-Matusita (J-M) distance.
   Hotelling's T-squared test revealed that the T-b for each forest cover and snow depth class differed statistically from each of the others, for dry snow, notwithstanding that within-class T-b variability tended to be larger than the between-class differences. The J-M distance indicated that most classes were somewhat separable based on the Tb spectra. Consistent with expectations, J-M distance between classes was lower for forested areas than for unforested areas, emphasizing the confounding influence of trees on characterizing snow using T-b measurements.

AB The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea that is optically dominated by coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and has relatively low sun elevation which makes accurate ocean colour remote sensing challenging in these waters. The high absorption, low scattering properties of the Baltic Sea are representative of other optically similar water bodies including the Arctic Ocean, Black Sea, coastal regions adjacent to the CDOM-rich estuaries such as the Amazon, and highly absorbing lakes where radiometric validation is essential in order to develop accurate remote sensing algorithms. Previous studies in this region mainly focused on the validation and improvement of standard Chlorophyll-a (Chl alpha) and attenuation coefficient (k(d)) ocean colour products. The primary input to derive these is the water-leaving radiance (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and it is therefore fundamental to obtain the most accurate L-w or R-rs before deriving higher level products. To this end, the retrieval accuracy of R-rs from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery using six atmospheric correction processors was assessed through above-water measurements at two sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network for Ocean Colour (AERONET-OC; 363 measurements) and a shipbome autonomous platform from which the highest number of measurements were obtained (4986 measurements). The six processors tested were the CoastColour processor (CC), the Case 2 Regional processor for lakes (C2R-Lakes), the Case 2 Regional CoastColour processor (C2R-CC), the FUB/WeW water processor (FUB), the MERIS ground segment processor (MEGS) and POLYMER. All processors except for CC had small average absolute percentage differences (psi) in the wavelength range from 490 nm to 709 nm (psi < 40%), while other bands had larger differences with psi > 60%. Compared to in situ values, the R-rs(709)/R-rs(665) band ratio had psi < 30% for all processors. The most accurate R-rs in the 490 to 709 nm domain was obtained from POLYMER with psi < 30% and coefficients of determination (R-2) > 0.6. Using a score system based on all statistical tests, POLYMER scored highest, while C2R-CC, C2R-Lakes and FUB had lower scores. This study represents the largest data base of in situ R-rs the most comprehensive analysis of AC models for highly absorbing waters and for MERIS, conducted to date. The results have implications for the new generation of Copernicus Sentinel ocean colour satellites.

AB The freeze/thaw (F/T) cycle plays an important role in climate change and ecology research. Currently, soil F/T monitoring is restricted by low satellite spatial resolution or a relative long revisit cycle, which is one of the main problems in improving F/T monitoring resolution using available satellite data. Because temperature is a key parameter in determining soil FIT status, in this study, relatively high-resolution merged land surface temperature data were obtained using the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) method by blending LSTs retrieved from passive microwave and infrared remotely sensed data. The merged temperature data were then used to downscale the passive microwave brightness temperature from 0.25 degrees to 0.05 degrees. Finally, the merged temperature and downscaled brightness temperature data were applied to discriminate the surface freeze/thaw status. A comparison with in situ data turned out that the downscaled brightness temperature could be used to determine soil F/T status with a total classification accuracy higher than 80%. The total freeze/thaw classification accuracy using merged temperature data was only 59.7%, which can be attributed to the temperature difference between the land surface and soil. After the adjustment with a relationship between soil temperature and land surface temperature, the classification accuracy reached 89.7%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Broad scale monitoring of inland waters is essential to research on carbon and water cycles, and for application in the monitoring of disasters including floods and droughts on various spatial and temporal scales. Satellite remote sensing using spatiotemporal data fusion (STF) has recently attracted attention as a way of simultaneously describing spatial heterogeneity and tracking the temporal variability of inland waters. However, existing STF approaches have limitations in describing abrupt temporal changes, integrating "dissimilar" datasets (i.e., fusions between microwave and optical data), and compiling long-term, frequent STF datasets. To overcome these limitations, in this study we developed and evaluated a lookup table (LUT)-based STF, termed database unmixing (DBUX), using multiple types of satellite data (AMSR series, MODIS, and Landsat), and applied it to semi-arid seasonal wetlands in Namibia. The results show that DBUX is: 1) flexible in integrating optical data (MODIS or Landsat) with microwave (AMSR series) and seasonal (day of year) information; 2) able to generate long-term, frequent Landsat-like datasets; and 3) more reliable than an existing approach (spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model; STARFM) for tracking dynamic temporal variations in seasonal wetlands. Water maps retrieved from the resulting STF dataset for the wetlands had a 30-m spatial resolution and a temporal frequency of 1 or 2 days, and the dataset covered from 2002 to 2015. The time series water maps accurately described both seasonal and interannual changes in the wetlands, and could act as a basis for understanding the hydrological features of the region. Further studies are required to enable application of DBUX in other regions, and for other landscapes with different satellite sensor combinations.

AB Fire products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery provide timely information for wildfire detection, monitoring, and characterization at the global scale. However, in Alaskan boreal forest fires, their lower effectiveness in detecting residual fire once the high-intensity fire front has passed limits their practical use for regional or local fire management decisions. Using data acquired during Alaska's 2016 fire season, we analyzed the performance of the MODIS-based MOD14/MYD14, and the more recent VIIRS I-band active fire products. A comparison with the fire perimeter and properties data published by the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center (AICC) shows that both MODIS and VIIRS fire products successfully detect all fires larger than approximately 200-300 ha. For fires smaller than this threshold, the VIIRS I-band product offers higher detection likelihood. To map burn areas containing both low- and high-intensity active fire, we developed the VIIRS I-band Fire Detection Algorithm for High Latitudes (VIFDAHL). We apply this algorithm to regions of known Alaskan boreal forest fires and validate it using events mapped by fire management agencies and detected on closely-timed Landsat imagery. We find that for Alaska, an example of a high-latitude region, VIFDAHL more accurately captures the fire spread, can differentiate well between low and high-intensity fires, and can detect 30-90% more fire pixels compared to the MODIS and VIIRS global fire products.

AB In the recent work of Liu and Minnett (2016), we estimated the sampling errors in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea-Surface Temperatures (SSTs) due to clouds and other causes, and characterized the global error dependence on the variability of clouds and SST. Here we report sampling error sensitivity to the choice of reference field and the error variation when data from a different year are used. We also developed an empirical model to parameterize sampling errors. Our sensitivity tests show that the sampling error quantification method developed is robust and can reveal the consequences of missing infrared SST observations primarily due to clouds. Since the previously found pronounced negative sampling errors along the Tropical Instability Waves are largely dependent on the SST gradients, here these regional sampling errors are quantified using data from an El Nino year, confirming that the weakened meridional SST gradient due to El Nino can reduce the negative sampling errors. Furthermore, the climatology-derived sampling errors are found to be a primary component that can be utilized to estimate and parameterize the sampling errors, especially for the spatial sampling errors. For the temporal sampling errors, good estimates are obtained especially in the high latitudes and stratocumulus regions, by incorporating an empirical model proposed in this study and the previously found sampling error dependence.

AB Recent developments in satellite altimetry are leading to improved spatial resolution, allowing applications in the coastal zone and over inland waters. Validation of these sensors near the shore remains a challenge, since the process of upscaling from single point measurements (gauges or GPS buoys) to the radar altimetry footprint is a source of uncertainty. Meanwhile, Airborne Laser Scanning (LIDAR) has been proven capable of delivering accurate water surface heights rapidly over large areas. Here, we show a proof of concept by comparing airborne LIDAR heights over Lake Balaton, Hungary with near-concurrent Envisat and Jason-2 altimeter heights and water level gauge data. The accuracy of LIDAR heights was improved by strip adjustment and absolute georeferencing to ground control points; waveform retracking improved the accuracy of altimetry data. LIDAR heights were averaged within the outlines of the altimetry footprints. Bias is measured for LIDAR and altimetry with respect to gauge heights, and standard deviation of heights measures the vertical dispersion of footprints within one track. Results show standard deviation of heights is in the order of millimeters for LIDAR and 40-50cm for altimetry and bias with respect to gauge heights is 5cm for LIDAR compared to 40cm for altimetry. We conclude that LIDAR may be used for calibration and validation of high resolution satellite radar altimetry over inland waters. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Determining the age of rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis) is of great interest to plantation managers and land-use decision makers as it enables, among others, reliable forecasts of resource availability. The acquisition of age information with field campaigns, however, is time consuming, laborious and expensive. We present an approach that facilitates rapid assessment of rubber plantation age at regional scales applying very dense Landsat times series (LTS) satellite data over China's second largest rubber planting area - Xishuangbanna. We aggregated 270 Landsat TM and ETM + surface reflectance images into annual best-available-pixel composites of minimum Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). The annual composites were classified into vegetated and non-vegetated pixels applying a global NDMI threshold of 0. As it is common practice in Xishuangbanna to clear the land before a new plantation is established, the last year in which a pixel located in a rubber plantation, was classified as non-vegetated, was recorded as the year of plantation establishment. The resultant plantation age map was validated using a stratified random sample of 184 data points, collected by visual interpretation of historical Landsat data. A Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.5 years was achieved. We estimate that in 2015 50% of Xishuangbanna's rubber plantations had an age suitable for latex tapping (8-25 years), 27% were too young to be tapped (<8 years) and 24% had already reached an age of reduced latex productivity (>25 years) and will be presumably harvested for wood in the near future. The proposed technique enables acquisitions of accurate rubber plantation age information from Landsat time series and NDMI over large areas with the potential of providing insights into land cover dynamics and allowing for the development of improved management strategies and local decision support activities.

AB Aerosols affect the radiative transfer in the absorption bands of carbon dioxide (CO2), thereby contributing to the uncertainties in the retrieval of CO2 from space. A Cloud and Aerosol Polarimetric Imager (CAPI) has been designed to fly on the Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite (TanSat) and provide aerosol and cloud information to facilitate the measurements of CO2. This study aims to assess the information content about aerosol properties that can be obtained from CAPI's observations of radiance and polarization. We simulate synthetic CAPI observations using the UNified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM), from which the degree of freedom for signal (DFS) and a posteriori error for various aerosol parameters are calculated using optimal estimation theory. The simulation considers different combinations of fine and coarse aerosols and includes detailed treatment for both soil and vegetation surfaces. It is found that CAPI can provide 3 to 4.5 independent pieces of information about aerosol parameters, mainly related to aerosol total volume (or aerosol optical depth), fine mode fraction (fmf(nu)) of aerosol volume, and imaginary part of refractive index for coarse mode aerosols. At directions around back-scattering, aerosol information content is smaller due in part to the large directional surface reflectance. In addition, aerosol DFS also depends on fmf(nu), aerosol optical depth and solar zenith angle, and such dependence is analyzed for various viewing and azimuth angles. Due to weaker scattering of coarse aerosol, the information content of large particle is relatively less. Therefore, as fmf(nu) decreases, DFS remains large for fine aerosol and increases for coarse aerosol. With larger aerosol optical depth (AOD), more aerosol information content can be obtained, but when AOD increases to a threshold ranging from 0.5 to 1.2, aerosol DFS doesn't increase any more. At larger solar zenith angles (SZA), a longer light path affected by aerosol can slightly increase aerosol information content. Furthermore, the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) is shown to be more sensitive to aerosol properties than reflectance, hence improves CAPI's aerosol retrieval accuracy. The additional information content raised from DOLP measurements ranges from 1 to 1.8 in terms of DFS and reaches the largest in conditions of 0.2<fmf(nu)<0.4 at SZA<60 degrees. The larger AOD and fmf(nu), the more improvement for characterizing fine aerosol is obtained from polarization due to larger DOLP of fine aerosol scattering (or less for coarse aerosol). If AOD is known a priori (for example, from other A-Train satellites), total DFS for aerosol information content can be improved by 0.8 to 1.6 inmost cases, and could exceed 2.0 for conditions of small AOD (<0.2). However, the improvement has little dependence on AOD if AOD is larger than 0.2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge on geographical location and distribution of crops at global, national and regional scales is an extremely valuable source of information for many applications. Traditional approaches to crop mapping using remote sensing data rely heavily on reference or ground truth data in order to train/calibrate classification models. As a rule, such models are only applicable to a single vegetation season and should be recalibrated to be applicable for other seasons. This paper addresses the problem of early season large-area winter crop mapping using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series and growing degree days (GDD) information derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) product. The model is based on the assumption that winter crops have developed biomass during early spring while other crops (spring and summer) have no biomass. As winter crop development is temporally and spatially non-uniform due to the presence of different agro-climatic zones, we use GDD to account for such discrepancies. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to discriminate winter crops from other crops (spring and summer). The proposed method has the following advantages: low input data requirements, robustness, applicability to global scale application and can provide winter crop maps 1.5-2 months before harvest. The model is applied to two study regions, the State of Kansas in the US and Ukraine, and for multiple seasons (2001-2014). Validation using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Data Layer (CDL) for Kansas and ground measurements for Ukraine shows that accuracies of >90% can be achieved in mapping winter crops 1.5-2 months before harvest. Results also show good correspondence to official statistics with average coefficients of determination R-2 > 0.85. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation composition and water surface area are changing in many tundra regions due to climate warming, which is twice as strong in the Arctic as compared to the global mean. Such land cover changes feed back to climate and permafrost thaw through altering the surface energy budget. We quantified the influence of vegetation type, canopy characteristics, and patchiness on the tundra shortwave radiation components. We used in situ measurements and vegetation mapping to parametrise a 3D radiative transfer model (DART) for summer conditions at the Kytalyk test site in northeast Siberia. We analysed model results assessing the most important drivers of canopy albedo, transmittance, and absorptance of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Tundra albedo was strongly influenced by the fractional cover of water surfaces. Albedo decreased with increasing shrub cover. However, plant area index effects on albedo were not statistically significant. Canopy transmittance and PAR absorptance (f(ApAR)) were almost entirely controlled by plant area index at the landscape scale. Only about one half of the total plant area index consisted of green leaves, while wood and standing dead leaves contributed equally to the other half. While spatial patterns and patch sizes of vegetation types and open water did not significantly influence the radiation budget at the landscape scale, it contributed to the large variability at the local scale. Such local variability of shortwave radiation may impact evapotranspiration and primary productivity at a range of scales. Therefore, the variation of radiation fluxes within single vegetation types potentially affects larger scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s).
   To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The water clarity of many inland water bodies is under threat due to intensifying land use pressures in conjunction with changes in water levels that result from increasing demand and climate variability. The recent launch of Landsat 8 coupled with Geoscience Australia's recent reprocessing of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) archives over the whole of Australia to a consistent surface reflectance product enables sub continental scale spatio-temporal analysis of freshwater optical water quality in support of monitoring and decision making for water management agencies. In this research, we present an objective assessment of the potential of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for monitoring inland water quality dynamics over a number of lakes and reservoirs with a range of optical water types in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. We used bio-optical modelling to develop sensor specific total suspended matter (TSM) retrieval algorithms that account for the difference in relative spectral response between Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. We were able to compare the suitability of the different sensors for optical water quality measurements using water bodies that fell within Landsat path overlaps where Landsat images of surface reflectance were acquired within 24 h between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ or Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. These water bodies represent a range of hydrological and limnological conditions, and enabled us to assess: 1) the comparability of TSM measurements retrieved from each sensor, and 2) the surface reflectance to image noise characteristics of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. Comparisons of lake surface reflectance and noise equivalent reflectance difference show that the improved radiometric resolution and increased quantization of Landsat 8 OLI relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ significantly reduce image noise and spectral heterogeneity, indicating that Landsat 8 OLI data are expected to provide more precise water quality retrievals relative to Landsat 7 ETM+. We found that: 1) the TSM retrievals from the different sensors are highly comparable; 2) Landsat 5 TM overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ by 6.4%; and 3) Landsat 7 ETM+ overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 8 OLI by only 1.4%. Retrieved TSM values were highly correlated with independent in situ data acquired within 24 h of satellite overpass (r = 0.99) with a mean average error of 14 mg/L. The results demonstrate that time series analysis of TSM retrievals can be conducted across a wide range of lakes at the sub-continental scale to characterise the multi-decadal TSM dynamics.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB The potential strengths and limitations of the Landsat systems for water clarity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurement were evaluated in Minnesota in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Optical water quality characteristics, including chlorophyll a, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and CDOM were collected along with imagery from Landsats 7 and 8. Sites represented a wide range of concentrations of CDOM, chlorophyll, and mineral suspended solids (MSS), the primary factors that affect reflectance. Clear images from September 24, 2013 (Landsat 7) and September 16, 2013 (Landsat 8) acquired for northern Minnesota eight days apart allowed comparison of the respective ETM + and OLI sensors for CDOM measurements. We examined a wide variety of potential band and band ratio models and found some two-variable models that included the NIR band worked well for Landsat 8 (R-2 = 0.82) and reasonably well for Landsat 7 (R-2 = 0.74). The commonly used green/red model had a poor fit for both sensors (R-2 = 0.24, 0.25), and five sites with high MSS were clear outliers. Exclusion of these sites and other sites not included with the Landsat 7 dataset yielded a less optically complex subset of 20 coincident lakes. For this subset strong models were found for many band and band ratio models, including the commonly used green/red model with R-2 = 0.79 for Landsat 7 and R-2 = 0.81 for Landsat 8. The less optically complex subset may explain why the green/red model has worked well in other areas. For optically complex waters CDOM models that used the new Landsat 8 ultra-blue and narrower NIR band worked best for the full dataset indicating that the new bands and other Landsat 8 characteristics, such as higher radiometric sensitivity and improved signal-to-noise ratios, improve CDOM measurements.
   For water clarity measured as Secchi depth (SD), we compared September 1, 2008 Landsat 7 and August 22, 2013 Landsat 8 images from path 28 using stepwise regression to identify the best model using all bands and band ratios including the new blue and narrower NIR band. The best water clarity model for Landsat 8 used the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 1 and was nearly identical with a model using the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 2. The latter model is similar to the model used for previous Landsat water clarity assessments, which used the ETM + 1/3 band ratio plus ETM + band 1. For SD measurements we found strong relationships with both sensors, with only slight improvements for the OLI sensor for the lakes in our datasets. In contrast to some previous reports that indicated Landsat 7's ETM + lacked sufficient sensitivity for reliable retrieval of CDOM, we found that overall both sensors worked well for water clarity and CDOM measurements. This will allow their continued use for current and historical measurements of important water characteristics on a regional scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID COVER CLASSIFICATION; MISSION
AB The Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) has 5 to 10 times better signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in all spectral bands than previous Landsat instruments. SNR performance has long been recognized as a value in instrument design, however, the impact on algorithm performance for earth science applications is poorly documented. Since SNR performance may drive design/cost tradeoffs on future missions, a set of experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of various SNR levels on algorithms applied to different science applications. The application areas studied spanned a wide range including water quality, land cover and forestry. The experiments involved producing data sets with a range of signal-dependent SNR values ranging from Landsat 7 ETM + levels to OLI levels. Algorithms were then run on these otherwise identical data sets and evaluation metrics applied to evaluate the relative performance versus SNR. In all cases, performance was shown to be a strong function of SNR with substantial increase in performance as SNR increased (e.g. constituent retrieval errors reduced by a factor of three). However, in some cases, the rate of increase slowed at higher SNR levels. Regrettably, the point of diminishing returns was not the same for all applications leaving significant burden on design teams to decide which application's needs could be fully met in terms of SNR requirements.

AB New and previously unimaginable Landsat applications have been fostered by a policy change in 2008 that made analysis-ready Landsat data free and open access. Since 1972, Landsat has been collecting images of the Earth, with the early years of the program constrained by onboard satellite and ground systems, as well as limitations across the range of required computing, networking, and storage capabilities. Rather than robust on-satellite storage for transmission via high bandwidth downlink to a centralized storage and distribution facility as with Landsat-8, a network of receiving stations, one operated by the U.S. government, the other operated by a community of International Cooperators (ICs), were utilized. ICs paid a fee for the right to receive and distribute Landsat data and over time, more Landsat data was held outside the archive of the United State Geological Survey (USGS) than was held inside, much of it unique. Recognizing the critical value of these data, the USGS began a Landsat Global Archive Consolidation (LGAC) initiative in 2010 to bring these data into a single, universally accessible, centralized global archive, housed at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The primary LGAC goals are to inventory the data held by ICs, acquire the data, and ingest and apply standard ground station processing to generate an LIT analysis-ready product. As of January 1, 2015 there were 5,532,454 images in the USGS archive. LGAC has contributed approximately 3.2 million of those images, more than doubling the original USGS archive holdings. Moreover, an additional 23 million images have been identified to date through the LGAC initiative and are in the process of being added to the archive. The impact of LGAC is significant and, in terms of images in the collection, analogous to that of having had two additional Landsat-5 missions. As a result of LGAC, there are regions of the globe that now have markedly improved Landsat data coverage, resulting in an enhanced capacity for mapping, monitoring change, and capturing historic conditions. Although future missions can be planned and implemented, the past cannot be revisited, undetscoring the value and enhanced significance of historical Landsat data and the LGAC initiative. The aim of this paper is to report the current status of the global USGS Landsat archive, document the existing and anticipated contributions of LGAC to the archive, and characterize the current acquisitions of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. Landsat-8 is adding data to the archive at an unprecedented rate as nearly all terrestrial images are now collected. We also offer key lessons learned so far from the LGAC initiative, plus insights regarding other critical elements of the Landsat program looking forward, such as acquisition, continuity, temporal revisit, and the importance of continuing to operationalize the Landsat program.

AB Remote sensing has proven a useful way of evaluating long-term trends in vegetation "greenness" through the use of vegetation indices like Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). In particular, analyses of greenness trends have been performed for large areas (continents, for example) in an attempt to understand vegetation response to climate. These studies have been most often used coarse resolution sensors like Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). However, trends in greenness are also important at more local scales, particularly in and around cities as vegetation offers a variety of valuable ecosystem services ranging from minimizing air pollution to mitigating urban heat island effects. To explore the ability to monitor greenness trends in and around cities, this paper presents a new way for analyzing greenness trends based on all available Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images and applies it to Guangzhou, China. This method is capable of including the effects of land cover change in the evaluation of greenness trends by separating the effects of abrupt and gradual changes, and providing information on the timing of greenness trends.
   An assessment of the consistency of surface reflectance from Landsat 8 with past Landsat sensors indicates biases in the visible bands of Landsat 8, especially the blue band. Landsat 8 NDVI values were found to have a larger bias than the EVI values; therefore, EVI was used in the analysis of greenness trends for Guangzhou. In spite of massive amounts of development in Guangzhou from 2000 to 2014, greenness was found to increase, mostly as a result of gradual change. Comparison of the greening magnitudes estimated from the approach presented here and a Simple Linear Trend (SLT) method indicated large differences for certain time intervals as the SLT method does not include consideration for abrupt land cover changes. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land cover change when analyzing trends in greenness from satellite time series in areas where land cover change is common.

AB Glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change. Particularly, glacier surface velocity constitutes a key parameter for estimating ice volume variations as response to global warming and its incidence in sea level rise. Several methodologies based in remotely sensed data have been employed for estimating ice velocity fields. They are mostly based in cross-correlating pairs of images in order to track features displacement between two dates. High ice flux velocity, which can reach more than 1 km/year, constitute a challenge for the existing methodologies, in practice limiting to a few days the time span between useful data. In this work we present an extension of the known Pixel Offset - Small Baseline Subsets (PO-SBAS) technique, that profit a set of successive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes for computing displacement time series and ice velocity fields. The algorithm is guided by a preliminary ice velocity model estimated from the data itself, which significantly improves the results reliability and reduces the overall computational cost. Furthermore, it implements a processing scheme that considers the displacement estimations (PO) quality in order to decide which pixels are included in the time series inversion. The proposed technique is applied to 22 COSMO-Skymed SAR images of Viedma Glacier (Southern Patagonian Icefield, Argentina) spanning roughly a year. The results obtained are robust and make profit of the whole available dataset. Resulting mean velocity field and displacement time series show the algorithm suitability for retrieving and characterizing complex ice motion patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditionally, effective soil temperature (T-eff) has been considered to be a secondary intermediate variable in microwave radiative transfer theory. However, its impact on microwave radiometry is comparable to that of vegetation cover, soil surface roughness and dielectric constant. T-eff is defined as the weighted temperature of the emitting layers, where the weighting involved depends on the soil moisture profile. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of various models for estimating T-eff using temperature and moisture profiles obtained from a land surface model. MERRA-Land (the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications-Land) soil moisture profiles and temperature profiles were used to reproduce global T-eff data sets with single parameter schemes (e.g. the Beta Soil Moisture Active Passive, SMAP scheme), two-parameter Choudhury's schemes (e.g. the current SMAP's scheme), two-parameter Wigneron schemes (e.g. the current Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity scheme, SMOS), and multilayer T-eff schemes (e.g. Lv's scheme). The results show that differences in T-eff between these schemes are usually <5 K. The comparison between Wigneron's and Lv's schemes indicates that, the difference is small (RMSD, root mean squared difference <1 K). In exceptional cases (<1%), the RMSD between Choudhury's T-eff scheme and Lv's scheme can reach around 5 K. The Beta SMAP T-eff has a difference of around 5 K, compared to Lv's scheme. Such a change in T-eff could lead to an emissivity difference of around 0.015. The most extreme emissivity difference is only found in desert areas, at 42.5 degrees (the incidence angle used by the SMAP mission is about 40 degrees). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is a well-established need within the remote sensing community for improved estimation and understanding of canopy structure and its influence on the retrieval of leaf biochemical properties. The main goal of this research was to assess the potential of optical spectral information from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to discriminate different canopy structural types. In the first phase, we assessed the relationships between optical metrics and canopy structural parameters obtained from LiDAR in terms of different canopy structural attributes (biomass (i.e., area under Vegetation Vertical Profile, VVPint), canopy height and vegetation complexity). Secondly, we identified and classified different "canopy structural types" by integrating several structural traits using Random Forests (RF). The study area is a heterogeneous forest in Sierra National Forest in California (USA). AVIRIS optical properties were analyzed by means of several sets of variables, including single narrow band reflectance and 1st derivative, sub-pixel cover fractions, narrow-band indices, spectral absorption features, optimized normalized difference indices and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) components. Our results demonstrate that optical data contain structural information that can be retrieved. The first principal component, used as a proxy for albedo, was the most strongly correlated optical metric with vegetation complexity, and it also correlated well with biomass (VVPint) and height. In conifer forests, the shade fraction was especially correlated to vegetation complexity, while water-sensitive optical metrics had high correlations with biomass (VVPint). Single spectral band analysis results showed that correlations differ in magnitude and in direction, across the spectrum and by vegetation type and structural variable. This research illustrates the potential of AVIRIS to analyze canopy structure and to distinguish several structural types in a heterogeneous forest. Furthermore, RF using optical metrics derived from AVIRIS proved to be a powerful technique to generate maps of structural attributes. The results emphasize the importance of using the whole optical spectrum, since all spectral regions contributed to canopy structure assessment (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, satellite observations including gravity (GRACE), terrestrial reflectance (MODIS), and global precipitation (TRMM) data, along with the output from the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model, are used to generate monthly and sub-monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates and quantify flood events over the Tonle Sap basin between 2002 and 2014. This study is the first time GRACE data have been used to investigate the hydrological processes over the Tonle Sap basin. To improve the accuracy of the TWS estimates from GRACE, a signal restoration method was applied in an effort to recover the signal loss (i.e., signal leakage) inherent in the standard GRACE post-processing scheme. The method applies the correction based on the GRACE observations only, requiring no external data or hydrological models. The effectiveness of the technique over the Tonle Sap basin was validated against several independent data sets. Based on the GRACE observations since 2002, the 2011 and 2013 flood events were clearly identified, and measured to have basin-averaged TWS values of 42 cm (40% higher than the long-term mean peak value) and 36 cm (34% higher) equivalent water height, respectively. Those same years also coincide with the largest observed flood extents, estimated from the MODIS data as 6561 km(2) (91% above the long-term mean peak value) and 5710 km(2) (66% above), respectively. Those flood events are also linked to the observed inter-annual variations of water storage between 2010 and 2014. It was shown that those inter-annual variations mainly reflect the variations in the surface water and groundwater storage components, influenced by the change of the precipitation intensity. In addition, this study presents a new approach for deriving monthly and sub-monthly TWS variations over a regularly inundated area by using MODIS reflectance data in addition to GRACE solutions. The results of this study show that GRACE data can be considered as an effective tool for monitoring certain small-scale (82,000 km(2)) hydrological basins. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite has been providing data, including sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements, for more than five years. However, the operational ESA Level 2 SSS data are known to have significant spatially and temporally varying biases between measurements from ascending passes (SSSA) and measurements from descending passes (SSSD).
   This paper demonstrates how these biases are reduced through the use of SSS anomalies. Climatology products are constructed using SMOS Level 2 data to provide daily, one-degree by one-degree climatologies separately for ascending and descending passes using a moving window approach (in time and space). The daily, one-degree products can then be averaged to provide values of climatological SSS at different spatial and/or temporal resolutions.
   The averaged values of the SMOS climatology products are in good general agreement with data from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. However, there are significant differences at high latitudes, as well as in coastal and dynamic regions, as found by previous studies. Both the mean and standard deviation of the differences between data from ascending passes and data from descending passes for the anomalies are reduced compared with those obtained using the original salinity values.
   Geophysical signals are clearly visible in the anomaly products and an example is shown in the Southern Indian Ocean of westward-propagating signals that we conclude represent the surface expression of Rossby waves or large-scale non-linear eddies. The signals seen in salinity data agree (in speed) with those from sea surface temperature and sea surface height and are consistent with previous studies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Brightness temperatures at 1.4 GHz (L-band) measured by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission have been used to derive the thickness of sea ice. The retrieval method is applicable only for relatively thin ice and not during the melting period. Hitherto, the availability of ground truth sea ice thickness measurements for validation of SMOS sea ice products was mainly limited to relatively thick ice. The situation has improved with an extensive field campaign in the Barents Sea during an anomalous ice edge retreat and subsequent freeze-up event in March 2014. A sea ice forecast system for ship route optimisation has been developed and was tested during this field campaign with the ice-strengthened research vessel RV Lance. The ship cruise was complemented with coordinated measurements from a helicopter and the research aircraft Polar 5. Sea ice thickness was measured using an electromagnetic induction (EM) system from the bow of RV Lance and another EM-system towed below the helicopter. Polar 5 was equipped among others with the L-band radiometer EMIRAD-2. The experiment yielded a comprehensive data set allowing the evaluation of the operational forecast and route optimisation system as well as the SMOS-derived sea ice thickness product that has been used for the initialization of the forecasts. Two different SMOS sea ice thickness products reproduce the main spatial patterns of the ground truth measurements while the main difference being an underestimation of thick deformed ice. Ice thicknesses derived from the surface elevation measured by an airborne laser scanner and from simultaneous EMIRAD-2 brightness temperatures correlate well up to 1.5 m which is more than the previously anticipated maximal SMOS retrieval thickness.

AB Ecosystems worldwide are threatened by the increasing impact of land use and climate change. To protect their diversity and functionality, spatially explicit monitoring systems are needed. In remote areas, monitoring is difficult and recurrent field surveys are costly. By using Lidar or the more cost-effective and repetitive optical satellite data, remote sensing could provide proxies for habitat structure supporting measures for the conservation of biodiversity. Here we compared the explanatory power of both, airborne Lidar and optical satellite data in modeling the spatial distribution of biodiversity of birds across a complex tropical mountain forest ecosystem in southeastern Ecuador. We used data from field surveys of birds and chose three measures as proxies for different laspects of diversity: (i) Shannon diversity as a measure of alpha-diversity that also includes the relative abundance of species, (ii) phylodiversity as a first proxy for functional diversity, and (iii) community composition as a proxy for combined alpha- and beta-diversity. We modeled these diversity estimates using partial least-square regression of Lidar and optical texture metrics separately and compared the models using a leave-one-out validated R-2 and root mean square error. Bird community information was best predicted by both remote sensing datasets, followed by Shannon diversity and phylodiversity. Our findings reveal a high potential of optical texture metrics for predicting Shannon diversity and a measure of community composition, but not for modeling phylodiversity. Generalizing from the investigated tropical mountain ecosystem, we conclude that texture information retrieved from multispectral data of operational satellite systems could replace costly airborne laser-scanning for modeling certain aspects of biodiversity.

AB Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

AB Calibration is a crucial step in the application of hydrological models and is typically performed using in situ streamflow data. However, many rivers on the globe are ungauged or poorly gauged, or the gauged data are not readily available. In this study, we used remotely-sensed surface water extent from the Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) as a proxy for streamflow, and tested its value for calibration of the distributed rainfall-runoff routing model LISFLOOD. In a first step, we identified 30 streamflow gauging sites with a high likelihood of reliable GFDS data. Next, for each of these 30 sites, the model parameters related to groundwater and routing were independently calibrated against in situ and GFDS-derived streamflow time series, and against the raw GFDS surface water extent time series. We compared the performance of the three calibrated and the uncalibrated model simulations in terms of reproducing the in situ streamflow time series. Furthermore, we calculated the gain achieved by each scenario that used satellite-derived information relative to the reference uncalibrated scenario and the one that used in situ data.
   Results show that using the raw GFDS data as a proxy for streamflow for calibration improved the skill of the simulated streamflow (in particular the high flows) for 21 of the 30 sites using correlation as a metric. Furthermore, we discuss a calibration strategy using a combination of in situ and satellite data for global hydrological models. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Evaluation of classification methods, whether in connection with the development of new methods or in an application setting, has been hampered by the lack of availability of adequate data and an approach for comparisons. We collected 30 mostly moderate-resolution, multispectral datasets to enable statistically rigorous comparisons of methods and have made those datasets available for other researchers. We developed a methodological approach to comparing classification methods and demonstrated the approach using six methods, C5.0, classification tree analysis, logistic model trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest, and support vector machines. We also demonstrated how these data and this approach can be used to address specific questions in addition to overall accuracy performance, including the relative effects of using derived components and ancillary data and the relative success in classifying rare classes. Most methods performed best by at least one metric with at least one dataset Therefore, although random forest on average performed statistically significantly better than the other methods tested, we do not recommend this method as the sole option currently in remote sensing. Rather, our results suggest that remote sensing analysts should evaluate multiple methods with respect to any classification project, which can be accomplished through statistical software packages.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. However, thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolutions are limited because of the technical limitations of current thermal sensors. Therefore, development of fusion models to obtain thermal data in high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial in environmental studies. This paper presents a hybrid wavelet-artificial intelligence fusion approach (WAIFA)to produce LST data at the spatial resolution of Landsat 8 thermal bands. The theoretical basis and the application procedures of the proposed data fusion approach are explained. A case study was performed to predict LSTs of six dates in 2014 from March to August in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. This approach uses powerful non-linear artificial intelligence modeling systems which can cope with the non-linear nature of the land surface temperature data. In addition, multispectral bands and different spectral indices are used as well as thermal data in the modeling process to consider the mixture properties of MODIS pixels. Using a 2D wavelet transform to capture the properties of the main signals (original bands) in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions to consider the effect of neighboring pixels is the other improvement of this modeling approach. It can also help the model to deal with the non-stationary properties of the satellite and land surface temperature data. The results indicated that the prediction accuracy of the model in different dates varies from 0.47 K to 1.93 K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Outbreaks of bark beetles cause widespread tree mortality, which have important consequences for wildlife, forest composition and structure, timber production, and water resources. Recent severe, extensive, and synchronous bark beetle outbreaks have motivated research into methods for surveying the location, extent, and attack stage of outbreak using remotely sensed data. In this paper, we adapt methods for classing mountain pine beetle-induced tree mortality to detect spruce beetle-induced tree mortality from single-date high-resolution imagery and multi-date moderate-resolution data. We use freely available aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) to produce a tree-scale map of gray-stage spruce beetle kill across a broad spatial extent. This map was then used to train a stand-scale classification of spruce beetle outbreak from Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) data. Gray-stage spruce beetle outbreak was characterized by higher values of the red-green index (RGI) at the tree-level. At the stand-level, gray stands were associated with high values of a Disturbance Index (DI) and low values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Both tree- and stand-scale classifiers of spruce beetle-attributed tree mortality were highly accurate (overall accuracy and user's accuracy for gray trees/stands greater-than 88%). Stand-level classification improved with post-classification correction, which removed high-frequency year-to-year variability in forest condition. Comparison of high-resolution and moderate-resolution classified imagery revealed variable amounts of tree mortality occur in areas of landscape-scale spruce beetle outbreak. Our results highlight the utility of both ecologically informed post-classification correction and coupling fine-scale and moderate-scale resolution imagery for mapping and studying spruce beetle outbreaks.

AB Monitoring soil surface dynamics in semi-arid agricultural landscapes becomes increasingly important due to the vulnerability of these ecosystems to desertification processes. Observations using remote sensing via the traditionally used visible-near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelength regions can be limited due to the special characteristics of such soils (e.g. rich in quartz, poor in clay minerals, coarse textured, and grain coatings). In this laboratory-based work we demonstrate the capabilities of the thermal infrared between 8 and 14 mu m (longwave infrared) to detect and quantify small ranges of the soil properties sand-, clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, as they appear in the semi-arid agricultural landscapes of the Mullewa region in Western Australia. All of the three soil properties could be predicted using the longwave infrared (LWIR) spectra with higher accuracy and precision than from the VNIR-SWIR wavelength region. The study revealed the complex relationships between the soil properties and the VNIR-SWIR soil spectra, which were caused by the spectral influence of the soils' grain coatings (based on iron and clay minerals). These difficulties could be handled more appropriately by the prediction models based on the LWIR soil spectra. Our results indicate that in order to quantitatively monitor farming areas for such erosion-related soil properties; remote sensing using the LWIR wavelength region would produce better estimates than using the wavelength ranges in the VNIR-SWIR.

TI Estimating mountain glacier surface temperatures from Landsat-ETM plus

AB Surface temperatures on mountain glaciers are a direct reflection of the heat budget at the glacier surface, which controls the degree of ablation. An understanding of surface temperatures is therefore crucial in simulating the evolution of mountain glaciers and in understanding a glacier's response to climate change. In situ observations indicate that when the exitance angle equals 75 degrees, relative to the nadir angle, the emissivity variation at lambda = 12.5 mu m in bare ice is as much as 0.24. However, research involving the remote-sensing-retrieval of mountain glacier surface temperatures does not generally take into account the topography (i.e., the exitance angle), and the validation of remote sensing approaches using surflcial climate measurements on mountain glaciers is lacking. Here we utilize the ETM+ multispectral dataset and resampled water vapor content data from MOD05, combined with the emissivity model of ice and snow, taking the exitance angle into account (Hori et al., 2013), and employ the single-channel algorithm developed by Jimenez-Mufioz et al. (2009), to calculate the remote-sensing-retrieved surface temperature distribution across Qiyi glacier, China, from July 2012 to September 2013. The remote-sensing-retrieved temperatures are validated by the 10-min mean measurements of surface temperature from two automatic weather stations at different altitudes on the glacier, and the results show good agreement at the two sites, with an average bias of 0.96 K and an average root mean square error of 1.5 K. Of note, in summer the influence of thermal emissions from surrounding topography means that the error associated with retrieved temperatures for the glacier tongue and margins might exceed 1.5 K.

AB Climate and physiological controls of vegetation gross primary production (GPP) vary in space and time. In many ecosystems, GPP is primary limited by absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation; in others by canopy conductance. These controls further vary in importance over daily to seasonal time scales. We propose a simple but effective conceptual model that estimates GPP as the lesser of a conductance-limited (F-c) and radiation-limited (Fr) assimilation rate. F-c is estimated from canopy conductance while Fr is estimated using a light use efficiency model. Both can be related to vegetation properties observed by optical remote sensing. The model has only two fitting parameters: maximum light use efficiency, and the minimum achieved ratio of internal to external CO2 concentration. The two parameters were estimated using data from 16 eddy covariance flux towers for six major biomes including both energy- and water-limited ecosystems. Evaluation of model estimates with flux tower-derived GPP compared favourably to that of more complex models, for fluxes averaged; per day (r(2) = 0.72, root mean square error, RMSE = 2.48 mu mol C m(2) s(-1), relative percentage error, RPE = -11%), over 8-day periods (r(2) = 0.78 RMSE = 2.09 mu mol C m(2) s(-1),RPE = -10%), over months (r(2) = 0.79, RMSE = 1.93 mu mol C m(2) s(-1), RPE = -9%) and over years (r(2) = 0.54, RMSE = 1.62 umol C m(2) s(-1), RPE = -9%). Using the model we estimated global GPP of 107 Pg C y(-1) for 2000-2011. This value is within the range reported by other GPP models and the spatial and inter-annual patterns compared favourably. The main advantages of the proposed model are its simplicity, avoiding the use of uncertain biome- or land-cover class mapping, and inclusion of explicit coupling between GPP and plant transpiration.

AB Accurate spatial information of canopy clumping degree (11) contributes to better understanding of the light regime within the canopy and the physiological processes associated with it. This paper evaluates the potential of terrestrial (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) to estimate 12 in different vegetation types after converting the point cloud into a 3-dimensional (3D) voxel-based model. Three methods are presented based on the spatial distribution of the returns (Standardized Morisita's Index - SMI); the gap distribution (Pielou's coefficient of segregation - PCS) and the gap size distribution (Chen & Cihlar's clumping index - CCI). Compared to Omega values derived from hemispherical photographs (HPs), the CCI method outperformed PCS and SMI for both instruments, with a correlation value of 0.93 (vs. 0.79 - PCS and 0.65 - SMI) for oak trees using TLS; 0.83 (vs. 0.78 - PCS and 0.73 - SMI) for a shrub chaparral using ALS data; and 0.84 (vs. 0.81 - PCS and 0.50 - SMI) for a mixed Mediterranean forest using ALS data. Voxel size was an important parameter to estimate (I showing statistically significant differences for the different resolutions tested. Voxel size had an opposite effect on SMI than that on PCS and CCI, with SMI providing better results for coarser voxel sizes, and PCS and CCI yielding higher accuracies for finer voxels. In the case of the TLS, the influence of the zenith angle was also evaluated by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test CCI and PCS did not show significant differences among the zenith angles tested, but SMI did. The radius of the plot used to analyze ALS data significantly affected the correlations with HP, with the best results found at 13, 7 and 15 m for mixed Mediterranean forest and at 11, 10 and 5 m for shrubs for CCI, PCS and SMI, respectively. The methods presented have the potential to be operationally applied to other areas using TLS and MS data, since they are not based on an empirical fit but on the analysis of the gap size in the canopy and the distribution of returns after voxelization.

AB Annual maps of the remote sensing green-up date derived from SPOT-VEGETATION data were compared to the phenological observations collected by the PlantWatch citizen science project across Canada between 1998 and 2012. Green-up dates were found to relate to the leaf-out dates for four woody species (Populus tremuloides, Acer rubrum, Syringa vulgaris, Larix laricina), with a RMSE from 13.6 to 15.6 days. This was true for all landcover types except in pixels where agriculture or water bodies were dominant. This is less accurate than the results from previous studies for boreal Eurasia (RMSE = 8.7 days), with phenology data from an operational network. When data were aggregated at a regional level, the remote sensing green-up date matched well with the interannual variations in leafing and also in flowering of most of the recorded species. These included spring events for trees, shrubs and non-woody plants which were either native to Canada or introduced. For most plants, spring flowering and leafing times are functions of accumulated temperature. For this reason, plant species develop in a predictable sequence, and interannual variations in this cohort of species leafing and flowering are correlated. This explains the correlation with remote sensing green-up. Data from this volunteer PlantWatch network proved consistent with independent satellite data, suggesting that combining the two will strengthen the future capacity to monitor vegetation changes.

AB Phytoplankton, at the base of the marine food web, represent a fundamental food source in coral reef ecosystems. The timing (phenology) and magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass are major determinants of trophic interactions. The Red Sea is one of the warmest and most saline basins in the world, characterized by an arid tropical climate regulated by the monsoon. These extreme conditions are particularly challenging for marine life. Phytoplankton phenological indices provide objective and quantitative metrics to characterize phytoplankton seasonality. The indices i.e. timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration are estimated here using 15 years (1997-2012) of remote sensing ocean-color data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative project (OC-CCI) in the entire Red Sea basin. The OC-CCI product, comprising merged and bias-corrected observations from three independent ocean-color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS), and processed using the POLYMER algorithm (MERIS period), shows a significant increase in chlorophyll data coverage, especially in the southern Red Sea during the months of summer NW monsoon. In open and reef-bound coastal waters, the performance of OC-CCI chlorophyll data is shown to be comparable with the performance of other standard chlorophyll products for the global oceans. These features have permitted us to investigate phytoplankton phenology in the entire Red Sea basin, and during both winter SE monsoon and summer NW monsoon periods. The phenological indices are estimated in the four open water provinces of the basin, and further examined at six coral reef complexes of particular socio-economic importance in the Red Sea, including Siyal Islands, Shams El Sheikh, Al Wajh bank, Thuwal reefs, Al Lith reefs and Farasan Islands. Most of the open and deeper waters of the basin show an apparent higher chlorophyll concentration and longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the winter period (relative to the summer phytoplankton growth period). In contrast, most of the reef-bound coastal waters display equal or higher peak chlorophyll concentrations and equal or longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the summer period (relative to the winter phytoplankton growth period). The ecological and biological significance of the phytoplankton seasonal characteristics are discussed in context of ecosystem state assessment, and particularly to support further understanding of the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Red Sea.

AB In the former "Eastern Bloc" countries, there have been dramatic changes in forest disturbance and forest recovery rates since the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to the transition to open-market economies, and the recent economic crisis. Unfortunately though, Eastern European countries collected their forest statistics inconsistently, and their boundaries have changed, making it difficult to analyze forest dynamics over time. Our goal here was to consistently quantify forest cover change across Eastern Europe since the 1980s based on the Landsat image archive. We developed an algorithm to simultaneously process data from different Landsat platforms and sensors (TM and ETM+) to map annual forest cover loss and decadal forest cover gain. We processed 59,539 Landsat images for 527 footprints across Eastern Europe and European Russia. Our results were highly accurate, with gross forest loss producer's and user's accuracy of >88% and >89%, respectively, and gross forest gain producer's and user's accuracy of>75% and >91%, based on a sample of probability-based validation points. We found substantial changes in the forest cover of Eastern Europe. Net forest cover increased from 1985 to 2012 by 4.7% across the region, but decreased in Estonia and Latvia. Average annual gross forest cover loss was 0.41% of total forest cover area, with a statistically significant increase from 1985 to 2012. Timber harvesting was the main cause of forest loss, accompanied by some insect defoliation and forest conversion, while only 7.4% of the total forest cover loss was due to large-scale wildfires and windstorms. Overall, the countries of Eastern Europe experienced constant levels or declines in forest loss after the collapse of socialism in the late 1980s, but a pronounced increase in loss in the early 2000s. By the late 2000s, however, the global economic crisis coincided with reduced timber harvesting in most countries, except Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the Baltic states. Most forest disturbance did not result in a permanent forest loss during our study period. Indeed, forest generally recovered fast and only 12% of the areas of forest loss prior to 1995 had not yet recovered by 2012. Our results allow national and sub-national level analysis and are available on-line (http://glad.geog.umd.edu/europe/) to serve as a baseline for further analyses of forest dynamics and its drivers.

AB Distribution of land cover has a profound impact on the climate and environment; mapping the land cover patterns from global, regional to local scales are important for scientists and authorities to yield better monitoring of the changing world. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful tool to monitor large-scale ground deformation at active volcanoes. However, vegetation and pyroclastic deposits degrade the radar coherence and therefore the measurement of 3-D surface displacements. In this article, we explore the complementarity between ALOS-PALSAR coherence images, airborne LiDAR data and in situ measurements acquired over the Piton de La Fournaise volcano (Reunion Island, France) to determine the sources of errors that may affect repeat-pass InSAR measurements. We investigate three types of surfaces: terrains covered with vegetation, lava flows (a'a, pahoehoe or slabby pahoehoe lava flows) and pyroclastic deposits (lapilli). To explain the loss of coherence observed over the Dolomieu crater between 2008 and 2009, we first use laser altimetry data to map topographic variations. The LiDAR intensity, which depends on surface reflectance, also provides ancillary information about the potential sources of coherence loss. In addition, surface roughness and rock dielectric properties of each terrain have been determined in situ to better understand how electromagnetic waves interact with such media: rough and porous surfaces, such as the a'a lava flows, produce a higher coherence loss than smoother surfaces, such as the pahoehoe lava flows. Variations in dielectric properties suggest a higher penetration depth in pyroclasts than in lava flows at L-band frequency. Decorrelation over the lapilli is hence mainly caused by volumetric effects. Finally, a map of LAI (Leaf Area Index) produced using SPOT 5 imagery allows us to quantify the effect of vegetation density: radar coherence is negatively correlated with LAI and is unreliable for values higher than 7.5.

AB Spatio-temporal patterns of suspended particulate matter, SPM, in coastal waters under the Mekong's influence are examined through remote sensing data collected from January 2003 to April 2012 by the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) at full spatial resolution (300 x 300 m(2)). The first SPM climatology over this region is provided and the SPM temporal variation schemes (irregular variability, seasonal variability, and long term trend) are described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. The different spatio-temporal patterns are then analyzed with regard to regional oceanographic and hydrologic conditions. The origin of the processes controlling the seasonality of the Mekong Delta plume is characterized. The increase of turbidity observed from June to December, starts with the Mekong sediment inputs which are maximum during the summer monsoon (the water discharge reaches its maximum in September/October). While the Mekong water discharge decreases, the concentration of suspended sediment keeps increasing in coastal waters during the following two/three months (November to January). This increase is explained by resuspension effects occurring in the shallow coastal areas. Due to higher wave energy and oblique orientation of the waves breaking near the coast, the winter monsoon triggers a high level of agitation and high value of resuspended material concentration which are submitted to a longshore current directed towards the South-West Deposition (in front of the Delta) and erosion (northern and southern areas of the delta) areas are identified in good agreement with recent results obtained from a prognostic model. While the temporal variability is strongly dominated by the seasonal component, a long term trend of about -5% SPM concentration per year is observed in the pro-delta area and is attributed to the decrease of the Mekong river sediment output during the high flow season.

AB Frequency and severity of droughts are projected to increase in many regions, and their effects on temporal dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle remain uncertain. Ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) is a key component of the carbon cycle, and rainfall use efficiency (RUE = NPP/precipitation) is an important measure of ecosystem stability and resilience. Here we investigated the temporal patterns of NPP and RUE and their key driving climate factors, during the early 21st century drought for four biomes in China: Needleleaf forest, Broadleaf forest, Woody savannas, and Grassland. Estimates of regional-scale NPP were based on the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17 NPP product. Our results confirmed recent findings that the impact of current-year precipitation on NPP was confounded by an array of biotic and abiotic factors. Whereas, the RUE responded strongly to variations in current- and previous-year drought for all the four biomes and the four biomes combined. We found that a dry year preceded by a wet year resulted in the highest RUE, and conversely, a wet year preceded by a dry year resulted in the lowest RUE. This was attributed to the legacy effect of precipitation changes in both wet and dry years, and to the resilience of the biomes in the dry years. Based on these results, we developed and validated a model of RUE based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) of both current and previous years which works well for these four biomes and all biomes combined. This model is particularly useful for understanding the impact of prolonged drought at the landscape scale because it is based on accessible satellite data and available meteorological data and the results have been tested across four major biomes.

AB Vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters related to water are pivotal to understanding the water cycle and its interactions with carbon and energy balance. This study assessed a wide range of methods to estimate foliar water content (FWC, g/cm(2)), canopy water content (CWC, g/cm(2)), fuel moisture content (FMC) and interrelated variables leaf mass per area (LMA, g/cm(2)), foliar biomass (FB, g/m(2)), and leaf area index (LAI, m(2)/m(2)) using multitemporal Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Estimations are compared to in-situ measurements stratified by cover type (i.e. grasses, shrubs and forest) made at Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, California, USA. Curve-fitting techniques, a widely accepted method to retrieve CWC from AVIRIS, proved relatively inaccurate. Standard and recently designed vegetation indexes (VIs) provided higher accuracy; however, the most accurate VI differed by variable and by cover types. To evaluate if a hyperspectral narrow band sensor enhances the retrieval of these variables over multispectral broad bands, AVIRIS was convolved to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bands. Best band combination indexes out of all possible bands improved the retrievals significantly over VI in the case of FMC, LMA and FB using AVIRIS bands in the longer SWIR wavelength region. AVIRIS PROSAIL and MODIS CWC PROSAIL radiative transfer model inversion had difficulty retrieving three of these variables simultaneously without a precise knowledge of the remaining chemical and physical conditions of the vegetation and soil. The SWIR region must be further investigated for water retrievals given that soil, dry mass and water are interrelated in the spectral signal plus the additional unknown impact of canopy structure upon the spectrum.

AB Uncertainties in L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiative transfer modeling (RTM) affect the simulation of brightness temperatures (Tb) over land and the inversion of satellite-observed Tb into soil moisture retrievals. In particular, accurate estimates of the microwave soil roughness, vegetation optical depth and scattering albedo for large-scale applications are difficult to obtain from field studies and often lack an estimate of uncertainty. Here, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method is used to determine satellite-scale estimates of RTM parameters and their posterior uncertainty by minimizing the misfit between long-term averages and standard deviations of simulated and observed Tb at multiple incidence angles, at horizontal and vertical polarizations, and for morning and evening overpasses. Tb simulations are generated with the land model component of the Goddard Earth Observing System (version 5) and confronted with Tb observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity satellite mission. The maximum a posteriori density (MAP) parameter values reduce the root-mean-square differences between observed and simulated long-term Tb averages and standard deviations to 3.4 K and 23 K, respectively. The relative uncertainty of the posterior RTM parameter estimates is typically less than 25% of the MAP parameter value, whereas it exceeds 100% for literature-based prior parameter estimates. It is also shown that the parameter values estimated through Particle Swarm Optimization are in close agreement with those obtained from MCMC simulation. The MCMC results for the RTM parameter values and the uncertainties presented herein are directly relevant to the need for accurate Tb modeling in global land data assimilation systems.

AB The phenology of vegetation exerts an important control over the terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. Remote sensing of key phenological phases in forests (e.g., the spring onset and autumn end of growing season) remains challenging due to noise in time series and the limited seasonal variation of canopy greenness in evergreen forests. Using 94 site-years of C flux data from four deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) and six evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) in North America, we examine whether growing season phenology can be remotely sensed from mean vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spring (Apr.-May) and autumn (Sep.-Nov) observations. Five Vls were used based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the land surface water index (LSWI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). Our results show that growing season transitions can be inferred from mean seasonal Vls, though the different Vls varied in their predictive strength across sites and plant functional types. Widely used NDVI and EVI exhibited limited potential in tracking growing season phenology of ENF ecosystems, while indices sensitive to water (i.e., LSWI) or less influenced by soil (i.e., OSAVI) may have unrevealed powers in indicating phenological transitions. OSAVI was shown to be a strong predictor of the end of the growing season in ENF ecosystems, suggesting that this VI may offer a new strategy for modeling the phenology of ENF sites. We conclude that combinations of multiple indices may improve the remote sensing of land surface phenology, as evidenced by the good agreement between modeled and observed growing season transitions and its length in our evaluation.

AB An automated computational methodology to extract agricultural crop fields from 30 m Web Enabled Landsat data (WELD) time series is presented. The results for three 150 x 150 km WELD tiles encompassing rectangular, circular (center-pivot irrigation) and irregularly shaped fields in Texas, California and South Dakota are presented and compared to independent United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cropland data layer (CDL) classifications. Coherent fields that are visually apparent were extracted with relatively limited apparent errors of omission or commission compared to the CDL classifications. This is due to several factors. First, the use of multi-temporal Landsat data, as opposed to single Landsat acquisitions, that enables crop rotations and inter-annual variability in the state of the vegetation to be accommodated for and provides more opportunities for cloud-free, non-missing and atmospherically uncontaminated surface observations. Second, the adoption of an object-based approach, namely the variational region-based geometric active contour method that enables robust segmentation with only a small number of parameters and that requires no training data. Third, the use of a watershed algorithm to decompose connected segments belonging to multiple fields into coherent isolated field segments and a geometry-based algorithm to detect and associate parts of circular fields together. A preliminary validation is presented to gain quantitative insights into the field extraction accuracy and to prototype a validation protocol including new geometric measures that quantify the accuracy of individual field objects. Implications and recommendations for future research and large-area applications are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying cloud interference in satellite-derived data is a critical step toward developing useful remotely sensed products. Most MODIS land products use a combination of the MODIS (MOD35) cloud mask and the 'internal' cloud mask of the surface reflectance product (MOD09) to mask clouds, but there has been little discussion of how these masks differ globally. We calculated global mean cloud frequency for both products, for 2009, and found that inflated proportions of observations were flagged as cloudy in the Collection 5 MOD35 product. These erroneously categorized areas were spatially and environmentally non-random and usually occurred over high-albedo land cover types (such as grassland and savanna) in several regions around the world. Additionally, we found that spatial variability in the processing path applied in the Collection 5 MOD35 algorithm affects the likelihood of a cloudy observation by up to 20% in some areas. These factors result in abrupt transitions in recorded cloud frequency across land cover and processing-path boundaries impeding their use for fine-scale spatially contiguous modeling applications. We show that together, these artifacts have resulted in significantly decreased and spatially biased data availability for Collection 5 MOD35-derived composite MODIS land products such as land surface temperature (MOD11) and net primary productivity (MOD17). Finally, we compare our results to mean cloud frequency in the new Collection 6 MOD35 product, and find that land cover artifacts have been reduced but not eliminated. Collection 6 thus increases data availability for some regions and land cover types in MOD35-derived products but practitioners need to consider how the remaining artifacts might affect their analysis.

AB The fresh Amazon/Orinoco plume covers in excess of 10(6) km(2) in late summer-early fall forming a near-surface barrier layer that reduces exchange with the cooler, saltier water below. Barrier layers and higher water turbidity keep SST in the region high and thus are factors in the development of fall season hurricanes. Year to year changes in key properties of salinity and areal coverage may depend on a number of factors including river discharge, ocean rainfall, vertical entrainment rate, and horizontal advection. This study uses new sea surface salinity observations from the Aquarius/SACD and SMOS satellites to show that the plume was 1 psu saltier in early fall 2012 than in the previous fall (despite a stronger Amazon discharge in 2012) and explores the possible causes. The study concludes that the most likely causes of the 2012 salinification are a relative deficit of rainfall over the inflow to the plume region well southeast of the plume in spring and a weaker North Brazil current in spring-summer. The results suggest that tracking spring rainfall can potentially contribute to forecasting the Amazon plume stratification during the fall hurricane season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, we compare sea surface freshwater flux products over the global ocean for the period of 1988-2005, taking into consideration the average field, global water budget, and interannual variability and trends. The analysis considers satellite-based products (Japanese Ocean Flux Datasets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations [J-OFURO2], Hamburg Ocean-atmosphere Parameters from Satellite Data 3 [HOAPS3], Remote Sensing Systems [RSS], Global Precipitation Climatology Project [GPCP2], and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation [CMAP]); reanalysis (Japanese 25-year reanalysis [JRA25], National Centers for Environmental Prediction [NCEP]/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis [NRA1], NCEP/Department of Energy reanalysis [NRA2], Climate Forecast System Reanalysis [CFSR]); and a hybrid product (Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea fluxes [OAFlux]). Recommendations are made for the developers of future freshwater flux products; these recommendations also aim to guide users to select products most suitable for their applications.
   For the global average field, evaporation and precipitation products of reanalysis are larger than satellite products in the tropical and subtropical regions. The large evaporation data values obtained by reanalysis are attributed to the low air specific humidity values and the differences between the bulk algorithms for the tropical and subtropical regions. Moreover, for the global water budget and the inter-annual variability and trends, the reanalysis precipitation product is largely dependent on its evaporation product If we use reanalysis precipitation and satellite evaporation data, we obtain a negative value for the global ocean water budget. This study demonstrates the difficulty of using different evaporation and precipitation products to analyze the global hydrologic cycle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multispectral data from satellites are widely used to study the effects of extreme weather events in forest ecosystems at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the sensitivity of these data is important since these phenomena are projected to increase as climate changes. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data were used to study the observed patterns of forest disturbance at different spatial scales in temperate forest (US Gulf Coast) produced by tropical cyclones Charley (2004), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), and Gustav (2008), and in tropical rainforests (Australia) produced by cyclone Yasi (2011). The severity of forest disturbance was quantified by applying spectral mixture analysis to the MODIS and Landsat coverages. Field studies were used to verify and compare the results. At the local scale Landsat data was sensitive to forest disturbance both within and between forest types. Higher tree mortality was observed in tropical rainforests than in temperate forests. This observation may be explained by forest type characteristics such as stem density, forest adaptation, and depth of root systems. At the species level, Landsat showed a gradient of forest resilience to tropical cyclone winds that agreed with observational field studies. At the landscape scale, the observed topographic effects on disturbance patterns were well represented by the MODIS data. Positive covariance was observed between surface orientation and slope on the severity of disturbance. Greater levels of disturbance were observed on windward surfaces with steeper slopes. Finally, at the regional scale, MODIS reproduced the pattern of forest damage associated with cyclone winds. The highest level of forest disturbance was observed on the right side of the cyclone track in the northern hemisphere (US Gulf Coast forest ecosystems) and on the left side in the southern hemisphere (Australian rainforest). At the regional scale, forest disturbance was positively associated with the decrease of wind speeds in an inland direction. Tropical cyclone surface winds explained 20% of forest disturbance, although characteristics of cumulative processes could cause this to be underestimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High resolution and low uncertainty deforestation maps covering large spatial areas in tropical countries are needed to plan efficient forest conservation and management programs such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Using an open-source free software (R, GRASS and QGis) and an original statistical approach combining multi-date land cover observations based on Landsat satellite images and the random forests classifier, we obtained up-to-date deforestation maps for the periods 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 with a minimum mapping unit of 036 ha for 7.7 M hectares, i.e. 40.3% of the tropical humid forest and 20.6% of the tropical dry forest in Madagascar. Uncertainty in deforestation on the maps was calculated by comparing the results of the classification to more than 30,000 visual interpretation points on a regular grid. We assessed accuracy on a per-pixel basis (confusion matrix) and by measuring the relative surface difference between wall-to-wall approach and point sampling. At the pixel level, user accuracy was 84.7% for stable land cover and 60.7% for land cover change. On average for the whole study area, we obtained a relative difference of 2% for stable land cover categories and 21.1% land cover change categories respectively between the wall-to-wall and the point sampling approach. Depending on the study area, our conservative assessment of annual deforestation rates ranged from 0.93 to 233%.yr(-1) for the humid forest and from 0.46 to 1.17%.yr(-1) for the dry forest. Here we describe an approach to obtain deforestation maps with reliable uncertainty estimates that can be transposed to other regions in the tropical world. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ocean surface wind data derived from several QuikSCAT products and the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) project were compared to wind speed and direction measurements, in order to assess which one of these databases has higher accuracy and ability to describe the local wind regime characteristics. For this, data from QuikSCAT (swath data from L2B 25 km and L2B 12.5 km slice composites, together with gridded L3) and CCMP were compared with measurements taken from five buoys located along the Iberian Peninsula coast.
   The results presented in this work show that QuikSCAT products have their strength in representing the temporal variability of the wind speed (higher correlation coefficients and lower RMSE and STDE) and the mean state of the wind direction (lower biases). Although no major differences were detected among QuikSCAT products, the high-resolution database (12.5 km) was the one with the best overall scores. However, CCMP is able to bring significant improvements in terms of wind direction temporal variability and wind speed mean state. CCMP also showed its capability to partially mitigate some of QuikSCAT's known problems, mainly those related to QuikSCAT systematic tendency to overestimate the wind speed and land masking effects. In addition, CCMP consists in a gridded dataset with a higher temporal sampling and complete data availability when compared to QuikSCAT, allowing this database to be clearly the one with a better ability to characterize the wind regimes measured by the buoys in terms of wind speed frequency distributions.
   These features can render CCMP an interesting ocean wind database for offshore wind energy assessment studies, where wind speed mean state accuracy plays the key role, and also for meteorological, oceanic and climate modelling applications where gridded wind data with good temporal sampling and data availability is vital to force numerical simulation models.

AB The utility of airborne scanning LiDAR data to estimate solar direct beam canopy transmittance in complex, forested terrain was evaluated. Twenty-four hemispherical photos were used to produce ground-based estimates of solar direct beam canopy transmittance. The photo estimates were used to develop and evaluate two spatially distributed canopy transmittance models: 1) a Beer's Law-type transmittance model based on LiDAR-derived canopy metrics, and 2) a solar raytrace model applied to a three-dimensional canopy model. The models were used to estimate solar direct beam canopy transmittance at five-minute resolution for all days between the winter and summer solstices over an 800 m by 700 m domain at 1 m horizontal grid spacing. When compared to estimates from hemispherical photos, the raytrace model resolved the complex seasonal and diurnal variability of solar direct beam canopy transmittance resulting from individual trees and localized canopy structure. The Beer's-type model was unable to resolve these detailed factors. The two models exhibited similar and relatively low normalized daily mean error values from December to early March. Later in the season (01 March-21 June), the model differences were pronounced; the daily mean and standard deviation of the error values for the Beer's-type and raytrace models were 13% +/- 10% and 8% +/- 6%, respectively. The results confirm previously known limitations of Beer's Law when used to estimate sub-canopy solar beam irradiance under heterogeneous canopy conditions. Averaged over the spatial domain, the Beer's-type model estimated 21% and 48% lower canopy transmittance than the raytrace model on 01 March and 03 May, respectively. The Beer's-type model was unable to represent the seasonal increase in areal average canopy transmission contributed from small canopy gaps. Finally, both distributed models were used to simulate the cumulative solar beam irradiance during the 2010 snowmelt season. The raytrace model was shown to capture a high level of variability necessary to simulate explicit stand-scale solar irradiance that strongly influences spatiotemporal patterns of snowmelt, soil water availability, and the partition and exchange of energy within heterogeneous forest ecosystems.

TI Cloud and cloud shadow screening across Queensland, Australia: An
   automated method for Landsat TM/ETM plus time series
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID COVER; DYNAMICS; IMAGERY
AB The 20 + year collection and moderate resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery provide a crucial data source for analysing land surface change over time for a range of applications. In Queensland, Australia, a number of government policies, natural resource management programmes and research activities are reliant on large-area, multi-temporal land cover monitoring applications based on Landsat satellite imagery. However, clouds and associated cloud shadows frequently obstruct the view of the land surface. The restriction of analyses to cloud-free imagery will reduce the opportunities to sample the land surface and limit the analysis of trends in reflectance overtime. This study presents a new automated method to screen cloud and cloud shadow and is intended for application to entire time series of Landsat imagery rather than single images processed in near- real time. The method uses a hierarchical approach and takes advantage of spectral, temporal, and contextual information. Outliers are located relative to the time series of land surface reflectance by smoothing time series information using minimum and median filters which are then used in multi-temporal image differencing. Seeded region grow and morphological dilation (pixel buffering) filters are then applied to map a larger spatial extent of the cloud/cloud shadow. Spectral and contextual rules were developed empirically using calibration and validation data derived from six Landsat WRS Path/Rows (number of images = 60) with varying climatic and land surface characteristics across the state of Queensland, Australia. The validation demonstrates that cloud contaminated pixels were accurately classified with producer's, user's and overall accuracies of 98, 87 and 97%, respectively. The ability to detect cloud shadow was less accurate, in comparison, with producer's, user's and overall accuracies of 90, 62 and 97%, respectively. The pixel buffer was found to be the largest source of commission error for cloud and cloud shadow in the final classifications. However, for many applications removing additional cloud/shadow at the expense of higher commission errors may be desirable. The performance of the method was also compared with the published Fmask (Function of mask) method. This demonstrated a moderate improvement in the detection of cloud (producer's accuracies: time series 98% and Fmask 90%; and an equivalent user's accuracy of 87%), and a significant improvement in the detection of cloud shadow (producer's accuracies: time series 90% and Fmask 78%; user's accuracies: time series 62% and Fmask 50%). Importantly, the results indicate that this automated method is robust and that temporal information can improve the detection of cloud and cloud shadow, although shadow detection above cropping areas is limited. The calibration/validation of the method has been restricted to Queensland, Australia. With further development there is potential for this method or one using a similar framework to have wider application in other landscapes. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is widely used in studying the surface urban heat island (SUHI). Due to the influence of clouds, composite products usually are preferred; however, exactly what the impact of temporal aggregation is on LST and SUHI is still unknown. In this paper, we quantify this impact focusing on Houston, Texas and its surroundings using MODIS LST products from 2000 to 2010. The results show that 1) the SUHI values are more notably enhanced in the daytime than nighttime with an increasing trend with larger composite periods. 2) The influences of aggregation in the spring and summer are larger than autumn and winter for the daytime. 3) The temporal aggregation impacts the spatial pattern of the SUHI implying that the higher SUHI regions are more likely to have a larger gap between two composite scales and this is related to the amount and distribution of clouds.

AB In this paper we develop a neural network (NN) algorithm for retrieving inherent optical properties (IOP) from above water remote sensing reflectances (Rrs) at available MODIS (or similar satellite) wavelengths. In previous work we used Hydrolight5 simulations of Rrs with widely varying globally representative constituent physical parameters as a training basis to develop a neural network algorithm, which, using the Rrs at the MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667 nm) as input, retrieves the in-water particulate backscattering (b(bp)), phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-phytoplankton (a(dg)) absorption coefficients at 443 nm. In this work, using the same dataset, we develop a NN which takes these same Rrs as input, and produces an output which is used to separate the non-phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(dg)) at 443 nm into dissolved (a(g)) and particulate (a(dm)) components. We then apply this synthetically trained algorithm to the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) Rrs to retrieve IOP at 443 nm, with the measured NOMAD and retrieved IOP values showing good agreement. These retrieved MP along with their related Rrs values are then used to train an additional NN that produces chlorophyll concentration [Chl] as output. It is shown that these [Chl] values are retrieved more accurately when compared with ones retrieved with a similar approach which does not use IOP as input, as well as with those derived using the MODIS OC3 algorithm.

AB Radar altimeter data from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 and microwave radiometer data from TRMM/TMI are used to investigate the large-scale variability between 10.5 degrees S and 35.5 degrees S in the South Atlantic Ocean. The proposed method for the analysis of the longitude-time diagrams of the cross-correlation between SSH and SST anomalies shows that the variability in mid latitudes is a blend of first-mode baroclinic Rossby waves and propagating mesoscale eddy-like structures. The estimated phase speed of the wave (c(p)) and propagation speed of the eddies (c(v)) are similar. In 70% of the cases, the absolute difference between c(p) and c(v) is less than 11%. In 40% of the cases this difference is less than 5%. Statistical results indicate that in the case of eddies, as the thermocline deepens the sea surface temperature rises and vice-versa. However, planetary waves show more complex, yet self-consistent results. In lower latitudes (10.5 degrees S-15.5 degrees S), the shallower thermocline and the weak thermal gradients impose a zero phase lag between temperature and height, similar to eddies. Poleward of those latitudes, sea surface temperature and height are in quadrature of phase. This indicates that geostrophic advection of the relatively stronger thermal gradient is performed by Rossby waves. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MODIS land surface reflectance product (MOD09) is one of the most popular data sources for characterizing land surface environments. Because those cloudy observations should be excluded from further analysis, the reliable cloud screening is important for downstream applications. In this paper, an approach is proposed to generate cloud masks from time series of MOD09 products. It is found that an inflexion point exists between the clear-sky and cloudy observations if time series of reflectances assembled from the same location are sorted. The maximum surface reflectance can be composited from these inflexions and those observations with reflectance values larger than the inflexion are identified as cloudy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to composite the maximum snow-free surface reflectance. And a new method is proposed to objectively compare cloud detection results derived from different approaches. Comparisons show that this inflexion-based cloud detection algorithm performs generally better than the cloud masks accompanying with the MOD09 products. The new cloud masks are valuable for those applications relying on the MOD09 products as input and for analysis of the uncertainty of the MODIS cloud mask products. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Model specification remains challenging in spectroscopy of plant biochemistry, as exemplified by the availability of various spectral indices or band combinations for estimating the same biochemical. This lack of consensus in model choice across applications argues for a paradigm shift in hyperspectral methods to address model uncertainty and misspecification. We demonstrated one such method using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which performs variable/band selection and quantifies the relative merits of many candidate models to synthesize a weighted average model with improved predictive performances. The utility of BMA was examined using a portfolio of 27 foliage spectral-chemical datasets representing over 80 species across the globe to estimate multiple biochemical properties, including nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll (a or b), carotenoid, polar and nonpolar extractives, leaf mass per area, and equivalent water thickness. We also compared BMA with partial least squares (PLS) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR). Results showed that all the biochemicals except carotenoid were accurately estimated from hyerspectral data with R-2 values >0.80. Compared to PLS and SMR, BMA substantially reduced overfitting and enhanced model generalization; BMA also yielded error estimation better indicative of true uncertainties in predictions, when evaluated using a statistic called "prediction interval coverage probability". The relative band importance, which was quantified by band selection probability, differed markedly between BMA and SMR, cautioning the use of SMR for band selection. Computationally, the model calibration with datasets of moderate sizes (>100) was faster for BMA via a hybrid reversible-jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler than for PLS via literal optimization of a cross-validation criterion. Our BMA scheme also provides a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework to assimilate prior knowledge of diverse forms, as illustrated by its use to account for nonlinearity in spectral-chemical relationships. We emphasize that BMA is a competitive, paradigm-shifting alternative to conventional statistical methods and it will find wide use as the virtue of Bayesian inference is increasingly appreciated by the remote sensing community.

AB Earth observation offers effective spatial and temporal coverage to monitor coral reefs in addition to in situ monitoring. Effective monitoring requires that significant substratum features are detectable by a sensor. This detectability is a function of the sensor spectral resolution, the depth and composition of the water column and the spectral characteristics of the substratum. Most broadband multispectral satellite sensors are ineffective in resolving reef substrata at depth due to a lack of spectral specificity. The aim of this simulation study was to quantify the level to which substrata can be classified by sensors with variable spectral resolutions over a range of depths and water qualities and also to improve and quantify the definition of substratum detectability (the measure to which a substratum can be resolved from the water column) and substratum separability (the measure to which a substratum pair can be resolved from each other and from the water column). Three sensors were selected, representing hyperspectral data (CASI with 30 spectral bands) and multispectral data (WorldView-2 with 8 bands, and QuickBird with 4 bands). Spectral separability of substratum reflectance spectra (convolved to the spectral resolution of the three sensors) were compared within two contrasting water columns (reef-oceanic and coastal) over a range of water column depths. Metrics for substratum detectability and substratum separability were determined. As spectral resolution increases from QB to WV2 to CASI, end-members can be resolved to greater depths (e.g. from two to six meters in a coastal water column). The additional three spectral bands in the visible part of the spectrum of the WV2 sensor, as compared to QB, increase the applicability of multispectral sensors to systematic coral reef remote sensing. Increase in water column attenuation, due to higher concentrations of water column constituents, causes loss of substratum detectability and substratum separability. This effect can be partly compensated for by increased spectral resolution. For example, although the CASI and WV2 sensor performed comparably in a very shallow coastal water column (e.g. at 2 m depth), the higher spectral resolution of the CASI sensor enhanced spectral separability, resulting in higher substratum separability in deeper water than WV2. With more spectral bands, more substratum end-member reflectances are distinct from the water column signal to greater depth. This implies that higher spectral resolution will enhance bathymetry retrieval, especially within coastal waters. The quantitative framework of this study extends findings of previous contextual coral reef substratum mapping studies. It confirms that higher spectral resolution (i.e. WV2 and CASI) earth observation data significantly enhances coral reef classification capability to increased depths or to the same depth in a more turbid water column. The conclusions of this study can also be extended to coastal ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate combined continuum removal and radiative transfer (RT) modeling to retrieve leaf chlorophyll a & b content (C-ab) from the AISA Eagle airborne imaging spectrometer data of sub-meter (0.4 m) spatial resolution. Based on coupled PROSPECT-DART RT simulations of a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand, we propose a new C-ab sensitive index located between 650 and 720 nm and termed ANCB(650-720). The performance of ANCB(650-720) was validated against ground-measured C-ab of ten spruce crowns and compared with C-ab estimated by a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) trained with continuum removed RT simulations and also by three previously published chlorophyll optical indices: normalized difference between reflectance at 925 and 710 nm (ND925&710), simple reflectance ratio between 750 and 710 nm (SR750/710) and the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI indices. Although all retrieval methods produced visually comparable C-ab spatial patterns, the ground validation revealed that the ANCB(650-720) and ANN retrievals are more accurate than the other three chlorophyll indices (R-2=0.72 for both methods). ANCB(650-720) estimated C-ab with an RMSE=2.27 mu g cm(-2) (relative RRMSE=4.35%) and ANN with an RMSE= 2.18 mu g cm(-2) (RRMSE=4.18%), while SR750/710 with an RMSE=4.16 mu g cm(-2) (RRMSE=7.97%), ND925&710 with an RMSE= 9.07 mu g cm(-2) (RRMSE=17.38%) and TCARI/OSAVI with an RMSE=12.30 mu g cm(-2) (RRMSE=23.56%). Also the systematic RMSEs was lower than the unsystematic one only for the ANCB(650-720) and ANN retrievals. Our results indicate that the newly proposed index can provide the same accuracy as ANN except for C-ab values below 30 mu g cm(-2), which are slightly overestimated (RMSE=2.42 mu g cm(-2)). The computationally efficient ANCB(650-720) retrieval provides accurate high spatial resolution airborne C-ab maps, considerable as a suitable reference data for validating satellite-based C-ab products.

AB Discrete airborne lidar is increasingly used to analyze forest structure. Technological improvements in lidar sensors have led to the acquisition of increasingly high pulse densities, possibly reflecting the assumption that higher densities will yield better results. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between pulse density and the ability to predict several commonly used forest measures and metrics at the plot scale. The accuracy of predicted metrics was largely invariant to changes in pulse density at moderate to high densities. In particular, correlations between metrics such as tree height, diameter at breast height, shrub height and total basal area were relatively unaffected until pulse densities dropped below 1 pulse/m(2). Metrics pertaining to coverage, such as canopy cover, tree density and shrub cover were more sensitive to changes in pulse density, although in some cases high prediction accuracy was still possible at lower densities. Our findings did not depend on the type of predictive algorithm used, although we found that support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian processes (GP) consistently outperformed multiple regression across a range of pulse densities. Further, we found that SVR yielded higher accuracies at low densities (<0.3 pI/m(2)), while GP was better at high densities (>1 pI/m(2)). Our results suggest that low-density lidar data may be capable of estimating typical forest structure metrics reliably in some situations. These results provide practical guidance to forest ecologists and land managers who are faced with tradeoff in price, quality and coverage, when planning new lidar data acquisition.

AB Estimates of growing stock volume are reported by the national forest inventories (NFI)of most countries and may serve as the basis for aboveground biomass and carbon estimates as required by an increasing number of international agreements. The probability-based (design-based) statistical estimators traditionally used by NFIs to calculate estimates are generally unbiased and entail only limited computational complexity. However, these estimators often do not produce sufficiently precise estimates for areas with small sample sizes. Model-based estimators may overcome this disadvantage, but they also may be biased and estimation of variances may be computationally intensive. For a minor region within Hedmark County, Norway, the study objective was to compare estimates of mean forest growing stock volume per unit area obtained using probability- and model-based estimators. Three of the estimators rely to varying degrees on maps that were constructed using a nonlinear logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and lidar data. For model-based estimators, methods for evaluating quality of fit of the models and reducing the computational intensity were also investigated. Three conclusions were drawn: the logistic regression model exhibited no serious lack of fit to the data; estimators enhanced using maps produced greater precision than estimates based on only the plot observations; and third, model-based synthetic estimators benefit from sample sizes for larger areas when applied to smaller subsets of the larger areas.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used widely for mapping snow cover in climate and hydrologic systems, but its accuracy is reduced in forests due to canopy obstruction. Prior validation datasets cannot quantify MODIS errors in forests, because finer-resolution passive sensors (e.g., Landsat) encounter the same canopy errors, and operational ground-based networks sample snow in clearings where snow dynamics differ from those in the forest. To assess MODIS accuracy relative to forest cover, we applied a common canopy adjustment to daily 500 m fractional snow-covered area (f(SCA)) from the physically-based MODIS Snow-Covered Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm, and tested it at subalpine meadow and forest sites (025 km(2)-1 km(2)) in the Sierra Nevada, California during two snow seasons. 37 to 89 sensors monitored hourly ground temperature at these sites. Damped diurnal variations provided a signal for snow presence due to the insulating properties of snow, yielding daily ground-based f(SCA) at each site. Ground-based f(SCA) values were validated in a canopy-free area of a meadow site using time-lapse imagery and 15 m snow maps from the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Ground-based f(SCA) had high correlation (R-2 = 0.98) with time-lapse data and was within 0.05 of ASTER f(SCA). Comparisons between MODSCAG and ground-based f(SCA) revealed that an underestimation bias remained in the canopy-adjusted MODSCAG f(SCA), ranging from -0.09 to -022 at the meadow sites and from 0.09 to 037 at the forest sites. Improved canopy adjustment methods are needed for MODIS f(SCA). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Efforts to predict water quality often rely heavily on static landuse/land-cover (LULC) classifications derived from remote sensing imagery. However, LULC classifications are infrequently updated, and the development of regular (annual) land cover maps that accurately capture intra- and inter-annual change may be expensive in terms of data and labor costs. In addition, existing land cover products may not include classes relevant to the assessment of water quality. Conversely, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are freely available, preprocessed, frequently updated, and available in a range of useful data products. Our goal was to predict water quality for streams in Wisconsin, USA using a model constructed exclusively from MODIS products. We used streamwater nitrate and dissolved phosphorus data from 2001 to 2004 from two previous studies (Robertson et al., 2006; Stanley & Maxted, 2008) to evaluate the potential for using MODIS in an empirical model to predict water quality, thereby reducing reliance on possibly dated land cover maps. Using predictors derived exclusively from MODIS data products, we successfully predicted 80% of the variation in measured nitrate concentrations. Remote sensing based models explained 51% of the variation in dissolved phosphorus concentrations. Predictions of water quality were developed on both a per-pixel and a watershed basis. The remote sensing approach offers the potential for spatially continuous estimates of stream nutrient concentrations, and complements the suite of approaches currently used to assess water quality; including periodic stream surveys models, and point-source data.

AB Human disturbances are a major driver of biodiversity declines world-wide, and the intensely used Alberta forest landscape is no exception to this trend. Monitoring of such large areas is typically conducted via multi-temporal land-cover maps from remote sensing, but automated and efficient procedures for reliable, operational applications have yet to be fully developed. In an effort to contribute to this need, we developed an innovative approach to landscape monitoring: the disturbance-inventory framework, which is applied for the first time as described here to monitor annual changes in an 8800-km(2) multi-use landscape in west-central Alberta, Canada. Using this framework, we (1) report on the spatio-temporal distribution of industrial disturbances such as harvesting cutblocks, oil and gas wells, coal mines, and road/pipelines; and (2) track the associated annual changes in land-cover composition and configuration between 1998 and 2005. To enable spatially explicit analyses within the study area, we divided it into 178, 49 km(2)-square landscape cells. The overall area-based annual rate of change of 0.62% for this multi-use may be considered moderate compared to other regions, where change was mainly shaped by a single use, i.e., forestry. However, the spatially explicit nature of our analysis revealed that the eastern half of the study area is subject to considerably higher rates of change, mainly due to the concurrent appearance of disturbances from forestry and the oil and gas industry. The western half, by contrast, is more restricted by rugged terrain and fewer roads. The average distance to disturbance features across the entire study area decreased from 1500 m to 1200 m over the seven years. Total forest area, mean and largest patch size, and mean shape index all decreased consistently over the same period. The detected rapid change and associated fragmentation call for ongoing monitoring of this and other multi-use landscapes, which could be undertaken using this framework. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest canopy impairs the detection of snow underneath and optical interpretation methods tend to underestimate the snow coverage. The effect of measurement conditions on snow reflectance is considerably well understood, but the sensitivity of scene reflectance (when forest canopy present) to these properties is less examined. To investigate scene reflectance of a boreal forest, an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Field Spec Pro JR was installed at the top of a 30-metre-high mast in Sodankyla, Northern Finland. Two sites sparse forest and a forest opening - were monitored. The data consists of average reflectance spectra in the range 350-2500 nm, as well as of simultaneously acquired digital images. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is widely used for the monitoring of snow-covered area (SCR). Therefore, ASD spectra were resampled to the spectral characteristics of MODIS. Time series of normalised difference snow index (NDSI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the reflectance at selected wavelengths were investigated in order to understand their behaviour in a snow-covered forest in spring. In order to discriminate between the effects of illumination conditions and the actual snow characteristics, reflectance spectra were measured both under direct and diffuse illumination. A specific focus was on the behaviour of NDSI, which is typically used in SCA retrieval - e.g. in MODIS snow mapping algorithms by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). We further modelled the scene reflectance as a function of surface reflectances considering areal proportions of Scots Pines, shadowed snow and directly illuminated snow.
   In the forest opening, NDSI was found to be relatively insensitive to illumination conditions, while in the forest stand it showed stronger dependence. This indicates that NDSI-based snow algorithms may provide a lower accuracy over forested areas. We demonstrated this by comparing the mast-observed indices and reflectances with the corresponding thresholds applied in MODIS snow mapping. The current thresholds led to underestimated snow cover in our test forest. It was also noticed that over the forest stand, variations in snow reflectance induced particularly great variation in the scene reflectance, even though visible snow-covered ground accounted for only half of the observed area as a result of the blocking effect of the trees. Comparison between the mast-borne and the modelled scene reflectance suggest that the surface reflectance observations could offer a feasible means to predict scene reflectance characteristics of snow-covered boreal forests observed by space-borne instruments.

AB Shortwave (0.3-3 mu m) and longwave (3-50 mu m) surface radiative flux components have been widely used in numerical prediction, meteorology, hydrology, biomass estimation, surface energy circulation and climate change studies, etc. However, during past decades, these components were usually estimated independently using different methods, possibly causing inconsistent estimation biases due to different atmospheric parameters and algorithms, especially for net surface fluxes. Two methods have been proposed in this paper to simultaneously derive surface shortwave (or longwave) radiative flux components based on MODIS products using an artificial neural network (ANN). The validation results show that the maximum root-mean-square error for downward and net shortwave radiative fluxes is less than 45 W/m(2), about 60 W/m(2) for direct solar radiation and 25 W/m(2) for all longwave fluxes, which are comparable or even better than existing algorithms, thus demonstrating their feasibility and efficacy. The ANN-based models are then applied over the Tibetan Plateau region and the characteristics of the surface radiative flux components over such areas are analyzed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new daily snow cover dataset was developed using Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-1B products for the Australian alpine region over the period 2000-2010 at 500 m resolution. The dataset has been evaluated during clear-sky conditions using snow detection estimates derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data and has been compared to the MOD10_L2 snow cover products. The ability to customise the snow detection threshold is one of the benefits of developing the Melt Area Detection Index (MADI) approach for regional conditions. The dataset provides a new satellite based observational record that may be used to characterise spatial and temporal development of Australian snow cover extent and duration. The new snow cover observations provide insight into snow characteristics in this region where significant declines in snow cover extent, season duration and a shift towards earlier snow melt date are observed. Shifts towards early season melt dates are observed for snow at 1580 m and above. This includes areas which are pertinent to snow recreation activities in the region. Season length declines are attributed to earlier seasonal snowmelt rather than later season onset and may be linked to observed warming trends in the area. The MODIS based approach can be applied to other regions and other sensors to assist in evaluating snow modelling efforts and improve water resource management and snow hydrology based investigations.

AB The Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) is the highest and longest plateau linear structure in the world. The embankment is prone to instability, primarily due to the freezing and thawing of the permafrost overlying active layer. The infrastructure construction changes environmental conditions and in turn has influenced permafrost evolutions. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of extracting surface motions in permafrost regions by means of satellite SAR interferometry. The relationship between surface deformation, permafrost active layer and other environmental conditions were further analyzed. In total, 19 L-band ALOS PALSAR SLC images (acquired from 21 June 2007 to 30 December, 2010) and 38 C-band Envisat ASAR SLC images (acquired from 18 November 2004 to 17 December, 2009) were employed to cover the Beiluhe experimental site, Qinghai, China. A hybrid persistent scatterer interferometry model based on interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) and small baseline strategy was firstly developed for surface motion estimation, minimizing the seasonal decorrelation effect. Then, the results from C- and L-band data were analyzed and compared, based on a statistical calibration model. Ground leveling data acquired from Fenghuo Mount Tunnel front with a one month interval were used for InSAR-derived results validation, revealing good agreement in displacement rates as well as time series. The QTR has been in operation since 2006. Our study has observed distinct surface motions along the embankment, primarily in the range of -20 to +20 mm/yr, implying the necessity of continued satellite-based surveillance along the QTR.

AB This study aimed to estimate canopy fuel properties relevant for crown fire behavior using ICESat/GLAS satellite LiDAR data. GLAS estimates were compared to canopy fuel products generated from airborne LiDAR data, which had been previously validated against field data. The geolocation accuracy of the data was evaluated by comparing ground elevation on both datasets, showing an offset of 1 pixel (20 m). Canopy cover (CC) was estimated as the ratio of the canopy energy to the total energy of the waveform. Application of a canopy base height threshold (OH) to compute the canopy energy increased the accuracy of CC estimates (R-2=0.89; RMSE = 16.12%) and yielded a linear relationship with airborne LiDAR estimates. In addition, better agreement was obtained when the CC derived from airborne LiDAR data was estimated using the intensity of the returns. An empirical model, based on the CC and the leading edge (LE), was derived to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using stepwise regression providing good agreement with the reference data (R-2=0.9, RMSE=0.15). Canopy bulk density (CBD) was estimated using an approach based on the method developed by Sando and Wick (1972) to derive CBD from field measurements, and adapted to GLAS data. Thus, foliage biomass was distributed vertically throughout the canopy extent based on the distribution of canopy material and CBD was estimated as the maximum 3 m-deep running mean considering layers with a thickness of 15 cm, which is the vertical resolution of the GLAS data. This approach gave a coefficient of determination of 0.78 and an RMSE of 0.02 kg m(-3). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to explore the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing to map areas affected by Red Dust (RD) pollution on soil and river water. The chosen study area contains residues from the extraction of aluminum from bauxite in a mud pond (i.e. the red mud), which contain high concentrations of contaminants such as heavy metals, so that special precaution must be taken when disposing to avoid RD pollution of land surface and river water resources. We perform laboratory analysis and in situ measurements of RD polluted samples to recognize the dominant minerals and identify the optical characteristics of the samples and their spectral features. Both an unsupervised methodology and a shape-based spectral analysis technique, using the significant RD reflectance spectral features, were applied to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data to map the RD distribution on bare soils. Whereas, to assess a tool for the detection of RD in river waters a semi-analytical model for the radiative transfer in water bodies was used. The results of the spectral shape-based analysis and of the semi-analytical model used for this study were consistent with ground truth data and hence support the application of hyperspectral technologies for a rapid detection and mapping of industrial wastes, such as the RD. This information is suitable to support the development of effective intervention policies and monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary production (GPP) product (GPP(MOD17A2)) was evaluated against GPP from the eddy covariance flux measurements (GPP(m)) at a CO2 flux tower test site in a tropical rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The dynamics of 8-day GPP(MOD17A2) averages generally showed similarities with observed values for the period 2004-2005 (r-value is 0.66, RMSE = 1.31 g C m(-2) d(-1)). However, the results revealed some underestimation of GPP by the MOD17A2 product during phases of low photosynthetic production while it overestimated GPP during phases with clear sky conditions. Obviously, these seasonal differences are caused by too large seasonal amplitudes in GPP(MOD17A2). The observed inconsistencies of the GPP(MOD17A2)with GPP(m) were traced to the inputs of the MODIS GPP algorithm, including fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and light use efficiency (epsilon(g)). This showed that underestimation of low values is caused by several uncertainties in the MODIS fAPAR input, whereas overestimation at high irradiance is caused by the MODIS light use efficiency approach which does not account for saturation of canopy photosynthesis under clear sky conditions. The performance of the MODIS GPP algorithm has been improved through the use of a site-validated fAPAR data set and a novel approach for epsilon(g) adjustment which allows for saturation of gross photosynthesis at high irradiance. Our study revealed a weakness of a commonly used light use efficiency approach to estimate global GPP at the example of a moist tropical rain forest in Indonesia and demonstrated a potential need for MOD17 enhancement.

AB Current methods for estimating vegetation parameters are generally sub-optimal in the way they exploit information and do not generally consider uncertainties. We look forward to a future where operational data assimilation schemes improve estimates by tracking land surface processes and exploiting multiple types of observations. Data assimilation schemes seek to combine observations and models in a statistically optimal way taking into account uncertainty in both, but have not yet been much exploited in this area.
   The EO-LDAS scheme and prototype, developed under ESA funding, is designed to exploit the anticipated wealth of data that will be available under GMES missions, such as the Sentinel family of satellites, to provide improved mapping of land surface biophysical parameters. This paper describes the EO-LDAS implementation, and explores some of its core functionality. EO-LDAS is a weak constraint variational data assimilation system. The prototype provides a mechanism for constraint based on a prior estimate of the state vector, a linear dynamic model, and Earth Observation data (top-of-canopy reflectance here). The observation operator is a non-linear optical radiative transfer model for a vegetation canopy with a soil lower boundary, operating over the range 400 to 2500 nm. Adjoint codes for all model and operator components are provided in the prototype by automatic differentiation of the computer codes.
   In this paper, EO-LDAS is applied to the problem of daily estimation of six of the parameters controlling the radiative transfer operator over the course of a year (>2000 state vector elements). Zero and first order process model constraints are implemented and explored as the dynamic model. The assimilation estimates all state vector elements simultaneously. This is performed in the context of a typical Sentinel-2 MSI operating scenario, using synthetic MSI observations simulated with the observation operator, with uncertainties typical of those achieved by optical sensors supposed for the data.
   The experiments consider a baseline state vector estimation case where dynamic constraints are applied, and assess the impact of dynamic constraints on the a posteriori uncertainties. The results demonstrate that reductions in uncertainty by a factor of up to two might be obtained by applying the sorts of dynamic constraints used here. The hyperparameter (dynamic model uncertainty) required to control the assimilation are estimated by a cross-validation exercise. The result of the assimilation is seen to be robust to missing observations with quite large data gaps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Simulation of future satellite images can be applied in order to validate the general mission concept and to test the performance of advanced multi-sensor algorithms for the retrieval of surface parameters. This paper describes the radiative transfer modeling part of a so-called Land Scene Generator (LSG) that was developed to simulate images of the sensors OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) on board of the Sentinel-3 mission. Features of this mission are its wide spectral coverage (optical and thermal domains) and its wide imaging swath, which imposes particular requirements on the simulator in dealing with atmospheric effects over both spectral domains and with angular effects caused by variations in surface bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and atmospheric scattering. In the simulator, radiative transfer models for the combination vegetation-soil and for water are coupled to atmospheric parameters derived from MODTRAN runs in order to calculate top-of-atmosphere radiances. For this, four-stream radiative transfer theory is applied to allow simulation of BRDF effects, topography effects, adjacency effects, as well as its uniform application over the optical and thermal spectral domains.

AB The landscape on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of Alaska is dominated by thousands of thaw (thermokarst) lakes and associated drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs). Knowledge of the DTLBs benefits our understanding of thaw lake dynamics, carbon cycles, and paleo-climatic change on the ACP since the end of the Late Glacial. This study initializes the application of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) into a systematic reconstruction of DTLBs on the western ACP and adjacent northern Arctic Foothills. The method combines a machine-based detection algorithm automating the delineation of basin paleoshorelines on IfSAR DEM data and a posterior quality control with the aid of high-resolution aerial photograph and Landsat-5 TM imagery. A total of similar to 3590 km(2) of thaw lakes and similar to 10130 km(2) of DTLBs were mapped, with an overall accuracy of 99.2% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.988. The delineated DUB extents are conservative, as validated from eleven field-sampled paleoshorelines. A variety of topologic patterns such as merging, nesting, and overtopping are presented in the reconstructed DTLBs. Basin paleoshoreline levels are subject to average uncertainties of 0.4-0.7 m. The combined area of thaw lakes and DTLBs accounts for 57.1% of the western ACP and 23.2% of the northern Arctic Foothills in the study site. Regional analysis of several spatial and topographic characteristics demonstrates a distinct heterogeneity among the younger Outer Coastal Plain (YOCP), Outer Coastal Plain (OCP), Inner Coastal Plain (ICP), and the Arctic Foothills. Generally, the areal density of DTLBs decreases progressively on higher and older surfaces. The ICP has a lake-DTLB area ratio (0.37) greater than that in the other regions. DUB bathymetry presents a positive correlation with surface elevation: basin maximum depths range from similar to 2.0 m on the YOCP to similar to 8.0 m on the Arctic Foothills. Given the reconstructed DTLBs, a total of 31.9 (+/- 4.9) gigatons of net water drainage were estimated for the entire study area. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In situ soil moisture data from more than 200 stations located in Africa, Australia, Europe and the United States are used to determine the reliability of three soil moisture products, one analysis from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) numerical weather prediction system (SM-DAS-2) and two remotely sensed soil moisture products, namely ASCAT (Advanced scatterometer) and SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity). SM-DAS-2 is produced offline at ECMWF and relies on an advanced surface data assimilation system (Extended Kalman Filter) used to optimally combine conventional observations with satellite measurements. ASCAT remotely sensed surface soil moisture is provided in near real time by EUMETSAT. At ECMWF, ASCAT is used for soil moisture analyses in SM-DAS-2, also. Finally the SMOS remotely sensed soil moisture data level two product developed at CESBIO is used. Evaluation of the times series as well as of the anomaly values, shows good performances of the three products to capture surface soil moisture annual cycle and short term variability. Correlations with in situ data are very satisfactory over most of the investigated sites located in contrasted biomes and climate conditions with averaged values of 0.70 for SM-DAS-2, 0.53 for ASCAT and 0.54 for SMOS. Although radio frequency interference disturbs the natural microwave emission of the Earth observed by SMOS in several parts of the world, hence the soil moisture retrieval, performances of SMOS over Australia are very encouraging.

AB Solar surface irradiance (SIS) and direct (SID) irradiance as well as effective cloud albedo (CAL) climate data records (CDR) derived from the Meteosat first generation satellites (Meteosats 2 to 7, 1983-2005) are presented. The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of 0.03 degrees.
   The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method. Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.
   The datasets are validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data. The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis, GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of extremes.
   No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements. However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for certain regions in earlier years. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Insects are important forest disturbance agents, and mapping their effects on tree mortality and surface fuels represents a critical research challenge. Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree mortality and surface fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality R-adj(2);= 0.40, F-1.34 = 24.76, P<0.0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R-adj(2) = 0.29, F-1.32 = 14.72. P = 0.0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e.g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R-adj(2) = 037, F-1.22 = 14.71, P= 0.0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories. This study also confirms the key role that satellite imagery can play in understanding the interactions among insects, fuels, and wildfire. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate landscape-scale maps of forests and associated disturbances are critical to augment studies on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the carbon cycle, especially in terms of understanding how the spatial and temporal complexities of damage sustained from disturbances influence forest structure and function. Vegetation change tracker (VCT) is a highly automated algorithm that exploits the spectral-temporal properties of summer Landsat time series stacks (LTSSs) to generate spatially explicit maps of forest and recent forest disturbances. VCT performs well in contiguous forest landscapes with closed or nearly closed canopies, but often incorrectly classifies large patches of land as forest or forest disturbance in the complex and spatially heterogeneous environments that typify fragmented forest landscapes. We introduce an improved version of VCT (dubbed VCTw) that incorporates a nonforest mask derived from snow-covered winter Landsat time series stacks (LTSSw) and compare it with VCT across nearly 25 million ha of land in the Lake Superior (Canada, USA) and Lake Michigan (USA) drainage basins.
   Accuracy assessments relying on 87 primary sampling units (PSUs) and 2640 secondary sampling units (SSUs) indicated that VCT performed with an overall accuracy of 86.3%. For persisting forest, the commission error was 14.7% and the omission error was 4.3%. Commission and omission errors for the two forest disturbance classes fluctuated around 50%. VCTw produced a statistically significant increase in overall accuracy to 91.2% and denoted about 1.115 million ha less forest (-.371 million ha disturbed and -0.744 million ha persisting). For persisting forest, the commission error decreased to 9.3% and the omission error was relatively unchanged at 5.0%. Commission errors decreased considerably to near 22% and omission errors remained near 50% in both forest disturbance classes.
   Dividing the assessments into three geographic strata demonstrated that the most dramatic improvement occurred across the southern half of the Lake Michigan basin, which contains a highly fragmented agricultural landscape and relatively sparse deciduous forest, although substantial improvements occurred in other geographic strata containing little agricultural land, abundant wetlands, and extensive coniferous forest. Unlike VCT, VCTw also generally corresponded well with field-based estimates of forest cover in each stratum. Snow-covered winter imagery appears to be a valuable resource for improving automated disturbance mapping accuracy. About 34% of the world's forests receive sufficient snowfall to cover the ground and are potentially suitable for VCTw; other season-based techniques may be worth pursuing for the remaining 66%.

AB Across the Pacific Northwest, the climate between 1950 and 1975 was exceptionally cool and wet compared with more recent conditions (1995-2005). We reasoned that the changes in climate could result in expanded outbreaks of insects, diseases, and fire. To test this premise, we first modeled monthly variation in photosynthesis and growth of the most widely distributed species, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), using a process-based model (3-PG) for the two periods. To compare with remotely sensed variables, we converted modeled growth potential into maximum leaf area index (LAImax), which was predicted to range from 1 to 9 across the region. On most sites, varying soil moisture storage capacity (theta cap) from 200 to 300 mm while holding soil fertility constant, made slight but insignificant difference in simulated LAImax patterns. Both values of theta cap correlated well with LAI estimates acquired from NASA's MODIS satellites in June, 2005 (r(2)=0.7). To evaluate where 15 coniferous tree species might be prone to wide-scale disturbance, we used climatically-driven decision-tree models, calibrated in the 1950-1975 period, to identify vulnerable areas in 1995-2005. We stratified predictions within 34 recognized ecoregions and compared these results with large-scale disturbances recorded on MODIS imagery acquired between 2005 and 2009. The correlation between the percent of species judged as vulnerable within each ecoregion and the percent of forested areas recorded as disturbed with a MODIS-derived Global Disturbance Index was linear and accounted for 65 to 73% of the observed variation, depending on whether or not disturbance by fire was excluded from the analysis. Based on climate projections through the rest of the rest of the 21st century, we expect continued high levels of disturbance in ecoregions located beyond the climatically buffering influence of the Pacific Ocean.

AB Retrieval of soil moisture content using the vertical and horizontal polarizations of multiple frequency bands on microwave sensors can provide an estimate of vegetation water content (VWC). Another approach is to use foliar-water indices based on the absorption at shortwave-infrared wavelengths by liquid water in the leaves to determine canopy water content, which is then related to VWC. An example of these indices is the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), which was found to be linearly related to canopy water content using various datasets, including data from the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 and 2005 in central Iowa. Here we compared independent estimates of VWC from WindSat to Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDII over central Iowa from 2003 to 2005. Results showed that there was a linear relationship between the MODIS and WindSat estimates of VWC, although WindSat-retrieved VWC was greater than MODIS-retrieved VWC. WindSat and MODIS have different satellite overpass times and in most climates we expect VWC to vary over a day due to transpiration and plant water stress. However, a sensitivity analysis indicated that the diurnal variation of VWC should not have a significant effect on retrievals of VWC by either method. The results of this study indicated that soil moisture retrievals from microwave sensors may be improved using VWC from optical sensors determined by foliar-water indices and classifications of land cover type.

AB Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important variable that governs canopy processes and can be monitored by satellites. The current study aims at exploring the potential and limitations of using the red-edge spectral bands of the forthcoming superspectral satellites, namely-Vegetation and Environmental New micro Spacecraft (VEN mu S) and Sentinel-2, for assessing LAI in field crops. The research was conducted in experimental plots of wheat and potato in the northwestern Negev, Israel. Continuous spectral data were collected by a field spectrometer and LAI data were obtained by a ceptometer. The spectral data were resampled to the superspectral VEN mu S and Sentinel-2 resolutions. The data were divided into seven datasets (four seasons, two crops, and one including all data). The LAI prediction abilities by Partial Least Squares (PLS) models for continuous spectra and the resampled spectra were compared and evaluated. For wheat and potato of the continuous, VEN mu S, and Sentinel-2 data formations, the PLS correlation coefficients (r) values were 0.93, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. In most cases, the red-edge region was found to be the most important spectral region for the three data formations, according to the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) analysis. Additionally, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Red-Edge Inflection Point (REIP) were computed for the three data formations in order to observe relation to as well as prediction accuracy in retrieving LAI values. The prediction abilities of the calculated indices by the data formations were compared, peaking for wheat, with r values of 0.91 for the REIP for the three data formations. Therefore, it is concluded that VEN mu S and Sentinel-2 can spectrally assess LAI as good as a hyperspectral sensor. The REIP was found to be a significantly better predictor than NDVI for wheat data and therefore can potentially be implemented for future LAI monitoring applications by superspectral sensors that contain four red-edge bands.

AB Many forestry and earth science applications require spatially detailed forest height data sets. Among the various remote sensing technologies, lidar offers the most potential for obtaining reliable height measurement. However, existing and planned spaceborne lidar systems do not have the capability to produce spatially contiguous, fine resolution forest height maps over large areas. This paper describes a Landsat-lidar fusion approach for modeling the height of young forests by integrating historical Landsat observations with lidar data acquired by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellite. In this approach, "young" forests refer to forests reestablished following recent disturbances mapped using Landsat time-series stacks (LTSS) and a vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm. The GLAS lidar data is used to retrieve forest height at sample locations represented by the footprints of the lidar data. These samples are used to establish relationships between lidar-based forest height measurements and LTSS-VCT disturbance products. The height of "young" forest is then mapped based on the derived relationships and the LTSS-VCT disturbance products. This approach was developed and tested over the state of Mississippi. Of the various models evaluated, a regression tree model predicting forest height from age since disturbance and three cumulative indices produced by the LTSS-VCT method yielded the lowest cross validation error. The R-2 and root mean square difference (RMSD) between predicted and GLAS-based height measurements were 0.91 and 1.97 m, respectively. Predictions of this model had much higher errors than indicated by cross validation analysis when evaluated using field plot data collected through the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program of USDA Forest Service. Much of these errors were due to a lack of separation between stand clearing and non-stand clearing disturbances in current LTSS-VCT products and difficulty in deriving reliable forest height measurements using GLAS samples when terrain relief was present within their footprints. In addition, a systematic underestimation of about 5 m by the developed model was also observed, half of which could be explained by forest growth that occurred between field measurement year and model target year. The remaining difference suggests that tree height measurements derived using waveform lidar data could be significantly underestimated, especially for young pine forests. Options for improving the height modeling approach developed in this study were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite images, along with oceanographic, meteorological, and whale aerial survey data, are used to illustrate aspects of ocean circulation associated with a bowhead whale feeding 'hotspot' near Barrow, Alaska. In response to weak winds, a strong front forms near the shelf-break along the southern edge of Barrow Canyon when the Alaska Coastal Current flows adjacent to the southern flank of Barrow Canyon or intrudes onto the western Beaufort shelf. This front is of particular local interest because it is indicative of aggregation and retention of zooplankton on the western Beaufort shelf and, as a result, is a locus for bowhead whales pausing to feed during their westward fall migration. Groups (4 or more individuals) of bowhead whales are primarily seen on the western Beaufort shelf following wind conditions that promote the formation of this front. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of airborne laser scanning systems (lidar) to describe forest structure has increased dramatically since height profiling experiments nearly 30 years ago. The analyses in most studies employ a suite of frequency-based metrics calculated from the lidar height data, which are systematically eliminated from a full model using stepwise multiple linear regression. The resulting models often include highly correlated predictors with little physical justification for model formulation. We propose a method to aggregate discrete lidar height and intensity measurements into larger footprints to create "pseudo-waves". Specifically, the returns are first sorted into height bins, sliced into narrow discrete elements, and finally smoothed using a spline function. The resulting "pseudo-waves" have many of the same characteristics of traditional waveform lidar data. We compared our method to a traditional frequency-based method to estimate tree height, canopy structure, stem density, and stand biomass in coniferous and deciduous stands in northern Wisconsin (USA). We found that the pseudo-wave approach had strong correlations for nearly all tree measurements including height (cross validated adjusted R(2) (R(2),) = 0.82, RMSE, = 2.09 m), mean stem diameter (R = 0.64, RMSE, = 6.15 cm), total aboveground biomass (R(2), = 0.74, RMSE, = 74.03 kg ha(-1)), and canopy coverage = 0.79, RMSE, = 5%). Moreover, the type of wave (derived from height and intensity or from height alone) had little effect on model formulation and fit. When wave-based and frequency-based models were compared, fit and mean square error were comparable, leading us to conclude that the pseudo-wave approach is a viable alternative because it has 1) an increased breadth of available metrics; 2) the potential to establish new meaningful metrics that capture unique patterns within the waves; 3) the ability to explain metric selection based on the physical structure of forests; and 4) lower correlation among independent variables.

AB In 2005, hurricane Katrina resulted in a large disturbance to U.S. forests. Recent estimates of damage from hurricane Katrina have relied primarily on optical remote sensing and field data. This paper is the first large-scale study to use satellite-based lidar data to quantify changes in forest structure from that event. GLAS data for the years prior to and following hurricane Katrina were compared to wind speed, forest cover, and damage data to assess the adequacy of sensor sampling, and to estimate changes in Mean Canopy Height (MCH) over all areas that experienced tropical force winds and greater. Statistically significant decreases in MCH post-Katrina were found to increase with wind intensity: Tropical Storm Delta MCH = -0.5 m, Category 1 Delta MCH = -2 m, and Category 2 Delta MCH = -4 m. A strong relationship was also found between changes in non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta NPV), a metric previously shown to be related to storm damage, and post-storm MCH. The season of data acquisition was shown to influence calculations of MCH and MCH loss, but did not preclude the detection of major large-scale patterns of damage. Results from this study show promise for using space-borne lidar for large-scale assessments of forest disturbance, and highlight the need for future data on vegetation structure from space.

AB Euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) products from ocean color measurements are now produced from MODIS ocean color measurements, one of which is based on inherent optical properties (IOP-approach) and the other is based on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-approach). For the first time, the quality of these satellite Z(eu) products is assessed with extensive field-measured Z(eu) (in the China Sea), where 78% of the measurements were made on the continental shelf (<= 200 m). For the data with matching location and time window, we have found that the overall average difference (epsilon) between satellite and in situ Z(eu) is 21.8% (n = 218, Z(eu) ranges from 4 to 93 m) with a root mean square error in log scale (RMSE) of 0.118 by the IOP-approach, while it is 49.9% (RMSE = 0.205) by the Chl-approach. These results suggest that 1) MODIS Z(eu) products for waters in the China Sea are robust, even in shelf waters; and 2) Z(eu) produced with IOPs are more reliable than those produced with empirically derived Chl. Spatial and seasonal variations of Z(eu) in the China Sea are briefly described with Z(eu) products generated by the IOP-approach. These results will facilitate further research on carbon cycling and environmental changes on both local and global scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The digital mapping of homogeneous zones that are likely to produce grapes or wines of similar composition (viticultural terroirs) is currently developed at the field scale but not at the regional scale. This study proposes to map viticultural terroirs using bootstrapped regression trees on distinct combinations of morphometric data (elevation, slope, aspect and wetness. index) and/or 20-m SPOT satellite images at four dates over the Stellenbosch viticultural area (South Africa). Expert knowledge on previously characterized grape and vine quality at 55 distinct Sauvignon blanc vineyards was available. Randomly sampled fractions of these observations were used as a basis for tree calculation for the mapping of 8 terroir units through the QUEST algorithm. For each of the 7 data layer combinations, the running of 100 QUEST iterations resulted in 100 classified images which were stacked in a "hyperclassified" image. The modal class of the hyperclassified image was computed at each pixel providing a "mode image" proposed as the final zoning result, whereas the class assignment frequencies provided a map of classification uncertainty. This approach is well adapted to the mixed 20-m pixels typical of viticultural environments. Provided that both radiometric and morphometric information are used to construct the model, no confusion occurs with non-viticultural land use. Four of the 8 terroir units could be modelled with a higher frequency of correct prediction. The combination of data layers that gave the highest percentage of correctly classified pixels in the validation sets (52-78% median accuracy) consisted of the 4 satellite images, elevation, slope and aspect.

AB The predictability of the vegetation cycle is analyzed as a function of the spatial scale over West Africa during the period 1982-2004 The NDVI-AVHRR satellite data time series are spatially aggregated over windows covering a range of sizes from 8 x 8 km(2) to 1024 x 1024 km(2). The times series are then embedded in a low-dimensional pseudo-phase space using a system of time delayed coordinates. The correlation dimension (D-c) and entropy of the underlying vegetation dynamics, as well as the noise level (sigma) are extracted from a nonlinear analysis of the time series The horizon of predictability (H-P) of the vegetation cycle defined as the time interval required for an n% RMS error on the vegetation state to double (i e reach 2n% RMS) is estimated from the entropy production. Compared to full resolution, the intermediate scales of aggregation (in the range of 64 x 64 km(2) to 256 x 256 km(2)) provide times series with a slightly improved signal to noise ratio, longer horizon of predictability (about 2 to 5 decades) and preserve the most salient spatial patterns of the vegetation cycle Insights on the best aggregation scale and on the expected vegetation cycle predictability over West Africa are provided by a set of maps of the correlation dimension (D-c), the horizon of predictability (H-P) and the level of noise (sigma).

AB Information related to land surface phenology is important for a variety of applications. For example, phenology is widely used as a diagnostic of ecosystem response to global change. In addition, phenology influences seasonal scale fluxes of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Increasingly, the importance of phenology for studies of habitat and biodiversity is also being recognized. While many data sets related to plant phenology have been collected at specific sites or in networks focused on individual plants or plant species, remote sensing provides the only way to observe and monitor phenology over large scales and at regular intervals. The MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics Product was developed to support investigations that require regional to global scale information related to spatio-temporal dynamics in land surface phenology. Here we describe the Collection 5 version of this product, which represents a substantial refinement relative to the Collection 4 product. This new version provides information related to land surface phenology at higher spatial resolution than Collection 4 (500-m vs. 1-km), and is based on 8-day instead of 16-day input data. The paper presents a brief overview of the algorithm, followed by an assessment of the product. To this end, we present (1) a comparison of results from Collection 5 versus Collection 4 for selected MODIS tiles that span a range of climate and ecological conditions, (2) a characterization of interannual variation in Collections 4 and 5 data for North America from 2001 to 2006, and (3) a comparison of Collection 5 results against ground observations for two forest sites in the northeastern United States. Results show that the Collection 5 product is qualitatively similar to Collection 4. However, Collection 5 has fewer missing values outside of regions with persistent cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols. Interannual variability in Collection 5 is consistent with expected ranges of variance suggesting that the algorithm is reliable and robust, except in the tropics where some systematic differences are observed. Finally, comparisons with ground data suggest that the algorithm is performing well, but that end of season metrics associated with vegetation senescence and dormancy have higher uncertainties than start of season metrics.

AB Over lands, the cloud detection on remote sensing images is not an easy task, because of the frequent difficulty to distinguish clouds from the underlying landscape, even at a high resolution. Up to now, most high resolution images have been distributed without an associated cloud mask. This situation should change in the near future, thanks to two new satellite missions that will provide optical images combining 3 features: high spatial resolution, high revisit frequency and constant viewing angles. The VEN mu S (French and Israeli cooperation) mission should be launched in 2012 and the European SENTINEL-2 mission in 2013. Fortunately, two existing satellite missions, FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT, enable to simulate the future data of these sensors.
   Multi-temporal imagery at constant viewing angles provides a new way to discriminate clouded and unclouded pixels, using the relative stability of the earth surface reflectances compared to the quick variations of the reflectance of pixels affected by clouds. In this study, we have used time series of images from FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT to develop and test a Multi-Temporal Cloud Detection (MTCD) method. This algorithm combines a detection of a sudden increase of reflectance in the blue wavelength on a pixel by pixel basis, and a test of the linear correlation of pixel neighborhoods taken from couples of images acquired successively.
   MTCD cloud masks are compared with cloud cover assessments obtained from FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT data catalogs. The results show that the MTCD method provides a better discrimination of clouded and unclouded pixels than the usual methods based on thresholds applied to reflectances or reflectance ratios. This method will be used within VEN mu S level 2 processing and will be proposed for SENTINEL-2 level 2 processing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studies using satellite sensor-derived data as input to models for CO2 exchange show promising results for closed forest stands. There is a need for extending this approach to other land cover types, in order to carry out large-scale monitoring of CO2 exchange. In this study, three years of eddy covariance data from two peatlands in Sweden were averaged for 16-day composite periods and related to data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and modeled photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Noise in the time series of MODIS 250 m vegetation indices was reduced by using double logistic curve fits. Smoothed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed saturation during summertime, and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) generally gave better results in explaining gross primary productivity (GPP). The strong linear relationships found between GPP and the product of EVI and modeled PPFD (R-2=0.85 and 0.76) were only slightly stronger than for the product of EVI and MODIS daytime 1 km land surface temperature (LST) (R-2=0.84 and 0.71). One probable reason for these results is that several controls on GPP were related to both modeled PPFD and daytime LST. Since ecosystem respiration (ER) was largely explained by diurnal LST in exponential relationships (R-2=0.89 and 0.83), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was directly related to diurnal LST in combination with the product of EVI and modeled PPFD in multiple exponential regressions (R-2=0.81 and 0.73). Even though the R-2 values were somewhat weaker for NEE, compared to GPP and ER, the RMSE values were much lower than if NEE would have been estimated as the sum of GPP and ER. The overall conclusion of this study is that regression models driven by satellite sensor-derived data and modeled PPFD can be used to estimate CO2 fluxes in peatlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the soil moisture sampling depth in the parameterization of soil emission in microwave rachometry at L-band. The analysis is based on brightness temperature, soil moisture and temperature measurements acquired over a bare soil during the SMOSREX experiment. A more detailed profile of surface soil moisture was obtained with a soil heat and water flows mechanistic model. It was found that (1) the soil moisture sampling depth depends on soil moisture conditions, (2) the effective soil moisture sampling depth is shallower than provided by widely used field moisture sensors, and (3) the soil moisture sampling depth has an impact on the calibration of soil roughness model parameters. These conclusions are crucial for the calibration and validation of remote sensing data at L-band. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to detect and quantify changes in the Earth's environment depends on sensors that can provide calibrated, consistent measurements of the Earth's surface features through time. A critical step in this process is to put image data from different sensors onto a common radiometric scale. This work focuses on monitoring the long-term on-orbit calibration stability of the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 7 (L7) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors using the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) reference standard pseudo-invariant test sites (Libya 4, Mauritania 1/2, Algeria 3, Libya 1, and Algeria 5). These sites have been frequently used as radiometric targets because of their relatively stable surface conditions temporally. This study was performed using all cloud-free calibrated images from the Terra MODIS and the L7 ETM+ sensors, acquired from launch to December 2008. Homogeneous regions of interest (ROI) were selected in the calibrated images and the mean target statistics were derived from sensor measurements in terms of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. For each band pair, a set of fitted coefficients (slope and offset) is provided to monitor the long-term stability over very stable pseudo-invariant test sites. The average percent differences in intercept from the long-term trends obtained from the ETM+TOA reflectance estimates relative to the MODIS for all the CEOS reference standard test sites range from 2.5% to 15%. This gives an estimate of the collective differences due to the Relative Spectral Response (RSR) characteristics of each sensor, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), spectral signature of the ground target, and atmospheric composition. The lifetime TOA reflectance trends from both sensors over 10 years are extremely stable, changing by no more than 0.4% per year in its TOA reflectance over the CEOS reference standard test sites.

AB Linking intertidal processes to their natural patterns within a framework of coastal erosion requires monitoring techniques providing high-resolution spatio-temporal data from the scale of processes to this of patterns. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne LiDAR Survey (SHOALS) consists of a ubiquitous topographic and bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system that has become an important technology for generating high-resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) over intertidal landscapes. The objectives of this project are i) to highlight the capacity of SHOALS Topography and intensity data (Red and Near-InfiraRed) to detect intertidal vegetation, ii) to assess the salt-marsh zonation, and iii) to map intertidal habitats and its adjacent coastal areas (Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada). The study area was selected based on the spectrum of land cover types, encompassing beach, salt-marsh, arable farm and urban coastal environments. Surfaces constructed from the LiDAR survey included DSM, DTM, Normalized Surface Model (NSM), Digital Intensity Model for InfraRed (DIMI), Digital Intensity Model for Red (DIMR), and Normalized Difference LiDAR Vegetation Index Model (NDLVIM), derived from the two previous models. The correlation between the so-called NDLVI and the amount of salt-marsh vegetation, measured in situ, was 0.87 (p<0.01). Then, LiDAR-assessed salt-marsh ecological zonation allowed finding out intermediate and strong relationships between NDLVI and Topography (r(2) = 0.89, p<0.038) and Topographic heterogeneity (r(2) = 0.54, p<0.1394), respectively. Finally, NDLVI and Topography surfaces were classified using maximum likelihood algorithm into 17 classes. whose overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 91.89% and 0.9088, respectively. These results support that (1) intertidal vegetation can be discriminated by NDLVI, (2) salt-marsh ecological zonation pattern, and (3) accurate coastal land cover maps can be satisfactorily generated from a single LiDAR survey using the NDLVIM and DTM approach.

AB Three sampling designs - simple random, stratified random, and systematic sampling - are compared on the basis of precision of estimated loss of intact humid tropical forest area in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2000 to 2005. MODIS-derived deforestation is used to partition the study area into strata to intensify sampling within forest clearing hotspots. The precision of the estimator of deforestation area for each design is calculated from a population of wall-to-wall PRODES deforestation data available for the study area. Both systematic and stratified sampling yield smaller standard errors than simple random sampling, and the stratified design has smaller standard errors than the systematic design at each sample size evaluated. The results of this case study demonstrate the utility of a stratified design based on MODIS-derived deforestation data to improve precision of the estimated loss of intact forest area as estimated from sampling Landsat imagery.
