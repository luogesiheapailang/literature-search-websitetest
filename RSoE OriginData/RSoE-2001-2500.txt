AB Transitions between plant species assemblages are often continuous with the form of the transition dependent on the 'slope' of environmental gradients and on the style of self-organization in vegetation. Image segmentation can present misleading or even erroneous results if applied to continuous spatial changes in vegetation. Even methods that allow for multiple-class memberships of pixels presuppose the existence of ideal types of species assemblages that constitute mixtures-an assumption that does not fit the case of continua where any section of a gradient is as 'pure' as any other section like in modulations of grassland species composition.
   Thus, we attempted to spatially model floristic gradients in Bavarian meadows by extrapolating axes of an unconstrained ordination of species data. The models were based on high-resolution hyperspectral airborne imagery. We further modelled the distribution of plant functional response types (Ellenberg indicator values) and the cover values of selected species. The models were made with partial least squares (PLS) regression analyses. The realistic utility of the regression models was evaluated by full leave-one-out cross-validation.
   The modelled floristic gradients showed a considerable agreement with ground-based observations of floristic gradients (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.66 for the first two axes of ordination). Apart from mapping the most important continuous floristic differences, we mapped gradients in the appearance of plant functional response groups as represented by averaged Ellenberg indicator values for soil pH (R-2 = 0.76), water supply (R-2 = 0.66) and nutrient supply (R-2 = 0.75), while models for the cover of single species were weak.
   Compared to many other vegetation attributes, plant species composition is difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques. This is partly caused by a lack of compatibility between methods of vegetation ecology and remote sensing. We believe that the present study has the potential to increase compatibility as neither spectral nor vegetation information gets lost by a classifying step. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The linear scale invariance of the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation is used to obtain invariant pixels for automatic relative radiometric normalization of time series of multispectral data. Normalization by means of ordinary least squares regression method is compared with normalization using orthogonal regression. The procedure is applied to Landsat TM images over Nevada, Landsat ETM+ images over Morocco, and SPOT HRV images over Kenya. Results from this new automatic, combined MAD/orthogonal regression method, based on statistical analysis of test pixels not used in the actual normalization, compare favorably with results from normalization from manually obtained time-invariant features.

AB The Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS-5) high resolution (10 km mesh) hourly data are sampled in 1degrees X 1degrees grid boxes in the domain of 600 X 600 km over Bangladesh (land) and the north part of the Bay of Bengal (ocean) to obtain diumal cycle of cloud activity. The cloud embedded area (CEA) shows afternoon (similar to 1700 LST) and morning (similar to 0003 LST) peaks over land typically composed of relatively small deep (< 214 K) and large shallow (< 243 K) convective cloud systems. In contrast, only afternoon (1400-1600 LST) peak is observed over. ocean typically composed of small shallow and large deep convective cloud systems. Meanwhile the frequency of the cloud systems exhibits the clear afternoon (similar to 1600 LST) peak over the land and the ocean that indicates that afternoon is the initiation times of land-based clusters over Bangladesh and water-based clusters in the analyzed ocean (87.44-93.33degreesE; 15.7-21.08degreesN).
   Radar data from Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for consecutive 135 days from 16 April 2000 over Bangladesh are utilized to obtain the diumal variations and characteristics of precipitation in relation to cloud activity. The nature of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in Bangladesh is that there is a morning peak at 0600 LST with minimum at noon. The frequency of the echoes exhibits two peaks-one in the afternoon (similar to 1500 LST) and the other in the morning (0600 LST) hours. The smaller echoes dominate in the afternoon while larger echoes develop in the early morning. The shape, lifetime, horizontal length and movement of the precipitation features in Bangladesh are also investigated using radar data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multidirectional observation from the spacebome POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectance) instrument makes it possible to measure the bidirectional reflectance of a large variety of Earth targets. A careful selection of cloud-free measurements with a large directional coverage lead to about 22,000 sets of measured Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs). This data set is used to evaluate the ability of analytical models to reproduce the observed directional signatures. Among those evaluated, the best models appear to be the three-parameter linear Ross-Li model, and the nonlinear Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model. On the other hand, all models fail to accurately reproduce the sharp reflectance increase (hot spot) close to the backscattering direction. Based on physical considerations, we suggest a modification of the Ross-Li model, without adding a free parameter, to account for the complex radiative transfer within the canopy that leads to the hot spot signature. The modified linear model performs better than all others, including the RPV nonlinear model. Although the correction modifies the retrieved directional signature parameters, it does not change significantly the surface albedo estimates. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The operational utilization of remote sensing techniques for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems is often constrained by problems of under-sampling in space and time, particularly in heterogeneous and unstable Mediterranean environments. The current work deals with the use of the NOAA-AVHRR and Landsat-TM/ETM+ images to produce long-term NDVI data series characterising coniferous and broadleaved forests in a protected coastal area in Tuscany (Central Italy). Two methods to extract NDVI values of relatively small vegetated areas from NOAA-AVHRR data were first evaluated by comparison to estimates from higher resolution Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. The optimal method was then applied to multitemporal AVHRR data series to derive 10-day NDVI profiles of coniferous and broadleaved forests over a 15-year period (1986-2000). Trend analyses performed on these data series showed that notable NDVI decreases occurred during the study period, particularly for the coniferous forest in summer and early fall. Further analysis carried out on local meteorological measurements led to identify the likely causes of these negative trends in contemporaneous winter rainfall decreases which were significantly correlated with the found NDVI variations.

AB Over the last two decades, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to address geologic problems has expanded as new applications for radar have been developed. One of the earliest and perhaps most surprising results from orbital SAR images of the Sahara was that, under certain conditions, radar signals penetrated up to several meters of sand to reveal subsurface features such as ancient river channels. Subsequent studies of radar penetration of and sand deposits have dealt with factors that govern the ability of radar to penetrate a sand cover. This paper presents results from a laboratory experiment in which radar backscatter from a surface of rocks was measured under controlled conditions as a function of frequency, polarization, incidence angle, and sand cover thickness. The sand used in the experiment had a moisture content of 0.28 vol.% and caused calculated average attenuations of 4.2 +/- 1 dB/m for C-band and similar to 11 +/- 2 dB/m for X-band. Results from the experiment were compared to field measurements of sand thickness during acquisition of airborne radar images. In AIRSAR images, the extent of dry sand in a dune field appears best in C-band because longer wavelength L- and P-band signals penetrate thinner sand deposits. Images of wet sand (4.9 vol.%) suggest that L-band was able to penetrate thin sand even though that sand was wet. Together, these laboratory and field measurements contribute towards a better understanding of how a sand cover modifies the radar backscatter of a surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Normative plant species are causing enormous ecological and environmental impacts from local to global scale. Remote sensing images have had mixed success in providing spatial information on land cover characteristics to land managers that increase effective management of invasions into native habitats. However, there has been limited evaluation of the use of hyperspectral data and processing techniques for mapping specific invasive species based on their spectral characteristics. This research evaluated three different methods of processing hyperspectral imagery: minimum noise fraction (MNF), continuum removal, and band ratio indices for mapping iceplant (Carpobrotus edulis) and jubata grass (Cortaderia jubata) in California's coastal habitat. Validation with field sampling data showed high mapping accuracies for all methods for identifying presence or absence of iceplant (97%), with the MNF procedure producing the highest accuracy (55%) when the classes were divided into four different densities of iceplant.

AB Multifrequency, polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) survey of a salt marsh on the east coast of the UK is used to investigate the radar backscattering properties of emergent salt marsh vegetation. Two characteristics of flooded vegetation are observed: backscatter enhanced by approximately 1.2 dB at C-band, and 180degrees HH-VV phase differences at L-band. Both are indicative of a double bounce backscattering mechanism between the horizontal water surface and upright emergent vegetation. The mapping of inundated vegetation is demonstrated for both these signatures, using a statistical active contour model for the C-band enhanced backscatter, and median filtering and thresholding for the L-band HH-VV phase difference. The two techniques are validated against the waterline derived from tidal elevation measured at the time of overpass intersected with an intertidal DEM derived from airborne laser altimetry. The inclusion of flooded vegetation is found to reduce errors in waterline location by a factor of approximately 2, equivalent to a reduction in waterline location error from 120 to 70 m. The DEM is also used to derive SAR waterline heights, which are observed to underpredict the tidal elevation due to the effects of vegetation. The underprediction can be corrected for vegetation effects using canopy height maps derived from the laser altimetry. This third technique is found to improve the systematic error in waterline heights from 20 to 4 cm, but little improvement in random error is evident, chiefly due to significant noise in the vegetation height map.

AB Coral reef benthic communities are mosaics of individual bottom-types that are distinguished by their taxonomic composition and functional roles in the ecosystem. Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13, 100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 in. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Estimating the distribution of impervious surface, a major component of the vegetation-impervious surface-soil (V-I-S) model, is important in monitoring urban areas and understanding human activities. Besides its applications in physical geography, such as ran-off models and urban change studies, maps showing impervious surface distribution are essential for estimating socio-economic factors, such as population density and social conditions. In this paper, impervious surface distribution, together with vegetation and soil cover, is estimated through a fully constrained linear spectral mixture model using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data within the metropolitan area of Columbus, OH in the United States. Four endmembers, low albedo, high albedo, vegetation, and soil were selected to model heterogeneous urban land cover. Impervious surface fraction was estimated by analyzing low and high albedo endmembers. The estimation accuracy for impervious surface was assessed using Digital Orthophoto Quarterquadrangle (DOQQ) images. The overall root mean square (RMS) error was 10.6%, which is comparable to the digitizing errors of DOQQ images. Results indicate that impervious surface distribution can be derived from remotely sensed imagery with promising accuracy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

   IMPACT; AVHRR; FIELD
AB The Vegetative Cover Conversion (VCC) product is designed to serve as a global alarm for land cover change caused by anthropogenic activities and extreme natural events. MODIS 250 m surface reflectance data availability was limited both spatially and temporally in the first year after launch due to processing system constraints. To address this situation, the VCC algorithms were applied to available MODIS 250 m Level 113 radiance data to test the VCC change detection algorithms presented in this paper. Five data sets of MODIS Level 1B 250 m data were collected for the year 2000, representing: (1) Idaho-Montana wildfires; (2) the Cerro Grande prescribed fire in New Mexico; (3) flood in Cambodia; (4) Thailand-Laos flood retreat; and (5) deforestation in southern Brazil. Decision trees are developed for each of the VCC change detection methods for each of these six cases. These decision trees are to be used for updating the look-up tables required by the VCC production code. For these change detection cases, the VCC change detection methods worked reasonably well. In the Idaho-Montana wildfire case, a fire perimeter polygon data set compiled by the USDA Forest Service was used to validate the output of the VCC change detection methods. Although the VCC output identified only 32% of the burned pixels within the ground observed Idaho-Montana fire perimeter polygons, the detection accuracy of the VCC output did reach 99% when the VCC product is considered as an alarm system identifying the occurrence of the change in an area. For other cases, the detection accuracy in per-pixel terms of the VCC output ranges from 55% to 90% against reference change bitmaps that were created by image interpretation. Look-up tables created with AVHRR and Landsat Thematic Mapper data require modifications for the MODIS data due to differences in radiometric response between MODIS and the heritage instruments. The applications presented in this paper also evaluate the relative performance of each of the five change detection methods used as VCC algorithms. Conclusions reached in this paper will be used for future refinement of the VCC product. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a robust, accurate inversion technique for estimating the grain size in a snowpack's surface layer from imaging spectrometer data. Using a radiative transfer mode, the method relates an ice absorption feature, centered at lambda =1.03 mum, to the optically equivalent snow grain size. Because the interpretation is based on the area-not depth-of the absorption feature scaled to absolute reflectance, the method is insensitive to instrument noise and does not require a topographic correction. We tested the method using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data over the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, and we validated it with a combination of ground-based spectrometer data and grain size measurements.

AB A new fluorimeter built at Orsay allowed us to measure at a distance of up to 6 m both the stead-state and the maximum chlorophyll fluorescence. This instrument has been applied continuously during 17 days of water stress development to follow the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of a potted grapevine. Gas-exchange rates for H2O and CO2 and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the same leaf were recorded concurrently. It was shown that: (1) Under well-watered conditions, before noon, a correlation was found between net photosynthetic rate and the rate of electron transport calculated from fluorescence measurements. After several hours of high light exposure, CO2 assimilation (A) started to decrease more than the rate of electron transport (ETR). Under drought conditions, the above-mentioned correspondence was lost: when A almost vanished due to high stomatal closure, the ETR was still about 50% of the control value. It is suggested that under these conditions, the ratio of photorespiration to CO2 assimilation increased (2) Light response of the quantum yield of ETR became increasingly different between,morning and afternoon as water stress progressed, thus serving as a good indicator of plant water status. (3) A simple fluorescence parameter, Fs, accurately reflected the plant physiological state. Over the range of light intensities used in this study, this parameter changed in parallel with irradiance in well-watered plants. With increasing water stress, Fs changed in opposite direction to irradiance changes. The response of Fs to rapid changes in irradiance was fast (within seconds). The potential of this parameter for remote sensing of water stress is discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Three satellite fire detection models (threshold, contextual, and fuel mask) were compared and evaluated using National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-11, NOAA-12, and NOAA-14 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor data from interior Alaska. The fixed threshold model compared the radiant temperature of each pixel to predetermined threshold values. The contextual model compared the radiant temperature of each pixel to its surrounding (background) pixels. The fuel mask model is similar to the contextual model, but pixels were tested for fuel availability according to pre-fire vegetation index values. Fire location data from the Alaska Fire Service teas used to assess the accuracy of the fire detection models. Fire detection accuracy: (a) was highest using the fuel mask model; (b) was lowest using the fixed threshold model; (c) increased as fire size increased; (d) was considerably greater in afternoon images than morning or night images. Fire defection methods may be less accurate in taiga/tundra regions such as interior Alaska due to landscape heterogeneity and relatively low aboveground fuel. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB A model for instantaneous gross canopy photosynthesis, considering sunlit and shaded leaves, variation of maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy, and a solution of the radiative transfer equation for propagation of direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation, is numerically integrated in space (angular variation of radiances and depth within the canopy) and time (diurnal cycle) to obtain daily total photosynthesis for varied incident irradiances and leaf and canopy characteristics. These numerical results are used to evaluate an analytic model for daily photosynthesis that requires daily total irradiance, recognizing that readily available global satellite data provide daily total irradiance rather than diurnal values of direct and diffuse irradiances. The analytic model is derived by considering the light response function for leaf photosynthesis to be a rectangular hyperbola. The evaluation was done by using field observations for 27 canopies representing four cultivated and seven uncultivated species and having a leaf area index between 0.6 and 5.9. The evaluation gives a mean maximum uncertainty of 32% for the analytic equation. The magnitude of uncertainty can be reduced by knowing the diffuse fraction of incident radiation.

AB The objective of this paper is to determine spectral bands that are best suited for characterizing agricultural crop biophysical variables. The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with OMNBR models was that of "over fitting" (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum R-2 value). This problem was addressed by comparing the R-2 values of crop variables with the R-2 values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in OMNBR models explained most (64% to 92%) of the variability in crop biophysical variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band NDVI predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda (lambda(1)) versus lambda (lambda(2)) plots of R-2 values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations (lambda(1) and lambda(2)) and bandwidths (Delta lambda(1) and Delta lambda(2)) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band NDVI models explained 64% to 88% variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 nm to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Acurrate monitoring of global seals changes in the terrestrial biosphere has become acutely important as the scope of human impacts on biological systems and atmospheric chemistry grows. For example, the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 signals some of the dramatic socioeconomic and political decisions that may lie ahead concerning CO(2) emissions and global carbon cycle impacts. These decisions will rely heavily on accurate measures of global biospheric changes (Schimel 1998; IGBP TCWG, 1998). An array of national and international programs have inaugurated global satellite observations, critical field measurements of carbon and water fluxes, and global model development for the purposes of beginning to monitor the biosphere. The detection by these programs of interannual variability of ecosystem fluxes and of longer term trends will permit early indication of fundamental biospheric changes which might otherwise go undetected until major biome conversion begins. This article describes a blueprint for more comprehensive coordination of the various flux measurement and modeling activities into a global terrestrial monitoring network that will have direct relevance to the political decision making of global change.

ID TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHM; SCANNER
AB The performance of sir published methods for extracting relative spectral emissivity information from thermal infrared multispectral data has been evaluated. In the first part of this article, we recall those six methods and show mathematically that they are almost equivalent to each other. Then, using simulated data for the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, we analyze the sensitivity of those methods to different sources of error which may occur in real data such as errors due to 1) method simplification, 2) instrumental noise and systematic calibration error, 3) uncertainties on the estimation of downwelling atmospheric radiance, and 4) uncertainties of atmospheric parameters in atmospheric corrections. In terms of resulting errors in relative emissivity, the results show that: a) all methods are very sensitive to the uncertainties of atmosphere. An error of 20% of water vapor in midlatitude summer atmosphere (2.9 cm) may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 (worst case) of TIMS. b) The effect of the atmospheric reflection term is very important. If this term is neglected in method development, this may lead to an error of 0.03 (mns) for Channel 1 and midlatitude summer atmosphere. This Is the case for the alpha method. c) Instrumental noise commonly expressed by noise equivalent difference temperature (NE Delta T) from 0.1 K to 0.3 K results in an error on relative emissivity ranging from 0.002 to 0.005 for all methods. d) Error on relative emissivity due to the instrumental calibration error (systematic error;) is negligible. The study also shows that the relative emissivity derived with deviate atmosphere is linearly related to its actual value derived with correct atmospheric parameters. Based on this property, we propose three methods to correct for the errors caused by atmospheric corrections render horizontally invariant atmospheric conditions. A practical analysis with the real TIMS data acquired for Hapex-Sahel experiment in 1992 supports the results of this simulation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

ID CIRCULATION
AB Several years of CZCS-measured surface pigment's concentrations in the Black Sea are analyzed to appraise the seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations of phytoplankton biomass and understand the causes of these fluctuations in terms of the Black Sea's general dynamics. The pattern of seasonal variations is typical for subtropical rather than temperate regions. The range of the absolute value of plant pigment surface concentration measured by remote sensing does not differ greatly from the values measured by direct methods. The pattern of year-to-year variations seems to correlate with cyclic oscillations of winter air temperature. In western shallow regions it is also correlated with the Danube discharge intensity. More intensive winter-spring blooms and a slightly lower level of pigment concentration during warm season are typical for years of with a mild winter. The causes of there regularities seem to be the peculiarities of hydrological and meteorological regimes of the Black Sea. The intensity of winter-spring bloom of phytoplankton appears to depend on hydrological mechanism (i.e., the intensity of water mixing during winter period due to thermic convection and wind mixing) rather than the illumination intensity.

AB Hierarchial foreground and background analysis (HFBA) was used to discriminate soil properties from two valleys in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, California. The analysis was organized in two levels. First, spectral data from laboratory measured soil samples were used to train a vector in AVIRIS data for classifying the soils between valleys. The prediction of organic matter and iron contents is performed at a second level of resolution. Results showed that in the laboratory, soils could be classified at a high level of accuracy. When applied to the image, the spatial predictions of organic matter and iron content were consistent for the first level of classification. The ranges of predicted organic matter and iron contents developed at the second level of classification were also consistent with the magnitude and distribution of field samples. The presence of vegetation and the steep terrain affect adversely the ability to resolve these soil properties. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB The consequences of shifting the spectral location of narrow and broad red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) bands on measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of Brazilian savannas were investigated for different plant communities and seasonal phenology. The basic data came from an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image obtained during the regional dry season and two Landsat 5-Thematic Mapper (TM) images from the dry and rainy seasons. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to a set of 64 AVIRIS bands from the interval of 500-1100 nm in order to select the R-NIR band pair of greatest spectral contrast and respective endmember spectra for the R and NIR band variations. For the endmember spectra, modeled AVIRIS-derived NDVI values, obtained by changing the spectral positioning and bandwidths of R-NIR band pairs, were compared with NDVI calculated from simulated R-NIR band pairs of orbital sensors. Furthermore, the suitability of different positions and bandwidths was also examined employing, as criterion, the calculated NDVI contrast between the endmember spectra. The results revealed that the NDVI of the green vegetation was essentially affected by the proximity of the R and NIR bands to the spectral interval of the red edge and NIR bands to the spectral interval of the red edge (690-750 nm). The strongest effects were observed for the R bands that partly extended longwards the 690 nm wavelength. On the other hand, the NDVI of the nonphotosynthetic vegetation varied up to 100% within the studied interval, especially as a function of the R-NIR spectral distance. The largest NDVI contrast between given the 690 nm and 750 nm wavelengths, as predicted from PCA. Results from simulated orbital sensors demonstrated that bandwidths have no significant influence on the NDVI provided the R and NIR bands are not extended into the red edge domain. The variable NDVI contrasts along traverses presented the smallest values when associated with the conspicuous green vegetation, and the largest values when associated with the dried-out grasslands or exposed soils.

AB A hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance data set of grass lawn and watercress canopies acquired under controlled laboratory conditions at the JRC European Goniometric Facility, at Ispra, Italy was analyzed with respect to basic physical reflectance mechanisms and factors influencing reflectance anisotropy. By normalizing reflectance data with the nadir reflectance as a reference, a strong influence of reflectance intensity on observed reflectance an isotropy is demonstrated for both vegetation canopies. This is explained by multiple scattering effects inside vegetation canopies as a function of canopy spectral absorbance characteristics. Two quantities based on canopy reflectances are utilized for characterizing the spectrally variable dynamics of BRDF effects: the anisotropy factor (ANIF), which is simply a normalization with nadir reflectance, and the anisotropy index (ANIX) defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum reflectance values In the principal plane (or defined azimuth plane) per spectral band. Using these two quantities the study revealed that the basic physical reflectance mechanisms described by Kimes (1983) for broad spectral bands are extendable to hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance data. In addition, the influences of canopy geometry and multiple scattering on BRDF are clearly demonstrated for the erectophile grass lawn and the planophile watercress canopy. Since multiple scattering effects and canopy geometry are dominant factors regulating BRDF effects, vegetation canopy architecture parameters such as the leaf area index might be derived from hyperspectral BRDF data.

AB Recent upgrades to the MODTRAN atmospheric radiation code improve the accuracy of its radiance predictions, especially in the presence of clouds and thick aerosols, and for multiple scattering in regions of strong molecular line absorption. The current public-released version of MODTRAN (MODTRAN3.7) features a generalized specification of cloud properties, while the current research version of MODTRAN (MODTRAN4) implements a correlated-k (CK) approach for more accurate calculation of multiply scattered radiance. Comparisons to cloud measurements demonstrate the viability of the CK approach. The impact of these upgrades on predictions for AVIRIS viewing scenarios is discussed for both clear and clouded skies; the CK approach provides refined predictions for AVIRIS nadir and near-nadir viewing.

AB In this study, principal component analysis. and the linear programming method "affine algorithm" were jointly used to provide an unmixing method and to calculate fractions bounds of main seaweeds and intertidal components from mixed pixels. The method was tested using CASI airborne imagery data taken over the Roscoff coastal zone (Brittany, France). The contribution of the number of spectral bands used to identify many component types was also examined. Between four and six components can be distinguished depending on the spectral richness of the original image. The accuracy of fraction cover types was estimated by comparing calculated proportions with ground data. Whatever the number of bands and ground categories, the coefficient of determination R-2 was higher than 0.62. Much more information and more accurate results were obtained with 13 spectral bands (R-2 from 0.81 to 0.96). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Four digital change detection algorithms are applied to 1986 and 1990 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of a portion of the Salt Lake Valley area to determine the land-cover/land-use changes between the two dates. Image differencing and image regression are used with the six reflective TM bands to create 12 change images. A tassled cap transformation is also used to create three change images (change in brightness, greenness, and wetness). A new method-a Chi square transformation-is proposed and used with the six reflective bands to create a single band change image. A thresholding strategy is applied to the change images to separate the pixels of change from those of no change. Five hundred eighty-five samples are selected through a combination of stratified random sampling and systematic sampling procedure. Ground truth information on the sample sites is obtained from the interpretation of color aerial photo slides of the two dates. Three indices are used to assess the accuracies of the sixteen change images for land-cover/land-use change detection. The regression of TM Band 3 is found to be most accurate for detecting change vs. no change in all three indices, while the difference image of TM4 is found to be least accurate. The kind of change in land-cover/land-use is also examined. The results are compared and summarized. Changes involving construction sites and farmlands are found to be accurately detected by several change images. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The objective of this research was to test the use of the well-documented ratio of near-infrared (NIR; 705 nm) to red (670 nm) reflectance in estimating chlorophyll content in a relatively turbid midwestern reservoir. The results were compared with those obtained by analyzing the first derivative of reflectivity near 690 nm. Data were collected in three different months over a 2-year period, and the characteristic spectral features of surface reflectance associated with algal chlorophyll were analyzed. Results indicated that the NIR/red ratio was not an effective predictor of algal-chlorophyll concentration in our case, except on one occasion. The first derivative of reflectance, on the other hand, was better correlated with chlorophyll concentration than the 705/670 band ratio. The highest correlation between the first derivative and chlorophyll was at 690.7 nm. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The quality of life (QOL) of the Athens-Clarke County of Georgia was assessed by integrating environmental variables extracted from Landsat thematic mapper data with socioeconomic variables obtained from the U.S. Census data. The environmental variables extracted are (1) land use/cover particularly percentage of urban use; (2) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and (3) apparent surface temperatures. The socioeconomic variables front the census data are (1) population density, (2) per capita income, (3) median home value, and (4) percentage of college graduates. NDVI, which shows strong negative correlation with ''per cent of urban use'' and ''surface temperatures,'' is in turn strongly correlated with per capita income, population density, and median home value. The environmental and socioeconomic variables are integrated by means of two approaches: (1) principal components analysis and (2) geographical-information-system overlay of ranked data layers. These two approaches constitute respectively an objective and a subjective assessment of the QOL of the study area. The results of these analyses indicate that satellite image data can complement census data in providing QOL assessment with an environmental perspective. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

The simulated reflectances were then fit with a simple model by using a least squares procedure. Plots of the resulting coefficients with LAI showed that the degree of curvature of the simulated principal plane reflectances, as represented by one of the coefficients, and the coefficient expressing interaction of view zenith angle and view azimuth angle were both related to LAI. This relation holds in all four spectral bands, including the 0.7-0.8 mu m band, despite a lack of relation between the constant coefficient (which is closely related to the nadir value) and LAI. Examination of the coefficients relating to solar zenith angle revealed a dependence on LAI. The coefficient for view zenith angle, or a related quantity, is suggested as a candidate for a bidirectional index that may be useful within the context of satellite-based vegetation classification and characterization schemes.

ID SYSTEM; CANOPY
AB Airborne laser profiling data were used to estimate the basal area, volume, and biomass of primary tropical forests. A procedure was developed and tested to divorce the laser and ground data collection efforts using three distinct data sets acquired in and over the tropical forests of Costa Rica. Fixed-area ground plot data were used to simulate the height characteristics of the tropical forest canopy and to simulate laser measurements of that canopy. On two of the three study sites, the airborne laser estimates of basal area, volume, and biomass grossly misrepresented ground estimates of same. On the third study site, where the widest ground plots were utilized, airborne and ground estimates agreed within 24%. Basal area, volume, and biomass prediction inaccuracies in the first two study areas were tied directly to disagreements between simulated laser estimates and the corresponding airborne measurements of average canopy height, height variability, and canopy density. A number of sampling issues were investigated; the following results were noted in the analyses of the three study areas. 1) Of the four ground segment lengths considered (25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m), the 25 m segment length introduced a level of variability which may severely degrade prediction accuracy in these Costa Rican primary tropical forests. This effect was more pronounced as plot width decreased. A minimum segment length was on the order of 50 m. 2) The decision to transform or not to transform the dependent variable (e.g., biomass) was by far the most important factor of those considered in this experiment. The natural log transformation of the dependent variable increased prediction error, and error increased dramatically at the shorter segment lengths. The most accurate models were multiple linear models with forced zero intercept and an untransformed dependent variable. 3) General linear models were developed to predict basal area, volume, and biomass using airborne laser height measurements. Useful laser measurements include average canopy height, all pulses ((h) over bar(a)), average canopy height, canopy hits ((h) over bar(c)) and the coefficients of variation of these terms (c(a) and c(c)). Coefficients of determination range from 0.4 to 0.6. Based on this research, airborne laser and ground sampling procedures are proposed for use for reconnaissance level surveys of inaccessible forested regions. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID BIOMASS; IDENTIFICATION; RESOLUTION; IMAGES
AB A technique has been developed to detect and map fire growth by using a multitemporal multispectral analysis of AVHRR images. The application of this technique allows fire growth monitoring. The technique is mainly based on comparison of brightness temperature differences and AVHRR Channels 3 and 4 for successive images. It provides a rapid evaluation;of the area affected by the fire but suppresses the ambiguous thermal signal produced by nonvegetated terrain. It has been applied to a set of diurnal images acquired by the Granada University AVHRR reception system during a severe fire outbreak in Spain (July 1994). The Andalusian Regional Government Environmental Directorate provided the information and boundaries of the fires which are used as ground truth'' to validate the AVHRR-derived fires boundaries. Both the derived boundaries for the burned area and the fire evolution agree closely with the information collected by field observers, with differences ranging from 9% to 20% in the total burnt area. The availability of 24-h field reports for one of the fires provided an appropriate test for the continuous monitoring by means of remote sensing technique. The study area, located in southeastern Spain, is characterized by a dry mediterranean climate, and the fires affected different ecosystems, from coniferous forest to shrubland. This variety of land coverage makes difficult the application of other proposed techniques. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB This article examines temporal changes in the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) C- and L-band radar backscatter over an agricultural test site centred on Altona, Manitoba, Canada in relation to changing environmental conditions during April and October 1994. The results indicate that environmental events such as frost and rain can be monitored. However, care must be taken as some soil targets at high moisture contents may behave as specular reflectors at longer wavelengths, such as L-band at large incidence angles, thus masking soil moisture effects. The strongest correlation between radar backscatter and soil moisture (r=0.84) was obtained for the 0-2.5 cm soil profile at HH polarizations. The strength of the correlation was approximately the same at C- and L-band. All polarizations displayed a decrease in soil moisture correlation with increasing soil profile depth. It was observed that soil texture effects on the estimation of soil moisture from radar backscatter were relatively small and consequently can be neglected. Although the sensitivity to surface roughness is greater at HV and VV than at HH polarization, results indicate that roughness could be neglected when measuring soil moisture over relatively short periods of time at a given site, without significantly reducing the sensitivity of the relationship between radar backscatter and soil moisture.

AB Retrieving area estimates from broad scale land-cover maps is generally inaccurate due to the effect of spatial aggregation on class proportions. In a previous study, we tested a method to calibrate area estimates of tropical forest cover by inverting a model of the influence of the forest spatial fragmentation on the spatial aggregation bias, as characterized by two nested regression models. This was based on a sample of high resolution land-cover classifications, distributed across the tropical belt. In this study, improvements of this previous model are sought, first, by better accounting for the spatial variability of landscape characteristics using texture measures and, second, by integrating spatial information in the mixed pixel estimator-that is, the modeling of spectral mixtures at the scale of coarse resolution pixels as a function of the proportion of land-cover types. These improvements were tested using NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data at 1.1 km resolution, Landsat Thematic Mapper-based classifications, and data simulated at the 250 m resolution of the forthcoming Earth Observing System's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The integration of spatial information into a correction model to retrieve fine resolution cover-type proportions from coarse resolution data can improve by up to 35% the reliability of the estimates. The results also demonstrate that the integration of spatial information in the mixed pixel estimator controls for the variability due to different landscape characteristics. This study improves our capability to estimate tropical forest cover from coarse resolution remote sensing data at a global scale. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997

AB The results of an inversion method by iteration for determining the aerosol size distribution and the refractive index of atmospheric aerosols in the surface layer from bistatic lidar angular scattering measurements, followed by a brief description of the experimental and data retrieval techniques are presented. The continuous wave, bistatic Argon ion lidar at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune (18 degrees 32'N, 73 degrees 51'E, 559 m AMSL), India has been used for the measurements. Results of the analysis of 420 samples collected over a 7 years' period indicate mean value of size and refractive indices of 4.0 and 1.6, respectively, with greater fraction of larger particles during premonsoon while smaller particles during post-monsoon months at the lidar site. The retrieved aerosol parameters are compared with those determined from spectroradiometer observations at the same site. The results are found well in agreement with those obtained previously by the authors using the library seal-ch method. The above observations of angular distribution of scattered intensity are used with an aerosol model to infer the dominant type of aerosols present in the Environment in and around the experimental station.

TI THE USE OF RADAR BACKSCATTERING SIGNALS FOR MEASURING SOIL-MOISTURE AND
   SURFACE-ROUGHNESS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROWAVE
AB In this article, the possible we of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), for measuring the moisture content and surface roughness is analyzed. Data have been acquired on the Melarchez subwatershed during the Orgeval '89 campaign from March to December 1989. Radar backscattering measurements were provided by the French airborne scatterometer ERASME. Simultaneous ground measurements of soil moisture and roughness, leaf-area index, and water content of the canopy were conducted on 12 test fields. Using radar configurations close that of the ERS-1 SAR, the results clearly indicate that radar data cannot be easily converted into moisture estimates at field scale over a variety of bare sell, essentially due to the effect of roughness on radar response. Nevertheless, mean soil-moisture values measured within bare soil fields over the whole subwatershed, show a decrease in soil-surface moisture from March to October. The same feature is clearly obtained by averaged radar measurements over all bare-soil fields, indicating that ERS-1 could be used for monitoring the moisture state on a regional scale. Furthermore, the great variability of radar backscattering and radar-slope data, for a given soil practice, for example, ploughing or sowing, and for the same date of measurement over bare soil, suggests that, under natural field conditions, backscattering from a soil surface may not be sufficient to explain and understand the radar response and that volume scattering may have to be accounted for as well. Finally, concerning soil roughness, the standard deviation of surface-height slope discriminates the roughness states, which apparently is a pertinent parameter for analyzing the variation of the backscattering coefficient with incidence angle.

AB Methods for interpreting the microwave high-frequency emission of open canopies are proposed in this article. Three frequencies are considered: 23.8, 36.5, and 90 GHz. The microwave data were collected simultaneously with the canopy infrared temperature, and ground measurements of moisture, temperature, and bulk density of the soil together with water content and volume fraction of the vegetation. Soil emission is modeled using dielectric permittivity and roughness parameters previously determined over bare soil surfaces. Two kinds of vegetation canopies are considered: a sparse-growing sorghum and a wheat canopy composed of dense, large patches. The microwave mired soil-vegetation emission is analyzed using three modeling approaches. At 23.8 and 36.5 GHz, a random continuous approach can. be applied. The sparse canopy emission is efficiently described by considering the vegetation layer as homogeneous. Conversely, a mixing equation must be used for the patchy canopy. At 90 GHz, another technique is applied. It consists of including vegetation in soil roughness parameters. The problem with retrieving the canopy temperature and the near-surface soil moisture at high frequencies is addressed. For the sparse canopy, soil moisture retrieval is possible. The canopy temperature is retrieved with poor accuracy, however. Over the patchy surface, geophysical parameter retrieval with high frequencies alone seems much more difficult.

The nac model considers the diffuse and specular reflection of shortwave radiation on leaves, the canopy hot spot, and nonlambertian soil. Diffuse fluxes are treated in a four-stream approximation. An elliptical distribution has been used for leaf inclination. Comparisons of the models demonstrate a good agreement. The complete set of algorithms of the new model is appended.

AB A vegetation / atmosphere radiative transfer method is employed to study atmospheric effects in spectral vegetation indices. A one-dimensional turbid medium model of a vegetation canopy that includes specular reflection and the hot spot effect is used to calculate canopy bidirectional reflectance factors. These are then used to specify the lower boundary condition of the atmospheric radiative transfer problem. A horizontally homogeneous cloudless midlatitude continental atmosphere with both molecular and aerosol loading is assumed throughout. The canopy and atmospheric radiative transfer equations are numerically solved by the discrete ordinates method. A total of 13 discrete wavelengths in the solar spectrum outside the absorption bands of major atmospheric constituents were considered in this study. Spectral and angular distribution of surface radiances above the canopy and atmosphere were evaluated for different solar zenith angles and leaf area indices. The most frequently used spectral vegetation index, NDVI, and variants introduced recently to correct for atmospheric and soil brightness effects (ARVI, SAVI, and SARVI) were calculated to investigate the extent of atmospheric distortion. The nature of the relationship between top-of-the-atmosphere and, top-of-the-canopy spectral vegetation indices is studied, and its sensitivity to various problem parameters assessed.

AB For a number of years it has been known that a relatively strong fluorescence emission is produced by leaves when using UV radiation for excitation (Chappelle et al., 1984a); the apparent bandwidth is larger than 150 nm starting from 400 nm and includes several peaks; under excitation at 337 nm, their integrated energy is 6-11 times the energy released by chlorophyll (a) bands. The problem of bands assignment concerns relative contribution balance as several different emitters are located in chloroplasts, vacuoles, mitochondria, nuclei, cell wall, and epidermis. Within the sensitivity of a 4-lambda synchronous pulse amplified N2 laser photometer, and the experimental limits Of a continuous spectrofluorimeter, the conclusion we present here is that: a) The blue-green fluorescence emission comes mainly from other epidermal layers; b) it is transferable on a quartz lamina by quick dipping the leaves in organic solvents and subsequent solvent evaporation; c) it shows a typical diffusion controlled quenching of fluorescence intensity within a thermal window between 277 K (high fluorescence) and 310 K (low fluorescence); d) the fluorescence emissivity is not linked to short-term metabolic arrangements, but tends to follow long-term epidermis adaptations to drought, and excessive radiation.

AB Surface reflectivities for horizontally and vertically polarized emission at 19 GHz and 37 GHz are calculated for two locations over sand deserts, one location each over a rainforest, and a savanna from daytime observations by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP-F8 satellite for the period january 1988 to December 1989. The calculated reflectivities over the deserts are compared against predictions from the Fresnel equations, while the reflectivities over the rainforest are compared against predictions from a radiative transfer model and with field observations. The temporal variation of the reflectivities over the savanna is discussed in relation to those over deserts and rainforest, and in terms of biomass growth and decay. These SSM/I observations can be used to study seasonal and interannual changes of vegetation cover.

AB An AVIRIS image was obtained at Lake Tahoe on 9 August 1990, along with in situ data. Profiles of percent transmission of monochromatic light, stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetically available radiation, and spectral upwelling and downwelling irradiance, and upwelling radiance were measured. Chlorophyll-a + phaeopigments, total particulate absorption, detritus absorption, and absorption due to colored dissolved organic matter were measured on discrete samples. Spectral reflectance at the surface was measured with a handheld spectroradiometer. Image preprocessing included increasing the instrument signal-to-noise ratio by filtering to reduce patterned noise and spatial resampling, and application Of LOWTRAN-7 as an atmospheric correction. Several analyses were then performed illustrating the utility of the AVIRIS over a dark water scene. The water-leaving radiance measured by the AVIRIS compares very well with the upwelling radiance measured in-water, everywhere but in the very short wavelength channels. After recalibrating one AVIRIS channel, the chlorophyll concentration derived from the image compares extremely well with that measured with bottle samples. Application Of the pigment algorithm to the rest of the lake was confounded by covarying absorption at 440 nm by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), underscoring the importance Of accurate calibration Of the instrument in the short-wavelength channels. Surface spectroradiometer measurements made along a transect Of varying depth were used to condition a multiple linear regression bathymetry model. By applying the model coefficients to a portion of the image, a bathymetry map of the shallow parts of the lake was constructed which compares favorably with published lake soundings, indicating the potential for a bottom-reflectance correction to coastal ocean color imagery.

TI SPECTRAL BAND SELECTION FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF SALINITY STATUS OF
   SOILS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Reflectance spectra of salt-affected surface soil samples have been measured at 10 nm spectral resolution between 495 nm and 2395 nm. The samples were collected in California (41) and in Hungary (49) to compare the effect of different salinization and alkalization processes on reflectance properties. The data set consisted of 272 spectra having 2-12 cases (repetitions) for each sample Sixteen classes were defined based on chemical soil properties, accounting for changes in pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), of which 12 were represented in the sample. The reflectance data set was statistically analyzed using a modified stepwise principal component analysis (MSPCA) approach to select 1, 2, 3, . . . bands for classification of salinity status. Recognition of the above described classification was tested by discriminant function analysis (DFA). Its results can be applied in further studies for weighing spectral bands according to their sensitivity to the chosen classification as well as in defining broad, but still potentially sufficient bands. Recognition accuracy of salinity status was 91%, 90%, and 88% with 10 nm, 20 nm, and 40 nm bands, respectively, for the entire data set. Comparison with PCA using all bands showed only slight differences. The California soil samples had more distinct spectral characteristics than the Hungarian ones. Key spectral ranges were identified in the visible (550-770 nm), near-infrared (900-1030 nm, 1270-1520 nm), and middle infrared (1940-2150 nm, 2150-2310 nm, 2330-2400 nm) portion of the spectrum at 20 nm, 40 nm, and 80 nm spectral resolution. Two of these (1270-1520 nm and 1940-2150 nm) cannot be used with satellite data due to water vapor absorption in the atmosphere. In addition, six broad bands in these ranges were identified, leading to considerably higher overall accuracy than currently available Landsat MSS, TM, and SPOT XS, in terms of spectral recognition of salinity status.

TI USING LANDSAT-5 THEMATIC MAPPER AND DIGITAL ELEVATION DATA TO DETERMINE
   THE NET-RADIATION FIELD OF A MOUNTAIN GLACIER
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

ID SNOW; REFLECTANCE; ALBEDO; SLOPES; MODEL
AB An accurate evaluation of glacier energy balance requires a precise knowledge of surface-cover albedo and emittance. Usually these values are acquired from field measurements. However, the microclimatological effects in mountainous terrain greatly limit the potential for spatial extrapolation of such a set of values. This study overcomes the problem by using the upward radiance values registered on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and information on the geometry of the terrain extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM). Studies were performed in the Athabasca Glacier basin, one of the major glacier outlets of the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The methodology is composed, first, of an automated procedure for the physiographic description of the glacierized basin (cover type, elevation, slope, aspect, horizon profiles, sky-view factor, and the level of enclosing topography) in order to calculate the effects of topography on the radiation balance for each 30 m pixel. Because glacier surface covers usually have high reflective behaviors or distinct emission patterns, this study puts special emphasis on modelling the amount of terrain-reflected or terrain-emitted radiation received on a particular surface. Second, the topographic correction is applied to values of irradiance computed using the LOWTRAN-6 code, a spectrally based radiative transfer model, and atmospheric radiosonde measurements of the vertical temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity profiles. The measured upward radiance values from TM, corrected for path effects, are used to calculate surface-cover albedo and brightness temperature. Third, the daily net radiation field for snow and ice covers is computed to illustrate the contribution of the estimated surface radiative parameters to the glacier snow-and-ice melt analysis. The results show that the irradiance values are accurately modelled within 10% of the radiation values acquired from a field pyranometer. The calculated glacial surface-cover reflectance and albedo values compare favorably to published information, whereas the measured surface brightness temperature is well within the expected range of values.

LA English
DT Article
ID LEAF
AB To assess the adequacy of remote and conventional agricultural surveys, aircraft spectrometry of 20 commercial winter wheat fields was obtained in southern Moldova, CIS, and related to plant measurements using canonical correlation. Measurements were made over the 420-1200 nm range at intervals of 10 nm. A total of 510-575 reflectance spectra were obtained for each of the five phenophases studied and the extrema of the averaged curves of bidirectional reflectance factor (b(lambda)) were determined. The blue and red minima, as well as the relative maximum in the visible region, were positionally highly stable during the season (about 480 nm, 550 nm, and 670 nm, respectively). In the NIR region the b(lambda) curve rose smoothly between 750 nm and 1070 nm, and its steepness was probably determined by soil background reflectance. The values of b480, b550, b670, and b860 were the spectral variables chosen, and they were related, through canonical correlation analysis, to phytometric variables (dry above-ground phytomass, plant height, plant density, and percent plant cover) obtained from the corresponding ground-based agronomic measurements. There was a close relation between spectral and phytometric variables when the canopy was green (the first canonical correlation coefficient was 0.974 in the booting stage), but the closeness decreased with crop maturation. Canonical variables for spectral reflectance explained, at most, about 75% of the variance in phytometric variables while the first canonical variable for phytometric features accounted for 90% of the spectral variance. The NIR and red reflectances contributed most to canonical variables and had the highest correlations with the plant measurements. Among the phytometric variables, percent plant cover and dry above-ground phytomass related more closely to spectral reflectance than did plant height and plant density. On the whole, the results obtained confirm the high information potential of aircraft spectrometry for estimating winter-wheat crop conditions.

AB The problem of remote sensing the canopy photosynthetic and stomatal conductance efficiencies is investigated with the aid of one- and three-dimensional radiative transfer methods coupled to a semiempirical mechanistic model of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Desertlike vegetation is modeled as clumps of leaves randomly distributed on a bright dry soil with partial ground cover. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), canopy photosynthetic (E(p)), and stomatal efficiencies (E(s)) are calculated for various geometrical, optical, and illumination conditions. A base case is defined to investigate the dynamics of E(p) and E(s) with respect to ground cover, clump leaf area index, soil reflectance, and atmospheric conditions. The contribution of various radiative fluxes to estimates of E(p) is evaluated and the magnitude of errors in bulk canopy formulation of problem parameters are quantifieid. The nature and sensitivity of the relationship between E(p) and E(s) to NDVI is investigated and an algorithm is proposed for use in operational remote sensing.

AB A method of deriving in-flight calibration factors for Channels 1 and 2 of the AVHRR radiometer is described.  The technique utilizes the dual views of a selected area of the ocean obtained from consecutive satellite overpasses, coupled with a radiative transfer model whose aerosol properties are constrained by surface measurements.  The method is applied to a sample NOAA 11 data set obtained about 18 months after launch, and the sensitivity of the recovered calibration drift factors to uncertainties in the data and model parameters is examined.  Best estimates of the calibration factors, defined as the fractional sensitivity relative to the preflight calibration, are 0.75 +/- 0.04 in Channel 1 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 in Channel 2.  The Channel 2 result is subject to additional error due to uncertainty in the water vapor loading, and observational constraints on the water vapor profile will be necessary to ensure the success of the method in this channel.

ID SEA-SURFACE; INFRARED MEASUREMENTS; EMISSIVITY; SATELLITE
AB In this work, a theoretical model that permits relating the land surface temperature with the temperatures measured by thermal infrared sensors has been developed. The model has been derived by linearization of Planck's function and atmospheric transmittance. In this way a split-window equation is obtained, which depends on atmospheric water vapor, viewing angle, and channel surface emissivities. Simulations of satellite measurements of land surface temperatures are made using the atmospheric transmittance-radiance model LOWTRAN-7 for NOAA-11 AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. From these simulations the accuracies of linearizations have been checked. The dependence of the split-window coefficients on the aforementioned magnitudes has been analyzed. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the angular dependence can be avoided while the total water vapor dependence must be retained. Therefore, we have obtained a split-window equation for each atmosphere in which the emissivity dependence is linearized in terms of Channel 4 emissivity epsilon-4 and channel emissivity difference, epsilon-4-epsilon-5. The analysis of the emissivity influence shows that the emissivity measurement should be made with an accuracy of 0.005 in order to get an error below to 0.4 K on land surface temperature. Finally, two applications of the split-window method for obtaining sea surface temperature and crop temperatures have been included.

AB A SPOT satellite image covering the Gironde estuary turbid plume during a flood (flow > 2000 m3/s) is analyzed.  Radiometric data from the three SPOT channels are compared.  The findings show that the XS1 (500-590 nm) and SX2 (610-680 nm) channels are complementary for the study of the turbid plume structure; the XS1 channel shows variation ranges higher than XS2 for low radiometric values (low turbidity) and, conversely, the XS2 channel shows range variations higher than XS1 for high radiometric values.  The histogram and isocontours of a combination of the two channels (XS1 + XS2) shows the presence of four suspended sediment surface layers discharged over a 48-h period.  Two areas of clearer water are located on each side of the turbid plume.  They correspond to the lateral penetration of ocean water associated with tidal currents.  The XS2 channel variations are compared to the suspended matter concentration measurements.  Flux evaluations based on regression analysis are stated.  Uncertainty concerning the calibration of the satellite data and the thickness variations of the turbid plume cause a great deal of inaccuracy for the mass transported over a 48-h period.

TI STUDIES OF ERRORS IN FIELD-MEASUREMENTS OF THE BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE
   FACTOR
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID RADIOMETERS; CALIBRATION
AB Errors in the determination of the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) were studied in a measuring campaign in the desert using one radiometer, a sprayed barium sulfate panel as reference and solarimeters. The following sources of error were evaluated: (1) specific characteristics of instruments, (2) interpolations due to non-simultaneous measurement of panel and object, (3) optical properties of the panel and (4) dependence of panel reflectance on atmosphere. The most significant errors occurred if the solar zenith angle dependent reflectance of the panel was ignored. Moreover, the assumption that all irradiance is direct, was discovered to be an important source of error, in particular pertaining to panel reflectance at large solar zenith angles, at short wavelengths and non-lambertian panels. The use of simultaneous solarimeter readings when object measurements were taken under nonideal atmospheric conditions may be partly of help.

AB Accurate mapping of burned areas (BAs) is essential for post-disaster reconstruction, air quality assessment, and estimation of fire emissions. Remote sensing has become the most practical means to map global/regional BAs. Space-borne coarse-resolution (250-1000 m) BA products play an essential role in fire-related science and applications, but small BAs are typically poorly represented due to resolution limitations. Moderate-resolution (10-30 m) imagery provides a more detailed spatial extent of BAs, but the various disturbances (e.g., plant phenology, cloud shading, flooding, harvesting, grazing, pests, and diseases) make application on a global scale challenging. Here, we propose an automatic BA detection algorithm based on time series images acquired by the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Google Earth Engine. Specifically: (i) We determined an optimal set of spectral indices for MSI images based on global sampling to mitigate the background heterogeneity and BA spectral diversity. (ii) We jointly used three temporal scales, i.e., the single-temporal, dual-temporal, and short-time series MSI images, to identify potential BA regions (i.e., BA candidates). (iii) We integrated multisource active fire (AF) products derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Operational Land Imager (OLI), and MSI instead of singlesource products to refine BA candidates. (iv) We constructed an interannual time series to improve the BA candidates not confirmed by AF products. The proposed BA detection method was applied to different land cover and regional scales, including forests, grasslands, savannas, shrublands, and croplands at the regional (scene) and national levels (Portugal). Validation and inter-comparison with similar products demonstrated that the proposed method is reliable: the Dice coefficient of our detection results was improved by -7% and - 9%, respectively, compared to the moderate-resolution BA products (e.g., LBA_CU for the conterminous United States and FireCCISFD20 for sub-Saharan Africa in 2019). These results suggest that the proposed method can accurately and automatically map BAs, providing a foundation for fire monitoring programs and climate change research.

AB The retrieval of downward shortwave radiation (DSR) with high spatiotemporal resolution and short latency is critical. It is the fundamental driving force of surface energy, carbon, and hydrological circulations, and a key energy source for photovoltaic electricity. However, existing methods face significant challenges owing to cloud heterogeneity and their reliance on other satellite-derived products, which hinder the retrieval of accurate and timely DSR with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the spectral features used in traditional approaches, deep learning (DL) can incorporate the spatial and temporal features of satellite data. This study developed and compared three DL methods, namely the DenseNet, the bidirectional gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (BiGRUnor), and the convolutional neural network with gated recurrent unit without surface albedo as inputs (CNNGRUnor). These methods were used to estimate DSR at 1 km and 10/15 min resolutions directly from top-of-atmosphere reflectance over the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard GOES-16 coverage, achieving high accuracies. The instantaneous root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE for the three models were 68.4 (16.1%), 69.4 (16.3%), and 67.1 (15.7%) W/m2, respectively, which are lower than the baseline machine learning method, the multilayer perceptron model (MLP), with RMSE at 76.8 W/m2 (18.0%). Hourly accuracies for the three DL methods were 58.6 (14.1%), 57.8 (14.0%), and 57.3 (13.8%) W/m2, which are within the DSR RMSEs that we estimated for existing datasets of the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) (88.8 W/m2, 21.4%) and GeoNEX (77.8 W/m2, 18.8%). The study illustrates that DL models that incorporate temporal information can eliminate the need for surface albedo as an input, which is crucial for timely monitoring and nowcasting of DSR. Incorporating spatial information can enhance retrieval accuracy in overcast conditions, and incorporating infrared bands can further improve the accuracy of DSR estimation.

AB Coastal salt marshes suffering from anthropogenic coastal development and sea level rise have attracted much attention because of their capacity for carbon sequestration and global climate change mitigation. Accurate mapping of coastal salt marshes is always the first step for their protection, management, and restoration. The inherent complexities of vegetation, dynamics of tides, and anthropogenic disturbances pose challenges for remote sensing-based approaches. Existing studies have utilized phenology information and various black-box algorithms to reduce misclassifications. However, the approaches with dual-temporal images containing phenology information have suffered from inefficiency; the misclassifications have been objectively postprocessed rather than considered in the method design, and the tacit knowledge of the trained black-box models has not been revealed. To address the above issues, we proposed a new approach with solid improvements in dual-temporal image construction, misclassification processing, and tacit knowledge analysis, including an efficient method to synthesize dual-temporal images based on the common divisor of the green-up season or senescence season resulting from latitudinal gradients in narrow coastal areas of China, a detailed classification scheme by interpretation of iteratively collected samples, and a key decision rule approximating the trained model. We applied the approach to Sentinel-1/2 images and DEM data, thus deriving a 10-m resolution coastal salt marsh map of China with an overall accuracy of 92.5%. A qualitative comparison showed that the map produced in this study was fitted well with actual salt marsh distributions, resulting in improved accuracy when compared to recently generated maps. The most important contribution is that the overall nature of the trained model observed from the training samples was approximated by a four-feature decision rule following the principle of explainable artificial intelligence, i.e., B8senescence/B4senescence < 2.06 & B4green/B8green < 0.78 & B12green/B11green < 0.72 & elevation < 2.13, and thus established a new potential classification mechanism for dual-temporal black-box algorithms, i.e., the water signal was covered up by flourishing vegetation, but the situation changed when vegetation withered. This study not only generates an accurate coastal salt marsh map at a national scale but also provides a classification mechanism for dual-temporal image-based coastal salt marsh identification and mapping.

AB Animals select habitat at multiple spatial scales, suggesting that biodiversity modeling, for example of species richness, should be based on environmental data gathered at multiple spatial scales, and especially multiple grain sizes. Different satellite sensors collect data at different spatial resolutions and therefore provide opportunities for multi-grain habitat measures. The dynamic habitat indices (DHIs), which are derived from satellite data, capture patterns of vegetative productivity and predict bird species richness well. However, the DHIs have only been analyzed at single resolutions (e.g., 1-km), and have not yet been derived from high-resolution satellite data (< 10-m). Our goal was to predict bird species richness based on measures of vegetation productivity (DHIs, NDVI median and NDVI percentile 90th) across a range of spatial resolutions both from different sensors, and from resampled high-resolution imagery. We analyzed bird species richness within 215 forest, grassland and shrubland plots (56.25 ha) located at 26 terrestrial field sites of the National Ecology Observatory Network (NEON), in the continental US. To obtain our multi-resolution measures of vegetation productivity, we acquired data from Planetscope (3-m), RapidEye (5-m), Sentinel-2 (10-m), Landsat-8 (30-m) and MODIS (250-m) from 2017 to 2020, generated time series of NDVI, calculated the three DHIs (cumulative, minimum and variation), NDVI median and the 90th percentile NDVI and calculated 1st and 2nd order texture measures. We evaluated the performance of the derived measures to predict bird species richness of habitat specialist guilds based on (i) univariate models (ii) multivariate models with single-resolution measures and (iii) multivariate models with multi-resolution measures. Single-spatial resolution measures predicted bird species richness moderately well (R2 up to 0.51) and the best performing spatial resolution and measure differed among bird species guilds. High -spatial resolution (3-5 m) measures outperformed medium-resolution measures (10-250 m). Models for all guilds performed best when incorporating multiple resolutions, including for all species richness (R2 = 0.63) and for forest (R2 = 0.72), grassland (R2 = 0.53) and shrubland specialists (R2 = 0.46). In addition, models based on multi-resolution data from different sensors performed better than models based on resampled high-resolution data for any of the guilds. Our results highlight, first, the value of the DHIs derived from high-resolution sat-ellite data to predict bird species richness and, second, that remotely-sensed vegetation productivity measures from multiple spatial resolutions offer great promise for quantifying biodiversity.

AB Interferometry of Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can potentially contribute to the cost-effective regional or global monitoring of the degradation and restoration of peatlands. However, there are uncertainties about the links between InSAR results and peatland ecohydrological parameters, especially soil moisture. Here, we analyse the relationships between the temporal evolutions of InSAR coherence, ground displacements, and in-situ soil moisture measurements for a temperate raised bog at Ballynafagh, Co. Kildare, Ireland, in the period 2017-mid2021. We also investigate the effects of a wildfire in June-July 2019 on those relationships. InSAR-derived ground displacements from Sentinel-1 C-band radar data indicate long-term subsidence of the intact and Active Raised Bog. Superimposed on the long-term displacement trends are annual oscillations that are linked to variations in rainfall and temperature and that are in phase with changes in soil moisture. We show that InSAR coherence is directly related to the change in soil moisture, with large changes causing coherence decrease or loss. The wildfire removed a 10-20 cm thick mossy vegetation layer across 60-70% of the intact bog area. The SAR backscatter intensity in VV polarisation increased after the wildfire, but the InSAR coherence, the InSARderived surface displacements and the soil moisture were not noticeably affected. We therefore infer that Cband radar waves attenuate in the active vegetation layer, but penetrate through it into the upper few cm of the underlying peat. The SAR backscatter occurs primarily at this level in the peat, where its coherence is controlled by the soil moisture. These findings underpin application and interpretation of radar for monitoring of peatlands, even if affected by wildfires, which are forecast to increase in both frequency and intensity due to global warming.

TI Near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance by fusion of

AB The ability to detect forest disturbance rapidly relies heavily on the frequency of usable satellite observations. Combining optical and SAR data can provide the most usable observations in the tropics and hence has the potential to achieve more timely detection of forest disturbance than using any individual sensor system. A new algorithm (Fusion Near Real-Time, or FNRT) for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance by fusion of Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 data fits a time series model to the data of each individual sensor system and produces a change score for each clear observation during the monitoring period. The change scores from the three different kinds of sensors are then combined for disturbance monitoring. Applying FNRT using all three data sources in eight selected sites in the Amazon Basin detected 69.8 & PLUSMN; 5% and 84.6 & PLUSMN; 4.1% of the forest disturbances within the first 30 and 60 days, respectively. FNRT using all three sensors reached a peak producer's accuracy of 91.6 & PLUSMN; 3.2% at approximately a 100-day lag time, compared to 86.4 & PLUSMN; 3.8% using the two optical sensors combined, and 71.7 & PLUSMN; 4.7% using Landsat only (the best-performing single-sensor). The user's accuracy of FNRT using all three sensors increased to 90.9 & PLUSMN; 3.3% when excluding false detections in non-forest areas. Overall, the model result using all three data sources had the highest detection rate with shorter lag times. Although modest, including Sentinel-1 data in the multi-sensor fusion approach improved the detection speed of some disturbance events. Given the abundance of optical data during the dry season in our study region, Sentinel1 data would be more valuable during the wet season or in persistently cloudy regions such as Madagascar or coastal West Africa.

AB Information on forest structure is vital for sustainable forest management. Currently, airborne LiDAR remote sensing has been well established as an effective tool to characterize the structure of canopies and forest in-ventory variables. Radiometry and geometry are highly intertwined in LiDAR remote sensing of forest vegetation and phenology influences the geometric-optical properties of deciduous and evergreen trees causing seasonal variation in LiDAR observations. This variation may be considered as a nuisance or exploited in for example tree species identification. Airborne LiDAR data are also influenced by sensor functioning, acquisition settings, scan geometry and the atmosphere. Reliable estimation of subtle phenological effects calls for data in which the impact of the external factors is minimal. We experimented with such data and explored LIDAR waveforms (WFs) in boreal trees in winter, early summer and late summer. Our objectives were to i) assess the match of the multitemporal LiDAR data for observing true changes in vegetation; ii) quantify the influence of phenology in deciduous and evergreen trees; iii) study the effect of varying scan zenith angle (SZA) and canopy age on WF features in different phenostates; iv) assess the temporal feature correlation in individual living and dead standing trees. A WF-recording pulsed LiDAR sensor unit operating at the wavelength of 1550 nm was used in repeated acquisitions. WF attributes such as energy, peak amplitude and echo width were derived for each pulse and were localized vertically to crown, understory and ground components. Silver and downy birch, black alder, European aspen, Siberian larch, Scots pine, Norway spruce and dead standing spruce formed our strata. Results showed that phenology caused more variation in WF features of deciduous trees compared to evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees displayed substantial between-species variation that was linked with differences in branching pattern, leaf orientation and bark reflectance. Pine displayed a possible winter-early summer anomaly in canopy backscattering that may be linked with changes in foliage clumping or with the role of stamens in early summer trees. Trees displayed positive temporal correlation in WF features and correlations were the strongest in evergreen and deciduous conifers and decreased with time. SZA had minor influence on WF features whereas age exercised a strong effect on many features with parallel variation between species and phenostates. Structural changes following death, i.e. 'aging' changed the geometric WF features of dead standing trees. Our results provide new insights for enhancing tree species identification by using WF LiDAR and for LiDAR time-series analysis of vegetation.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; METAANALYSIS
AB One of the most important major driving forces behind climate change and environmental issues that the Earth is currently facing is the pollution of the air which remains a key symptom of negative human influence on the environment. Air pollution is often invisible to the eye which can make its detection challenging, unlike the destruction of the land or waterways. Given that air-quality monitoring stations are typically ground-based, their abilities to detect pollutant distributions are often restricted to wide areas. Satellites, however, have the potential for studying the atmosphere at large; the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus project satellite, "Sentinel-5P"is a newly launched satellite capable of measuring a variety of pollutant information with publicly available data outputs. This paper seeks to create a multi-modal machine learning model for predicting air-quality metrics with high precision so that it will be applicable to locations where monitoring stations do not exist. The inputs of this model will include a fusion of ground measurements and satellite data with the goal of highlighting pollutant distribution and motivating change in societal and industrial behaviours. A contemporary method for fusing satellite information with pollution measurements is studied, suggesting that simpler models can work as effectively as neural network models that are constructed with state-of-the-art architectures. A new dataset of continental European pollution monitoring station measurements is created with features including altitude, population density, environmental classification of local areas, and satellite data from the ESA Copernicus project. This dataset is used to train a multi-modal ML model, Air Quality Network (AQNet) capable of fusing these various types of data sources to output predictions of various pollutants. These predictions are then aggregated to create an "air-quality index" that could be used to compare air quality over different regions. Three pollutants, NO2, O3, and PM10, are predicted successfully by AQNet and the network was found to be useful compared to a model only using satellite imagery. It was also found that the addition of supporting tabular data improves predictions. When testing the developed AQNet on out-of-sample data of the UK and Ireland, we obtain satisfactory estimates though on average pollution metrics were roughly overestimated by around 20%.

AB Building height is a crucial variable in the study of urban environments, regional climates, and human -environment interactions. However, high-resolution data on building height, especially at the national scale, are limited. Fortunately, high spatial-temporal resolution earth observations, harnessed using a cloud-based platform, offer an opportunity to fill this gap. We describe an approach to estimate 2020 building height for China at 10 m spatial resolution based on all-weather earth observations (radar, optical, and night light images) using the Random Forest (RF) model. Results show that our building height simulation has a strong correlation with real observations at the national scale (RMSE of 6.1 m, MAE = 5.2 m, R = 0.77). The Combinational Shadow Index (CSI) is the most important contributor (15.1%) to building height simulation. Analysis of the distribution of building morphology reveals significant differences in building volume and average building height at the city scale across China. Macau has the tallest buildings (22.3 m) among Chinese cities, while Shanghai has the largest building volume (298.4 108 m3). The strong correlation between modelled building volume and socio-economic parameters indicates the potential application of building height products. The building height map developed in this study with a resolution of 10 m is open access, provides insights into the 3D morphological characteristics of cities and serves as an important contribution to future urban studies in China.

AB We investigate the geometric/kinematic characteristics of faulting a triplet of Mw -6 earthquakes (E1, E2, and E3) in Kerman province, Central Iran, over twelve days in December 2017. A geodetic framework is implemented and combined with seismic and geological methods to provide an integrated model of faulting within the sequence. To retrieve coseismic displacements in the complex and high-gradient near-field area, an adaptive method is proposed based on image-alignment techniques applied to both SAR (Sentinel-1) and optical data (PlanetScope). A continuous deformation map is created by combining interferometric and pixel offset tracking results through principal component analysis. We jointly invert the geodetic data, including along-and across-track displacement maps, through a constraint-based Bayesian inversion process to optimize the source pa-rameters of the causative faults. The results reveal that the NE-dipping nodal planes, with variable slip peaks of 63 and 17.5 cm at depths of 5.5 and 9.1 km, best fit the data for the E1 and E2 events, respectively, whereas the E3 event was on a SW-dipping fault plane including -E- and NW-striking segments. The E3 plane was shallow with maximum slip of 1.2 m at a depth of 2.2 km. We relocate 93 events and use the InSAR slip distributions as constraints to indirectly calibrate the epicenter of the earthquake cluster, and obtain the local stress state from the inversion of the focal mechanism solutions of the ten largest events of the Hojedk cluster. The resultant compressional stress explains the dextral and sinistral components found on the western and eastern segments of the E3 rupture, respectively. All together suggest a NW-striking pop-up structure in a restraining stepover be-tween the -N-striking dextral Lakarkuh and Golbaf-Sirch-Gowk fault systems. This structural model highlights the interaction between thick-skinned and thin-skinned seismic deformation within Iran.

AB Soil surface roughness in the U.S. Corn Belt varies outside of the growing season due to rainfall and soil management activities such as tillage. This is not consistent with the assumption that roughness is a static parameter in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture retrieval algorithm. SMAPVEX16-IA, an extensive field campaign focused on calibration of SMAP retrievals in croplands, occurred during a period when roughness is theoretically at a minima. Satellite-scale measurements of rms height and correlation length collected via pinboard, gridboard, and lidar methodologies resulted in a ensemble of model roughness coefficients that, at h = [0.13, 0.97], is significantly rougher than the original SMAP assumption in croplands of h = 0.108. Comparing simulated brightness temperatures using the ensemble h to SMAP observations resulted in a best-fit angular sensitivity coefficient of N = -2 for both horizontal and vertical polarizations. Satellite-scale h is then retrieved for a four-year study period (excluding growing seasons) via the single channel algorithm from SMAP brightness temperatures and in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature. Roughness retrievals are highly variable in the spring as rainfall events decrease h followed by an increase during soil dry-down; h steadily increases in the fall post-harvest as fields are tilled across the network. Retrievals of h are effectively independent of polarization and demonstrate the potential to simultaneously retrieve soil moisture and roughness in the absence of crops. These soil roughness retrievals could provide new information on tillage and other soil management activities.

AB This study evaluates the performance of convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of water bodies in very high-resolution satellite and aerial images from multiple sensors with particular focus on flood emergency response applications. Different model architectures (U-Net and DeepLab-V3+) are combined with encoder backbones (MobileNet-V3, ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B4) and tested for their ability to delineate inundated areas under varying environmental conditions and data availability scenarios. An unprecedented reference dataset of 1120 globally sampled images with quality checked binary water masks is introduced and used to train, validate and test the models for water body segmentation. Furthermore, independent test datasets are developed to test the generalization ability of the trained models across regions, sensors (IKONOS, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3 and four different airborne camera systems) and tasks (normal water and flood water segmentation). Results indicate that across all tested scenarios a U-Net model with Mobilenet-V3 backbone pretrained on ImageNet performs best. While using R-G-B image bands performs well, adding the near infrared band (if available) slightly improves prediction results. Similarly, adding slope information from an independent digital elevation model increases accuracies. Train-time augmentation and contrast enhancement could improve transferability across sensors and in particular between satellite and aerial images. Moreover, adding noisy training data from freely available online resources could further improve performance with minimal annotation effort.

AB High complexity and variability in composition of water constituents pose major challenges for development of algorithms to estimate biogeochemical data products from optical observations over the continuum of diverse aquatic environments. To address these challenges, we examined an adaptive optical approach that accounts for variability in composition of suspended particulate matter. We use the ratio of particulate organic carbon to suspended particulate matter concentration, POC/SPM, for optically discriminating water bodies with varying proportions of organic and mineral particles. Through the analysis of field data from the western Arctic seas that exhibit a broad range of water composition and optical properties, we developed empirical algorithms to estimate SPM and POC/SPM either from the particulate inherent optical properties (IOPs) of seawater, i.e., the spectral particulate absorption ap(lambda) or backscattering bbp(lambda) coefficients, or directly from the spectral remotesensing reflectance of the ocean, Rrs(lambda). The capability to retrieve POC/SPM from optical measurements was used to formulate the particle composition-specific algorithms for estimating POC from particulate IOPs or Rrs(lambda). The evaluation of algorithms with the development field dataset demonstrates that the algorithm formulations accounting for changes in POC/SPM provide significant improvements in POC estimates along the continuum of optically-complex Arctic waters compared with algorithms that do not account for variations in particulate composition, such as the current standard POC algorithm used for global satellite applications. The results of example application of the particle composition-specific algorithm and standard global algorithm to satellite observations are consistent with comparisons of these algorithms for our field dataset, which supports a conclusion that the standard algorithm tends to overestimate POC in Arctic waters that exhibit a broad range of particle composition. Although this study demonstrates the adaptive approach using data from the Arctic region, it has broader significance and is amenable to further enhancements by including other optically-derivable water constituent properties. Further validation analyses and efforts are needed towards a unified approach with improved representation of cause-and-effect relationships between water composition and optical properties to enable improved optically-based applications across a wide range of water bodies.

   Elevation-correlated deformation
ID SURFACE DEFORMATION; MODEL; SAR; COMPENSATION; ALGORITHM
AB Tropospheric delay is a major limiting factor in ground displacement retrieval using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Such delays are caused by the variations of pressure, temperature, and humidity of the troposphere, potentially leading to elevation-dependent phases in interferograms. The atmospheric heterogeneity makes the phase-elevation dependence vary in both space and time, posing challenges on empirical models that estimated the elevation-topography relationship in empirically predefined windows interferogram by interferogram. Moreover, the portion of the deformation that is correlated with topography can be mistaken as tropospheric delays and therefore degrade the performance of linear regression between the tropospheric phase and the elevation. The effectiveness of these methods is further limited by the requisite knowledge presumed of the user, particularly with regard to how to divide the scene and which observation model is suitable. These limitations make reliable isolation of tropospheric delay challenging. We present here a novel approach that combines tropospheric delay, deformation and possible topographic error to a joint model, enabling a precise separation of tropospheric delay. The rationale is rooted in the distinct temporal dependencies of these parameters. To avoid empirical setting of segmentation windows, we employ quadtree to adaptively control the spatial variability of tropospheric properties. We validate the proposed method at two volcanic areas, Bali and Hawaii, where tropospheric delay presents notable variability coupled with elevation-correlated deformation signals. Both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data over the island of Bali show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional ones. The misfit standard deviation (STD) is reduced by similar to 50% at the island of Bali, where elevation-correlated deformation is simulated according to a predefined model. More impressively, at the island of Hawaii, the misfit STD between InSAR and ground truth (i.e., GPS displacements) decreases from 25.1 to 4.5 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in reducing the spatially variable tropospheric delay while preserving the elevation-correlated deformation signal.

AB Tropospheric ozone (O3) profiles, especially within the boundary layer, are essential for studying the vertical, temporal, spatial variations, as well as the formation sensitivity and regional transport of O3. However, it is rare to find continuous tropospheric O3 profiles with high temporal and spatial resolutions without blind areas using current remote sensing technologies, with issues such as low near-surface sensitivity or systematic blind areas from satellite and LiDAR observations, respectively, being encountered. In this study, multi-source data including stratospheric O3 profiles from external datasets and local monthly dependent a priori profiles were fused in the retrieval algorithm, then vertical O3 profiles from the near-surface to the free troposphere were retrieved from multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. With the aim of deriving a set of best practice recommendations for applying a profile inversion algorithm to long-term observations, we comprehensively investigated the influence of various settings on profile retrieval, with emphasis on the selection of a Fraunhofer reference spectrum and appropriate a priori profiles in the upper troposphere. These recommendations are essential for applying the algorithm to real long-term measurements. In this study, tropospheric O3 profiles were retrieved for operational MAX-DOAS observations in Beijing, and the results, especially for the boundary layer, were evaluated in detail with respect to well-established independent O3 datasets, including one-year ozonesonde profiles and tower-based in-situ measurements at different altitudes. A good level of agreement was found for both near-surface and elevated-altitude results, and the MAX-DOAS O3 profiles were able to reproduce the vertical distributions measured by ozonesonde. However, MAX-DOAS measurements are less sensitive to the upper troposphere and converge to the a priori profile, and the smoothing effect induced by the optimal estimation method makes it difficult to reproduce steep vertical gradients in real atmosphere.

AB The increasing frequency of forest disturbances caused by climate change has highlighted the importance of understanding the entire process of disturbance, from its onset to forest recovery. Many previous studies have used multispectral Landsat time-series data describing forest dynamics. However, there is a lack of studies using thermal imagery, which may provide information about bio-climatic changes and energy balance during the forest disturbance and recovery. Our objective in this research was to detect the main features of insect forest disturbance and subsequent forest recovery (disturbance duration, disturbance severity, recovery duration) using thermal Landsat imagery. We also aimed to determine the relationship between the identified thermal features and topography. The study area was a Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) dominated forest located in a Central European border region between the Czech Republic (Sumava Mountains) and Germany (Bavarian Forest). For more than three decades, forests in this area have experienced widespread defoliation due to the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We determined the forest's surface temperature (ST) between 1985 and 2015 from thermal Landsat time-series data and then normalized it (STn) to be comparable across the years in question. We plotted thermal trajectories for this period and then clustered them based on their variances. The resulting thermal trajectories well described both disturbance and recovery, showing a rise in the STn during the onset of the disturbance, the severity, and a decrease during recovery. The mean disturbance duration was 8.44 years (SD = +/- 3.775), with a maximum severity as indicated by the STn of 4.92 (SD = +/- 1.5) and a duration of 12.84 years (SD = +/- 3.38) until 50% recovery and 17.85 years (SD = +/- 1.74) until 80% recovery. Clustering of the thermal trajectories revealed clusters with similar year-groups of bark beetle attack and a spatially aggregated pattern closely related to topography. Severity showed a positive correlation with altitude, whereas the spatially aggregated patterns of disturbance and recovery duration can be attributed to more complex topographical characteristics. Our study demonstrates the ability of thermal infrared imagery to provide highly relevant data for assessing not only the main features of forest disturbance and recovery, but also bio-climatic canopy functions in terms of topography and other environmental variables.

AB Grassland ecosystems are under threat globally, primarily due to land-use and land-cover changes that have adversely affected their biodiversity. Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant alpha-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in -situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant alpha-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m x 60 m, 120 m x 120 m, 180 m x 180 m, and 240 m x 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyper -spectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypoth-esis-i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity-to estimate alpha-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity-a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species-but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant alpha-diversity of 60 m x 60 m or 120 m x 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine-and coarse -resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally -assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration's Surface Biology and Geology mission.

AB Two space-borne LiDAR missions (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, GEDI; Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2, ICESat-2) have unique advantages in retrieving forest heights. Fusing these two missions will greatly increase the number of forest height samples and realize their geographical complementarity, providing unprecedented opportunities for global forest height mapping. However, ICESat-2 and GEDI use different LiDAR technologies, which may lead to inconsistencies in the forest height estimation between the two missions. This study aims to explore the potential of obtaining consistent forest heights from ICESat-2 and GEDI data in support of global forest height mapping. First, the accuracies of GEDI and ICESat-2 forest heights in four different scenarios (nigh/daytime and strong/weak beam) were validated and compared utilizing airborne LiDAR data. Second, we quantitatively evaluated the differences in the forest heights derived from the GEDI and ICESat-2 data within their overlapping footprints and analyzed the effects of the terrain slope, forest coverage, forest type and study site on these differences. Third, the forest height consistency models were built based on GEDI-derived forest heights and ICESat-2 feature parameters using stepwise regression (SR) and random forest (RF) algorithms as well as a combination of both SR and RF algorithms. Finally, we evaluated the transferability of forest height consistency models to different forest types and study sites, and further analyzed the potential of building a universally consistent model. The results showed that the accuracies of both GEDI and ICESat-2 derived forest heights differ among four different scenarios, and the accuracy of forest heights extracted from GEDI data (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 2.99 m for power beams at night) is higher than that extracted from ICESat-2 data (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.62 m for strong beams at night) regardless of scenarios. The forest height differences exist between these two missions, and show an apparent change trend with increasing forest coverage. By establishing the consistency models, the forest height difference between GEDI and ICESat-2 can be reduced. Compared to the forest height consistency models built by SR or RF algorithms, the consistency models established by combining the RF and SR algorithms have higher accuracy (average R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 2.56 m for ATL08). Additionally, the consistency models developed specifically for one forest type or study site are less transferable, while a universal consistency model is applicable for various vegetation types and study sites. After building a universal consistency model based on both SR and RF algorithms, the consistent forest heights were obtained from GEDI and ICESat-2 data. Overall, this study demonstrates the possibility of combining different modes of space-borne LiDAR data to obtain consistent forest height datasets.

AB Active remote sensing by laser scanning (LiDAR) has markedly improved the mapping of a cave environment with an unprecedented level of accuracy and spatial detail. However, the use of laser intensity simultaneously recorded during the scanning of caves remains unexplored despite it having promising potential for lithological mapping as it has been demonstrated by many applications in open-sky conditions. The appropriate use of laser intensity requires calibration and corrections for influencing factors, which are different in caves as opposed to the above-ground environments. Our study presents an efficient and complex workflow to correct the recorded intensity, which takes into consideration the acquisition geometry, micromorphology of the cave surface, and the specific atmospheric influence previously neglected in terrestrial laser scanning. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated on terrestrial LiDAR data acquired in the Gouffre Georges, a cave located in the northern Pyrenees in France. The cave is unique for its geology and lithology allowing for observation, with a spectacular continuity without any vegetal cover, of the contact between marble and lherzolite rocks and tectonic structures that characterize such contact. The overall accuracy of rock surface classification based on the corrected laser intensity was over 84%. The presence of water or a wet surface introduced bias of the intensity values towards lower values complicating the material discrimination. Such conditions have to be considered in applications of the recorded laser intensity in mapping underground spaces. The presented method allows for putting geological observations in an absolute spatial reference frame, which is often very difficult in a cave environment. Thus, laser scanning of the cave geometry assigned with the corrected laser intensity is an invaluable tool to unravel the complexity of such a lithological environment.

AB Australia experienced multi-year drought and record high temperatures, and massive forest fires occurred across the southeast in 2019 and early 2020. In the fire-affected forest areas, understory and often tree canopies were burned, and in-situ observations in late 2020 reported rapid vegetation recovery, including grasses, shrubs, and tree canopies from burned-but-not-dead eucalyptus trees. Considering the strong fire resilience and resistance of eucalyptus trees and above-average rainfall in 2020, we assessed how much and how quickly vegetation structure and biomass changed from loss to post-fire and drought recovery in 2020 for all forest areas in Australia. Here, we analyzed space-borne optical, thermal, and microwave images to assess changes in the structure and function of vegetation using four vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), gross primary production (GPP), and aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that all eight variables show large losses in 2019, driven by fires and climate (drought and high temperature), but large gains in 2020, resulting from the high resilience of most trees to fire and rapid growth of understory vegetation under wet condition in 2020. In 2019, the forest area has an AGB loss of 0.20 Pg C, which is similar to 15% of the pre-fire AGB. Attribution analyses showed that both fire and climate (prior and co-occurring severe drought and record high temperatures) are responsible for the AGB loss in 2019, approximately 0.09 Pg C (fire) and 0.11 Pg C (climate), respectively. In 2020, the forest area has a total AGB gain of 0.26 Pg C, composed of 0.22 Pg C from fire-affected forest area and 0.04 Pg C from fire-unaffected forest area. Fire-adapted Eucalyptus forests and above-average annual precipitation in 2020 brought by a moderate La Nina drove the recovery of vegetation cover, productivity, and AGB. The results from this study shows the potential of multiple sensors for monitoring and assessing the impacts of fire and climate on the forest areas in Australia and their post-fire recovery.

AB Remote sensing-based approaches are important for evaluating ecosystem degradation and the efficient planning of ecosystem restoration efforts. However, the large majority of remote sensing-based degradation assessments are trend-based, implying that they can only detect degradation that occurred after medium or high-resolution satellite imagery became available. This makes them less suitable to map long-term degradation in ecosystems that have been under high human pressure since before. The main goal of this study was to develop a robust operational approach to map forest degradation status in heterogeneous landscapes with a long-standing degradation history to inform the planning of restoration interventions. We hereby use the tropical dry forests of Lambayeque, Peru, as a case study. Instead of using a trend-based assessment, we evaluated forest degradation status by comparing current woody cover (WC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates obtained from remote sensing imagery with benchmark values consisting of the 95th percentile WC and AGB values inside environmentally homogenous land capability classes. Using boosted regression tree models and a combination of optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data of different seasons, we mapped WC and AGB, using training data obtained through very high-resolution imagery and field measurements. Further, we aimed at assessing (i) whether the inclusion of Sentinel-1 data improves mapping accuracy in comparison to using only Sentinel-2 data, and (ii) whether the use of multi-seasonal data improves accuracy in comparison to single-season data. Models combining multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data resulted in the most accurate WC predictions (mean absolute error (MAE): 16%; MAE normalized by dividing by the inter-quartile range of training data: 26%) and AGB predictions (MAE: 28.6 t/ha; normalized MAE: 65%), but differences in predictive accuracy with single season models or models using only Sentinel-2 data were small. The most accurate models estimated an average WC of 41% and an average AGB of 23.4 t/ha. Average WC and AGB reduction due to degradation was 35% and 36%, respectively, indicating that these forests are highly degraded. The site-specific scaling of WC and AGB allows to efficiently estimate forest degradation status irrespective of the time when this degradation occurred, and to express degradation status against site-specific benchmarks. On the condition that there are still some areas that are sufficiently undegraded to be used as a benchmark, the approach can be used to prioritize forest restoration actions and inform targets for restoration in heterogeneous landscapes suffering the impacts of undocumented long-term degradation.

AB In order to study spatial patterns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its impact factors, consistent and area-wide information is essential. With TROPOMI aboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P), daily tropospheric NO2 observations have become available with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 3.5 km x 5.5 km. However, a systematic study of tropospheric NO2 patterns on a national scale and with preserved high spatial resolution is still pending. In addition, the increasing availability of area-wide, high-resolution data for large study areas presents new challenges for analyzing impact factors, such as spatial heterogeneity. Based on the annual mean tropospheric NO2 of Germany (September 2018 to August 2019) resampled to a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution, the subject of this study was twofold: on the one hand a hot and cold spot analysis was performed, on the other hand, nonmeteorological factors influencing tropospheric NO2 were investigated within spatial regimes of different land use / land cover (LU/LC) compositions. A total of 24 national hot spots were identified with the majority located in urban areas. The spatial regime-based impact factor analysis revealed that most correlation coefficients between LU/LC and tropospheric NO2 are highly dependent on the location. Some other factors, however, were found to have a strong impact on tropospheric NO2 independent of the location (impervious surfaces, population and road density). Although this study is based on tropospheric column data, and meteorology has not been considered yet, the analyses demonstrate the contribution of Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI data to a better understanding of the high-dimensional and complex relationship between NO2, the atmosphere and the composition of the land surface and its use.

AB The increased variety and availability of remotely sensed data from satellite and airborne platforms are expected to enhance data fusion approaches aimed at characterizing wildlife habitat. We investigated multisensor machine learning (ML) models to estimate desert grassland habitat suitability for a critically endangered species, the mask bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgewayi). Contemporary habitat conditions are marked by a history of intensive livestock grazing, periodic drought, and changes in arid land hydrology. Historical land use and vegetation changes were accompanied by altered disturbance regimes that once supported recurrent fire important to maintaining grassland composition and structure. Habitat assessment plots were combined with multidate and multispectral Worldview-3 (WV3) satellite imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) metrics to model habitat suitability on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR). We used regression and structural equation models (SEM) to assess fire history, climate, and site biophysical effects on habitat suitability from 239 vegetation plots stratified by topography and fire frequency. We found that combined WV3/LiDAR models improved suitability predictions and consistency over WV3-only models comparing the root mean squared and mean absolute error from training data. Hyperparameter tuning for ML habitat models further improved performance. Gradient boosted regression trees and WV3/LiDAR habitat suitability models showed superior performance and correspondence to independent field validation data (F = 92.7, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.57). Comparisons between predicted habitat suitability and fire history variables from 84 management units showed a significant negative relationship with increased fire frequency (F = 27.6, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.41) and positive relationship with time since last burn (F = 41.3, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.34). SEMs established that masked bobwhite habitat occurrence was strongly associated with site biophysical conditions that supported greater woody plant cover important for nesting, thermal, and predator protection. Our results suggest that desert grasslands associated with low primary productivity may require recovery periods in excess of 20 years to develop a desired mix of herbaceous and woody plant cover for masked bobwhite, when >= 2 fires have occurred over the last 30 years. Multiple sensor types provided a unique set of variables describing horizontal and vertical habitat structure and composition, essential to understanding fire effects on masked bobwhite habitat suitability. Combined information from active and passive remote sensing systems can likely enhance mapping and monitoring applications necessary for assessing recovery needs for numerous other wildlife species with diverse habitat requirements.

AB Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have significant ecological and economic impact at local and regional scales. Consequently, there is a pressing need to map the fine-scale temporal and spatial patterns of MHWs, for both historical and near real-time events. Satellite remote sensing of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) provides fundamental data for the mapping of MHWs. This study used high-resolution Himawari-8 SST and the Sea Surface Temperature Atlas of the Australian Regional Seas (SSTAARS) data, which have a spatial resolution of -2 km, to map recent and near real-time MHW events in waters around Australasia. The high-resolution MHWs mapping identified two broad areas of MHW hotspots that occurred between August 2015 and February 2019. The Tropical Warm Pool region (including the Great Barrier Reef and part of the Coral Sea) was affected by strong and prolonged MHW conditions for the greater part of 2016. The unusually strong 2015-16 El Nin similar to o event was believed to be the primary underlying driver for the MHWs, and the air-sea heat flux was likely the key local process controlling the heat budget. The south-east of the study area (including Australia's south-east coast, the Tasman Sea and New Zealand's east coast) suffered severe MHWs in 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The 2015-16 summer Bass Strait and East Tasmania MHW event was likely due to the anomalous heat transported by the East Australia Current. The air-sea heat flux, however, was likely an important local driver for the MHW events in the Tasman Sea during the 2016 autumn, the 2017-18 summer and the 2018-19 summer. The anomalous heat flux into ocean was attributed to potential underlying climate drivers including ENSO teleconnections, positive SAM and their interaction. This mapping has not only enhanced our understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of several previously documented MHWs, but also identified and mapped several previously undocumented MHWs. Two case studies in the Beagle Marine Park located in north-eastern Bass Strait and the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs situated -550 km east of the Australian coast within the Lord Howe Marine Park proved the value of Himawari-8 SST and SSTAARS data in mapping fine details of MHWs in a small area, which could not be captured by the broad-scale DOISST data. During the 2017-18 summer event, the case studies revealed much stronger MHW influence in the shallow waters east of the Beagle Marine Park where most of the important rocky reef habitats exist. During the same event, the case studies also confirmed more severe MHW impact on the Elizabeth Reef than the Middleton Reef which resulted in bleaching to selective coral species on the Elizabeth Reef. The near-real time MHWs mapping showed that both the GBR and the Coral Sea marine parks were experiencing MHW conditions in early March 2020, with most affected areas having strong MHW class.

AB A method for rectifying thermograms in perspective captured at human height is proposed. It applies to the image pixel-by-pixel corrections that account for the surface emissivity, the reflected longwave infrared radiation flux, and the radiation emitted and attenuated by the atmosphere. The results are validated in two steps: first by comparison with contact temperature devices and then by comparison with finite element simulations. They give satisfactory results in both cases. The method is illustrated on a canyon-type street located in a dense urban area during a winter period of 24 h. Detailed observation of urban facade surface temperatures opens up new perspectives. Indeed, it allows conclusions to be drawn about the energy behavior of inhabitants by offering a non-intrusive alternative for identifying urban thermal bridges. Furthermore, the combined use of measurement and simulation facilitates the exploration of the thermal and optical properties of the scene. This work contributes significantly to the interpretation of urban metering at human height. It provides essential improvements in the evaluation of errors associated with urban surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing observations.

AB Croplands, occupying approximately 13% of the Earth's land surface, can dramatically alter surface temperature via multiple biophysical processes. However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent croplands warm or cool the land surface globally. Here we present new evidence of the temperature effects of global croplands based on high-resolution satellite observations of land surface temperature (LST). We find general daytime warming and nighttime cooling of crop-dominated lands (cropland intensity >= 90%) relative to other vegetation cover, with net daily cooling in the arid zone and net daily warming in all other areas. On a per-pixel basis, however, nearly half of the crop-dominated lands cool daytime LST and/or warm nighttime LST. The temperature effects vary greatly by location and season. The per-pixel intensity can exceed 10 degrees C likely due to the changes in surface evapotranspiration, albedo, and background climate. By extending the LST changes of crop-dominated lands to the full land surface, we find that croplands make large contributions to regional and global land surface warming. Daytime warming can reach 0.56 degrees C in Europe during spring. Nationally, China, India, and Brazil lead the warming due to their large cropland areas and strong local climate effects. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the biophysical effects of croplands for projecting climate change and formulating adaptation and mitigation strategies.

AB The ability of a forest to buffer understory temperature extremes depends on the canopy structure, which is often measured from the ground. However, ground measurements provide only point estimates, which cannot be used for spatially explicit microclimate modeling. Canopy structures derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can overcome these limitations, but high point-density LiDAR is expensive and computationally challenging. Therefore, we explored whether unmanned aerial systems (UAS) processed with the structure-frommotion (SfM) algorithm could serve as an alternative source of canopy variables for forest microclimate modeling. Specifically, we compared the performance of the canopy cover and height derived from the ground measurements and passive (UAS-SfM) and active (UAS-LiDAR) remote sensing as predictors of air and soil temperature offsets (i.e. differences between the forest understory and treeless areas).
   We found that the maximum air temperatures were substantially lower inside than outside the forest, with differences ranging from 9.0 to 12.5 degrees C. The soil temperatures under the canopy were also reduced, but the soil temperature offsets were lower and ranged from 1.1 to 2.8 degrees C. The air and soil temperature offsets both increased with increasing tree height and canopy cover. However, the prediction ability of tree height and canopy cover differed if they were ground-based or remotely sensed. The remotely sensed canopy indices explained air temperature offsets better (UAS-SfM: R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.75 degrees C; UAS-LiDAR: R-2 = 0.57, RMSE = 0.76 degrees C) than ground measurements (R-2 = 0.51, RMSE = 0.80 degrees C). Ground-based metrics explained soil temperature offsets better (R-2 = 0.37, RMSE = 0.36 degrees C) than passive remote sensing approach (UAS-SfM: R-2 = 0.27, RMSE = 0.39 degrees C), but comparably to active one (UAS-LiDAR: R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.37 degrees C).
   Our results suggest that both UAS-SfM and UAS-LiDAR can substitute ground canopy measurements for air temperature modeling, but soil temperature modeling is more challenging. Overall, our results show that forest microclimate can be modelled at a very high spatial resolution using UAS equipped with inexpensive optical cameras. The increasingly available UAS-SfM approach can thus provide fine-resolution microclimatic data much needed for biologically relevant predictions of species responses to climate change.

AB Disturbances have increased in Central Europe's forests, but whether changes in disturbance regimes are driven by natural or human causes remains unclear. Satellite-based remote sensing provides an important data source for quantifying forest disturbance change. Separating causes of forest disturbance is challenging, however, particularly in areas such as Central Europe where disturbance patches are small and disturbance agents interact strongly. Here we present a novel approach for the causal attribution of forest disturbance agents and illustrate its utility for 1.01 million disturbance patches mapped from Landsat data in Austria for the period 1986-2016. We gathered reference data on 2620 disturbance patches by conducting targeted field observations and structured interviews with 21 forest managers. We developed a novel indicator class characterizing the landscape context of a disturbance patch (i.e., the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of disturbance patches on the landscape), and combined it with other predictor variables describing the spectral signal, topography, and patch form of each disturbance patch. We used these predictors to identify the causal agents for disturbances mapped in Austria using Random Forest classification. Landscape context was the most important predictor of disturbance agent, improving model performance by up to 26 percentage points. Wind, bark beetles and timber harvesting were separated with an overall accuracy of 63%. Bark beetle patches were most difficult to identify correctly (producer's accuracy = 15%, user's accuracy = 30%), while regular timber harvesting was classified with highest certainty (producer's accuracy = 68%, user's accuracy = 82%). Harvesting dominates the disturbance regime of Austria's forests, with 70.5% of the disturbed area (76.7% of the disturbed patches) attributed to human causes and 29.5% (23.3%) to natural causes (wind: 23.0% [14.8%], bark beetles: 6.5% [8.5%]). Increases in disturbance since 1986 were driven by natural causes, with wind increasing by 408% and bark beetles increasing by 99% between the first and the second half of the observation period. Wind-disturbed patches were also considerably larger than those caused by bark beetles and harvesting (+102% and + 67%, respectively). Our novel approach to mapping causal agents of forest disturbance, applicable also to highly complex and interactive disturbance regimes, provides an important step towards a comprehensive monitoring and management of forest disturbances in a changing world.

AB Wildfires are increasing in intensity and frequency across the globe due to climate change and rising global temperature. Development of novel approach to Monitor wildfire progressions in near real-time is therefore of critical importance for emergency responses. The objective of this research is to investigate continuous learning with U-Net by exploiting both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI time series for increasing the frequency and accuracy of wildfire progression mapping. In this study, optical-based burned areas prior to each SAR acquisition (when available) were accumulated into SAR-based pseudo progression masks to train a deep residual U-Net model. Unlike multi-temporal fusion of SAR and optical data, the temporal fusion of progression masks allows us to track as many wildfire progressions as possible. Specifically, two approaches were investigated to train the deep residual U-Net model for continuous learning: 1) Continuous joint training (CJT) with all historical data (including both SAR and optical data); 2) Learning without forgetting (LwF) based on newly incoming data alone (SAR or optical). For LwF, a mean squared loss was integrated to keep the capabilities learned before and prevent it from overfitting to newly incoming data only. By fusing optical-based burned areas, SAR-based progression pseudo masks improve significantly, which benefits both data sampling and model training, considering the challenges in SAR-based change extraction attributed to the variability in SAR backscatter of the surrounding environments. Pre-trained ResNet was frozen as the encoder of the U-Net model, and the decoder part was trained to further refine the derived burned area maps in a progression-wise manner. The experimental results demonstrated that LwF has the potential to match CJT in terms of the agreement between SAR-based results and optical-based ground truth, achieving a F1 score of 0.8423 on the Sydney Fire (2019-2020) and 0.7807 on the Chuckegg Creek Fire (2019). We also observed that the SAR cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) shows good capability in suppressing multiplicative noise and detecting burned areas when VH and VV have diverse temporal behaviors.

AB Remote imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral imaging, uses Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to predict the measured radiance spectrum for a specific surface and atmospheric state. Discrepancies between RTM assumptions and physical reality can cause systematic errors in surface property estimates. We present a statistical method to quantify these model errors without invoking ground reference data. Our approach exploits scene invariants - properties of the environment which are stable over space or time - to estimate RTM discrepancies. We describe techniques for discovering these features opportunistically in flight data. We then demonstrate data-driven methods that estimate the aggregate errors due to model discrepancies without having to explicitly identify the underlying physical mechanisms. The resulting distributions can improve posterior uncertainty predictions in operational retrievals.

AB Currently most global land cover maps are produced with discrete classes, which express the dominant land cover class in each pixel, or a combination of several classes at a predetermined ratio. In contrast, land cover fraction mapping enables expressing the proportion of each pure class in each pixel, which increases precision and reduces legend complexity. To map land cover fractions, regression rather than classification algorithms are needed, and multiple approaches are available for this task. A major challenge for land cover fraction mapping models is data sparsity. Land cover fraction data is by its nature zero-inflated due to how common the 0% fraction is. As regression favours the mean, 0% and 100% fractions are difficult for regression models to predict accurately. We proposed a new solution by combining three models: a binary model determines whether a pixel is pure; if so, it is processed using a classification model; otherwise with a regression model. We compared multiple regression algorithms and implemented our proposed three-step model on the algorithm with the lowest RMSE. We further evaluated the spatial and per-class accuracy of the model and demonstrated a wall-to-wall prediction of seven land cover fractions over the globe. The models were trained on over 138,000 points and validated on a separate dataset of over 20,000 points, provided by the CGLS-LC100 project. Both datasets are global and aligned with the PROBA-V 100 m UTM grid. Results showed that the random forest regression model reached the lowest RMSE of 17.3%. Lowest MAE (7.9%) and highest overall accuracy (72% ? 2%) was achieved using random forest with our proposed threemodel approach and median vote. This research proves that machine learning algorithms can be applied globally to map a wide variety of land cover fractions. Fraction mapping expresses land cover more precisely, and empowers users to create their own discrete maps using user-defined thresholds and rules, which enables customising the result for a diverse range of uses. The three-step approach is useful for addressing the zero-inflation issue and mapping 0% and 100% fractions more accurately, and thus has already been taken up in the operational production of global land cover fraction layers within the CGLS-LC100 project. Furthermore, this study contributes to the accuracy assessment of land cover fraction maps both thematically and spatially, and these methods could be taken up by future land cover fraction mapping efforts.

AB Predicting leaf traits using models based on spectroscopic data can provide essential information to advance ecological research and future Earth system models. Most current models are based on Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithms that attempt to predict a set of leaf traits of several plant groups using leaf spectra. However, PLSR models tend to be inconsistent in describing the importance of absorption features when used to predict leaf traits. Likewise, the effect of contrasting absorption features of different plant groups on the prediction and evaluation of PLSR models is not well understood. Hence, this study focuses on using wavelet spectra to overcome current PLSR?s limitation and improve leaf trait predictions. Specifically, we explored the use of visible?near-infrared (0.45?1.0 ?m) and mid- long-wave infrared spectra (2.55?11 ?m) to predict three-leaf traits of lianas and trees: Leaf Mass Area (LMA), Water Content (WC), and Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). We also compare the effect of life forms on the prediction of traits by using sun leaves collected from 14 liana species and 21 tree species (n = 700) from a Neotropical Dry Forest. On each leaf, reflectance measurements were performed for both selected spectral regions; then, leaf traits were estimated from a leaf segment. Leaf reflectance was first resampled and then processed using continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) to derive the wavelet spectra. PLSR models linking the leaf traits and the reflectance or wavelet spectra were compared. Our results reveal that PLSR models based on wavelet spectra require fewer components to predict traits (13?16) than those based on reflectance (25?29). In addition, PLSR models? performance (e.g., R2) of testing datasets tend to be higher for models based on wavelet spectra (LMA = 0.83; WC = 0.77; EWT = 0.68) than reflectance (LMA = 0.78; WC = 0.76; EWT = 0.49). Wavelet spectra models also seem to better characterize absorption features that drive the variability of leaf traits than models based on reflectance. However, life forms play an essential role in model performance, where the prediction of lianas? traits presenting lower R2 (R2 = 0.61 ? 0.25) than trees? traits (R2 = 0.69 ? 0.15) regardless of the type of spectra or leaf trait. Our findings highlight the use of wavelet spectra to overcome limitations of the PLSR models for predicting leaf traits and the need to explore potential bias associated with plant groups on the model evaluations.

AB Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a remotely sensed indicator characterizing the attenuation of the Earth's thermal emission at microwave wavelengths by the vegetation layer. At L-band, VOD is used to estimate the global biomass, a key component of the Earth's surface and of the carbon cycle. This study focuses on the behaviour of L-band VOD (L-VOD) retrieval algorithm over seasonally inundated areas, as some previous observations have shown an unexpected decline in VOD during flooding events. To analyse such variations, a passive microwave model was used to simulate the signal emitted by a mixed scene composed of soil and standing water. The retrieval over this inundated scene led to an overestimation of soil moisture (SM) and an underestimation of L-VOD. The phenomenon is more pronounced over grasslands than over forests, since low vegetation is mostly submerged under water and becomes invisible to the sensor; and since more standing water is visible to the sensor. The estimated L-VOD is typically reduced by similar to 10% over flooded forests and up to 100% over flooded grasslands. Such effects can distort the analysis of aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics based on L-VOD estimates. We evaluated that AGB can be underestimated by 15/20 Mg ha(-1) in the largest seasonal wetlands, which can represent more than 50% of the actual AGB of these fields, and up to higher values during exceptional meteorological years. Consequently, to better estimate the global biomass, surface water seasonality has to be taken into account in passive microwave retrieval algorithms.

AB For agricultural applications, identification of non-photosynthetic above-ground vegetation is of great interest as it contributes to assess harvest practices, detecting crop residues or drought events, as well as to better predict the carbon, water and nutrients uptake. While the mapping of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) is well established, current operational retrieval models are not calibrated for LAI estimation over senescent, brown vegetation. This not only leads to an underestimation of LAI when crops are ripening, but is also a missed monitoring opportunity. The high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (52) satellites constellation offers the possibility to estimate brown LAI (LAI(B)) next to green LAI (LAI(G)). By using LAI ground measurements from multiple campaigns associated with airborne or satellite spectra, Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models were developed for both LAI(G) and LAI(B), providing alongside associated uncertainty estimates, which allows to mask out unreliable LAI retrievals with higher uncertainties. A processing chain was implemented to apply both models to 52 images, generating a multiband LAI product at 20 m spatial resolution. The models were adequately validated with insitu data from various European study sites (LAI(G): R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 0.67 m(2)/m(2); LAI(B): R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.43 m(2)/m(2)). Thanks to the 52 bands in the red edge (B5: 705 nm and B6: 740 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (B12: 2190 nm) a distinction between LAI(G) and LAI(B) can be achieved. To demonstrate the capability of LAI(B) to identify when crops start senescing, 52 time series were processed over multiple European study sites and seasonal maps were produced, which show the onset of crop senescence after the green vegetation peak. Particularly, the LAI(B) product permits the detection of harvest (i.e., sudden drop in LAI(B)) and the determination of crop residues (i.e., remaining LAI(B)), although a better spectral sampling in the shortwave infrared would have been desirable to disentangle brown LAI from soil variability and its perturbing effects. Finally, a single total LAI product was created by merging LAI(G) and LAI(B) estimates, and then compared to the LAI derived from 52 L2B biophysical processor integrated in SNAP. The spatiotemporal analysis results confirmed the improvement of the proposed descriptors with respect to the standard SNAP LAI product accounting only for photosynthetically active green vegetation.

AB A major international effort has been made to monitor sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from space as a proxy for the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. However, the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the SIF retrievals from canopy radiance derived from images with medium and low spatial resolution remains uncharacterised. In images from forest and agricultural landscapes, the background comprises a mixture of soil and understory and can generate confounding effects that limit the interpretation of the SIF at the canopy level. This paper aims to improve the understanding of SIF from coarse spatial resolutions in heterogeneous canopies by considering the separated contribution of tree crowns, understory and background components, using a modified version of the FluorFLIGHT radiative transfer model (RTM). The new model is compared with others through the RAMI model intercomparison framework and is validated with airborne data. The airborne campaign includes high-resolution data collected over a tree-grass ecosystem with the HyPlant imaging spectrometer within the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) preparatory missions. Field data measurements were collected from plots with a varying fraction of tree and understory vegetation cover. The relationship between airborne SIF calculated from pure tree crowns and aggregated pixels shows the effect of the understory at different resolutions. For a pixel size smaller than the mean crown size, the impact of the background was low (R-2 > 0.99; NRMSE < 0.01). By contrast, for a pixel size larger than the crown size, the goodness of fit decreased (R-2 < 0.6; NRMSE > 0.2). This study demonstrates that using a 3D RTM model improves the calculation of SIF significantly (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.03 mW M-2 sr(-1) nm(-1)) when the specific contribution of the soil and understory layers are accounted for, in comparison with the SIF calculated from mixed pixels that considers only one layer as background (R-2 = 0.4, RMSE = 0.28 mW M-2 sr(-1) nm(-1)). These results demonstrate the need to account for the contribution of SIF emitted by the understory in the quantification of SIF within tree crowns and within the canopy from aggregated pixels in heterogeneous forest canopies.

AB Snow is a fundamental component of the climate system. It is also an important part of the planet's hydrological cycle. Accordingly, the investigation of its light scattering properties is essential for remote sensing applications employed in the estimation of changes in the current amount of snowpack. These wide-scale environmental changes are key indicators of future climate events affecting global sustainability. Viewed in this context, computational simulations of light interactions with snow can be used to increase the effectiveness-to-cost ratio of remote sensing initiatives in this area. More specifically, by enabling a controlled assessment of the effects of snow granular structure and composition parameters on its light reflection and transmission profiles, these simulations can be instrumental in the high-fidelity interpretation of data remotely acquired from snow-covered landscapes that pose sizable challenges for field work. In order to contribute to these interdisciplinary research efforts, this paper presents a novel light transport model for snow that can predictively simulate the spectral and spatial distributions of light interacting with this ubiquitous particulate material. While the former radiometric responses are quantified in terms of hyperspectral reflectance and transmittance, the latter are quantified in terms of BSDF (bidirectional scattering distribution function). The proposed model employs a first-principles simulation approach that accounts for the positional dependence of the scattered light in the quantification of its spatial distribution. Thus, this distribution can also be expressed in terms of BSSDF (bidirectional surface-scattering distribution function). The predictive capabilities of the proposed model are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated by comparing modeled results with measured data obtained from in situ experiments and phenomenological traits reported in the literature, respectively.

AB A method for the retrieval of soil freeze/thaw (F/T) state in the boreal forest region using SAR is presented in this paper. The method utilizes Sentinel-1 data and is thus suitable for continuous near real-time monitoring. The main challenge with the C-band VV-polarization signal is the sensitivity to vegetation and especially to forest canopies. A relatively simple zeroth-order model is used for the retrieval of the ground and the canopy backscatter contributions in 1 km cell size. These backscatter components are then used to identify the F/T state of the soil by comparing them to corresponding reference values representing frozen and thawed conditions. The classification algorithm is based on threshold values applied on the Euclidian distances between the retrieved backscatter and the reference values. The method is tested for three test areas across Finland, having different forest properties: Sodankyla, Nurmes and Tampere, located in northern, central and southern Finland, respectively. We first evaluated whether the use of canopy cover (CC) or stem volume (SV) as the parameter describing the forest conditions provide better model accuracy. We then assessed the Sentinel-1 based soil F/T estimates by comparing them to automatic in situ observations and the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) based soil F/T product. The model performance was generally better when SV was used as the forest parameter. Nevertheless, for both CC and SV, the RMSE between the modeled and the observed backscatter was considerably lower than the seasonal variation of the backscatter. In Sodankyla and Nurmes, the Sentinel-1 based F/T estimates were well in line with the in situ observations and the SMOS F/T product. The Sentinel-1 retrievals measuring the top soil layer were fast to react to air temperature changes between negative and positive Celsius degrees, showing similarity of 94-99% with the air temperature measurements. In Tampere the method showed weaker results; the similarity with the air temperature observations was 64%. Overall, a correct vertical freezing pattern of the soil was demonstrated in this study, with Sentinel-1 sensitive to the top soil layer, in situ sensors measuring at 5 cm depth, and SMOS reaching to 5-15 cm soil depth. Additional assessment should be conducted in southern Finland.

AB Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is an important flux that links global cycles of carbon, water and energy and is largely driven by transpiration (T) through leaf stomata in vegetated areas during the growing season. ET, however, remains one of the most uncertain hydrological variables at the global scale. In this study, we proposed a semi-mechanistic model for estimating terrestrial T by deriving an analytical solution between solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and stomatal conductance (g(c)) as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD), combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior. The relationships of SIF-ETR and ETR-gc center dot VPD0.5 was calibrated by the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) model. This model was validated by hourly canopy SIF and concurrent eddy covariance flux observations at both forest and cropland ecosystems. Results showed that the SIF combined with VPD can better predict gc than using SIF alone with a more consistent seasonal trends found in both SIF and gc center dot VPD0.5. The correlation between gc center dot VPD0.5 and SIF was stronger than those between gc and SIF and between gc and VIs. Canopy T was accurately predicted from SIF at both hourly (R-2 > 0.65) and daily (R-2 > 0.76) scales and was also successfully estimated using SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) at cropland ecosystems. In comparison with empirical relationships of directly linking gc with SIF or VIs, the proposed model produced latent heat flux (lambda E) estimation in best agreement with measured values at all three sites. Our model could be a step forward in understanding the coupling of carbon and water cycles and may be used in ecosystem models for improving ET estimation over large areas.

AB For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) de-monstrates improved performance over the study region (95-125 degrees E, 18-30 degrees N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.

AB The freeze/thaw state of permafrost landscapes is an essential variable for monitoring ecological, hydrological and climate processes. Ground surface state can be obtained from satellite data through time series analysis of C-band backscatter from scatterometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. Scatterometer data has been used in a variety of studies concerning freeze/thaw retrieval of the land surface. Coarse spatial resolution scatterometer data has great potential for application in this field due to its high temporal resolution (approx. daily observations). In this study, we investigate the influence of sub-grid cell (12.5 km) surface water (ice free and ice covered) on freeze/thaw retrieval based on ASCAT data using a threshold algorithm. We found discrepancies related to the surface water fraction in the detected timing of thawing and freezing of up to 2 days earlier thawing for spring and 3.5 days earlier freezing for autumn for open water fractions of 40% resulting in an overestimation of the frozen season. Results of this study led to the creation of a method for correction of water fraction impact on freeze/thaw data. Additionally, this study demonstrates the applicability of a new approach to freeze/thaw retrieval which has not so far been tested for SAR, specifically Sentinel-1.

AB This study assesses the impact of an improved soil moisture (SM) initialization using direct insertion methodology for convection-resolving modelling of heavy precipitation events (HPEs). State-of-the-art 1 km SM data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, SMOS-BEC L4 version 3 are used for this purpose. A strategy is developed to prepare the SMOS-L4 surface soil moisture (SSM) product for the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO) model initialization by applying a cumulative density function (CDF)-matching biascorrection and the exponential filter method to calculate corresponding SM profiles (L4-Expo). The processed satellite-derived product is validated with 38 observing sites from three in-situ SM networks REMEDHUS (19), SMOSMANIA (11) and VAS (8). All networks measure at a soil depth of 5 cm, only at the SMOSMANIA network additional measurements at 10, 20 and 30 cm are available. Four HPEs are selected to evaluate the impact of the high-resolution realistic initialization. The results show a high agreement index (AI = 0.91) and a low root-mean-square deviation (0.03 m(3)/m(3)) of the high-resolution, bias-corrected SMOS-L4 SSM product compared to in-situ observations. Moreover, the derived L4-Expo SM profile field agrees with ground-based observations and successfully removes the wet bias of the original COSMO simulated SM profile. Enhanced SM initialization with the SMOS-L4 SM derived profiles improves precipitation modelling in all selected HPEs as a consequence of improved near-surface 2 m-temperature and induced changes in the pressure field (-0.5 hPa), atmospheric humidity distribution (dqs = 5-15%) as well as wind circulations (dw(700hPa) = 25%), thus convergence/divergence fields. The sensitivity study, applying the same methodology for SM initialization for a SMOS-L3 (similar to 25 km), shows a weaker improvement of the precipitation forecast of an analysed HPE than the 1 km SMOS-4 product. Our results highlight the benefit of high-resolution SSM remote sensing satellite data for scientific disciplines like meteorology in overcoming present limitations such as the uncertainty associated to SM initialization in models.

AB Landslides can result in loss of lives, cause damage to property, infrastructure, utilities, and residential structures and can block transportation routes. Landslide inventory maps can provide spatial-temporal information about past and recent landslides and are used for analysis to create models that can characterize susceptibility. As such, these maps are considered an essential source for risk management tasks. In this paper, we propose a persistent homology method applied on LiDAR-derived digital terrain model data to detect landslides for landslide inventory maps. In testing the hypothesis that persistent homology, a method for computing topological features of a space at different resolutions, can be used to accurately detect landslides, we applied the method on LiDARderived digital terrain models to detect shapes and patterns that are indicative of landslide surface expressions. We validated our test results by comparing them to currently available landslide inventory maps for selected locations in Pennsylvania, Oregon, Colorado and Washington. The results show a different performance for each state; the accuraces were 0.79, 0.71, 0.53, 0.69, and 0.77 for five study areas. Variations in performance are linked to varying surface roughness between different types of landslides, their size, shape, ages, composition, and a possible history of reactivations of landslides that would further pronounce surface expressions. To overcome some of these challenges that may hinder performance of our method, we recommend that other datasets, containing landslides, be considered as additional nth-order dimensions beyond the spatial and elevation dimensions inherent in topographic datasets.

AB Surface snowmelt affects the energy balance through melt-albedo feedback and may endanger the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) through hydrofracture. Here, we introduce an automatic snowmelt identification algorithm based on Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer. The proposed method can provide self-adaptive thresholds for snowmelt detection based on Rosin thresholding, and is able to detect weak melt signals with a wavelet denoising procedure. Results suggest the AP surface snowmelt has slightly declined during 1999-2018 in the context of recent cooling. However, winter melt index (i.e., melt days times the area of melting) has significantly increased (above the 99% confidence level) with a rate of 83% decade(-1). Unprecedented winter snowmelt was found in 2015/2016 when about one-third of the AP experienced snowmelt in late May. This may be attributed to the intrusions of marine air and the enhanced fohn-driven warming resulted from the abnormal northwesterly flow driven by a significant deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.

AB Estimates of the magnitude and distribution of aboveground carbon in Earth's forests remain uncertain, yet knowledge of forest carbon content at a global scale is critical for forest management in support of climate mitigation. In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR's L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI's footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding RMSEs of 57%, 75%, and 89% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI's power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87%). We also test the application of GEDI's biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion.

AB Landfast sea ice (fast ice) is an important feature prevalent around the Antarctic coast, which is affected by climate change and energy exchanges with the atmosphere and ocean. This study proposed a method for detection of the West Antarctic fast ice using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR) images. The algorithm has combined image segmentation, image correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques (i.e., random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), and logistic regression (LR)). We used SAR images with a baseline of 5 days that are not in the same orbit but overlap each other as overlaps between swaths in adjacent orbits are often available in the polar regions. The underlying assumption for the proposed fast ice detection algorithm is that fast ice regions in SAR images with a time interval of 5 days are highly correlated. The object-based approach proposed in this study was well suited to high-resolution SAR images in deriving spatially homogeneous fast ice regions. The image segmentation results using the optimized parameters showed a distinct difference in the backscatter temporal evolution between fast ice and pack ice regions. Correlation and STD of backscattering coefficients were found to be the most significant variables for the object-based fast ice detection from two temporally separated images. In overall, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that the algorithm was an effective approach to detect fast ice with high accuracies. The models well detected various fast ice regions in the West Antarctica but misclassified some objects. The misclassifications occurred toward the edge of fast ice regions with relatively rapid changes in backscattering between both data acquisitions. On the other hand, few fast ice objects were misclassified as uniform backscattering over time occurred by chance on very small objects far from the coast. Very old multi-year fast ice regions with high backscattered signals were also a source for some misclassifications. This may be due to the sensitivity of L-band to snow structure to some extent and a thinner ice over the region with either ice growth (no deformation) or closing (slight deformation) between both images. Heavy snow load on the ice could be another error source for some misclassification as well. The approach allowed for the reliable detection of fast ice regions by using L-band SAR images with a small local incidence angle difference.

AB The area, distribution, and temporal dynamics of anthropogenic impervious surface (AIS) at large scale are significant for environmental, ecological and socio-economic studies. Remote sensing has become an important tool for monitoring large scale AIS, while it remains challenging for accurate extraction of AIS using optical datasets alone due to the high diversity of land covers over large scale. Previous studies indicated the complementary use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to improve the AIS estimation, while most of them were limited to local and small scales. The potential of SAR for large scale AIS mapping is still uncertain and under-explored. In this study, first, a machine learning framework incorporating both optical and SAR data based on Google Earth Engine platform was developed for mapping and analyzing the annual dynamics of AIS in China. Feature-level fusion for SAR and optical data across large scale was tested applicable considering the backscattering coefficients, texture measures and spectral characteristics. Improved accuracy (averaged 2% increased overall accuracy and averaged 4% increased Kappa coefficient) and better delineation between the bright impervious surface and bare land was observed comparing with using optical data alone. Second, comprehensive assessment was conducted using high-resolution samples from Google Earth, census data from China Statistic Yearbook and benchmark datasets from the GlobeLand30 and GHSL, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method and results. Last but not the least, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of AIS in China from national, regional and provincial levels.

AB Mangrove ecosystems are targeted for many conservation and rehabilitation efforts due to their ability to store large amounts of carbon in their living biomass and soil. Traditional methods to monitor above-ground biomass (AGB) rely on on-ground measurements, which are expensive, labour intensive and cover small spatial scales. Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstructions from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles imagery (UAV-SfM) have the potential to increase fieldwork efficiency by providing a greater amount of spatial information in less time. However, there is still a need to assess the ability of UAV-SfM to retrieve structural information of mangrove forests, which could pose challenges in areas of high forest complexity and density.
   In this study we successfully used UAV-SfM data to estimate height, canopy diameter and AGB of natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests across two regions of the southeastern coast of Australia. We used a variable window filter algorithm to detect trees with an 80% detection rate when considering the top canopy. Individual tree canopy segmentation was performed using a marker-controlled watershed segmentation with two sets of constraining markers: treetops and a minimum height below which a pixel is not considered part of a tree.
   Direct comparison with on-ground measurements at the regional level showed no significant difference in tree height and AGB medians when only top canopy was considered. Similarly, median canopy diameters were not significantly different in natural areas of both regions, but significant differences were found in rehabilitated areas. UAV-SfM estimates of AGB were on average 15% lower in natural areas and 10% higher in rehabilitated areas when compared to on-ground measurements and followed a strong linear relationship close to the ideal one-to-one relationship.
   Additionally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of the two methodologies. UAV-SfM methods can save almost AU$ 50,000 per ha when compared to on-ground measurements and become cost-effective (based on total costs) after just 15 days of surveys. The methods described in this study open the possibility for easily repeatable, low-cost UAV-SfM surveys for local managers by providing a faster, more cost-effective approach for monitoring mangrove forests over larger areas than traditional on-ground surveys while maintaining forest inventory data accuracy in both natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for characterizing crop growth conditions and estimating crop productivity. Despite continuing efforts to develop LAI estimation algorithms, LAI datasets still need improvement at spatial and temporal resolutions to meet the requirements of agricultural applications. Advancements in data fusion technique and the emergence of new satellite data provide opportunities for LAI data at higher resolutions in both space and time. In this study, we derived new LAI estimations by leveraging novel satellite remote sensing datasets, STAIR fusion (MODIS-Landsat fusion) and Planet Labs' CubeSat data (through a reprocessed pipeline) for a typical agricultural landscape in the U.S. Corn Belt. The STAIR fused data and our reprocessed CubeSat data have both fine spatial resolutions (30 m and 3.125 m, respectively) and high frequencies (daily for both). To reliably estimate LAI from these advanced satellite datasets, we used two methods: inversion of a radiative transfer model (RTM), and empirical relationship with vegetation index (VI) calibrated from field measured LAI. Compared to the ground-truth LAI collected at 36 sites across the study region, reliable approximations were achieved by both LAI estimations based on PROSAIL RTM (STAIR: R-2 = 0.69 and root mean squared error (RMSE) = 1.12 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.09 (m(2) m(-2))), and LAI estimations based on Green Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (GrWDRVI) (STAIR: R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.10 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 1.08 (m(2) m(-2)), where validation ground-truth is independent from calibration data). Newly estimated high-resolution LAI data were aggregated at 500 m resolution and compared with MODIS and VIIRS LAI products, revealing substantial uncertainties and biases in these two products. We also demonstrated phenology stage estimation at fine spatial resolutions based on our high-frequency LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation methods at both high spatial resolution and temporal frequency can be applied to the entire U.S. Corn Belt and provide significant advancement to crop monitoring and precision agriculture.

AB Several decade-long satellite retrievals of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIP) have become available during the past few years, but understanding the long-term dynamics of SIF and elucidating its co-variation with historical gross primary production (GPP) remains a challenge. Part of the challenge is due to the lack of direct comparability among these SIF products as they are derived from various satellite platforms with different retrieval methods, instruments characteristics, overpass time, and viewing-illumination geometries. This study presents a framework that circumvents these discrepancies and allows the harmonization of SIF products from multiple instruments to achieve long-term coverage. We demonstrate this framework by fusing SIF retrievals from SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) onboard MetOp-A developed at German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ). We first downscale both original SIF datasets from their native resolutions to 0.05 degrees ((SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) respectively) using machine learning (ML) algorithms imposed with regionalization constraints to account for the varying relationships between predictors and SIF in space and time. We then apply the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique to correct the offset between (SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) inherited from the original instrumental discrepancies to generate a harmonized SIF time series from 2002 to present ((SIF) over bar (005)). Finally, we quantify the uncertainty of (SIF) over bar (005). (SIF) over bar (005) is validated with 1) the original retrievals to ensure the spatial and temporal variabilities are preserved, 2) airborne SIF derived from the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS, R-2 = 0.73), and 3) ground-based SIF measurements at a subalpine coniferous forest (R-2 = 0.91). The SIFyield derived from (SIF) over bar (005) has high seasonal consistency with the ground measurements (R-2 = 0.93), suggesting that the harmonized product (SIF) over bar (005) carries physiological information beyond the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Additionally, (SIF) over bar (005) has a good capability for large-scale stress monitoring as demonstrated with several major historical drought and heatwave events. The framework developed in this study sets the stage for future development of even more advanced SIF products from all SIP-capable satellite platforms once issues related to inter-sensor calibration are resolved and SIF physiology is better understood.

AB The accurate retrieval of land surface vegetation properties under varying environmental conditions from time series of moderately high spatial resolution satellite observations is challenging. By coupling various Radiative Transfer (RT) models one can describe the soil, vegetation and atmosphere contributions in a "bottom-up" approach and, thereby, simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data comparable to satellite-observed TOA radiances. This makes it possible to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA radiances rather than from atmospherically corrected top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance data. The advantages of this approach are that a separate atmospheric correction of the satellite images is not necessary, and that the anisotropic surface reflection can also be taken into account effectively. In this study, we coupled various RT models, including the brightness - shape - moisture (BSM) reflectance model of the soil, the optical radiative transfer (RTMo) model of vegetation and the 'MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission' (MODTRAN) model of the atmosphere, to simulate an annual time series of Landsat satellite TOA radiances observed during a drought episode in California Mediterranean grasslands in 2004. The inversion of this coupled system through an optimization technique against Landsat TOA radiances resulted in direct retrieval of vegetation properties. We accommodated the surface anisotropic reflection in our coupled modeling and also defined a novel anisotropy index to quantitatively express the importance of this phenomenon in satellite image analysis for the first time. Our study showed that the coupled use of RT models was able to accurately reproduce the time series of observed TOA radiances collected under varying soil moisture contents during an extended drought episode. The proposed coupling approach is useful for successful retrieval of vegetation properties from time series of satellite TOA radiance data to produce maps of land surface properties and to monitor vegetation properties variations in an operational straightforward way. The approach can also be easily adapted for conducting multi-sensor time series studies, creating a much denser temporal sampling than would be possible for separate single sensors.

ID LAND; MODIS; AREA
AB The use of time series analysis with moderate resolution satellite imagery is increasingly common, particularly since the advent of freely available Landsat data. Dense time series analysis is providing new information on the timing of landscape changes, as well as improving the quality and accuracy of information being derived from remote sensing. Perhaps most importantly, time series analysis is expanding the kinds of land surface change that can be monitored using remote sensing. In particular, more subtle changes in ecosystem health and condition and related to land use dynamics are being monitored. The result is a paradigm shift away from change detection, typically using two points in time, to monitoring, or an attempt to track change continuously in time. This trend holds many benefits, including the promise of near real-time monitoring. Anticipated future trends include more use of multiple sensors in monitoring activities, increased focus on the temporal accuracy of results, applications over larger areas and operational usage of time series analysis.

AB We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45 degrees to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or "breaks") contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.

AB In recent years, large amount of high spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images are available for land cover mapping. However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images. The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images, including Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, Jilin-1, Ziyuan-3, Sentinel-2A, and Google Earth platform data, show encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification with multi-source HRRS images.

AB An accurate estimation of biomass burning emissions is partially limited by the lack of knowledge of fire burning phase (smoldering vs. flaming). In recent years, several fire detection products have been developed to provide information of fire radiative power (FRP), location, size, and temperature of fire pixels, but no information regarding fire burning phase is retrieved. The Day-Night band (DNB) aboard Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is sensitive to visible light from flaming fires in nighttime scenes. In contrast, VIIRS 4 mu m moderate resolution band #13 (M13), though capable of detecting fires at all phases, has no direct sensitivity for discerning fire phase. However, the hybrid usage of VIIRS DNB and M-bands data is hampered by their different scanning technology and spatial resolution. In this study, we present a novel method to rapidly and accurately resample DNB pixel radiances to the footprint of M-band pixels, accounting for onboard detector aggregation schemes and bowtie effect removals. The visible energy fraction (VEF) is subsequently introduced as an indicator of fire burning phase. VEF is calculated as the ratio of visible light power (VLP) to FRP for each fire pixel retrieved from the VIIRS 750 m active fire product. A global distribution of VEF values is quantitatively obtained, showing smaller VEF values in regions with mostly smoldering wildfires, such as peatland fires in Indonesia, larger VEF values in regions with flaming wildfires over grasslands and savannas in the sub-Sahelian region, and the largest VEF values associated with gas flaring in the Middle East. Mean VEF for different land cover types or regions is highly correlated with modified combustion efficiency (MCE). These results, together with a case study of the 2018 California Camp Fire, show that the VEF has the potential to be an indicator of fire combustion phase for each fire pixel, appropriate for estimating emission factors at the satellite pixel level.

AB Satellite remote sensing is becoming an increasingly essential component of volcano monitoring, especially at little-known and remote volcanoes where in-situ measurements are unavailable and/or impractical. Moreover the synoptic view captured by satellite imagery over volcanoes can benefit hazard monitoring efforts. By monitoring, we mean both following the changing styles and intensities of the eruption once it has started, as well as nowcasting and eventually forecasting the areas potentially threatened by hazardous phenomena in an eruptive scenario. Here we demonstrate how the diversity of remote sensing data over volcanoes and the mutual interconnection between satellite observations and numerical simulations can improve lava flow hazard monitoring in response to effusive eruption. Time-averaged discharge rates (TADRs) obtained from low spatial/high temporal resolution satellite data (e.g. MODIS, SEVIRI) are complemented, compared and fine-tuned with detailed maps of volcanic deposits with the aim of constraining the conversion from satellite-derived radiant heat flux to TADR. Maps of volcanic deposits include the time-varying evolution of lava flow emplacement derived from multispectral satellite data (e.g. EO-ALI, Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER), as well as the flow thickness variations, retrieved from the topographic monitoring by using stereo or tri-stereo optical data (e.g. Pleiades, PlanetScope, ASTER). Finally, satellite-derived parameters are used as input and validation tags for the numerical modelling of lava flow scenarios. Our strategy is applied to the first historic eruption of Nabro volcano (Eritrea), occurred in June 2011. This eruptive event was characterized by the extraordinary quantity of SO2 emitted into the atmosphere and the extent of the long lava flows, which had a significant impact on the inhabitants of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border region despite the low population density. Because of its remote position, little was known about this eruption regarding the quantity of volcanic deposits and the timing and mechanisms of their emplacement. We found that the total volume of deposits, calculated from differences of digital elevation models (DEMs), is about 580 x 10(6) m(3), of which about 336 x 10(6) m(3) is the volume of the main lava flow that advanced eastward beyond the caldera. Multi-spectral satellite observations indicate that the main lava flow had reached its maximum extent (similar to 16 km) within about 4 days of the eruption onset on midnight 12 June. Lava flow simulations driven by satellite-derived parameters allow building an understanding of the advance rate and maximum extent of the main lava flow showing that it is likely to have reached 10.5 km in one day with a maximum speed of similar to 0.44 km/h.

AB Observations from satellites provide high-resolution images of ground deformation allowing to infer deformation sources by developing advanced modeling of magma ascent and intrusion processes. Nevertheless, such models can be strongly biased without a precise model of the internal structure of the volcano. In this study, we jointly exploited two interferometric techniques to interpret the 2011-2013 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc). The first is the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique, which provides highly-resolved spatial and temporal images of ground deformation. The second is the Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT), which images subsurface structures, providing the constraints necessary to infer the depth of the shallow source at CFc (between 0.8 and 1.2 km). We applied for the first time a tool to delineate the deformation source boundaries from the observed deformation maps: the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD) technique. The THD processes the vertical component of the ground deformation field detected through InSAR applied to COSMO-SkyMed data. The patterns retrieved by applying the THD technique show consistent spatial correlations with (1) the seismic group-velocity maps achieved through the ANT and (2) the distribution of the earthquakes nucleated during the unrest at similar to 1 km. High-velocity anomalies, the retrieved geometrical features of the deformation field, and the spatial distribution of seismicity coincide with extinct volcanic vents in the eastern part of the caldera (Solfatara/Pisciarelli and Astroni). Such a coincidence hints at a significant role of the extinct plumbing system in either constraining or channeling the eastward propagation of magmatic fluids. Here, we demonstrated that a joint analysis of the InSAR patterns, seismic structures, and seismicity allows us to model in space and time the characteristics and nature of the shallow deformation source at CFc. Using published literature, we show that the effects of structural heterogeneities at shallow depths may have a more significant early-stage impact on the evolution of the surface displacement signals than deeper magmatic sources: these secondary structural effects may produce local amplification in the deformation records which can be mistakenly interpreted as early signals of impending eruptions. The achieved results are particularly relevant for the understanding of the origin of deformation signal at volcanoes where magma propagation within sills is expected, as at CFc.

AB Quantification of microwave vegetation properties (i.e. vegetation optical depth (VOD) and single scattering albedo (omega)) is of interest not only to reliably estimate soil moisture from the Earth's microwave emission, but also for broad applications across plant physiology and hydrology. Estimated VOD is often used as a biomass proxy or to investigate plant water dynamics on multiple scales, as it is dependent on the vegetation water content, dry woody biomass, and canopy structure. For most but not all microwave satellite remote sensing applications, VOD and omega are assigned a priori from auxiliary vegetation information and used as inputs to retrieve soil moisture. Alternatively, polarized brightness temperature has been used to estimate VOD and omega. Retrieval algorithms typically use the zeroth-order solution to the radiative transfer equation (tau-omega model) to simultaneously characterize surface and vegetation emission. In this study we investigate one year of estimated VOD and omega at L-(1.4 GHz), C-(6.9 GHz) and X-band (10.7 GHz), from SMAP and AMSR2 satellites respectively. Since VOD and omega describe absorption and scattering integrated over a path length, we derive estimates of relative absorption and scattering through normalization by a vegetation height derived from GLAS light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements.
   We assess whether relative attenuation is independent of vegetation height and land cover class. We also test how the relative absorption and scattering estimates follow a spectrum across microwave frequencies. We apply this analysis globally and find relative canopy absorption and scattering to follow distinct patterns, relatively independent of the spatial distributions of vegetation height. We find that relative canopy absorption generally peaks for shorter vegetation (5-10 m) and high density (shrub lands) while high forest canopies have relatively lower values. The VOD values that include the path length (taller vegetation) however are higher for forests relative to shorter vegetation. Seasonal amplitudes of VOD are higher for C- and X-band than for L-band and have maxima in regions with strong rainfall seasonality. This study presents first results for global relative canopy attenuation, based on one consistent retrieval for three frequencies, and discusses temporal dynamics as well as the role of multiple frequencies in assessing attenuation in canopies.

AB Climate variability and change acting at broad scales can lead to divergent changes in plant production at local scales. Quantifying how production responds to variation in climate at local scales is essential to understand underlying ecological processes and inform land management decision-making, but has historically been limited in spatiotemporal scale based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements or coarse resolution satellite observations. With the advent of cloud-based computing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), production responses to climate can be evaluated across broad landscapes though time at a resolution useful for ecological and land management applications. Here, GEE was employed to synthesize a multi-platform Landsat time series (1988-2014) and evaluate relationships between the soil-adjusted vegetation index (a proxy for plant production) and climate across deserts and plant communities of the southwestern U.S. A "climate pivot point" approach was adopted in GEE to assess the trade-off between production responses to increasing wetness and resistances to drought at 30-m resolution. Consistent with a long-term seasonal climate gradient, production was most related to climate variance during the cool-season in the western deserts, during the warm-season in the eastern deserts, and equally related to both seasons within several desert areas. Communities dominated by grasses and deciduous trees displayed large production responses to an increase in wetness and low resistances to water deficit, while shrublands and evergreen woodlands had variable responses and high drought resistances. Production in plant communities that spanned multiple deserts responded differently to seasonal climate variability in each desert. Defining these plant production sensitivities to climate at 30-m resolution in GEE advances forecasts of how long-term climate trajectories may affect carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and the vulnerability of water-limited ecosystems.

AB Knowledge of the spatial patterns of successional stages (i.e., primary and secondary forest) in tropical forests allows to monitor forest preservation, mortality and regeneration in relation to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Different successional stages have also different capabilities of re-establishing carbon stocks. Therefore, a successful discrimination of successional stages over wide areas can lead to an improved quantification of above ground biomass and carbon stocks. The reduction of the mapping uncertainties is especially a challenge due to high heterogeneity of the tropical vegetation. In this framework, the development of innovative remote sensing approaches is required. Forests (top) height (and its spatial distribution) are an important structural parameter that can be used to differentiate between different successional stages, and can be provided by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) acquisitions. In this context, this paper investigates the potential of forest heights estimated from TanDEM-X InSAR data and a LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM) for separating successional stages (primary or old growth and secondary forest at different stages of succession) by means of a maximum likelihood classification. The study was carried out in the region of the Tapajos National Forest (Para, Brazil) in the Amazon biome. The forest heights for three years (2012, 2013 and 2016) were estimated from a single-polarization in bistatic mode using InSAR model-based inversion techniques aided by the LiDAR digital terrain model. The validation of the TanDEM-X forest heights with independent LiDAR H100 datasets was carried out in the location of seven field inventory plots (measuring 50 x 50 m, equivalent to 0.25 ha), also allowing for the validation of the LiDAR datasets against the field data. The validation of the estimated heights showed a high correlation (r = 0.93) and a low uncertainty (RMSE = 3 m). The information about the successional stages and forest heights from field datasets was used to select training samples in the LiDAR and TanDEM-X forest heights to classify successional stages with a maximum likelihood classifier. The identification of different stages of forest succession based on TanDEM-X forest heights was possible with an overall accuracy of about 80%.

AB Provisioning services from grassland ecosystems are strongly linked to physical and chemical grassland traits, which are affected by atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]s). The influences of increased [CO2]s ([eCO(2)]s) are typically investigated in Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) studies via destructive sampling methods. This traditional approach is restricted to sampling plots and harvest dates, while hyperspectral approaches provide new opportunities as they are rapid, non-destructive and cost-effective. They further allow a high temporal resolution including spatially explicit information. In this study we investigated the hyperspectral predictability of 14 grassland traits linked to forage quality and quantity within a FACE experiment in central Germany with three plots under ambient atmospheric [CO2]s, and three plots at [eCO(2)]s (similar to 20% above ambient [CO2]s). We analysed the suitability of various normalisation and feature selection techniques to link comprehensive laboratory analyses with two years of hyperspectral measurements (spectral range 600-1600 nm). We applied partial least squares regression and found good to excellent predictive performances (0.49 <= leave one out cross-validation R-2 <= 0.94), which depended on the normalisation method applied to the hyperspectral data prior to model training. Noteworthy, the models' predictive performances were not affected by the different [CO2]s, which was anticipated due to the altered plant physiology under [eCO(2)]s. Thus, an accurate monitoring of grassland traits under different [CO2]s (present-day versus future, or within a FACE facility) is promising, if appropriate predictors are selected. Moreover, we show how hyperspectral predictions can be used e.g., within a future phenotyping approach, to monitor the grassland on a spatially explicit level and on a higher temporal resolution compared to conventional destructive sampling techniques. Based on the information during the vegetation period we show how hyperspectral monitoring might be used e.g., to adapt harvest practices or gain deeper insights into physiological plant alterations under [eCO(2)]s.

AB Standard ocean color chlorophyll algorithms, including normalized fluorescence line height algorithms, over-estimate summer blooms and often miss large winter blooms in mid-latitude estuaries such as Long Island Sound (LIS). Thus, they are unable to accurately determine year-round chlorophyll concentrations. Here, we show that winter phytoplankton blooms cannot be retrieved using MODIS' 667 and 678 nm bands. Although MERIS' equivalent 665 and 681 nm bands are able to better characterize chlorophyll a concentrations at LIS compared to MODIS, we show that it is a red band difference (RBD) algorithm relying on observing the maximum spectral difference between R-rs681nm-R-rs665nm and R-rs709nm-R-rs665nm from the MERIS sensor that is able to successfully capture the seasonal chlorophyll dynamics measured in situ. Such switching algorithms are useful in areas where the shape of the reflectance spectrum changes throughout the seasons associated with changes in the phytoplankton community structure, and provide seamless implementation compared to algorithms based on seasonal tunings. We apply the switching RBD algorithm to the 10 years of available MERIS data, and results reveal important spatial and temporal patterns that cannot be assessed from in situ data alone. These include the observation that the decreasing trend in surface chlorophyll concentrations between 2002 and 2012 is localized, and may be related to changes in the flow of Atlantic waters into the estuary rather than a result of active management against eutrophication. Following from past studies, we demonstrate how high sensitivity red bands are valuable to successfully determine proxies for phytoplankton biomass in coastal areas where optical properties are dominated by dissolved organic matter, and where the fluorescence peak may not accurately capture the dynamics of productive waters. Such switching RBD algorithms applied to data from the Sentinel or PACE missions may allow distribution of near-real time chlorophyll a products for coastal waters across winter and summer seasons.

AB Moso bamboo is the most widely distributed bamboo forest type in tropical and subtropical areas. Increasing trends in both expansion and logging of Moso bamboo have occurred over the past four decades due to its rapid growth rate and short harvest rotation period. The spatial and temporal distribution of bamboo forest is the basis for the study of the carbon cycle in bamboo forest ecosystems. Previous studies have consistently focused on different influences of scale, data and algorithms for bamboo forest mapping; however, there is still considerable uncertainty in bamboo forest mapping due to the unique on-year and off-year phenomena and their significant differences in spectral characteristics. Northwestern Zhejiang Province has the most widely distributed bamboo forest and was selected as the study area. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time-series data, changes in the spectral characteristics during the growth cycle of bamboo forest were analyzed and the optimum time window for the classification of the bamboo forest was determined. The seasonal index of the bamboo forest based on spectral differences was the proposed approach, and on-year and off-year bamboo forest mapping was conducted seasonally using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that (1) the best period to distinguish bamboo forest from other forest types is April May, followed by December February, and the best month for distinguishing between on-year and off-year bamboo forests is May; (2) the spectral differences between bamboo forest and other forest types are mainly reflected in the red-edge 3 near-infrared (NIR) and NIR narrow bands (740-865 nm); (3) Sentinel-2 data have obvious advantages over Landsat 8 data in distinguishing the bamboo forest because of better spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions; and (4) the multi-temporal bamboo forest index has a better overall classification accuracy (OA = 91.2) for distinguishing on-year and off-year bamboo forests than the mono-temporal index and can be applied to other regions.

AB Accurate landslide inventory mapping is essential for quantitative hazard and risk assessment. Although multi temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved delta NDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data.

AB Global estimation of Gross Primary Production (GPP) - the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by plants through photosynthesis - is commonly based on optical satellite remote sensing data. This presents a source driven approach since it uses the amount of absorbed light, the main driver of photosynthesis, as a proxy for GPP. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) estimates obtained from microwave sensors provide an alternative and independent data source to estimate GPP on a global scale, which may complement existing GPP products. Recent studies have shown that VOD is related to aboveground biomass, and that both VOD and temporal changes in VOD relate to GPP. In this study, we build upon this concept and propose a model for estimating GPP from VOD. Since the model is driven by vegetation biomass, as observed through VOD, it presents a carbon sink driven approach to quantify GPP and, therefore, is conceptually different from common source-driven approaches. The model developed in this study uses single frequencies from active or passive microwave VOD retrievals from C-, X- and Ku-band (Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation (AMSR-E)) to estimate GPP at the global scale. We assessed the ability for temporal and spatial extrapolation of the model using global GPP from FLUXCOM and in situ GPP from FLUXNET. We further performed upscaling of in situ GPP based on different VOD data sets and compared these estimates with the FLUXCOM and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products. Our results show that the model developed for individual grid cells using VOD and change in VOD as input performs well in predicting temporal patterns in GPP for all VOD data sets. For spatial extrapolation of the model, however, additional input variables are needed to represent the spatial variability of the VOD-GPP relationship due to differences in vegetation type. As additional input variable, we included the grid cell median VOD (as a proxy for vegetation cover), which increased the model performance during cross validation. Mean annual GPP obtained for AMSR-E X-band data tends to overestimate mean annual GPP for FLUXCOM and MODIS but shows comparable latitudinal patterns. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of VOD for estimating GPP. The sink-driven approach provides additional information about GPP independent of optical data, which may contribute to our knowledge about the carbon source-sink balance in different ecosystems.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide a detailed representation of forest canopy structure and are highly suitable for forest inventory applications. Providing three-dimensional data at a lower cost, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as an alternative to ALS. Previous studies have compared the utility of ALS and DAP data for predicting forest attributes, however none of those studies used data acquired as part of large-area operational inventories. We used ALS, DAP and field data obtained from 836 plots and five operational inventories conducted in southeastern Norway. We compared local and regional modelling approaches for predicting basal area, number of stems, volume, Lorey's mean height, and dominant height. First, we developed district-, forest type-, and data source-specific nonlinear prediction models for all forest attributes (local models). Second, we fitted forest type- and data-source specific nonlinear models with pooled data from all districts (regional models), in which we included dummy variables to account for district-specific effects. We compared the accuracies of ALS- and DAP-based predictions made with local and regional models. Finally, we assessed how a reduced number of calibration plots affected the accuracies of ALS- and DAP-based predictions made with regional models. In general, ALS-based predictions made with local models were most accurate. District-specific effects needed to be accounted for in the regional models. ALS models required substantially fewer calibration plots than DAP models. The accuracies obtained with regional ALS models fitted with 50% of the available data were better than the accuracies obtained with local DAP models fitted with all the available data. Thus, by fitting regional ALS models with data from multiple inventories, field efforts can be reduced substantially while still obtaining better prediction accuracies than by fitting local DAP models.

AB Monitoring long-term landslide activity is of importance for risk assessment and land management. Daytime airborne drones or very high-resolution optical satellites are often used to create landslide maps. However, such imagery comes at a high cost, making long-term risk analysis cost-prohibitive. Despite the widespread use of open-access 30 m Landsat imagery, their utility for landslide detection is often limited due to low classification accuracy. One of the major challenges is to separate landslides from other anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we produce landslide maps retrospectively from 1998 to 2017 for landslide-prone and highly populated Taiwan (35,874 km(2)). To improve classification accuracy of landslides, we integrate nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), with multi-seasonal daytime optical Landsat time-series, and digital elevation data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). We employed a non-parametric machine-learning classifier, random forest, to classify the satellite imagery. The classifier was trained with data from three years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and was validated with an independent reference sample from twelve years. Our results demonstrated that combining nighttime light data and multi-seasonal imagery significantly improved the classification (p < 0.001), compared to conventional methods based on single-season optical imagery. The results confirmed that the developed classification model enabled mapping of landslides across Taiwan over a long period with annual overall accuracy varying between 96% and 97%, user's and producer's accuracies between 73% and 86%. Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslide inventories from 1998 to 2017 revealed different temporal patterns of landslide activities, showing those areas where landslides were persistent and other areas where landslides tended to reoccur after vegetation regrowth. In sum, we provide a robust method to detect long-term landslide activities based on freely available satellite imagery, which can be applied elsewhere. Our mapping effort of landslide spatiotemporal patterns is expected to be of high importance in developing effective landslide remediation strategies.

AB A satellite-based semi-mechanistic model was developed to estimate the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on the river-dominated Louisiana Continental Shelf (LCS) in summer months using satellite-derived products including chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a(_sat)), sea surface salinity (SSS_sat), and sea surface temperature (SST_sat). The model analytically expresses pCO(2) as the sum of physical (pCO(2),(mix)) and biological (Delta pCO(2,bio)) contributions which are the primary controlling factors associated with the pCO(2 )variability on the LCS. The SSS_sat, derived from a locally calibrated retrieval algorithm, was used in a two-end member river-ocean mixing model to estimate the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) resulting from physical mixing. The mixing-induced DIC and TA were used together with SST_sat to calculate the pCO(2mix), resulting from the mixing processes at the in situ temperature. The biological uptake of pCO(2) through net community production (Delta pCO(2),(bio)) was derived from a previously validated local Chl-a(_sat) product along with the difference between the pCO(2mix), and the extensive in situ underway pCO(2) data. The satellite-derived pCO(2) agreed with in situ measurements with a median absolute difference of 37 mu atm, mean difference of -5 mu atm, and a root mean square difference of 58 mu atm for five summer cruises spanning 2006-2009. The semi-mechanistic remote sensing model differentiates physical and biological influences on the pCO(2) variability, which will help to better investigate the variability and the underlying controlling mechanisms of pCO(2) and CO2 flux on the LCS. This study demonstrates that the use of locally calibrated satellite products (Chl-a,(_sat), SSS_sat) should be promoted to improve the satellite estimation of pCO(2 )in coastal waters. This method can potentially be applied in other river-dominated continental shelves with local tuning.

AB The present paper applies Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based on Local Gradient-Modified (LG-Mod) algorithm to retrieve wind directions from Sentinel-1 data in the Camargue and the Wadden Sea protected coastal areas. Wind speeds are estimated through the inversion of the C-band MODel 5.N (CMOD5.N) backscattering model. Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) Level 1 products were evaluated for wind fields retrieval at high (5 km) and medium (12.5 km) output spatial resolutions. SSW fields from Sentinel-1 were compared with Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and in situ data. Exploitation of the LG-Mod provided wind direction with a related marginal error parameter (i.e., ME alpha ROI) which proved useful for selecting the optimal input pixel size of SAR data processing. When compared to in situ data, the selection of the optimal pixel size reduced the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of LG-Mod wind directions up to 7 degrees and about 45 degrees for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In turn, such reduction provided a decrease of the wind speed RMSE values up to 0.7 m/s and 2.1 m/s, for Wadden Sea and the Camargue site, respectively. In addition, the LG-Mod gave better performance than the global NWP model European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in estimation of wind direction, at 12.5 km output spatial resolution, for both sites. The ME alpha ROI exploitation in the directional analysis of IW and EW products evidenced that at high resolution (5 km) the percentage of reliable wind directions from IW images (84.5%) resulted much larger than that obtained from EW images (30.1%). At medium resolution (12.5 km) instead, the percentage values resulted quite close to each other (99.2% and 86.3%, respectively). IW images proved optimal for high resolution SSW retrieval, whereas EW images suitable for medium resolution. With respect to NWP models, the spectral analysis confirmed the suitability of Sentinel-1 to represent the local wind fields spatial variability in coastal areas, at both high and medium output resolution. Our findings suggest that the combination of the LG-Mod algorithm with NWP models could better resolve spatially wind patterns in complex coastal areas.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission aims to improve the frequency and accuracy of global observations of river water surface elevations (WSEs) and slopes. As part of the SWOT mission, an airborne analog, AirSWOT, provides spatially-distributed measurements of WSEs for river reaches tens to hundreds of kilometers in length. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability of AirSWOT to consistently measure temporal dynamics in river WSE and slope. We evaluate data from six AirSWOT flights conducted between June 7-22, 2015 along a similar to 90 km reach of the Tanana River, AK. To validate AirSWOT measurements, we compare AirSWOT WSEs and slopes against an in situ network of 12 pressure transducers (PTs). Assuming error-free in situ data, AirSWOT measurements of river WSEs have an overall root mean square difference (RMSD) of 11.8 cm when averaged over 1 km(2) areas while measurements of river surface slope have an RMSD of 1.6 cm/km for reach lengths > 5 km. AirSWOT is also capable of recording accurate river WSE changes between flight dates, with an RMSD of 9.8 cm. Regrettably, observed in situ slope changes that transpired between the six flights are well below AirSWOT's accuracy, limiting the evaluation of AirSWOT's ability to capture temporal changes in slope. In addition to validating the direct AirSWOT measurements, we compare discharge values calculated via Manning's equation using AirSWOT WSEs and slopes to discharge values calculated using PT WSEs and slopes. We define or calibrate the remaining discharge parameters using a combination of in situ and remotely sensed observations, and we hold these remaining parameters constant between the two types of calculations to evaluate the impact of using AirSWOT versus the PT observations of WSE and slope. Results indicate that AirSWOT-derived discharge estimates are similar to the PT-derived discharge estimates, with an RMSD of 13.8%. Additionally, 42% of the AirSWOT-based discharge estimates fall within the PT discharge estimates' uncertainty bounds. We conclude that AirSWOT can measure multitemporal variations in river WSE and spatial variations in slope with both high accuracy and spatial sampling, providing a compelling alternative to in situ measurements of regional-scale, spatiotemporal fluvial dynamics.

AB Six global, gridded, gap-free, daily sea surface temperature (SST) analyses covering a period of at least 20 years have been intercompared: ESA SST CCI analysis long-term product v1.0, MyOcean OSTIA reanalysis v1.0, CMC 0.2 degree, AVHRR_ONLY Daily 1/4 degree OISST v2.0, HadISST2.1.0.0 and MGDSST. A seventh SST product of the ensemble median of all six has also been produced using the GMPE (Group for High Resolution SST Multi-Product Ensemble) system. Validation against independent near-surface Argo data, a long timeseries of moored buoy data from the tropics and anomalies to the GMPE median have been used to examine the temporal and spatial homogeneity of the analyses. A comparison of the feature resolution of the analyses has also been undertaken. A summary of relative strengths and weaknesses of the SST datasets is presented, intended to help users to make an informed choice of which analysis is most suitable for their proposed application.

AB Pollen released by vegetation in urban and surrounding rural areas is an important risk factor for respiratory allergies. Mapping the onset, duration, and severity of pollen is difficult, because of insufficient stations and/or monitoring networks at the national and international levels. To address this challenge, we evaluated the spatiotemporal relationship between satellite derived vegetation phenology and in-situ station derived information of pollen season during 2001-2015 at five stations in Canada. First, we calculated annual indicators of start of season (SOS) and start of pollen season (SPS) for birch from Landsat time series and pollen concentration data, respectively, at the five stations. Second, we explored the relationship between derived indicators of SOS and SPS and investigated the scale effect on the relationship. Our results indicate the Landsat based SOS is a good proxy for the indicator of SPS in the birch dominated area. The mean SOS and SPS in the study period are close (within 2.7 days) across the five stations. The interannual variability of SOS and SPS suggests the satellite derived phenology indicator can capture well the dynamics of pollen season in spring. Our analysis also indicates that the annual SOS at a finer resolution (30m) is more consistent with SPS as compared to the indicators derived from coarser resolution satellite observations. This study shows the potential of using fine spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Landsat) to derive the pollen season indicators, which is important for predicting pollen season severity and risk, and assessment of their impacts on respiratory allergies in urban domains.

AB The geometric accuracy of tens of millions of scenes of medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images collected in the past 45 years has been systematically evaluated for land scenes, but the accuracy of ocean scenes is poorly known due to the lack of ground control points (GCPs). In this study, the locations of offshore platforms are first derived from time-series of Landsat-8 OLI images, and are then used as offshore reference points to systematically assess the geometric performance of RS images covering offshore oil/gas development areas. An inventory of 16,131 offshore platforms at the global scale is established, and then a novel method using the position-invariant characteristic of offshore platforms and the coherent characteristic of the geometric shift among tie-points (i.e. between sensed points from to-be-assessed images and the corresponding OLI-derived reference points) is developed for assessing the geometric accuracy of Landsat and other RS images. The method has been applied to 112,935 Landsat scenes (similar to 1.87% of the entire archive) over oceans. The results indicate an optimal performance of Landsat OLI images (both pre-collection and Collection-1) but a less reliable performance of Landsat TM/ETM + L1TP images. Approximately 50% of TM L1GS and ETM + L1GT images have at least 2 pixels of geometric error. The new reference points inventory and the developed method were also applied to many other low-resolution and finer-resolution imagery (e.g. VIIRS Night-fire product, Terra/Aqua MODIS active fire product, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI, the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial images, and images from several Chinese satellites), and a quantitative description of the geometric accuracy of these sensors is also presented. The findings suggest that the new offshore reference point inventory is probably useful to help establish more robust offshore GCPs for U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) GCP library and further improve the ongoing USGS Global GCP improvement plan and European Space Agency Global Reference Image plan.

AB This work focuses on the study and evaluation of the retrievals of aerosol complex refractive index (m = m(r) + im(i)) and single scattering albedo (SSA) from the inversion of multi-wavelength lidar measurements, particularly of three backscattering coefficients (beta) at 355,532 and 1064 nm and two extinction coefficients (alpha) at 355 and 532 nm, typically known as the stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion. The focus is on the well-known regularization technique for spherical particles. It is well known that constraints in the range of refractive indices allowed in the inversion are essential, both for the real (m(r)) and imaginary (m(i)) parts, due to the under-determined nature of the problem. Usually these constraints are fixed for a given set of inversions. Using a large database of AERONET retrievals, correlations between retrieved m(r) and m(i) are observed and those correlations together with results from the GOCART model are used to define optimized, case-dependent, constraints in the stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion. For each inversion performed, the optimized constraints are computed from the 3 beta + 2 alpha data using a-priori information of extinction-to-backscattered ratio (LA) and the Angstrom exponent computed with a at 355 and 532 nm. The stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion with optimized, case-dependent, constraints is applied to airborne NASA LaRC HSRL-2 experimental measurements during DISCOVER-AQ. The optimized constraints selected from the measured 3 beta + 2 alpha are compared with the typing classification based on additional multiwavelength depolarization measurements, showing consistency between aerosol size and absorption range and aerosol typing. Evaluations of the SSA retrieved by the stand-alone 3 beta + 2 alpha lidar inversion with optimized constraints are done by comparisons with correlative airborne in-situ measured SSA. The agreement between both methodologies is satisfactory for most aerosol types as differences are within the uncertainties of each methodology.

AB The warming climate of the Arctic affects the mass budget of glaciers, and changes in the distribution of glacier facies are indicative of their response to climate change. The glacial mass budget over large land ice masses can be estimated by remote sensing techniques, but selecting an efficient remote sensing method for recognizing and mapping glacier facies in the Arctic remains a challenge. In this study, we compared several methods of distinguishing the facies of the Vestfonna ice cap, Svalbard, based upon Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and terrestrial high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements. Glacier zones as determined using the backscattering coefficient (sigma0) of SAR images were compared against GPR data, and an alternative application of Internal Reflection Energy (IRE) calculated from terrestrial GPR data was also used for differentiating the extent of glacier facies. The IRE coefficient was found to offer a suitable method for distinguishing glacier zones and for validating SAR analysis. Furthermore, results of analysis of fully polarimetric Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) and European Remote Sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (ERS-2 SAR) images were compared with the IRE coefficient classification. Especially promising method is H-a segmentation, where the glacier zone boundaries corresponded very well with both GPR visual interpretation and IRE classification results. The IRE coefficient's simplicity of calculation makes it a good alternative to the subjective GPR visual interpretation method, where results strongly depend on the operator's level of experience. We therefore recommend for GPR profiles to be used for additional validation of SAR image analysis in studies of glacier facies on the High Arctic ice masses.

AB With the upcoming BIOMASS mission, P-band PolInSAR is expected to provide new perspectives on global forest aboveground biomass (AGB). However, its performance has not yet been fully evaluated for dense tropical forests with complex structure and very high biomass. Based on the TropiSAR campaign in French Guiana, we explored the challenges of the three most commonly used PolInSAR measures to capture AGB in tropical forests; coherence magnitude, interferometric phase, and backscatter. An improved AGB estimation approach was developed by integrating multiple information derived from single-baseline PolInSAR data. The approach involves ground-volume backscatter decomposition and combines volume backscatter with the retrieved forest height. Volume backscatter from the forest canopy was the best predictor of AGB for tropical forests, whereas the ground backscatter contribution was affected by the complex underlying surface and terrain slope. Both LiDAR- and PolInSAR-derived forest heights showed limited correlation with high AGB due to the varying forest basal area. The linear combination of PolInSAR-derived forest height and volume backscatter complemented each other and produced improved AGB estimates. Comparing three different PolInSAR data pairs, the proposed method produced an AGB map with an average R-2 of 0.7 and RMSE of 34 tons/ha (relative RMSE of 9.4%) at a spatial resolution of 125 x 125 m(2) for biomass between 250-500 tons/ha.

AB This study aims to develop a deep learning based classification framework for remotely sensed time series. The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks.

AB Accurate information on cropland spatial distribution is required for global-scale assessments and agricultural land use policies. Cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide unprecedented opportunities for large-scale classifications of Landsat data. We developed a novel method to fuse pixel-based random forest classification of continental-scale Landsat data on GEE and an object-based segmentation approach known as recursive hierarchical segmentation (RHSeg). Using our fusion method, we produced a continental -scale cropland extent map for North America at 30 m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2010. The total cropland area for North America was estimated at 275.18 million hectares (Mha). The overall accuracies of the map are > 90% across the continent. This map also compares well with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer (CDL), Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) annual crop inventory (ACI), and the Mexican government agency Servicio de Informacion Agroalimentaria y Pesquera (SIAP)'s agricultural boundaries. Furthermore, our map compared well with sub-country statistics including state-wise and county-wise cropland statistics in regression models resulting in R-2 > 0.84. This key contribution paves the way for more detailed products such as crop intensity, crop type, and crop irrigation, and provides a method for creating high-resolution cropland extent maps for other countries where spatial information about croplands are not as prevalent.

AB Surface soil moisture content (SMC) is known to impact soil reflectance at all wavelengths of the solar spectrum. As a consequence, many semi-empirical methods aim at inferring SMC from soil reflectance, but very few rely on physically-based models. This article presents a multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance called MARMIT (multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) as a function of SMC given on a mass basis and a method called MARMITforSMC to estimate it from soil reflectance spectra. This model depicts a wet soil as a dry soil covered with a thin film of water. It is used to assess SMC over seven independent laboratory datasets gathered from the literature. A learning phase is required to link the thickness of the water film with the SMC. For that purpose, a sigmoid function, the parameters of which are related to soil physical and chemical properties such as porosity, grain size and mineralogy composition, is fitted. SMC can be inferred with good accuracy (RMSE approximate to 3%) if the learning step is applied soil by soil. The link between SMC and water thickness actually depends on soil texture and chemical composition. If the soils are divided into classes and if the learning phase is applied to a class, the RMSE slightly increases up to 5%. Finally, MARMITforSMC provides lower RMSE than any other existing semi-empirical or physically-based method.

AB Medium-resolution DEMs have limited applicability to flood mapping in large river systems within data sparse regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. We present a novel approach for the enhancement of the SRTM (30 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in The Gambia, West Africa: A time-series analysis of flood frequency and land cover was used to delineate differences in the vertical limits between morphological units within an alluvial floodplain. Combined with supplementary river stage data and vegetation removal techniques, these methods were used to improve the estimation of bare-earth terrain in flood modelling applications for a region with no access to high-resolution alternatives. The results demonstrate an improvement in floodplain topography for the River Gambia. The technique allows the reestablishment of small-scale complex morphology, instrumental in the routing of floodwater within a noise-filled DEM. The technique will be beneficial to flood-risk modelling applications within data sparse regions.

AB The goal of this study is to quantify variability of daily light use efficiency (LUE) based on radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (LUEgreen) in C3 and C4 crops. Data contained GPP, fAPAR, total and green leaf area index taken over 16 site years of irrigated and rainfed maize and 8 site years of soybean in 2001-2008 including years with quite strong drought events. LUEgreen in irrigated and rainfed sites were statistically indistinguishable showing low sensitivity to water availability. Seasonal changes of LUEgreen remained remarkably small over a wide range of water supply, leaf area index and weather conditions. The magnitude and composition of incident radiation affected the magnitude of the day-to-day LUEgreen change - increases in incident PAR caused statistically significant decreases of LUEgreen. Convergence of LUEgreen to a narrow range in irrigated and rainfed crops brought important implications for understanding mechanisms of plant response to stress and remote estimation of primary production in crops.

AB In this study the variability of Atlantic Water (AW) entering the Nordic Seas from the North Atlantic through the passage between Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Scotland has been investigated. The poleward transport of this warm AW is a key component in maintaining a relatively mild climate in the northwestern Europe. Satellite remote sensing datasets from altimetry and the Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission, in combination with surface drifters, fixed current meter, and hydrographic data are used. The high-resolution mean dynamic topography (MDT) is shown to resolve the time-invariant surface currents in the inflow region. In addition to the improved MDT, we take benefit of the new reprocessed sea level anomaly data in the estimation of absolute dynamic topography. Analysis of the monthly surface velocities from 1993 to 2016 demonstrates significant influence of the large scale atmospheric forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Furthermore, a significant increase in surface velocities along the slope current, front current and the Norwegian Coastal Current are found during winter. Finally, combining altimetry with hydrographic data, we demonstrate that the variability in surface velocities of the inflow region is also reflected in the deeper layers, and that altimetry therefore can be used to monitor the variability of the poleward transport of AW in this region.

AB Urban geometry and materials combine to create complex spatial, temporal and directional patterns of longwave infrared (LWIR) radiation. Effective anisotropy (or directional variability) of thermal radiance causes remote sensing (RS) derived urban surface temperatures to vary with RS view angles. Here a new and novel method to resolve effective thermal anisotropy processes from LWIR camera observations is demonstrated at the Comprehensive Outdoor Scale MOdel (COSMO) test site. Pixel-level differences of brightness temperatures reach 18.4 K within one hour of a 24-h study period. To understand this variability, the orientation and shadowing of surfaces is explored using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Blender three-dimensional (3D) rendering software. Observed pixels and the entire canopy surface are classified in terms of surface orientation and illumination. To assess the variability of exitant longwave radiation (M-LW) from the 3D COSMO surface (M-LW(3D)), the observations are prescribed based on class. The parameterisation is tested by simulating thermal images using a camera view model to determine camera perspectives of M-LW(3D) fluxes. The mean brightness temperature differences per image (simulated and observed) are within 0.65 K throughout a 24-h period. Pixel-level comparisons are possible with the high spatial resolution of M(LW)(3D )and DART camera view simulations. At this spatial scale ( < 0.10 m), shadow hysteresis, surface sky view factor and building edge effects are not completely resolved by M-LW(3D). By simulating apparent brightness temperatures from multiple view directions, effective thermal anisotropy of M(LW)(3D )is shown to be up to 6.18 K. The developed methods can be extended to resolve some of the identified sources of sub-facet variability in realistic urban settings. The extension of DART to the interpretation of ground-based RS is shown to be promising.

AB Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly benefit from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at fine spatial resolution. Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R-2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of nonphotosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.

AB The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 satellite can provide remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) of aquatic environments with high spatial resolution (30 m), allowing for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring of bathymetry and water column optical properties. To facilitate these applications, accurate sensor-derived R-rs is required. In this study, we assess atmospheric correction schemes, including NASA's NIR-SWIR approach, Acolite's NIR and SWIR approaches and the cloud-shadow approach. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 R-rs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 R-rs products in a temperate turbid embayment. The obtained Landsat-8 R-rs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral R-rs measurements. Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable R-rs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters. This evaluation suggests that high quality R-rs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies.

AB Global vegetation dynamics are of critical importance for understanding changes in ecosystem structure and functioning and their responses to different natural and anthropogenic drivers. Under the background of rapid global warming, it is still unclear whether there were significant changes in the extent and intensity of global vegetation browning during the past three decades. Taking satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the proxy of vegetation growth, we investigated spatiotemporal variances in global vegetation trends during the period 1982-2013 using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and two piecewise linear regression models. Our study suggests that increasing global vegetation browning is masked by overall vegetation greening. A > 60% increase in browning area was found during the study period, and the results consistently indicate that the expansion of browning trends has accelerated since 1994. After the late 1990s, browning trends increased in all latitudinal bands in the Northern Hemisphere. This increase was particularly pronounced in the northern mid-low latitudes, where the greening trends stalled or even reversed. Areas with browning trends increased in all land cover types, although the increase processes varied substantially. During 1982-2013, although most vegetated lands exhibited overall greening trends, greening-to-browning reversals occurred on all continents and occupied a much larger area than browning-to-greening reversals. Greening trends prevailed before the turning points, and browning trends largely expanded and enhanced thereafter. The increased browning trends resulted in a slowdown of the increase in global mean NDVI since the early 1990s. Since drought is likely the main cause of the increasing browning trends, global vegetation growth is at risk of reversal from long-term greening to long-term browning in the warmer future.

AB Monitoring biodiversity is essential for the conservation and management of forest resources. A method called "spectranomics" that maps the diversity of forest species based on species-driven leaf optical traits using imaging spectroscopy has been developed for tropical forests in earlier studies. In this study we applied the "spectranomics" method in combination with airborne hyperspectral (PHI-3 sensor with 1 m spatial resolution) and LiDAR ( > 4 points/m(2)) data to first identify interspecies variations in biochemical and structural properties of trees and then estimate the tree species diversity within the Shennongjia Forest Nature Reserve in China. Firstly, we used the watershed algorithm based on morphological crown control to isolate individual tree crowns (ITCs) from the LiDAR data. For each ITC, we then calculated seven vegetation indices (VIs) representing key biochemical properties from the hyperspectral data and additionally derived the LiDAR-based tree height which was identified to support the discrimination of the tree species in a preceding analysis. Finally we utilized the combination of the seven selected VIs and tree height as input to a self-adaptive Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The FCM algorithm was applied to fixed subsets of 30 m x 30 m and it was assumed that the number of clusters identified within a subset represents the number of occurring species. The species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index calculated from the clustering outputs correlated well with the field reference data (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.25). The results show that forest species diversity can be directly predicted using the suggested clustering method based on crown-by-crown variations in biochemical and structural properties in the examined subtropical forest without the need to distinguish the individual tree species.

AB This article describes a new algorithm for the detection and delineation of tree crowns using optical sub-meter resolution satellite images. The algorithm focuses on detecting individual semi-isolated trees in a variety of environments defined as trees outside forests (TOF). The concept of Marked Point Processes (MPPs), which alternates phases of "birth" and "death" iterations to satisfy a density factor was used as a theoretical basis. The "mark" in the MPP represents the object being sought. Unlike most applications of MPP to object recognition, the mark used in our algorithm is computed from a 3D geometrical optical model artificially lit using the same illumination parameters as the image itself. Because trees differ in size, the process also incorporates a tree crown radius variable. The algorithm is tested on four sub-meter satellite images, each in a different environment. Validation was performed on both detection and delineation. The detection was based on tree crown counting and yielded an accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.95 for the four images. The delineation accuracy was estimated based on the crown pixel count and yielded an accuracy of approximate to 0.63 (0.57-0.72).

AB A field campaign was conducted October 30th to November 13th, 2015 with the intention of capturing diurnal soil freeze/thaw state at multiple scales using ground measurements and remote sensing measurements. On four of the five sampling days, we observed a significant difference between morning (frozen scenario) and afternoon (thawed scenario) ground-based measurements of the soil relative permittivity. These results were supported by an in situ soil moisture and temperature network (installed at the scale of a spaceborne passive microwave pixel) which indicated surface soil temperatures fell below 0 degrees C for the same four sampling dates. Ground-based radiometers appeared to be highly sensitive to F/T conditions of the very surface of the soil and indicated normalized polarization index (NPR) values that were below the defined freezing values during the morning sampling period on all sampling dates. The Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP) instrumentation, flown over the study region, showed very good agreement with the ground-based radiometers, with freezing states observed on all four days that the airborne observations covered the fields with ground-based radiometers. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite had morning overpasses on three of the sampling days, and indicated frozen conditions on two of those days. It was found that > 60% of the in situ network had to indicate surface temperatures below 0 degrees C before SMAP indicated freezing conditions. This was also true of the SLAP radiometer measurements. The SMAP, SLAP and ground-based radiometer measurements all indicated freezing conditions when soil temperature sensors installed at 5 cm depth were not frozen.

AB The decrease in vegetation cover is one of the main triggering factors for soil erosion of grasslands. Within the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a model commonly used to describe soil erosion, the vegetation cover for grassland is expressed in the cover and management factor (C-factor). The site-specific C-factor is a combination of the relative erosion susceptibility of a particular plant development stage (here expressed as soil loss ratio SLR) and the corresponding rainfall pattern (here expressed as R-factor ratio). Thus, for grasslands the fraction of green vegetation cover (FGVC) determines the SLRs. Although Switzerland is a country dominated by grassland with high percentages of mountainous regions and evidence for high erosion rates of grassland exists, soil erosion risk modeling of grasslands and especially of mountainous grasslands in Switzerland is restricted to a few studies. Here, we present a spatio-temporal approach to assess the dynamics of the C-factor for Swiss grasslands and to identify erosion prone regions and seasons simultaneously. We combine different satellite data, aerial data, and derivative products like Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, Swissimage false-color infrared (Swissimage FCIR), PROBA-V Fraction of green Vegetation Cover (FCover300m), and MODIS Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global (MOD13Q1) for the FGVC mapping of grasslands. In the spatial mapping, the FGVC is extracted from Swissimage FCIR (spat. res. 2 m) by linear spectral unmixing (LSU). The spatially derived results are then fused with the 10-day deviations of temporal FGVC derived by FCover300m. Following the original RUSLE approach, the combined FGVC are transformed to SLRs and weighted with high spatiotemporal resolved ratios of R-factors to result in spatio-temporal C-factors for Swiss grasslands. The annual average C-factor of all Swiss grasslands is 0.012. Seasonal and regional patterns (low C in winter, high C in summer, dependency on elevation) are recognizable in the spatio-temporal mapping approach. They are mainly explicable by the R-factor distribution within a year. Knowledge about the spatio-temporal dynamic of erosion triggering factors is of high interest for agronomists who can introduce areal and time specific selective erosion control measures and thereby reduce the direct costs of mitigation as well as erosion measures.

AB We constructed a bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) observation system on a 25-m-high tower surrounded by mature larch forests at the foot of Mt. Yatsugatake, central Japan. The BRDF feature (strong/weak reflections in a backward/forward scattering areas) is related closely to the 3D structure and biophysical parameters of forests. However, because of the difficulty of observations, observational BRDF data of mature forests are scarce, except for those of Boreal Ecosystem -Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). We made BRDF observations 10 times during 2007 to ascertain BRDF characteristics in each season. For comparison to these BRDF data, a semi-empirical BRDF model (Ross-thick-Li sparse kernel model) was introduced. This model can reproduce the BRDF data fairly well under identical solar conditions in each season. Then, seasonal changes of the vegetation structure and possible relations with BRDF were discussed. They are summarized as follows: (1) The forest BRDF changes distinctly and seasonally depending on the phenology. (2) The forest BRDF is influenced primarily by clarity of the geometrical profile on the forest surface, which is affected by shadow. However, the forest BRDF might be influenced by other factors such as the physiological characteristics of leaves and slight change of vegetation structure such as forest floor conditions and leaf angles during summer. (3) Features of forest BRDF must therefore appear during summer when the crown shape is distinctive. Furthermore, BRDF features appear distinctly as seasons progress, e.g., by autumn leaves and defoliation, when the unevenness of forests increases. These findings can promote monitoring of vegetation using multi-angular satellite observations.

AB Remote sensing estimates of forest canopy cover have frequently been used to support a variety of applications including wildlife habitat modeling, monitoring of watershed health, change detection, and are also correlated to various aspects of forest structure and ecosystem function. Although data from the long running Landsat earth observation program (1972-present) have been previously utilized to characterize forest canopy cover, the variability in spatial and spectral resolutions between the Landsat sensors has generally limited analyses to readily comparable imagery from the TM and ETM + sensors, which omits large portions of the full temporal record. In this study, we present an R package, LandsatLinkr, which automates the processes for harmonizing Landsat MSS and OLI imagery to the spatial and spectral qualities of TM and ETM + imagery, allowing for the generation of annual cloud-free composites of tasseled cap spectral indices across the entire Landsat archive. We demonstrate the utility of LandsatLinkr products, further enhanced through the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm, for characterizing forest attributes through time by developing annual forest masks and maps of estimated canopy cover for the state of Minnesota from 1973 to 2015. The forest mask model had an overall accuracy of 87%, with omission and commission errors for the forest class of 17% and 10%, respectively, and 9% and 16% for non-forest classification. Our resulting maps depicted a significant positive trend in forest cover across all ecological provinces of Minnesota during the study period. A random forest model used to predict continuous canopy cover had a pseudo R-2 of 0.75, with a cross validation RMSE of 5%. Our results are comparable to previous Landsat-based canopy cover mapping efforts, but expand the evaluation time period as we were able to utilize the entire Landsat archive for assessment.

AB Despite being one of the most important and well-studied coral reefs in the world, the full extent of coral habitat of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not well mapped and there is no current and comprehensive map of the GBR's geomorphic zonation or benthic composition. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the "shallow offshore reefs" of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15m x 15m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large (similar to 2500 km(2)) reef system, of which 245 km(2) was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km(2) of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.

AB During the last decades, satellite observations have increasingly been used to study the global water cycle over land. Although their value is now appreciated by the hydrological community, they are still limited by their uncertainties and their inability to close the water budget. In a previous study, we optimally integrated several datasets for each component (precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage change and discharge) to close this budget at a basin scale. Furthermore, an independent and simple calibration of each satellite dataset was designed to reduce the budget residual. In this paper, we extend the calibration procedure to the global scale. Pixels are first classified into surface types characterized by their NDVI and net precipitation values. We show that the global calibration transforms the original datasets towards a consensus that is hydrologically more coherent, with a budget residual reduced by 26%. The calibrated datasets are compared to ground-based observations, showing an improvement for more than 65% of the sites tested. This opens new perspectives to generate long-term datasets at global scale based purely on all available satellites observations, which describe all the terrestrial water components useful for climate purposes. Beyond the simple calibration presented here, inconsistencies among the various satellite datasets can be used as a proxy for satellite observation uncertainties. The quality of our calibration procedure is constrained by the availability of discharge measurements, and could therefore be improved in the future, as discharge measurement networks become more extensive.

AB Global data on settlements, built-up land and population distributions are becoming increasingly available and represent important inputs to a better understanding of key demographic processes such as urbanization and interactions between human and natural systems over time. One persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi temporal built-up land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38 m), in the United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas, generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving classification procedures to create measures of the built environment. The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.

   MODEL
AB Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (Pol-InSAR) has shown great promise for estimating the height of agricultural crops through the inversion of a scattering model of the plant canopy and the soil. The inversion also provides estimates of model parameters describing the microwave attenuation within the canopy and the relative scattering contributions from canopy and soil surface.
   Here, we investigate how vegetation characteristics including biomass, water content (VWC) and canopy structure are related to these parameters and provide a first assessment of the potential of estimating such characteristics using Pol-InSAR time series in L-, C- and X-Bands.
   The overall attenuation for maize is positively related to total VWC in L- and C-Bands. Furthermore, larger attenuation in W than HH points toward the existence of anisotropic propagation effects due to vertical orientation of the stalks.
   Conversely, for wheat in C- and X-Bands there is no consistent relation between attenuation loss and VWC. Rather, structural changes occurring within the plant growth cycle appear to have an appreciable polarization dependent effect on the observed attenuation changes.
   In addition, the estimated normalized volume backscattering power NVP (a measure of the relative scattering contribution from the canopy compared to the underlying soil) is associated with wet biomass. However, the contrasting sign of this relation (negative for maize in L- and C-Bands; positive for wheat in C- and X-Bands) indicates again the role of crop structural properties in the Pol-InSAR measurements. For instance, the NVP for maize in L- and C-Bands appears to decrease with increasing biomass due to the increasingly important double bounce ground-stalk scattering contribution as plants become taller and thicker.
   Overall, these results indicate the sensitivity of the Pol-InSAR parameters to canopy structure and biomass; this sensitivity is however dependent, amongst others, on crop type and radar frequency. When choosing an appropriate baseline/frequency configuration, the Pol-InSAR attenuation loss and NVP may complement the information of the estimated crop height, especially if the latter shows very little variation over the plant growth cycle (e.g. as for wheat).

AB Current remote sensing applications of bio-geophysical parameter estimation and image classification have to deal with an unprecedented big amount of heterogeneous and complex data sources. New satellite sensors involving a high number of improved time, space and wavelength resolutions give rise to challenging computational problems. Standard physical inversion techniques cannot cope efficiently with this new scenario. Dealing with land cover classification of the new image sources has also turned to be a complex problem requiring large amount of memory and processing time. In order to cope with these problems, statistical learning has greatly helped in the last years to develop statistical retrieval and classification models that can ingest large amounts of Earth observation data. Kernel methods constitute a family of powerful machine learning algorithms, which have found wide use in remote sensing and geosciences. However, kernel methods are still not widely adopted because of the high computational cost when dealing with large scale problems, such as the inversion of radiative transfer models or the classification of high spatial spectral -temporal resolution data. This paper introduces to the remote sensing community an efficient kernel method for fast statistical retrieval of atmospheric and biophysical parameters and image classification problems. We rely on a recently presented approximation to shift-invariant kernels using projections on random Fourier features. The method proposes an explicit mapping function defined through a set of projections randomly sampled from the Fourier domain. It is proved to approximate the implicit mapping of a kernel function. This allows to deal with large-scale data but taking advantage of kernel methods. The method is simple, computationally very efficient in both memory and processing costs, and easily parallelizable. We show that kernel regression and classification is now possible for datasets with millions of samples. Examples on atmospheric parameter retrieval from hyperspectral infrared sounders like IASI/Metop; large scale emulation and inversion of the familiar PROSAIL radiative transfer model on Sentinel-2 data; and the identification of clouds over landmarks in time series of MSG/Seviri images show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB This paper describes a SAR image focuser application exploiting General-purpose Computing On Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), developed within the European Space Agency (ESA) funded SARIPA project. Instead of relying on distributed technologies, such as clustering or High-performance Computing (HPC), the SARIPA processor is designed to run on a single computer equipped with multiple GPUs. To exploit the computational power of the latter, while retaining a high level of hardware portability, SARIPA is written using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework rather than the more widespread Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This allows the application to exploit both GPUs and CPUs without requiring any code modification or duplication. A further level of optimization is achieved thanks to a software architecture, which mimics a distributed computing environment, although implemented on a single machine. SARIPA's performance is demonstrated on ENVISAT ASAR Stripmap imagery, for which a real-time performance of 8.5 s is achieved, and on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wideswath (IW) raw data products, for which a near-real time processing time of about 1 min is required. Such a performance has the potential of significantly reducing the storage requirements for wide-area monitoring applications, by avoiding the need of maintaining large permanent archives of Level 1 (focused) imagery, in favor of lighter Level 0 (raw) products, which can be focused on-the-fly within the user's application processing pipelines at almost no overhead.

AB We developed a new algorithm called MFmask (Mountainous Fmask) for automated cloud and cloud shadow detection for Landsats 4-8 images acquired in mountainous areas. The MFmask algorithm, built upon the success of the Fmask algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012; Zhu et al., 2015), is designed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, where the Fmask algorithm is not performing well. The inputs of the MFmask algorithm include Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, Brightness Temperature (BT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Compared to Fmask, MFmask can separate water and land pixels better in mountainous areas with the aid of DEMs. Moreover, MFmask produces better cloud detection results than Fmask in mountainous areas after BT is linearly normalized by DEMs. To provide more accurate cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, MFmask uses a double-projection approach to better predict cloud shadow shape on slope side. Additionally, MFmask applies a topographic correction to remove terrain shadows and estimates cloud base height with neighboring clouds. Both will reduce the possibility of cloud and cloud shadow mismatch and increase cloud shadow detection accuracy for places with large topographic gradient. To test the performance of the proposed MFmask algorithm, a total of 67 Landsat images acquired in mountainous areas from different parts of the world were selected for assessing the accuracy of cloud detection, in which 15 of them were used for assessing the accuracy of cloud shadow detection. Compared with Fmask, MFmask can provide substantial improvements in cloud and cloud shadow detection accuracies for places with large topographic gradient and also work well for relatively flat terrain.

AB Grassland use intensity and its impact on biodiversity and water pollution is a topic of growing interest. In ecological studies, intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i) mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators. Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use. The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were distinguished: i) medium intensive (46%), ii) low intensive (37%), and iii) high intensive (17%). We discuss the combination of high mowing frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out preserving independence between methods.

AB One of the benefits of model-based inference relative to design-based inference is that probability samples are not required which means that models can be constructed using data external to the area of interest. Although "external" usually means spatially or geographically external, it could also be used in the temporal sense that the model is constructed using data whose dates are temporally external to the dates of the data to which the model is applied. This study focuses on assessing the effects of such temporally external application data on model-based inference using remotely sensed auxiliary information. The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample of 160 field plots was selected from the population and measured, and auxiliary datasets from Landsat 8 were acquired. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, was estimated; and the variance of the population mean,Var((mu) over cap), was estimated using both an analytical variance estimator, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), and an empirical bootstrap estimator, V (mu) over cap (boot). The estimates, (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap, were compared for models constructed using calibration and application data of the same date and models constructed using calibration and application data whose dates differed. The primary results were twofold. First, for cases for which the dates of the model calibration and application data were the same, (mu) over cap, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot) and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were similar across datasets. These results suggest that the particular date of the dataset from which the calibration and application data are obtained may be mostly arbitrary assuming the relation between the dependent and independent variables does not change over time. Second, for a model for which the calibration and application data were obtained from temporally different datasets, (mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot), and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were all greater than when the calibration and application data were not temporally different. Further, the criterion for screening candidate models must be based on estimation of (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap rather than the model prediction accuracy or goodness of fit. The adverse effects of differing dates for the calibration and application data were exacerbated as the difference in dates increased. Finally, because the temporal differences also affected the analytical variance calculation, the bootstrapping procedure is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The variability of leaf water content has considerable significance for plant-environment interactions, ecosystem functioning and crop growth. This paper describes a methodology used to create spectral similarity water indices (SWIs) to accurately retrieve leaf water content based on the similarity between the leaf reflectance spectra and the specific water absorption spectrum. The abilities of six common distance metrics to capture spectral features were tested using two in situ datasets (LOPEX93 and PANAMA) and one simulation dataset (PROSPECT). These three datasets were also used to determine the most appropriate spectral intervals and to verify the performance of SWIs against six frequently used spectral indices that were specifically designed to estimate vegetation water content. Our results demonstrate that the Spectral Angle Cosine (SAC) is the most effective metric to capture useful spectral information pertinent to the equivalent water thickness (EWT), and three spectral intervals (9701150, 1330-1350 and 1584-1760 nm) are suitable for the retrieval of leaf water content. The SWIs were then created based on the SAC distances in these three spectral intervals respectively. The results demonstrate that SWISAC indices are better indicators of leaf water content and more tolerant to species differences than the six spectral indices, including the Shortwave Angle Normalized Index (SANI), Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SASI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Maximum Difference Water Index (MDWI). In addition, the most accurate estimates of EWT were achieved from a single SAC distance with nRMSE of 4.08% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.98), 3.63% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.95) and 8.11% ((R) over bar (2) = 0.80) for PROSPECT, LOPEX93 and PANAMA, respectively. Models that combine two SAC distances from the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions produce an even better overall performance. Spectral similarity metrics may be a new effective tool to capture useful spectral information pertinent to leaf biochemical components, not only EWT but also other components such as chlorophyll and nitrogen content and they have potential to be adapted to canopy level observations.

AB The use of sky cameras for nocturnal aerosol characterization is discussed in this study. Two sky cameras are con-figured to take High Dynamic Range (HDR) images at Granada and Valladolid (Spain). Some properties of the cameras, like effective wavelengths, sky coordinates of each pixel and pixel sensitivity, are characterized. After that, normalized camera radiances at lunar almucantar points (up to 20 degrees in azimuth from the Moon) are obtained at three effective wavelengths from the HDR images. These normalized radiances are compared in different case studies to simulations fed with AERONET aerosol information, giving satisfactory results. The obtained uncertainty of normalized camera radiances is around 10% at 533 nm and 608 nm and 14% for 469 nm. Normalized camera radiances and six spectral aerosol optical depth values (obtained from lunar photometry) are used as input in GRASP code (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) to retrieve aerosol properties for a dust episode over Valladolid. The retrieved aerosol properties (refractive indices, fraction of spherical particles and size distribution parameters) are in agreement with the nearest diurnal AERONET products. The calculated GRASP retrieval at night time shows an increase in coarse mode concentration along the night, while fine mode properties remained constant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The poor constraint of forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is responsible, in part, for large uncertainties in modelling future climate scenarios. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can be used to derive unbiased and non-destructive estimates of tree structure and volume and can, therefore, be used to address key uncertainties in forest AGB estimates. Here we review our experience of TLS sampling strategies from 27 campaigns conducted over the past 5 years, across tropical and temperate forest plots, where data was captured with a RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner. The focus is on strategies to derive Geometrical Modelling metrics (e.g. tree volume) over forest plots (>= 1 ha) which require the accurate co-registration of 10s to 100s of individual point clouds. We recommend a 10 m x 10 m sampling grid as an approach to produce a point cloud with a uniform point distribution, that can resolve higher order branches (down to a few cm in diameter) towards the top of 30+ m canopies and can be captured in a timely fashion i.e. (similar to)3-6 days per ha. A data acquisition protocol, such as presented here, would facilitate data interoperability and inter-comparison of metrics between instruments/groups, from plot to plot and over time.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter associated with the land-atmosphere interface. Satellite remote sensing is the most effective method of measuring LST at regional and global scales. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements are widely used to retrieve LST with high accuracy and high spatial resolution but are limited to cloud-free conditions due to their inability to penetrate clouds. By contrast, satellite passive microwave (PMW) measurements are capable of penetrating clouds and providing data regardless of the cloud conditions. However, PMW measurements have limitations, such as a low spatial resolution and low temperature retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, temperature retrieval from PMW measurements yields the subsurface temperature, which differs from the LST retrieved from TIR measurements (skin temperature). This study proposes a framework for the retrieval of all-weather LST at a high spatial resolution by combining the advantages of TIR and PMW measurements. Compared to the MODIS LST product, the all-weather LST reflects the spatial variations in LST accurately. In situ LST measurements at four sites in an arid area of northwest China were used to evaluate the accuracy of the all-weather LST. The root mean square error of the LST under cloud-free conditions was approximately 2 K, whereas that of the LST under cloudy conditions varied from 3.5 K to 4.4 K. The results indicate that the all-weather LST retrieval algorithm can provide an IST dataset with reasonable accuracy and a high spatial resolution under clear and cloudy conditions.

AB In light of Earth's changing climate and growing human population, there is an urgent need to improve monitoring of natural and anthropogenic disturbances which effect forests' ability to sequester carbon and provide other ecosystem services. In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one. Out of bag (OOB) predictions from RF showed that across the ten scenes, overall agreement was highest when only causal agent was considered (avg = 80%, min = 69%, max = 86%), and was lowest when both agent and year (within 1 of the reference date) were required to be correct (avg = 71%, min = 56%, max = 80%). Across scene omission and commission errors for fire and stable forest classes were mostly around 10% to 20%, respectively. Harvests were also modeled well, as five of nine test scenes had error rates <26%. Accuracy of the wind and stress classes were much more variable with model errors ranging from 24% to 88%. The years assigned by the rule-based model were reasonably accurate, as 88% of all disturbances were assigned a year that fell within 2 years of the reference date. Fire disturbances were assigned the correct year 78% of the time, followed by harvest (69%) and conversion (54%). Although 17% and 63% of wind and stress disturbances were under-estimated by S or more years, the impact on overall accuracy was nominal given these two classes only accounted for roughly 5% of all disturbances. Our results also revealed that causal agent models summarized to broader disturbed/not disturbed classes were as accurate as models specifically constructed to predict binary disturbance, thus there appears to be no advantage to modeling disturbance prior to assigning causality. A relative evaluation of mean decrease in accuracy from RF showed that although a wide range of predictor variables contributed to the successful modeling of causal agents and stable forest (e.g. patch metrics, forest occurrence, and topography), disturbance variables (e.g. MTBS) and spectral change metrics (e.g. absolute and relative magnitude) were by far the most important. Modeled causality maps and annual disturbance rates were examined and found to be in good agreement with existing literature and other published data sets. Lastly, results are used to make recommendations for mapping forest disturbance agents nationally across the U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Future space-borne imaging spectrometers could enable global comparative analyses of urban composition. In particular, the high spectral resolution of imaging spectrometry could improve the discrimination of materials that have similar spectral signatures but are functionally dissimilar, such as turfgrass and trees. However, the amount of reflected energy needed to measure narrow-band reflectance with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios means that space-borne imaging spectrometry data will be collected at relatively coarse spatial resolutions, potentially limiting its usefulness for mapping urban composition. In this study, we use Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer-Classic and -Next Generation imaging spectrometry acquired in the summer of 2014 over the Santa Barbara, California area to quantify sub-pixel urban composition at fine (4 m) and coarse (18 m) spatial resolutions. We develop and compare spectral libraries of single- and multiple-resolution endmembers, and use Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis to estimate sub-pixel fractions of spectrally dissimilar materials (vegetation, impervious, pervious) as well as pairs of spectrally similar materials (turfgrass and tree, paved and roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil) at both resolutions. Fractions were validated using 1 m orthophotography. Overall, fractional accuracy was affected by the spatial resolution of the spectral library and image, and the (dis)similarity of the measured classes. Spectral libraries of multiple-resolution endmembers performed better than single-resolution libraries, likely because they increase within-class variance by capturing multiple levels of material variability that occur across spatial scales. A positive relationship was observed between pixel size and the number of sub-pixel materials, however significant pixel mixing occurred at 4 m resolution, with an average of 48% of all pixels modeled by more than one endmember. Fractional estimates produced by the best performing libraries at 4 m and 18 m resolution correlated with validation fractions, with mean R-2 > 0.89 for spectrally dissimilar classes and mean R-2 > 0.76 for spectrally similar classes. These results demonstrate the scalability of fractional estimates of urban materials using imaging spectrometry, suggesting its potential for future global urban analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste.

AB Remote sensing of plant carbon uptake, or gross primary production (GPP), in a repeatable and consistent manner remains a key element of a comprehensive understanding of the role of vegetation within the global carbon cycle. To further this understanding at a landscape level or global scale, accurate remote sensing of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) is required to understand photosynthetic down-regulation and environmental constraints to plant photosynthesis. The past decade has seen advances in detecting both leaf-and canopy-level physiological stress behaviours using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), a narrow-waveband normalized difference index that relates LUE to a xanthophyll-induced absorption feature at 531 nm. To date, however, much of this research has occurred using top of canopy measurements, while our understanding of the vertical distribution of LUE within the crown is limited. In this study, we demonstrate an approach which could be used to scale photosynthetic behaviour of vegetation vertically and horizontally using estimates of vertical canopy structure obtained from terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to predict proportions of shaded and sunlit canopy which are then linked to predictions of LUE. We apply the approach over a mature Aspen study site located in central Saskatchewan, Canada utilising full-waveform LiDAR data provided by the ground-based laser scanner system and canopy spectra obtained by the AMSPEC II spectro-radiometer. Agreement between predictions of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using the developed approach compared to independent observations was highly significant at hourly intervals (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.01) under clear sky conditions. A range of LUE vertical profiles for different stand structures across the growing season were developed providing estimations of how crown structure can impact LUE vertically in the crown. We conclude with a recommendation for ongoing research to verify these types of trends using concurrently acquired, independently derived leaf LUE from photosynthesis light-response curves, and forest structure variation from LiDAR, to provide a more exact quantification of these patterns.

AB Real-time prediction of vegetation phenology is critical for assisting crop monitoring, natural resource management, and land modeling in weather prediction systems. However, due to the lack of timely available satellite datasets and the inherent noise in time series, little attention has been paid to real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. The successful launch of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument onboard operational Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite makes this research possible because it can provide land surface observations in a timely fashion. This study introduces an operational system that provides real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. Specifically, the system integrates timely available VIIRS observations and the climatology (expectation and standard deviation) of vegetation phenology from long-term MODIS data to simulate a set of potential temporal trajectories of greenness development at a given time for each pixel. These potential trajectories are then applied to identify spring green leaf development in real time, predict the occurrence of greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, and analyze the uncertainty of the prediction across a variety of ecosystems in North America. The accuracy of real-time and short-term predictions was evaluated by comparing with standard VIIRS detections and near-surface PhenoCam observations in both 2014 and 2015 across North America. The results showed that the real-time prediction of spring phenological metrics from VIIRS were all significantly correlated with those derived from PhenoCam datasets (R-2> 0.96, P< 0.01) and closely comparable to the standard VIIRS detections with a mean absolute difference of <10 days, 5 days and 5 days in greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, respectively. The mean absolute difference in the northern region for all three events was relatively smaller than that in the southern region. These findings demonstrate the capability of VIIRS observations to effectively predict temporal dynamics of vegetation phenology in real time at a continental scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of image-based three-dimensional data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has proven effective for forest inventories. However, limitations in the range of UAV operations hinder their use in large scale applications. Use of partial-coverage UAV data in combination with field plots may increase precision of field-based estimates of forest resource parameters and may offer a cost-effective alternative to wall-to-wall acquisition. In this study, data from UAV collected in systematically distributed blocks and combined with field plots in a two-phase design with hybrid inference (UAV(HYB)) were used to estimate mean volume and its precision (standard error) for a 7330 ha forest area in Norway. Because in UAV(HYB) the field data do not necessarily need to come from a probability sample, the approach offers great flexibility in field data collection. The estimate of precision using UAV(HYB) was compared to two alternative inventory approaches differing in terms of sampling design and mode of inference, i.e., (1) single-phase probabilistic sampling relying only on field samples for which the design-based approach to inference using simple random sampling estimators was adopted (FIELDDB) and (2) a model-based approach independent from design assumptions for which wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning data were applied (ALS(MB)). Relative efficiency (RE), calculated as the ratio between the estimated variances of two different inventory approaches, was used as measure for improvement in variance for one approach over the other. Comparison of UAVHYB against FIELDDB revealed that the use of the former was up to four times more efficient than the latter (RE = 4.4). This translates to a need for 4.4 times as many field plots under simple random sampling for a FIELDDB estimate to be equally precise as the UAV(HYB) estimate. For ALS(MB) the increase in efficiency compared to UAV(HYB) was limited (RE = 1.6). The study also demonstrated that the precision under UAV(HYB) can be improved when including additional field data from other inventories to enhance the model. Cost estimates for each inventory approach were compared, revealing that UAV may be a cost-effective tool for large scale forest resource assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of light use efficiency (LUE) of plant canopies is essential for calculating gross primary productivity (GPP) using LUE models and is also useful for calibrating process-based models for regional and global applications. A promising method for estimating LUE is through remote sensing of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). However, there are internal (e.g. pigment concentrations) and external factors (e.g. environmental conditions and sun-target-view geometry) that affect PRI signals. Considering the reflectance difference between sunlit and shaded leaves, the ratio of observed canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is used to represent the observed fraction of sunlit leaves, and the observed fraction of shaded leaves is calculated with a geometrical optical model. Thus, a canopy-level PRI observation is separated into sunlit and shaded PRI values, and a two-leaf canopy PRI (PRIt) is calculated as sum of these two values weighted by their respective sunlit and shaded leaf area indices. The usefulness of PRIt in assessing the canopy-level. LUE is evaluated with automated multi-angle PRI observations acquired on a flux tower from April to September 2013 over a sub-tropical coniferous forest in southern China. In each 15-minute observation cycle, PRI is observed at four view zenith angles fixed at (37 degrees, 47 degrees, 57 degrees) or (42 degrees, 52 degrees, 62 degrees) and the instantaneous solar zenith angle in the azimuth angle range from 45 degrees to 325 degrees (from the geodetic north). In both the half-hourly and daily time steps, PRIt can effectively improve (>50% and >35% increases in R-2, respectively) the ability as a proxy of LUE derived from the tower flux measurements over the big-leaf PRI taken as the arithmetic average of the multi-angle measurements in a given time interval. In the dry season from July to September, correlations of PRI with LUE at daily time steps are much stronger in the two-leaf case than in the big-leaf case. The correlation between PRIt and LUE is the strongest (R-2 = 0.785, p < 0.001) in July. PRIt is very effective in detecting the light and low-moderate drought stress on LUE at half-hourly time steps, while ineffective in detecting severe atmospheric water and heat stress, which is probably due to alternative radiative energy sink, i.e. photorespiration. Overall, the two-leaf approach well overcomes some external effects (e.g. sun-target-view geometry) that interfere with PRI signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter to monitor surface energy and water fluxes but the strong impact of topography on CST has limited its use to mostly flat areas. To fill the gap, this study proposes a physically-based method to normalize LST data for topographic-namely illumination and elevation-effects over mountainous areas. Both topographic effects are first quantified by inverting a dual-source soil/vegetation energy balance (EB) model forced by 1) the instantaneous solar radiation simulated by a 3D radiative transfer model named DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) that uses a digital elevation model (DEM), 2) a satellite-derived vegetation index, and 3) local meteorological (air temperature, air relative humidity and wind speed) data available at a given location. The satellite LST is then normalized for topography by simulating the LST using both pixel- and image-scale DART solar radiation and elevation data. The approach is tested on three ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) overpass dates over a steep-sided 6 km by 6 km area in the Atlas Mountain in Morocco. The mean correlation coefficient and root mean square difference (RMSD) between EB-simulated and ASTER LST is 0.80 and 3 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the EB-based method is found to be more accurate than a more classical approach based on a multi-linear regression with DART solar radiation and elevation data. The EB-simulated LST is also evaluated against an extensive ground dataset of 135 autonomous 1-cm depth temperature sensors deployed over the study area. While the mean RMSD between 90 m resolution ASTER LST and localized ibutton measurements is 6.1 degrees C, the RMSD between EB-simulated LST and ibutton soil temperature is 5.4 and 5.3 degrees C for a DEM at 90 m and 8 m resolution, respectively. The proposed topographic normalization is self-calibrated from (LST, DEM, vegetation index and in situ meteorological data) data available over large extents. As a significant perspective this approach opens the path to using normalized CST as input to evapotranspiration retrieval methods based on LST. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we inter-compare observed and modeled Ku-, X- and C-band microwave backscatter for two snow temperature conditions for a highly saline snow cover on smooth first-year sea ice. A new surface-based multi frequency (Ku-, X- and C-bands) microwave scatterometer system is used quasi-coincident with in situ geophysical snow measurements. A multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate the total co-polarized backscatter coefficient for two snow temperature conditions. The model provides the surface and volume scattering contributions for each snow layer, as well as the frequency-dependent penetration depth. These results aid interpretation of observed backscatter. Joint use of Ku-, X- and C-band microwaves provide an enhanced understanding of diverse variations in geophysical, thermodynamic and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. Our results indicate that the effect of dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers is the dominant factor affecting microwave penetration and backscatter from all three frequencies. The observed and modeled C band backscatter shows good agreement, followed by X- and Ku-bands, at both snow temperature conditions. Microwave backscatter shows greater sensitivity to variations in plot-scale surface roughness, for all three frequencies. Additionally, Ku-band wavelength exhibits greater sensitivity to snow grain radius, over X-, and C bands. Our results demonstrate the future potential of a multi-frequency approach towards the development of snow thickness and snow water equivalent algorithms on first-year sea ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The gradual increase in Landsat-class data availability creates new opportunities for fire science and management applications that require higher-fidelity information about biomass burning, improving upon existing coarser spatial resolution (>= 1 km) satellite active fire data sets. Targeting those enhanced capabilities we describe an active fire detection algorithm for use with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) daytime and nighttime data. The approach builds on the fire-sensitive short-wave infrared channel 7 complemented by visible and near-infrared channel 1-6 data (daytime only), while also expanding on the use of multi-temporal analysis to improve pixel classification results. Despite frequent saturation of OLI's fire-affected pixels, which includes radiometric artifacts resulting from folding of digital numbers, our initial assessment based on visual image analysis indicated high algorithm fidelity across a wide range of biomass burning scenarios, gas flares and active volcanoes. Additional field data verification confirmed the sensor's and algorithm's ability to resolve fires of significantly small areas compared to current operational satellite fire products. Commission errors were greatly reduced with the addition of multi-temporal analysis tests applied toco-located pixels, averaging less than 0.2% globally. Because of its overall quality, Landsat-8/OLI active fire data could become part of a network of emerging earth observation systems providing enhanced spatial and temporal coverage of biomass burning at global scales.

AB Ghana is the focus of extensive economic development interest, and is undergoing a substantial increase in population from 5 million in 1950 to an estimated 50 million in 2050. Population growth is impacting the natural environment, mostly through land cover and land use change (LCLUC), and particularly associated with agriculture expansion and urbanization. Monitoring LCLUC is necessary in order to understand the overall dynamics of population, LCLU and quality of life. However, extensive cloud cover in the region complicates satellite-based monitoring of LCLUC. Our objectives are to evaluate an innovative "dense stack" approach to image classification with extremely cloudy, multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery, map and quantify LCLU within southern Ghana for circa 2000 and circa 2010, examine LCLU changes, and assess the utility of the approach for monitoring human induced change. Maximum value composite images (derived from the dense stacks) provide unique information for classifying the LCLU classes of interest, and accuracy assessment results indicate effective overall classification of the six LCLU classes mapped using semi-automated methods. A product we developed and refer to as the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI) plays a major role in discriminating three natural vegetation classes and agriculture. Derived circa 2000 and circa 2010 LCLU maps indicate that approximately 26% of the study area exhibited LCLU change during the study period. Sixty-two percent (62%) of the changes are associated with conversion to Agriculture, with 33% from Secondary Forest, 26% from Savanna, and 3% from Forest.

AB Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) provides unique data on the 3-D structure of atmosphere constituents and the Earth's surface. Simulating LiDAR returns for different laser technologies and Earth scenes is fundamental for evaluating and interpreting signal and noise in LiDAR data. Different types of models are capable of simulating LiDAR waveforms of Earth surfaces. Semi-empirical and geometric models can be imprecise because they rely on simplified simulations of Earth surfaces and light interaction mechanisms. On the other hand, Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) models are potentially accurate but require long computational time. Here, we present a new LiDAR waveform simulation tool that is based on the introduction of a quasi-Monte Carlo ray tracing approach in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Two new approaches, the so-called "box method" and "Ray Carlo method", are implemented to provide robust and accurate simulations of LiDAR waveforms for any landscape, atmosphere and LiDAR sensor configuration (view direction, footprint size, pulse characteristics, etc.). The box method accelerates the selection of the scattering direction of a photon in the presence of scatterers with non-invertible phase function. The Ray Carlo method brings traditional ray-tracking into MCRT simulation, which makes computational time independent of LiDAR field of view (FOV) and reception solid angle. Both methods are fast enough for simulating multi-pulse acquisition. Sensitivity studies with various landscapes and atmosphere constituents are presented, and the simulated LiDAR signals compare favorably with their associated reflectance images and Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) waveforms. The LiDAR module is fully integrated into DART, enabling more detailed simulations of LiDAR sensitivity to specific scene elements (e.g., atmospheric aerosols, leaf area, branches, or topography) and sensor configuration for airborne or satellite LiDAR sensors.

AB We present a new dating approach for desert alluvial surfaces that utilizes radar image data to obtain regional scale correlations between dated surfaces and surfaces of unknown ages. The study was carried out along the Arava segment of the Dead Sea Transform north of the Gulf of Elat (Aqaba) using Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data with 6-12 m/pixel resolutions. Nineteen independently dated Quaternary morphostratigraphic alluvial units (5 to 1910 ka) from eight different sites with variable lithologies (carbonate/magmatic/chert) were examined in order to develop, test and validate the proposed approach. Expanding on previous studies that established the characteristic smoothing of desert alluvial surface through time and the capability of measuring such roughness variations with radar, we employed a pixel-aggregation approach that yielded a robust (R-2 = 0.95) power-law relation between the average radar bacicscatter value from the surface ('AR') and the abandonment age ('T') of the unit as measured with independent methods such as luminescence and/or cosmogenic radionuclide dating. We found that: 1) This AR-T correlation can be inverted to obtain calibrated radar-based T estimates as old as similar to 1.5 Ma with 35% uncertainty; 2) ALOS PALSAR 6 m/pixel images acquired at incidence angles of 34-38 degrees yielded optimal results; 3) a sample of at least 70 contiguous radar pixels was required to capture the natural roughness variability of the surfaces examined, and 4) surface lithology did not exert a primary effect on T inversions. Validation experiments yielded radar-based ages of 3 +/- 1, 91 +/- 32, 484 +/- 169 and 1604 +/- 561 ka that compare to Holocene, 56 +/- 14, 540 60 and 1590 250 ka ages previously determined for the same surfaces, respectively. We propose that with region-specific calibrations, spaceborne radar data can be used to quantitatively estimate the age of abandoned alluvial units across regional scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the present study, the influence of sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) that occurred in the last decade (2001/02-2012/13) in the northern hemisphere, simultaneously on the tropopause, stratopause, and mesopause is investigated for the first time using multi-satellite measurements. Multi-satellites include GPS Radio Occultation (GPS RO), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using the Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) onboard the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) mission. Emphasis have been made to investigate up to what latitudes the effect of SSW will be seen on these pauses. This study also presents the characteristics, intensity and duration of the SSW events. A total of 9 SSW events are identified out of the 12 winters. The altitude of tropopause is observed to have decrease by similar to 0.7 km during SSW events in NH high latitudes and restricted to 60 degrees N and above. As expected, significant increase in the stratopause altitude is noticed, which reaches to almost similar to 80 km when compared to non-warming years and this effect was observed up to 50 degrees N. Thus, SSW effects on the tropopause and stratopause noticed at polar latitudes may not be felt directly at the tropical latitudes. Interestingly, large reduction in the mesopause altitudes (by 3-4 km) is observed during SSW events, which propagates to the tropical latitudes in some of the SSW winters. The gravity wave (GW) activity is also examined during these SSW events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The recent paper by Morillas et al. [Morillas, L et al. Using radiometric surface temperature for surface energy flux estimation in Mediterranean drylands from a two-source perspective, Remote Sens. Environ. 136, 234-246, 2013] evaluates the two-source model (TSM) of Norman et al. (1995) with revisions by Kustas and Norman (1999) over a semiarid tussock grassland site in southeastern Spain. The TSM - in its current incarnation, the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) - was applied to this landscape using ground-based infrared radiometer sensors to estimate both the composite surface radiometric temperature and component soil and canopy temperatures. Morillas et al. (2013) found the TSEB model substantially underestimated the sensible H (and overestimated the latent heat LE) fluxes. Using the same data set from Morillas et al. (2013), we were able to confirm their results. We also found energy transport and exchange behavior derived from primarily the observations themselves to differ significantly from a number of prior studies using land surface temperature for estimating heat fluxes with one-source modeling approaches in semi-arid landscapes. However, revisions to key vegetation inputs to TSEB and the soil resistance formulation resulted in a significant reduction in the bias and root mean square error (RMSE) between model output of H and LE and the measurements compared to the prior results from Morillas et al. (2013). These included more representative ground-based vegetation greenness and local leaf area index values as well as modifications to the coefficients of the soil resistance formulation to account for the very rough (rocky) soil surface conditions with a clumped canopy. This indicates that both limitations in remote estimates of biophysical indicators of the canopy at the site and the lack of adjustment in soil resistance formulation to account for site specific characteristics, contributed to the earlier findings of Morillas et al. (2013). This suggests further studies need to be conducted to reduce the uncertainties in the vegetation and land surface temperature input data in order to more accurately assess the effects of the transport exchange processes of this Mediterranean landscape on TSEB formulations.

AB In the last decades, several topographic correction methods (TOC) have been proposed, but there is not an agreement on the best method. Furthermore, different evaluation criteria have been used in the past, and there is not any simple and objective evaluation procedure to measure the quality of the correction. Consequently, a multi criteria analysis of widely used topographic correction methods is required that evaluates their performance over different sensors, terrain and temporal configurations. In this work, ten TOC methods were assessed using seven different evaluation strategies. The analysis was carried out for three SPOT5 images acquired over a mountainous area of northern Spain. The images had different acquisition dates and solar angles, so as to evaluate performance under varying illumination conditions. The results obtained showed that Statistic-Empirical method, C-Correction and Sun-Canopy-Sensor + C performed the best, and differences were minor when favorable illumination conditions were considered. For the seven tested evaluation strategies, interquartile range reduction of land covers or the comparison of sunlit and shaded slopes gave very similar results, whereas there were greater contrasts among other criteria.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were acquired over the Deepwater Horizon spill's main slick with a number of different instruments during response to the catastrophic accident in 2010. These included instruments operating in different microwave frequency bands (L-C-X band), and, for TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed, more than one acquisition system operating in the X-band. In this work, for the first time the diverse SAR data acquired over the Deepwater Horizon spill have been compared and quantitatively analyzed with the goal of determining the different capabilities of the last generation SAR systems in the analysis of this important test case. Using the nearest acquisitions in time over the same areas, backscattering coefficients and polarimetric features, when available, have been evaluated. The derived information and comparison of sensors is discussed, in particular taking into consideration the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) value characterizing each instrument. Although, as expected, an increase of the damping ratio values is noted at higher frequencies, the best slick discrimination capability has been obtained with the L-band UAVSAR sensor, characterized by a more effective NESZ value, while the satellite SAR sensors are shown to have in some cases significant noise contamination to polarimetric parameters. Anomalous behavior at X-band measurements has been also registered and discussed. Through the analysis of all the available data an evaluation of the impact of low noise SAR for oil characterization in the considered context is provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The remote monitoring of plant canopies is critically needed for understanding of terrestrial ecosystem mechanics and biodiversity as well as capturing the short- to long-term responses of vegetation to disturbance and climate change. A variety of orbital, sub-orbital, and field instruments have been used to retrieve optical spectral signals and to study different vegetation properties such as plant biochemistry, nutrient cycling, physiology, water status, and stress. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a mechanistic link between vegetation properties and observed spectral features, and RTM spectral inversion is a useful framework for estimating these properties from spectral data. However, existing approaches to RTM spectral inversion are typically limited by the inability to characterize uncertainty in parameter estimates. Here, we introduce a Bayesian algorithm for the spectral inversion of the PROSPECT 5 leaf RTM that is distinct from past approaches in two important ways: First, the algorithm only uses reflectance and does not require transmittance observations, which have been plagued by a variety of measurement and equipment challenges. Second, the output is not a point estimate for each parameter but rather the joint probability distribution that includes estimates of parameter uncertainties and covariance structure. We validated our inversion approach using a database of leaf spectra together with measurements of equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). The parameters estimated by our inversion were able to accurately reproduce the observed reflectance (RMSEVIS = 0.0063, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0098) and transmittance (RMSEVIS = 0.0404, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0551) for both broadleaved and conifer species. Inversion estimates of EWT and LMA for broadleaved species agreed well with direct measurements (CVEWT = 18.8%, CVLMA = 24.5%), while estimates for conifer species were less accurate (CVEWT = 53.2%, CVLMA = 63.3%). To examine the influence of spectral resolution on parameter uncertainty, we simulated leaf reflectance as observed by ten common remote sensing platforms with varying spectral configurations and performed a Bayesian inversion on the resulting spectra. We found that full-range hyperspectral platforms were able to retrieve all parameters accurately and precisely, while the parameter estimates of multispectral platforms were much less precise and prone to bias at high and low values. We also observed that variations in the width and location of spectral bands influenced the shape of the covariance structure of parameter estimates. Our Bayesian spectral inversion provides a powerful and versatile framework for future RTM development and single-and multi-instrumental remote sensing of vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Temperature is a key factor for river ecosystems. In summer, patches of cold water are formed in the river by groundwater seepage. These patches have strong ecological significance and extend to the surface water in a well-mixed riverine system. These patches can serve as thermal refuges for some fish species during summer. In this study, the temporal variability and spatial distribution of cold water patches were explored along a 50 km river reach (the lower Ain River, France) using thermal infrared airborne remote sensing. This study examines a new range of processes acting on cold water patches at different scales that have not previously been touched upon in the literature. Three airborne campaigns were conducted during the summers of 2010, 2011 and 2014. Based on these images, a large number of cold water patches were identified using an automated method. Four types of patches were observed: tributary plumes, cold side channels (former channels or point bar backwater channels), side seeps (located directly in the river channel) and gravel bar seeps (occurring at the downstream end of gravel bars). Logistic regression was used to analyze the longitudinal distribution of cold water patches according to geomorphologic indicators reflecting current or past fluvial process. Side seeps were found to be related to the local geology. Cold side channels were correlated to contemporary and past lateral river mobility. Gravel bar seeps were related to the current development of bars and are more prevalent in wandering reaches than in single-bed incised and paved reaches. The logistic model was subsequently used to evaluate gravel bar seep variability in the past. The model suggests larger numbers of seeps in the mid-20th century when bar surface area was higher. Interannual variability in the occurrence and spatial extent of side seeps and gravel bar seeps appear to be related to groundwater level fluctuations. Cold side channels exhibited greater interannual stability. Nonetheless, among all patch types, some are quite stable over time, while others are transient. These results can be used to target areas with high densities of stable and spatially extensive cold water patches that are considered ecological refuges, in the context of pronounced low flow and a rise in water temperature.

AB Ice loss from the glaciers of Novaya Zemlya (NVZ) is the dominant contributor to sea level for the Russian Arctic. Here we present maps of glacier elevation change rates (dh/dt) and velocities at Novaya Zemlya that reveal evidence of the impact of both calving flux and surface melt on ice mass loss.
   dh/dt are calculated by applying a weighted linear regression to stacked digital elevation models (DEMs) from a 1952 map and DEMs created from stereo-pairs of WorldView images acquired between 2012 and 2014. The similar to 60-year average mass change rate is -0.23 +/- 0.04 m w.e. yr(-1). The recent, short-term (2012-2013/2014) average mass change rate is -0.40 +/- 0.09 m w.e. yr(-1). We apply the same weighted linear regression to stacked WorldView DEMs and ICESat elevations from 2003 to 2009, as well as stacked WorldView DEM5 and ASTER DEM5 from 2000 to 2013. The dh/dt from both datasets confirm that thinning has been more rapid than the 60-year average since 2000. Average mass loss has accelerated at the lower elevations of land-terminating glaciers, suggesting that recent near surface warming and increased melt have led to greater thinning. Marine-terminating glaciers along the Barents Sea coast have substantially higher thinning rates near their termini in recent years than adjacent land-terminating glaciers, suggesting that calving flux is an important contributor to overall ice mass loss in the region.
   Flow velocities are generated by feature tracking on optical and radar image pairs. Marine-terminating glaciers along the Barents Sea coast have the highest frontal velocities of any glaciers on NVZ. Our surface velocity measurements constrain the calving flux at the two fastest-retreating glaciers, Inostrantseva (INO) and Virkitskogo (VIS), which are both on the Barents Sea coast. We find that the calving flux is high enough to drive frontal thinning and retreat at those two glaciers. Summer terminus speeds at Inostrantseva Glacier have accelerated from a 2006 maximum of 3 m day(-1) to a 2012 maximum of 9 to 10 m day(-1) and the front has retreated by more than 3 km between 2006/06/27 and 2013/08/17.

AB The satellite-based estimation of dry PM2.5 mass concentration near the surface is a big challenge in the aerosol remote sensing fields, but urgently needed by the environmental monitoring. We present an experimental validation of a physical PM2.5 remote sensing (PMRS) method which is not dependent on geographical location, based on ground-based remote sensing measurements at Jinhua City, a typical middle size city in East of China. The PMRS method is designed to employ currently available satellite remote sensing parameters as many as possible, including aerosol optical depth (ADD), fine mode fraction (FMF), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and thus be capable of deriving PM2.5 from instantaneous remote sensing measurements under different pollution levels. The key processes of the PM2.5 method including size cutting, volume visualization, bottom isolation and particle drying are directly validated by comparing with reference parameters. We found that the size cutting of the PMRS method has a significant bias (about 0.86) resulting from the use of fine mode fraction to estimate PM2.5 among all size of aerosol particles, which should be systematically corrected. The validation results of the volume visualization and particle drying of the PMRS method are quite satisfied while the bottom isolation procedure brings currently the maximum uncertainty to the PM2.5 remote sensing. The improved PMRS method shows good performance on the remote sensing of hourly PM2.5 with an average error of about 38 mu g/m(3) and relative error of about 31%. The correlation coefficient between remote sensing and in situ hourly PM2.5 is about 0.67 with a linear slope of 1.03 and intercept of 11 mu g/m(3) while the means are very close (110.7 mu g/m(3) versus 118.6 mu g/m(3)). The validation study also helps find out future improvement directions and demonstrates the possible application to ground-based remote sensing data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Development of a general model to estimate the instantaneous, daily, and

AB Net radiation is a key variable in computing evapotranspiration and is a driving force in many other physical and biological processes. Remote sensing techniques provide an unparalleled spatial and temporal coverage of landsurface attributes, and thus several studies have attempted to estimate net radiation by combining remote sensing observations with surface and atmospheric data. However, remote sensing provides instantaneous data, when many applications and models need information at other temporal scales. In this work, a new general methodology is proposed to estimate daily and daytime net radiation and to retrieve the diurnal cycle of net radiation. Four images were acquired on different dates, two corresponding to the TM sensor (Landsat 5) and two from EFM + (Landsat 7), and ancillary meteorological data covering the Tandil department (Argentina) were collected. The performance of the methodology at both local and regional scales is assessed by comparing the results with ground net radiation measurements. At local scale, estimation errors between +/- 4 and +/- 9%, biases close to zero, and good agreement between predicted net radiation values and ground-measured values were obtained. On the other hand, estimation errors between +/- 2 and +/- 4% were finally obtained using satellite data. Note that the methodology presented here is not restricted to a latitude, a date, or a time of satellite overpass, and therefore it can be applied to any satellite mission, provided it has visible, infrared, and thermal bands to obtain previously the instantaneous net radiation.

AB We investigate the potential for closing the water balance purely from remote sensing (RS) sources and quantify the hydrological dynamic of the Pantanal (Brazil), the world's largest continuous wetland. We use 10-year time series of total water storage changes (Delta S) derived from GRACE and the balance between precipitation (P) derived from TRMM and evapotranspiration (ET) derived from MOD16, as well as the overall vegetation response (EVI2) to water availability. The GRACE-estimates of total water storage were consistent with in situ measurements from the Laddrio gauge station. Despite the coarse spatial resolution of GRACE, its estimates were able not only to represent the hydrological regime of the entire basin but also its internal variability. The total water storage change estimates correlated well with precipitation (r = 0.87), evapotranspiration (r = 0.83), and vegetation greenness (r = 0.85), particularly when a two to three month time lag was considered. Likewise, the MODIS-derived vegetation greenness was consistent with variations in precipitation (r = 0.77) and evapotranspiration (r = 0.79). Nevertheless, we found that the water balance could not be closed with these data. Inferred runoff was greatly overestimated due mainly to an underestimation of ET. The uncertainty in the inputs and scarce validation data were limiting factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We compare identification, delineation and recording of freshly erupted deposits around active volcanoes from very high resolution optical images with that done by traditional geologic mapping. Object-oriented classification (OOC) and normalized difference spectral indices of vegetation, moisture and soil redness (NDVI, NDWI and NDRSI) have been applied to sub-metric GeoEye-1 and Pleiades images to identify and map pyroclastic and lahar deposits and trace their spatio-temporal evolution over two years, following the 2010 eruption of Merapi Volcano, Indonesia. We could identify several categories of pyroclastic depositional areas, and also map the damaged forest and destroyed cultivated terraces and settlements in the Gendol and Opak River basins on the south flank of the volcano. More than 75% of erupted deposits were delineated semi-automatically unlike the ground geological map based on photo-interpretation of the 2010 GeoEye image and field observations. A temporal image analysis, using bivariate scatter diagrams of the three spectral indices between 2010 and 2012 and a combination of NDWI and NDVI, separated areas affected by surges from unscathed vegetation. Use of NDRSI and NDWI allowed us to differentiate overbank Pyroclastic Density Current deposits from wet lahar deposits. NDRSI values close to 0 refer to scoria-rich pyrodastic deposits.
   About 40% of the devastated upper catchment was recolonized by vegetation between 2010 and 2012. The recovery also took place in the forested valley margins affected by ash-cloud surges. The morphometric analysis of the initial drainage network, digitized from the 2011-2012 images, demonstrated (1) the resurfacing of pristine 2010 PDC deposits by runoff and (2) incision or remobilization by lahars. It took two years following the eruption in the rugged upper catchment devastated by high-energy surges to fully develop the hydrographic network. It is, however, still rudimentary on gently sloping fans created by overbank PDC deposits in the middle valley, thus suggesting the importance of slope gradient, grain size, permeability and thickness of deposits. As much as 35% of the 2010 PDC deposits, emplaced in the vicinity of the river channels, were remobilized by lahars over the two post-eruption rainy seasons and also by constant mining activities. Studies on the erosion of the pyroclastic deposits after 2012 need to concentrate on the upper reach of the catchment on the south flank. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST82E) product will be included in forthcoming Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6. Surface temperature and emissivities for thermal bands 29 (8.55 mu m), 31 (11 mu m) and 32 (12 mu m) will be retrieved using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) method adapted to MODIS at-sensor spectral radiances, previously corrected with the Water Vapor Scaling method (MOD21 algorithm). We simulated MOD21 product estimates over two different sandy deserts (i.e. White Sands and Great Sands) using a series of MODIS scenes from 2010 to 2013. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anisotropy of the thermal infrared emissivity over semiarid regions, since angular variations of thermal infrared emissivity imply important uncertainties in satellite 1ST retrievals. The obtained LSEs and their dependence on zenith viewing angles were analyzed. Results from the MOD21 simulated algorithm showed that band 29 LSE decreased up to 0.038 from nadir to zenith angle of 60 degrees, while LSEs for bands 31 and 32 did not show significant variation. MOD21 LSE for band 29 also showed mean differences between night and daytime retrievals of +0.027 for WS and +0.009 for GS. These differences can be attributed to the water vapor adsorption of the soil from the atmosphere. MOD21 nadir and off-nadir LSEs showed a good agreement with laboratory emissivity measurements, and were used to validate with satellite data a zenithal-dependent emissivity model proposed in a previous study.

AB We present the evidence of regional scale outflow of particulate pollution from Mexico City using measurements from the space borne CALIPSO lidar. The vertically resolved results are presented for winter months when the large scale biomass burning from nearby areas is minimized, and the aerosol loading is dominated by anthropogenic outflow from the city. The particulate depolarization ratio in the outflowing plume has high values and reflects the influence of mixing of the urban pollution with the ubiquitous dust around the city. This is consistent with the results from previous field campaigns in the city and leads to polluted dust being the dominant aerosol subtype as identified by the CALIPSO algorithm. A first order estimate of the mass flux on two episodes using the aerosol extinction profiles from CALIPSO indicates outflow of several hundred tons per day. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study used a global hydrological model (GHM), PCR-GLOBWB, which simulates surface water storage changes, natural and human induced groundwater storage changes, and the interactions between surface water and subsurface water, to generate scaling factors by mimicking low-pass filtering of GRACE signals. Signal losses in GRACE data were subsequently restored by the scaling factors from PCR-GLOBWB. Results indicate greater spatial heterogeneity in scaling factor from PCR-GLOBWB and CLM4.0 than that from GLDAS-1 Noah due to comprehensive simulation of surface and subsurface water storage changes for PCR-GLOBWB and CLM4.0. Filtered GRACE total water storage (TWS) changes applied with PCR-GLOBWB scaling factors show closer agreement with water budget estimates of TWS changes than those with scaling factors from other land surface models (LSMs) in China's Yangtze River basin. Results of this study develop a further understanding of the behavior of scaling factors from different LSMs or GHMs over hydrologically complex basins, and could be valuable in providing more accurate TWS changes for hydrological applications (e.g., monitoring drought and groundwater storage depletion) over regions where human-induced interactions between surface water and subsurface water are intensive.

AB Satellite measurements have been widely used to estimate particulate matters (PMs) on the ground and their effects on human health. However, such estimation depends critically on an established relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground level PMs. In this study we performed an experiment at Xi'an to establish a relation between AOD and PM10. A first test of satellite AOD and PM10 data showed a low correlation between the two properties, especially in spring and summer seasons with relatively many high AOD values paired to low ground-level PM10 values, which hinted that AOD may 'contaminate' by summer agricultural burning season and dust storm intrusion leading to much elevated aerosol. MODIS fire count and CALIPSO vertical feature mask data were used to detect fire emissions and elevated aerosol to substantiate this hypothesis. A later test showed that the correlation between ADD and PM10 has strongly been improved by excluding the paired AOD-PM10 data with known biomass burning and elevated aerosol layers. This result indicates that summer agricultural burning and aloft aerosol should be considered when the AOD-PM10 association is explored. Finally, a geographically weighted regression model was developed to further improve estimation of ground-level concentration by combining AOD with meteorological parameters. The results showed that the meteorological parameters can greatly improve model performance. The overall cross-validation R-2 is 0.77 and the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) is 16.91 mu g/m(3). These results are useful for developing satellite AOD based model to estimate ground-level PMs especially for the region with known strong biomass burning events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 0.4-2.5 mu m) hyperspectral satellite imaging is one of the most promising tools for topsoil property mapping for the following reasons: i) it is derived from a laboratory technique that has been demonstrated to be a good alternative to costly physical and chemical laboratory soil analysis for estimating a large range of soil properties; ii) it can benefit from the increasing number of methodologies developed for VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne imaging; and iii) it provides a synoptic view of the study area. Despite the significant potential of VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data for topsoil property mapping, the transposition to satellite data must be evaluated. The objective of this study was to test the sensitivity of clay content prediction to atmospheric effects and to degradation of spatial resolution. This study may offer an initial analysis of the potential of future hyperspectral satellite sensors, such as the HYPerspectral X Imagery (HYPXIM), the Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM), the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), for soil applications. This study employed VNIR/ SWIR AISA-DUAL airborne data acquired in a Mediterranean region over a large area (300 km(2)) with an initial spatial resolution of 5 m. These hyperspectral airborne data were simulated at the top of the atmosphere and aggregated at six spatial resolutions (10, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 90 m) to correlate with the future hyperspectral satellite sensors. The predicted clay content maps were obtained using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The large area of the studied region allows analysis of different pedological patterns of soil composition and spatial structures. Our results showed the following: (i) when a correct compensation of atmosphere effects was performed, only slight differences were detected between clay maps retrieved from the airborne imagery and those from spaceborne imagery (both at 5 m of spatial resolution); (ii) the PLSR models, built from data with 5 to 30 m spatial resolutions, performed well, and allowed clay mapping, although variations in clay content related to short scale succession of parent material was imperfectly captured beyond 15 m of spatial resolution; (iii) the PLSR models built from data with 60 and 90 m spatial resolutions were inaccurate, and did not enable clay mapping; and (iv) the two latter results could be explained by the combination of a small short-scale clay content variability and small field sizes observed in the study area. Therefore, in the Mediterranean and under the spectral specifications of the AISA-DUAL airborne sensor, most of the future hyperspectral satellite sensors (four of the five sensors examined in this study) will be potentially useful for clay content mapping.

AB Land surface phenology (LSP) is directly related to seasonal variations in the condition of vegetated land surfaces and hence is an important indicator for studying the effect of climate change on ecosystems. Satellite data is widely used to monitor LSP over regional to global extents. Currently, there are many algorithms for generating satellite based LSP products. The Committee of Earth Observing System identifies performance assessments of these products as a pressing need. Performance assessment includes both validation in comparison to independent reference data and evaluation by comparison against estimates of noise free phenology indicators. This study proposes a novel methodology for evaluation of satellite based LSP algorithms and applies this methodology to evaluate three well-known LSP algorithms, Savitzky-Golay based filter (SGF), asymmetric Gaussian fitting (AGF) and logistic function fitting (logistic), using 20 years of daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index composites for Canada and Northern USA. The three LSP methods were evaluated in terms of accuracy for start of season, maximum of season and end of season. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal gap frequency (gaps) of the NDVI time series are shown to be proportional to the confidence level for clear sky labeling. The SGF and logistic methods were found to be more sensitive to the SNR than AGF. However, AGF require a minimum proportion of temporal samples for reconstruction. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the trade-off between gap frequency and SNR impacts on LSP methods and indicate that the performance of these methods will depend on both land surface condition and the clear sky identification approach adopted. The developed evaluation approach serves as a basis for assessing the uncertainty in satellite LSP products due to radiometric noise and missing data.

AB There is ongoing debate as to whether the oligotrophic ocean is predominantly net autotrophic and acts as a CO2 sink, or net heterotrophic and therefore acts as a CO2 source to the atmosphere. This quantification is challenging, both spatially and temporally, due to the sparseness of measurements. There has been a concerted effort to derive accurate estimates of phytoplankton photosynthesis and primary production from satellite data to fill these gaps; however there have been few satellite estimates of net community production (NCP). In this paper, we compare a number of empirical approaches to estimate NCP from satellite data with in vitro measurements of changes in dissolved O-2 concentration at 295 stations in the N and S Atlantic Ocean (including the Antarctic), Greenland and Mediterranean Seas. Algorithms based on power laws between NCP and particulate organic carbon production (POC) derived from C-14 uptake tend to overestimate NCP at negative values and underestimate at positive values. An algorithm that includes sea surface temperature (SST) in the power function of NCP and C-14 POC has the lowest bias and root-mean square error compared with in vitro measured NCP and is the most accurate algorithm for the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a 13 year time series of NCP was generated using this algorithm with SeaWiFS data to assess changes over time in different regions and in relation to climate variability. The North Atlantic subtropical and tropical Gyres (NATL) were predominantly net autotrophic from 1998 to 2010 except for boreal autumn/winter, suggesting that the northern hemisphere has remained a net sink for CO2 during this period. The South Atlantic subtropical Gyre (SATL) fluctuated from being net autotrophic in austral spring-summer, to net heterotrophic in austral autumn winter. Recent decadal trends suggest that the SATL is becoming more of a CO2 source. Over the Atlantic basin, the percentage of satellite pixels with negative NCP was 27%, with the largest contributions from the NATL and SATL during boreal and austral autumn winter, respectively. Variations in NCP in the northern and southern hemispheres were correlated with climate indices. Negative correlations between NCP and the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) occurred in the SATL, which explained up to 60% of the variability in NCP. Similarly there was a negative correlation between NCP and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Southern Sub-Tropical Convergence Zone (SSTC), which explained 90% of the variability. There were also positive correlations with NAO in the Canary Current Coastal Upwelling (CNRY) and Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA) which explained 80% and 60% of the variability in each province, respectively. MEI and NAO seem to play a role in modifying phases of net autotrophy and heterotrophy in the Atlantic Ocean. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Hence, data on seasonal and spatial variations of phytoplankton primary production (PP) is needed to estimate their ecological state. However, considerable difficulties arise when investigating the spatial and temporal variations of productivity in inland waters. Traditional in situ sampling approaches cannot provide the necessary data over large lakes or for lakes over large geographic regions. A solution can be to combine modelling with satellite data, by using different satellite products as inputs for a primary production model. The objective of this study is to evaluate and validate a lake primary production model based on satellite products. For that purpose we compared PP(sat) with PP(in situ) in two large, shallow, well mixed, and eutrophic Estonian lakes. A semi-empirical phytoplankton primary production model, derived by us earlier, was used. It allows estimating the values of phytoplankton primary production for lakes over large geographic areas. The primary production model operated well using MERIS products as input data. Our results show that spatial variability in primary production cannot be neglected in large lakes. Combining satellite data with model calculations allows monitoring of the state of lakes in space and time, providing a new perspective for lake primary production studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing is an important tool to monitor precipitation over regions with sparse rain gauge networks. To provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over un-gauged areas, great efforts have been taken to downscale low-resolution satellite precipitation datasets using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on the assumption that precipitation can be simulated by vegetation and topography proxies at various spatial scales. However, the non-stationarity of the relationship between precipitation and vegetation or topography has not been appropriately considered when low-resolution satellite precipitation datasets are downscaled using NDVI and DEM in previous studies. To overcome this limitation, a new downscaling algorithm was proposed in this study by introducing a regional regression model termed as geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the precipitation-ND VI and precipitation-DEM relationships. The performance of this new downscaling algorithm was assessed by downscaling the latest version of monthly TRMM precipitation datasets (referred to TRMM 3B43 V7) over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the TianShan Mountains from 025 (about 25 km) to 1 km spatial resolution, and the downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against ground observations measured by rain gauges. The validation results indicate that the high-resolution precipitation datasets obtained through the new algorithm not only performed better than the traditional downscaling algorithms, but also had higher accuracy than the original TRMM 3B43 V7 dataset Besides, we found that the performance of this new algorithm was largely dependent on the accuracy of the original TRMM 3B43 V7 data. We therefore recommend considering the non-stationarity of the precipitation-NDVI and precipitation-DEM relationships in the downscaling process, and demonstrate the possibility of downscaling satellite precipitation with NDVI and DEM at monthly temporal scale.

AB Estimating accurate aboveground forest carbon stocks (AFCS) is always challenging in tropical regions due to the complex mosaic of forest structure and species diversity. This study evaluates the potential of high-resolution ALOS/PALSAR mosaics data in the tropical forests of central Sumatra to improve AFCS estimates. The study region has an average AFCS (47% of the aboveground biomass) of 66 Mg C ha(-1) with a range of 1 to 334 Mg C ha-1 and consists of natural forests including peat swamp, dry moist, regrowth, and mangrove, and plantation forests including rubber, acacia, oil palm, and coconut. Field measurements of AFCS were carried out in 87 (ha(-1)) plots, where half of them were from plantation forests. Various possibilities including direct gamma naught back-scatters and their ratios and various types of textures of dual polarized mosaics from the years 2009 and 2010 were examined applying regression modeling in a five step framework. R-2, variable inflation factor (VIF), p-value, and root mean square errors (RMSE) were the major indicators considered for selection of best model in the calibration process. The potential models selected were cross validated by the leave-one-out (LOO) method where R-2, RMSE, mean deviation (MD), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE, model performance indicator) were examined. The results indicate that a simple combination of backscatters and their ratios provides an AFCS estimate with a RMSE of 45 Mg C ha(-1), more efficient than the average of field measured AFCS (NSE of 0.54), and R-2 of 0.63. Inclusion of appropriate texture parameters derived from the high-resolution PALSAR mosaics further increases the potential for AFCS estimation by increasing R-2 and model performance (NSE) to 0.84 and 0.83, respectively and decreasing the uncertainty to 28 Mg C ha(-1). This SAR based method offers the low cost wall-to-wall forest carbon mapping with a high level of accuracy in the dense tropical forest regions of Southeast Asia where other methods are still rare.

AB Satellite-based observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling spectral irradiance at the wavelength of 490 nm, K-d(490) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), K-d(PAR) in the ocean can play important roles for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models. Since existing K-d(PAR) models for the satellite ocean color data have wide regional variations, we need to improve the K-d(PAR) algorithm for global ocean applications. In this study, we propose a new blended K-d(PAR) model for both open oceans and turbid coastal waters. The new method has been assessed using in situ optical measurements from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database. Next, the new method is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to derive Kd(PAR) products, and is compared with in situ measureinents. Results show that there are significant improvements in model-derived K-d(PAR) values using the new approach compared to those from some existing K-d(PAR) algorithms. In addition, matchup comparisons between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean show a good agreement with mean and median ratios of 1.109 and 1.035, respectively. Synoptic maps of MODIS- and VIIRS-derived Kd(PAR) data generated using the new method provide very similar and consistent spatial patterns in the U.S. East Coast region, although there are some slight differences between two satellite-derived K-d(PAR) images (similar to 1-5% higher in VIIRS K-d(PAR) compared with those from MODIS-Aqua in the shallow water region), which are possibly due to differences in spectral bands and sensor performance (e.g., calibrations). Monthly maps of VIIRS-derived K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean are also generated using the new Kd(PAR) model, and provide spatial and temporal K-d(PAR) distributions that show consistent results with those from previous studies. Thus, results show that satellite-derived K-d(PAR) data using the new K-d(PAR) model, e.g., from MODIS and VIIRS, can provide more accurate K-d(PAR) data to science communities, in particular, as an important input for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models.

AB This study assesses the performance of the SCOPE model (Van der Tol et al., 2009) to reproduce directional anisotropy of remote sensing thermal infrared measurements. A calibration/validation exercise over two datasets (winter wheat and young pine stand) on energy balance fluxes is presented. Surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are correctly simulated (with RMSE in the range of 30-50 W.m(-2)) together with directional temperatures in 4 different viewing geometries (RMSE < 1.4 K) for both canopies. The sensitivity of the model to two critical but uncertain parameters, the maximum carboxylation capacity V-cmo, and a stomatal parameter lambda (the marginal water cost of carbon assimilation) is discussed; it is shown that anisotropy displays limited sensitivity to both parameters for the experimental conditions met over a well-watered wheat field. The ability of SCOPE to simulate anisotropy is finally illustrated by a qualitative comparison against experimental measurements obtained over a mature pine stand using an airborne TIR camera. SCOPE-simulated TIR directional anisotropy appears to be consistent with the experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophyll-a satellite products are routinely used in oceanography, providing a synoptic and global view of phytoplankton abundance. However, these products lack information on the community structure of the phytoplankton, which is crucial for ecological modelling and ecosystem studies. To assess the usefulness of existing methods to differentiate phytoplankton functional types (PFT) or phytoplankton size classes from satellite data, in-situ phytoplankton samples collected in the Western Iberian coast, on the North-East Atlantic, were analysed for pigments and absorption spectra. Water samples were collected in five different locations, four of which were located near the shore and another in an open-ocean, seamount region. Three different modelling approaches for deriving phytoplankton size classes were applied to the in situ data. Approaches tested provide phytoplankton size class information based on the input of pigments data (Brewin et al., 2010), absorption spectra data (Ciotti et al., 2002) or both (Uitz et al., 2008).
   Following Uitz et al. (2008), results revealed high variability in microphytoplankton chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 m(2) (mg chl)(-1) between 400 and 500 nm. This spectral analysis suggested, in one of the regions, the existence of small cells (<20 mu m) in the fraction of phytoplankton presumed to be microphytoplankton (based on diagnostic pigments). Ciotti et al. (2002) approach yielded the highest differences between modelled and measured absorption spectra for the locations where samples had high variability in community structure and cell size. The Brewin et al. (2010) pigment-based model was adjusted and a set of model coefficients are presented and recommended for future studies in offshore water of the Western Iberian coast.

AB Deriving individual tree information from discrete return, small footprint LiDAR data may improve forest aboveground biomass estimates, and provide tree-level information that is important in many ecological studies. Several crown delineation algorithms have been developed to extract individual tree information from LiDAR point clouds or rasterized canopy height models (CHM), but many of these algorithms have difficulty discriminating between overlapping crowns, and also may fail to detect understory trees. Our approach uses a watershed-based delineation of a CHM, which is subsequently refined using the LiDAR point cloud. Individual tree detection was validated with stem mapped field data from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Maryland, and on a plot and stand level through comparisons of stem density and basal area to delineated metrics at both SERC and a study area in the Sierra Nevada, California. For individual tree detection, the algorithm correctly identified 70% of dominant trees, 58% of codominant trees, 35% of intermediate trees and 21% of suppressed trees at SERC. The algorithm had difficulty distinguishing between crowns of small, dense understory trees of approximately the same height. Delineated crown volume alone explained 53% and 84% of the variability in basal area at the SERC and Sierra Nevada sites, respectively. The algorithm produced crown area distributions comparable to diameter at breast height (DBH) size class distributions observed in the field in both study sites. The algorithm detected understory crowns better in the conifer-dominated Sierra Nevada site than in the closed-canopy deciduous site in Maryland. The ability for the algorithm to reproduce both accurate tree size distributions and individual crown geometries in two dissimilar and complex forests suggests great promise for applicability to a wide range of forest systems.

AB Air temperature is an essential component in microclimate and environmental health research, but difficult to map in urban environments because of strong temperature gradients. We introduce a spatial regression approach to map the peak daytime air temperature relative to a reference station on typical hot summer days using Vancouver, Canada as a case study. Three regression models, ordinary least squares regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were all calibrated using Landsat TM/ETM + data and field observations from two sources: Environment Canada and the Weather Underground. Results based on cross-validation indicate that the random forest model produced the lowest prediction errors (RMSE = 2.31 degrees C). Some weather stations were consistently cooler/hotter than the reference station and were predicted well, while other stations, particularly those close to the ocean, showed greater temperature variability and were predicted with greater errors. A few stations, most of which were from the Weather Underground data set, were very poorly predicted and possibly unrepresentative of air temperature in the area. The random forest model generally produced a sensible map of temperature distribution in the area The spatial regression approach appears useful for mapping intraurban air temperature variability and can easily be applied to other cities.

AB Global surface soil moisture (SSM) datasets are being produced based on active and passive microwave satellite observations and simulations from land surface models (LSM). This study investigates the consistency of two global satellite-based SSM datasets based on microwave remote sensing observations from the passive Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS; SMOSL3 version 2.5) and the active Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT; version TU-Wien-WARP 5.5) with respect to LSM SSM from the MERRA-Land data product. The relationship between the global-scale SSM products was studied during the 2010-2012 period using (1) a time series statistics (considering both original SSM data and anomalies), (2) a space time analysis using Hovmoller diagrams, and (3) a triple collocation error model. The SMOSL3 and ASCAT retrievals are consistent with the temporal dynamics of modeled SSM (correlation R > 0.70 for original SSM) in the transition zones between wet and dry climates, including the Sahel, the Indian subcontinent, the Great Plains of North America, eastern Australia, and southeastern Brazil. Over relatively dense vegetation covers, a better consistency with MERRA-Land was obtained with ASCAT than with SMOSL3. However, it was found that ASCAT retrievals exhibit negative correlation versus MERRA-Land in some arid regions (e.g., the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula). In terms of anomalies, SMOSL3 better captures the short term SSM variability of the reference dataset (MERRA-Land) than ASCAT over regions with limited radio frequency interference (RFI) effects (e.g., North America, South America, and Australia). The seasonal and latitudinal variations of SSM are relatively similar for the three products, although the MERRA-Land SSM values are generally higher and their seasonal amplitude is much lower than for SMOSL3 and ASCAT. Both SMOSL3 and ASCAT have relatively comparable triple collocation errors with similar spatial error patterns: (i) lowest errors in arid regions (e.g., Sahara and Arabian Peninsula), due to the very low natural variability of soil moisture in these areas, and Central America, and (ii) highest errors over most of the vegetated regions (e.g., northern Australia, India, central Asia, and South America). However, the ASCAT SSM product is prone to larger random errors in some regions (e.g., north-western Africa, Iran, and southern South Africa). Vegetation density was found to be a key factor to interpret the consistency with MERRA-Land between the two remotely sensed products (SMOSL3 and ASCAT) which provides complementary information on SSM. This study shows that both SMOS and ASCAT have thus a potential for data fusion into long-term data records. (C) 2014 British Geological Survey (c) NERC. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Drought affects vegetation photosynthesis and growth. Many studies have used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is calculated as the normalized ratio between near infrared and red spectral bands in satellite images, to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought. In this study, we examined the impacts of drought on three vegetation indices (NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI, and land surface water index, LSWI) and CO2 flux from three tallgrass prairie eddy flux tower sites in the U.S. Gross primary production (GPP) was also modeled using a satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), and the modeled GPP (GPP(VPM)) was compared with the GPP (GPP(EC)) derived from eddy covariance measurements. Precipitation at two sites in Oklahoma was 30% below the historical mean in both years of the study period (2005-2006), while the site in Illinois did not experience drought in the 2005-2007 study period. The EVI explained the seasonal dynamics of GPP better than did NDVI. The LSWI dropped below zero during severe droughts in the growing season, showing its potential to track drought. The result shows that GPP was more sensitive to drought than were vegetation indices, and EVI and LSWI were more sensitive than NDVI. We developed a modified function (Wsailar), calculated as a function of LSWI, to account for the effect of severe droughts on GPP in VPM. The GPP(VPM) from the modified VPM accounted for the rapid reduction in GPP during severe droughts and the seasonal dynamics of GPPvpm agreed reasonably well with GPP(EC). Our analysis shows that 8-day averaged values (temperature, vapor-pressure deficit) do not reflect the short-term extreme climate events well, suggesting that satellitebased models may need to be run at daily or hourly scales, especially under unfavorable climatic conditions.

AB The total absorption (a(lambda)) and backscattering (b(b)(lambda)) coefficients of natural waters are the most significant factors affecting light propagation within water columns, and thus play indispensable roles in the estimation of aquatic biomass, primary production, and carbon pools. Despite its importance, no accurate retrieval model has been specifically developed for both oceanic and coastal waters, but significant efforts have been made in regard to oceanic inversion models. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the applicability of the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) in deriving a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) from oceanic and coastal waters, and to improve it using a neural network-based semi-analytical algorithm (NNSAA). Based on a comparison of the a(X) and bb(X) predicted by these models with field measurements taken from the national aeronautics and space administration bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD), the Yellow Sea and China East Sea, it is shown that the NNSAA model (R-2 > 0.82 and mean relative error, MRE = 20.6-35.5%) provides a stronger performance than the QAA model (R-2 < 0.73 and MRE = 32.2-69.6%). The model was also applied to MODIS data after atmospheric correction using a near-infrared-based and shortwave infrared-based combined model. Through validation by field measurements, it was shown that the NNSAA model can predict a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) with high accuracy (R-2 >0.77 and MRE < 39.9%). Finally, the NNSAA model was used to map the global climatological seasonal mean a(443) and b(b)(555) for the time range of July 2002 to September 2013. Except the coastal zones, it was shown that the a(443) and b(b)(532) in some high-latitude areas are much higher than in the mid- and low-latitude regions, due to the effects of spurious signals from neighboring sea-ice. In the equatorial oceans, the a(443) value in the surface water is considerably higher in the equatorial Pacific than in the equatorial Atlantic in the upwelling region, while the integrate a(443) is much higher in the Atlantic than in the throughout the entire tropical gyre areas. The difference between a(443) and b(b)(532) in the subsurface water is due to a pronounced deep biomass maximum existing in the equatorial Atlantic, which is associated with the higher nitrate in the lower euphotic zone.

AB This research investigated the use of multi-source remote sensing data to map natural coastal salt marsh vegetation habitats. Coastal zones are very dynamic and provide a number of critical ecosystem services, particularly in relation to flood mitigation but they have been found to be difficult to monitor using remotely sensed data. This research analysed combinations of S-band and X-band quad-polarimetric airborne SAR, elevation data and optical remotely sensed imagery. In total 30 variables were analysed. The SAR inputs included backscatter intensity channels and Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Van Zyl decomposition SAR descriptors. Classification was carried out using Random Forest classifiers at two thematic resolutions which generated a general mapping of salt marsh vegetation and a high-resolution mapping of thematically detailed salt marsh vegetation habitats. The results indicate that Random Forest models are able to handle multi-source datasets and generate high classification accuracies. Models based on either SAR or optical RS variables alone were found to be less accurate than models that combining variables from multiple sources. The results show that X-band SAR data provided the best information to map vegetation extent and analysis showed that S-band SAR data was better able to differentiate between different vegetation habitats. The methods and analyses suggested in this paper extend previous research into remote monitoring of costal zones and illustrate the opportunities for mapping natural coastal areas afforded through combinations of radar and optical remote sensing data.

AB Debris cover is widely present in the ablation areas of mountain glaciers. Such debris plays an important role in glacier mass balance, but it complicates the glacier boundary and area estimation when using remotely sensed images. Automatic recognition of the debris is much more difficult than recognizing bare ice on optical remotely sensed images because the debris has almost the same spectral characteristics of the surrounding.terrain. In this paper, the scattering characteristics of the debris on the C-and L-band polarimetric SAR images are presented and analyzed to study the possibility of recognizing debris thickness and extent. The Koxkar glacier, in the central Tianshan Mountain Range, was selected as the study area. It was found that debris is distinct from bare ice in cross polarization (HV) of both the L-and C-bands. The L-band volume scattering component, acquired from target decomposition, increases with debris thickness when the debris is less than 25 cm deep, but the volume scattering does not increases if the debris is thicker than 25 cm. In contrast, the C-band SAR data does not appear to be sensitive to debris thickness. This difference may be caused by different radar penetration depth of the debris. On the basis of the polarimetric property analysis, two methods were developed to determine the extent of the debris. In the first method, the simple threshold to distinguish debris from non-debris areas is presented. Using this threshold, approximately 90% of the debris can be recognized. In the second method, by combining more polarimetric features and support vector machines, recognition of debris reaches an accuracy greater than 95%. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of diurnal warming at the ocean surface from modified Argo floats providing unpumped measurements of temperature up to the surface are compared against collocated satellite-derived values from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) flying on the METEOSAT-9 Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite. The amplitude of diurnal warming is computed from the difference between subskin and foundation temperature estimates derived independently from the Argo and SEVIRI data. The results demonstrate remarkable consistency between the observations, lending support for both products and the associated methodologies, particularly for the estimation of the foundation temperature. Individual subskin values agree to within an absolute mean difference of <= 0.1 K and standard deviations of the differences are <0.4 K. Statistics for comparison of the foundation temperatures are similar. Differences between the corresponding derived estimates of diurnal warming have negligible bias and standard deviations <0.25 K. The strong agreement of the diurnal warming estimates exists even when excluding nearly isothermal profiles, suggesting the differences are robust to small spatial offsets and point-to-pixel differences. The results particularly support the ability of the modified Argo floats to provide reliable, and highly valuable, measurements of the near-surface temperature, helping to argue for more modified floats. Moreover, the results suggest that the unpumped Argo data has the potential to provide an independent estimate of the foundation temperature for validation of SST analyses. The method for estimating the foundation temperature from SEVIRI represents a good compromise between data coverage and influences of cloud contamination and nighttime cooling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission provides multi-angular, dual-polarised brightness temperatures at 1.4 GHz, from which global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (tau) products are retrieved. This paper presents a study of SMOS' tau product in 2010 and 2011 for crop zones of the USA. Retrieved tau values for 504 crop nodes were compared to optical/IR vegetation indices from the MODES (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite sensor, including the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVE), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and a Normalised Difference Water Index (NOW!) product. tau values were observed to increase during the growing season and decrease during senescence in these areas, as did MODIS vegetation indices. SMOS' tau values generally peaked later than MODES LAI values, with an estimated time difference of about 19 days. A linear regression between tau and the MODIS products was carried out for each node and values of the determination coefficient, R-2, slope, b' and intercept, b '' were found. The average R-2 value varied from 0.32 to 035 for the different vegetation indices. The linear regression between LAI and tau produced an average slope of b' = 0.06, and an average intercept of b '' = 0.14. The effects of crop fraction and dominant crop type were investigated and crop fraction was found to have a low effect on R-2 values. R-2 values appeared to be lower for wheat and hay and higher for corn. b' and b '' values had higher standard deviations for wheat but were generally close to the mean values for corn, soybean and hay.

AB Carbon dioxide is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels and is an important contributor to anthropogenic climate change. Multiple current and planned satellite missions are designed to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on a global scale, but most of these sensors do not have the spatial resolution necessary to resolve point sources such as fossil fuel power plants. Airborne imaging spectrometer data, such as those from the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), can have multiple, contiguous bands covering shortwave infrared (SWIR) absorption features produced by carbon dioxide. Therefore, high spatial resolution data from AVIRIS-like sensors may offer a means for detecting plumes and retrieving carbon dioxide concentrations for point source emissions. The objectives of this study include modeling minimum carbon dioxide anomalies detectable in AVIRIS data under different conditions and applying a Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter for detection of carbon dioxide plumes in simulated data and in AVIRIS images acquired over power plants. Radiative transfer simulations were used to model the residual radiance produced by increased absorption by carbon dioxide as concentration was elevated above background levels within a 0-500 m layer. Carbon dioxide anomalies, surface reflectance, water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering were varied in simulation sets and the resulting residual radiance spectra were compared against noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL) for the "classic" and "next generation" AVIRIS instruments. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide anomalies improved with increased surface reflectance and declined with increased water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering. Zero to 500 m concentration anomalies as low as 100 parts per milion by volume (ppm) for AVIRIS C and 25 ppm for AVIRIS NG produced residual radiance values that exceeded SWIR NEdL Carbon dioxide concentrations modeled for a generic power plant emissions scenario using a plume dispersion model were combined with randomly-generated reflectance spectra to create simulated images with varying surface reflectance and NEdL For these simulated images, true positive and false positive detection rates improved as background reflectance increased and as NEdL decreased. Apparent plumes were detected in all four AVIRIS C images acquired over power plants, although the characteristics of the plumes varied according to solar-plume-sensor geometry. Improvements in modeling may allow retrieval of plume concentration, providing a valuable means for quantifying point source emissions and a basis for comparison with column concentrations retrieved from in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite data.

AB The evolution of permafrost and the active layer is highly related to biological diversity and climate change because of its feedback effects involving water and carbon storage. In this study, we firstly examined the relationship of active layer variation, geomorphological processes and anthropogenic activities by means of small baseline synthetic aperture radar interferometry in Beiluhe, Hoh Xil natural reserve in Tibet Plateau (TP), China. 3.5-Yr observation span of L-band ALOS PALSAR data (June, 2007 to December, 2010) was used. The estimated surface displacements (primarily in the range of 20 mm yr(-1) to 20 mm yr(-1)) and time-series implied evolution of the active layer and permafrost beneath. The motion trend along slopes was complicated due to the geomorphological processes, and thus interdisciplinary interpretations were needed. Anthropogenic influences on this frail permafrost environment were significant, as evident from the remarkable surface settlement along the embankment of Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It is crucial and necessary to monitor this permafrost plateau owing to the consequences arising from a combination of factors related to climate change, geo-hazard prediction, nature conservation and regional sustainable development.

AB A Saharan Dust Index (SDI) has been produced operationally since 2006 from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data. This SDI, based on brightness temperatures (BTs) at 3.9, 8.7, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, has been used in the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) chain to detect Saharan dust and correct for its effect on SST calculations. OSI-SAF has developed a processing chain to derive Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. In this framework, an SDI algorithm adapted to VIIRS data has been developed. Consistency between various SDI derived from various sensors is essential in the OSI-SAF context. Without absolute definition of this parameter, we have adopted the Meteosat-9 nominal SDI values as reference. In this paper we present a new method to define SDI algorithms, based on the use of simulated BTs contaminated by aerosols at various concentrations and altitudes. This method has been applied to VIIRS data. It shows consistent results with the original 2006 method and a simple regression against Meteosat-9 SDI values when compared to the operational Meteosat-9 SDI. This new method can be used to prepare SDI equations for any sensor with adequate channels once their radiometric characteristics are known. In addition, it ensures consistency with our reference SDI. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aerodynamic roughness length (z(0)) is a key variable for the parameterization of momentum, mass and heat exchanges between land surfaces and the atmosphere. Its estimation however is complicated due to the large number of input variables such as height and arrangement of roughness elements on the surface, and its measurement relies on complex micrometeorological instrumentation that is typically unavailable. One remote sensing technology well suited to measuring the height of objects is light detection and ranging (LiDAR). This study demonstrates the use of pre- and post-harvest LiDAR data to quantify the aerodynamic roughness of a post-harvest forest surface. LiDAR data were acquired before and after clearcut harvesting of a 77-ha Douglas-fir dominated site on Vancouver Island, for which a micrometeorological tower provided direct year-long measurements of shear or Reynolds stress (i.e., momentum flux) and wind speed, thus permitting the independent assessment of z(0) using the logarithmic wind profile equation.
   The LiDAR data were used to estimate z(0) based on the standard deviation of roughness element heights within the source areas of the micrometeorological tower. Estimated z(0) from the LiDAR analysis compared well to z(0) calculated using the micrometeorological measurements. The standard deviation of roughness element height estimated from the LiDAR analysis resulted in z(0) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 m (mean +/- SD) for neutral atmospheric stability conditions and z(0) = 0.13 0.01 m for all stability conditions. The value of z(0) calculated using the logarithmic wind profile equation was 0.13 0.13 m for neutral conditions and 0.12 +/- 0.30 m for all stability conditions after applying diabatic profile corrections. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of using LiDAR data to estimate z(0) across large areas and in complex situations where direct measurements of z(0) are impossible.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated the link between leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis, mainly at the leaf level and under controlled laboratory conditions. The present study makes progress in demonstrating the relationship between steady-state fluorescence and net photosynthesis measured under natural light field conditions both at the leaf and image levels. Ground measurements and airborne campaigns were conducted over two summers to acquire hyperspectral imagery at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400-885 nm spectral region. This enabled the identification of pure vegetation pixels to extract their radiance spectra. The datasets were collected in August 2010 and 2011 in the western part of the area included in the Ribera del Duero Designation of Origin (Denominacion de Origen), in northern Spain. The experiments were conducted in twelve full production vineyards where two study plots per field were selected to ensure adequate variability in leaf biochemistry and physiological condition. The vineyard fields were selected on the basis of their gradient in leaf nutrition and plant water status and showed variability in leaf pigment values and stomatal conductance. Leaves were collected for destructive sampling and biochemical determination of chlorophyll a + b, carotenoids and anthocyanins in the laboratory. Leaf steady-state and dark-adapted fluorescence parameters, net photosynthesis (P-n) and stomata( conductance (G(s)) were measured in the field under natural light conditions. Such data were used as a validation dataset to assess fluorescence-photosynthesis relationships both at the leaf and the image level. The Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle based on three spectral bands (FLD3) was the method used to quantify fluorescence emission from radiance spectra extracted from pure vegetation pixels identified in the hyperspectral imagery. Fluorescence retrievals conducted using the FLD3 method yielded significant results when compared to ground-measured steady-state F-s (r(2) = 0.48; p < 0.01) and F-v'/F-m' (r(2) = 0.53; p < 0.01). The two-year assessment yielded consistent results on the relationship between P-n and F-s both at the leaf level and based on the airborne hyperspectral imagery. At the leaf level, significant relationships were found between leaf F-s and P-n (r(2) = 0.55; p < 0.001 for 2010; r(2) = 0.59; p < 0.001 for 2011). At the hyperspectral image level, the agreement between leaf P-n, and airborne F was consistent for both years separately, yielding significant relationships at p < 0.01 for 2010 (r(2) = 0.54) and 2011 (r(2) = 0.41) and a significant relationship at p < 0.001 for the aggregated years (r(2) = 0.52). Results show the link between net photosynthesis and steady-state fluorescence obtained under natural sunlight conditions at both leaf and airborne hyperspectral imagery levels.

AB We present a rapid in situ photogrammetric method to characterize surface roughness by taking overlapping photographs of a scene. The method uses a single digital camera to create a high-resolution digital terrain model (pixel size of similar to 1.32 mm) by means of a free open-source stereovision software. It is based on an auto-calibration process, which calculates the 3D geometry of the images, and an efficient multi-image correlation algorithm. The method is successfully applied to four different volcanic surfaces namely, a'a lava flows, pahoehoe lava flows, slabby pahoehoe lava flows, and lapilli deposits. These surfaces were sampled in the Piton de la Foumaise volcano (Reunion Island) in October, 2011, and displayed various terrain roughnesses. Our in situ measurements allow deriving digital terrain models that reproduce the millimeter-scale height variations of the surfaces over about 12 m(2). Five parameters characterizing surface topography are derived along unidirectional profiles: the root-mean-square height (xi), the correlation length (L-c), the ratio Z(s) = xi(2)/L-c, the tortuosity index (t), and the fractal dimension (D). Anisotropy in the surface roughness has been first investigated using 1-m-long profiles circularly arranged around a central point. The results show that L-c, Z(s) and D effectively catch preferential directions in the structure of bare surfaces. Secondly, we studied the variation of these parameters as a function of the profile length by drawing random profiles from 1 to 12 m in length. We verified that xi and L-c increase with the profile length and, therefore, are not appropriate to characterize surface roughness variation. We conclude that Z(s) and D are better suited to extract roughness information for multiple eruptive terrains with complex surface texture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Observed warming in the high northern latitudes has led to an increase in fire occurrence across North American tundra. Our ability to effectively monitor ecosystem change and the carbon cycle in this region depends upon the development of robust and reliable methods of extracting information about fire events and the characterization of fire impacts from remotely-sensed data. Previously developed and routinely applied remote sensing methods yield poor results in assessing the extent and severity of burning in tundra. Here we present an analysis of temporal trends in spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas of tussock tundra obtained from Landsat imagery within six fire events of the 2010 fire season in the Noatak Nature Preserve in Alaska. The analysis revealed a large variability in surface reflectance of burned and unburned areas across space and time. We established that spectral signatures of fire scars can be well separated by both single- and multi-date mapping approaches immediately after burning. However, the spectral signature of burned areas in tundra deteriorates rapidly and, in our study, is poorly distinguishable by the end of the first post-fire season. Our results showed that common mapping methods based on the normalized burn ratio were inferior to other spectral indices (Tasseled Cap Greenness and Brightness) and single Landsat bands (near-infrared) in separating burned and unburned areas as well as in mapping burn severity.

AB The composition of marine ecosystems is determined by spatial and temporal patterns of global biogeochemical cycles. Shifts in marine ecosystem composition driven by changes in climate can in turn affect biogeochemical cycles, especially through their impact on air-sea fluxes of CO2 and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. However, the response of marine ecosystems to climate is difficult to assess at global scale due to the scarcity of large-scale in-situ biological monitoring programmes. Here, we combine and analyse remote-sensing observations, in-situ observations, and a global ocean biogeochemistry model to gain insight into interactions between marine ecosystem composition and climate variability over the last decade, in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. Our results show large-scale shifts in the dominance of diatoms, with mean anomalies 63.3% higher during extreme positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation index compared to its extreme negative phases and with mean anomalies 134% higher during extreme positive phases of Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Ocean over the period 1998-2008. Significant changes in the frequency of diatom dominance are detected concurrently in the three data sources studied. Model outputs indicate that this increase is driven by nutrient supply from deep waters during windier and more turbulent climate conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The end of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) mission makes harmful algal bloom (HAB) detection with moderate resolution satellite data now relies on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based on MODIS and in situ data collected in the coastal region of the western part of Seto-Inland Sea, Japan with HAB-forming algae Karenia mikimotoi, a simpler new satellite remote sensing-based HAB detection method was developed. The strength of this method is, although it does not require indigenous atmospheric correction scheme, it is expected to be able to classify K. mikimotoi blooms, diatom blooms, TSM-dominated waters, gelbstoff-dominated waters, and mixed waters in the optically complex coastal waters. We anticipate that our satellite remote sensing-based HAB detection method can operate as a valuable complementary tool assisting in situ HAB monitoring and as an integrated part of HAB early warning systems to mitigate HAS negative impacts not only in the coastal waters of the western part of Seto-Inland Sea, Japan, but also in the other coastal waters with different HAS-forming algae, providing that backscattering signature and pigment packaging of other HAS-forming algae are similar to those of K. mikimotoi.

AB Surface coal mining (SCM) has undergone dramatic changes in the last 30 years. Large-scale SCM practices are at the center of an environmental and legal controversy that has spawned lawsuits and major environmental investigations. SCM techniques extract multiple coal seams by removing an area of many square kilometers and creating serious environmental problems. Information about mining activities location is essential for environmental applications, specifically the temporal and spatial patterns of land cover/land use change (LCLUC). Advancements in satellite imagery analysis provide possibilities to investigate new approaches for LCLUC detection caused by SCM globally. However there is no study that analyzes the changes produced for SCM at a global scale. Our work examines three areas of coal extraction in the world: Spain, United States of America (USA), and Australia. We used Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to map SCM affected area. Endmember spectra of vegetation, soil, and impervious surfaces were collected from the Landsat TM image with the help of a fine resolution orthophotographs and the pixel purity index (PPI). Reference endmembers from an Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) spectral library were utilized as well. An unsupervised classifier was applied to the fraction images to obtain an estimation of active SCM affected area. Classification accuracy was reported using error matrixes and kappa statistic using active SCM affected area perimeters digitized from fine resolution orthophotographs as reference data. In addition, we compared the accuracy of the MESMA based estimation to estimates using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), and a spectral index traditionally used as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) testing statistical significance using a Z-test of their kappa Statistics. Results showed a Significant improvement in the accuracy Of the SCM affected area using MESMA with an average increase of the kappa statistic of 31%. We conclude that MESMA-based approach is effective in mapping SCM active affected area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The three-dimensional spatial configuration of forest habitats affects the capacity of arboreal vertebrates to move, access food, and avoid predation. However, vegetation sampling over large areas from a sufficient density of field plots to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in canopy structure is logistically difficult, labor-intensive, time-consuming and costly, particularly in remote areas of tropical forests. We used airborne waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired over the southeastern Peruvian Amazon in combination with detailed field data on a population of bald-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia irrorata) to assess the utility of LiDAR-derived indices of canopy structure in describing parameters of preferred forest types for this arboreal primate. Forest structure parameters represented by LiDAR measurements were significantly different between home range areas used by sakis and those that were not used. Home range areas used by sakis represented a predictable subset of available forest areas, generally those containing the tallest and most uniform canopies. Differences observed within a 335-ha focal area occupied by five previously habituated and systematically followed study groups were consistent across the wider study landscape (6,400 ha): sakis were missing from areas of low-statured, heterogeneous canopies, but they occupied adjacent areas dominated by taller and less variable canopies. These findings provide novel insights into the relationship between vegetation structure and habitat use by a tropical arboreal vertebrate and demonstrate that high-resolution, three-dimensional remote sensing measurements can be useful in predicting habitat occupancy and selection by forest canopy species.

AB The recent increase in food prices has revealed that climate, combined with an expanding population and a widespread change in diet, may result in an end to an era of predictable abundance of global cereal crops. The objective of this paper is to estimate changes of agriculturally-relevant growing season parameters, including the start of the season, length of the growing period and the position of the height or peak of the season, in the primary regions with rainfed agriculture during the past 26 years. Our analysis found that globally, 27% of cereal crop areas have experienced changes in the length of the growing season since 1981, the majority of which had seasons that were at least 2.3 days per year longer on average. We also found both negative and positive trends in the start of season globally, with different effects of changing temperature and humidity being isolated depending on the country and region. We investigated the correlation between the peak timing of the growing season and agricultural production statistics for rain fed agriculture. We found that two thirds of the countries investigated had at least 25% of pixels with crop production that behaved differently than expected from the null hypothesis of no correlation. The results show that variations in the peak of the growing season have a strong effect on global food production in these countries. We show that northern hemisphere countries and states appear to have improved model fit when using phenological models based on humidity while southern hemisphere countries and states have improved model fit by phenological models based on accumulated growing degree days, showing the impact of climate variability during the past two and a half decades.

AB Timely assessment of canopy nitrogen content (CNC) in crops is critical for growth diagnosis and precision management of crops to generate higher yield and better quality while also minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to determine the most suitable algorithm, using hyperspectral reflectance data, for the regional assessment of CNC at a critical growth stage in paddy rice. Ground-based hyperspectral datasets were obtained during the panicle formation stage under a wide range of plant and environmental conditions in Japan and China using spectroradiometers. A hyperspectral airborne dataset was obtained over a typical rice-growing region in Japan using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 3 (CASI-3). On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the hyperspectral data, significant spectral indices (SIs) such as the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI) were explored to provide an accurate and robust assessment of CNC. The capability of multivariable regression approaches, such as partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using the whole hyperspectral data or interval PLSR (IPLSR) using selected wavebands was also examined. Among various SIs, a simple index, RSI (D740, D522) using the first derivative (D) values at 740 nm and 522 nm, was found to be most accurate and robust for the assessment of CNC. The predictive ability of the index was comparable to those of PLSR and IPLSR. Independent validation using the airborne dataset supported the robust applicability of the new SI. The CNC was closely related to the conventional diagnostic indicators based on direct plant measurements. The results demonstrated the operational applicability of hyperspectral measurements for diagnostic mapping of CNC on a regional scale. The investigation based on the precise dataset for rice will be a good basis for remote sensing of canopy nitrogen content in a wide range of vegetation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The lidar and radar profiling capabilities of the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder (CALIPSO) satellites provide opportunities to improve the characterization of cloud properties. Ark Arctic cloud climatology based on their observations may be fundamentally different from earlier Arctic cloud climatologies based on passive satellite observations, which have limited contrast between the cloud and underlying surface. Specifically, the Radar-Lidar Geometrical Profile product (RL-GEOPROF) provides cloud vertical profiles from the combination of active lidar and radar. Based on this data product for the period July 2006 to March 2011, this paper presents a new cloud macrophysical property characteristic analysis for the Arctic, including cloud occurrence fraction (COF), vertical distributions, and probability density functions (PDF) of cloud base and top heights. Seasonal mean COF shows maximum values in autumn, minimum values in winter, and moderate values in spring and summer; this seasonality is more prominent over the Arctic Ocean on the Pacific side. The mean ratios of multi-layer cloud to total cloud over the ocean and land are between 24% and 28%. Low-level COFs are higher over ocean than over land. The ratio of low-level cloud to total cloud is also higher over ocean. Middle-level and high-level COFs are smaller over ocean than over land except in summer, and the ratios of middle-level and high-level clouds to total cloud are also smaller over ocean. Over the central Arctic Ocean, PDFs of cloud top height and cloud bottom height show (1) two cloud top height PDF peaks, one for cloud top heights lower than 1200 m and another between 7 and 9 km; and (2) high frequency for cloud base below 1000 m with the majority of cloud base heights lower than 2000 m.

AB Urban forest tree species mapping has benefitted from advances in remote sensing techniques. In this study, we explored the potential of the newly developed high resolution satellite sensor, WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery for identifying and mapping urban tree species/groups in the City of Tampa, FL, USA by comparing capabilities between high resolution IKONOS (IKO, acquired on April 6, 2006) and WV2 (acquired on May 1, 2011) imagery for identifying the urban tree species. Seven urban tree species/groups were mapped, including: sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Image-objects (IOs) were used as the tree species mapping unit. A stepwise masking protocol was developed to separate sunlit and shadow/shaded tree canopy IOs from the study area prior to tree species mapping. Comparative analyses examined average accuracies of tree species mapping results between four-band IKO imagery and three different band combinations of WV2 imagery: four "traditional" bands, four additional bands, and all eight bands. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Classification and Regression Trees were used to classify IOs using selected 10 features derived from IKO and band combinations of WV2 imagery. With the exception of sand live oak mapping result (due to phenological difference due to image collection dates), validation results indicate significantly improved mapping accuracies using all combinations of WV2 imagery (p<0.01). Results using independent validation samples demonstrated that average accuracy was increased by 16-18% using WV2 imagery compared to that using IKO imagery when considering mapping 6-species/group. Improved results with the WV2 sensor could be attributed to improved spatial resolution (4 m to 2 m) and additional bands (coastal, yellow, red-edge and NIR2). (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The effect of ongoing climate change on sub-arctic and alpine forests has led to increased interest in monitoring potential changes in the forest-tundra ecotone. In addition to climate change, insect damage, browsing pressure by herbivores such as moose and reindeer, as well as anthropogenic impacts will contribute to changes in the forest-tundra ecotone. These changes are difficult to monitor with manual methods because of the complex mosaic pattern of the ecotone. In this study, the possibility to predict maximum tree height, above ground tree biomass and canopy cover with airborne laser scanning (ALS) was therefore tested at a forest-tundra ecotone site near Abisko in northern Sweden (Lat. N 68 degrees 20', Long. E 19 degrees 01', 420-700 m a.s.l.). The forest in the area is dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), which has highly irregular stem and canopy forms. Predictions from two different laser data acquisitions were compared. The first laser data set had 6.1 points m(-2) and was obtained in 2008 with a TopEye MKII scanner carried by a helicopter flown at 500 m a.g.l. The second laser data set had 1.4 points m(-2) and was obtained in 2010 with an Optech ALTM Gemini scanner carried by a fixed-wing aircraft flown at 1740 m a.g.l. Linear regression models were developed for the predictions using data from 73 sample plots with ten meter radius surveyed in 2009 and 2010. The relative RMSEs obtained for the TopEye and Optech data after leave-one-out cross-validation were, respectively, 8.8% and 9.5% for maximum tree height; 18.7% and 21.2% for above ground tree biomass; and, 16.8% and 18.7% for vertical canopy cover on plot level. The results were clearly improved by introducing a new procedure to compensate for unevenly distributed laser points. In conclusion, ALS has strong potential as a data source to map mountain birch biomass in the forest-tundra ecotone, even when using sparse point density ALS data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest cover change is one of the most important land cover change processes globally, and old-growth forests continue to disappear despite many efforts to protect them. At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62% in 1990 to 64% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26% in 1990, to 20% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14%) or non-pine scrub forest (66%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a "best-case scenario" for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.

AB Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a large proportion of its population living in rural areas. While industry is limited, over 70% of the territory is covered by forests, which can potentially be used to attract investment through forest-based projects that promote reductions in carbon emissions and sustainable management. These can be leveraged by producing accurate maps of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at national level and by developing cost-effective mapping methods that allow reliable future updating for management and engagement in international mechanisms such as the United Nations (UN) Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries.
   Using data from Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), this study compared a semi-empirical and machine learning algorithm, with the latter based on bagging stochastic gradient boosting (BagSGB), for retrieving the AGB of woody vegetation thereby supporting estimation of national carbon stocks. AGB was estimated by using measurements of tree size collected from112 forest plots during two field campaigns (2007 and 2008) as input to published allometric equations.
   The BagSGB outperformed the semi-empirical algorithm, resulting in a coefficient of correlation (R) between observed and cross-validation predicted forest AGB values of 0.95 and in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.62 Mg ha(-1). Furthermore, the BagSGB model produced also a measure of forest AGB prediction variability (coefficient of variation) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, with values ranging from 7 to 250% (mean = 42%). An estimate of total forest AGB carbon stock of 96.93 Mt C was obtained in this study for Guinea-Bissau, with a mean forest AGB value of 65.17 Mg ha(-1). Although the mean error associated with this forest AGB map is still undesirably high, several issues were addressed. The heterogeneity of forest structural types, presence of palm trees, and dimension and type of field plots were identified as potential source of uncertainty that must be tackled in future studies. This study represents a step forward regarding the information currently available for Guinea-Bissau. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An important component of satellite-based soil moisture algorithm development and validation is the comparison of coincident remote sensing and in situ observations that are typically provided by intensive field campaigns. The planned NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has unique requirements compared to previous soil moisture satellite programs because both active and passive microwave observations are needed. The primary source of these combined observations has been an aircraft-based SMAP simulator called PALS (Passive and Active L-band System). This paper presents an overview of the field experiment data collected using PALS that spans 10 years. Data from the various campaigns were merged to form a single data set. Analyses showed that the data set contains an extensive range of soil moisture values collected under a variety of conditions and that the quality of both the PALS and ground truth data meets the needs of SMAP algorithm development and validation. The study suggests that the data set should be expanded in order to achieve globally representative land cover diversity and that more observations under dense vegetation conditions and longer time series would be desirable.

AB Accurate estimates of the quantity and quality of grasslands, as they vary in space and time and from regional to global scales, furthers our understanding of grassland ecosystems. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is a promising sensor for measuring and monitoring grasslands due to its high spectral resolution, medium spatial resolution and a two- to three-day repeat cycle. However, thus far the multi-biome MERIS land products have limited consistency with in-situ measurements of leaf area index (LAI), while the multi-biome canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) has not been validated yet with in-situ data. This study proposes a single-biome approach to estimate grassland LAI (a surrogate of grass quantity) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and CCC (surrogates of grass quality) using the inversion of the PROSAIL model and MERIS reflectance. Both multi-biome and single-biome approaches were validated using two-season in-situ data sets and the temporal consistency was analyzed using time-series of MERIS data. The single-biome approach showed a consistently better performance for estimating LAI (R-2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.02, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 16%) and CCC (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 0.36, NRMSE = 23%) compared with the multi-biome approach (LAI: R-2 = 0.36, RMSE = 1.77, NRMSE = 28%; CCC: R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 1.33, NRMSE = 84%). However, both single-biome and multi-biome approaches failed to retrieve LCC. The multi-biome LAI was overestimated at lower LAI values (<2) and saturated at higher LAI values (>= 4), and the multi-biome CCC was consistently overestimated through the whole data range. Similar temporal trajectories of grassland LAI and CCC estimates were observed using these two approaches, but the multi-biome trajectory consistently produced larger values than the single-biome trajectory. The spatio-temporal variation of grassland LAI and CCC estimated by the single-biome approach was shown to be closely associated with agricultural practices. Our results underline the potential of mapping grassland LAI and CCC using the PROSAIL model and MERIS satellite data. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecologists commonly collect data on vegetation structure, which is an important attribute for characterizing habitat. However, measuring vegetation structure across large areas is logistically difficult. Our goal was to evaluate the degree to which sample-point pixel values and image texture of remotely sensed data are associated with vegetation structure in a North American grassland-savanna-woodland mosaic. In the summers of 2008-2009 we collected vegetation structure measurements at 193 sample points from which we calculated foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure at Fort McCoy Military Installation, Wisconsin, USA. We also calculated sample-point pixel values and first- and second-order image texture measures, from two remotely sensed data sources: an infrared air photo (1-m resolution) and a Landsat TM satellite image (30-m resolution). We regressed foliage-height diversity against, and correlated horizontal vegetation structure with, sample-point pixel values and texture measures within and among habitats. Within grasslands, savanna, and woodland habitats, sample-point pixel values and image texture measures explained 26-60% of foliage-height diversity. Similarly, within habitats, sample-point pixel values and image texture measures were correlated with 40-70% of the variation of horizontal vegetation structure. Among habitats, the mean of the texture measure 'second-order contrast' from the air photo explained 79% of the variation in foliage-height diversity while 'first-order variance' from the air photo was correlated with 73% of horizontal vegetation structure. Our results suggest that sample-point pixel values and image texture measures calculated from remotely sensed data capture components of foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure within and among grassland, savanna, and woodland habitats. Vegetation structure, which is a key component of animal habitat, can thus be mapped using remotely sensed data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A radar imaging model including a Doppler shift module is presented for quantitative studies of radar observations of wave-current interaction in a strong tidal current regime. The model partitions the Doppler shift into the relative contribution arising from the motion of the backscattering facets including Bragg waves, specular points, and breaking waves that are advected by and interact with the underlying surface current. Simulated and observed normalized radar cross sections and Doppler shifts for different environmental conditions and radar parameters are compared and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The objective of this paper is to quantitatively validate the global MODIS and CYCLOPES leaf area index (LAI) products using a global LAI field measurement database created on the basis of a literature review and major validation campaigns. The MODIS LAI product suite, containing the Terra Collection 4 (C4), Terra Collection 5 (C5) and Terra + Aqua combined C5, was analyzed, with considerable attention paid to the quality control (QC) information. The CYCLOPES V3.1 LAI product was similarly analyzed with regard to the status map (SM) layer. In general, the MODIS LAI has improved consistently over all releases. MODIS C5 data retrieved with the main algorithm (QC<64) and CYCLOPES data showed a similar range of uncertainties (1.0-1.2). Uncertainties for the best MODIS C5 (QC= 0) and CYCLOPES (SM =0) estimates were around 0.9-1.1. The overall mean differences between the best MODIS C5 and CYCLOPES were within +/- 0.10. The highest correspondence was obtained for woody biomes from the best MCD15 C5 data (RMSE = 0.80). Results indicate that the uncertainties in current LA! products (around +/- 1.0) are still unable to meet the accuracy requirement of GCOS (+/- 0.5). Although there are limitations, we recommend MODIS C5 retrieved with the main algorithm (QC<64) and CYCLOPES for the user community. This study demonstrates the necessity of exploring uncertainties related to the true and effective LA's separately, and reveals the importance of referring to the quality assessment information. More field measurements are required for further studies, which should focus on under-sampled biome types and areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM + TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of Rn-222 (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone.
   Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.

AB A methodology to assess levee structural integrity using high resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is investigated for a 16 km reach of the Sacramento River within the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (California). Levee geometric parameters (levee crown width, height and water and landside slopes) were extracted from 0.5 m resolution LiDAR derived digital ground models. Deviation of these parameters from minimum levee design standards was used to calculate a levee stability index. Stability maps were generated and those areas that did not meet USACE geometric shape standards were identified. Results show that 2 out of the 4 geometric parameters do not meet the minimum value required in 48% and 43% of profiles on the east (urban adjacent) and west (farmland adjacent) margins respectively. Most importantly, the crown width in 99% of the levee profiles located on the urban side was below the minimum required. The paper also points out the importance of evaluating all four geometric parameters, not just the elevation of the levee, by assessing its level of performance through a geometric assessment.

AB Current satellite sensors provide data of insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to fully characterize the patchy phenology patterns of dryland forests. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is an algorithm that fuses Landsat 30 m data with MODIS 500 m data to produce synthetic imagery at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time steps. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using STARFM to produce synthetic imagery over a dryland vegetation study site for the purpose of tracking phenological changes. We assembled subsets of six Landsat-5 TM scenes and temporally-coincident MODIS datasets spanning the 2006 April-October growing season in central-northern Arizona, which is characterized by large tracts of dryland forest. To investigate the effects of temporal compositing, BRDF-adjustment, and base pair timing on the accuracy of the resulting synthetic imagery, we employed a range of MODIS 500 m surface reflectance datasets (daily, 8-day composite, and 16-day Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR)) as well as initial Landsat/MODIS imagery pairs from opposite ends of the growing season. The STARFM algorithm was applied to each MODIS data series to produce up to twelve synthetic images corresponding to each Landsat image. We evaluated the accuracy of the synthetic images by comparing the reflectance values of a random sample of the vegetation pixels with the corresponding pixel values of the reference Landsat image on a band-by-band basis. Our results indicate that the NBAR imagery is the optimal dataset for use with Landsat-5 TM data in this area. The NBAR dataset consistently returned the lowest absolute difference values and the highest correlations. A comparison of landscape-scale maps of the timing and value of the peak NDVI derived from STARFM, Landsat, and MODIS (NBAR) time series across the full 2006 growing season shows the effect of the heightened spatial and temporal resolution offered by a STARFM-based dataset This work demonstrates the feasibility of using the STARFM algorithm to assemble an imagery time series at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution in vegetated dryland ecosystems.

AB For over a decade the ATSR series of sensors produced high quality SST data products, but the narrow swath did not encourage their use for operational tasks. This changed in 2005 when the European Space Agency's Medspiration Service introduced AATSR data in the GHRSST L2P format. This paper describes the opportunities provided by the Medspiration system for facilitating the complementary use of SST products from AATSR and from other satellite sensors. It explains how, following the implementation by Medspiration of GHRSST procedures, data products and tools, AATSR data are now being used around the world to complement the use of other sources of SST and to facilitate bias adjustments between them. Despite the limited daily coverage of AATSR its broadly reliable accuracy and stability seem to be beneficial to SST analyses that merge all available observations. The new analyses are already contributing to improved ocean and weather forecasting. This represents an unforeseen but significant role for the ATSR series, through which it continues to make an important contribution to the operational uses of SST. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation productivity across the Sahel is known to be affected by a variety of global sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. Often climate indices are used to relate Sahelian vegetation variability to large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. However, previous research findings reporting on the Sahelian vegetation response to climate indices have been inconsistent and contradictory, which could partly be caused by the variations in spatial extent/definitions of climate indices and size of the region studied. The aim of this study was to analyze the linkage between climate indices, pixel-wise spatio-temporal patterns of global sea surface temperature and the Sahelian vegetation dynamics for 1982-2007. We stratified the Sahel into five subregions to account for the longitudinal variability in rainfall. We found significant correlations between climate indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the Sahel, however with different magnitudes in terms of strength for the western, central and eastern Sahel. Also the correlations based on NDVI and global SST anomalies revealed the same East-West gradient, with a stronger association for the western than the eastern Sahel. Warmer than average SSTs throughout the Mediterranean basin seem to be associated with enhanced greenness over the central Sahel whereas colder than average SSTs in the Pacific and warmer than average SSTs in the eastern Atlantic were related to increased greenness in the most western Sahel. Accordingly, we achieved high correlations for SSTs of oceanic basins which are geographically associated to the climate indices yet by far not always these patterns were coherent. The detected SST-NDVI patterns could provide the basis to develop new means for improved forecasts in particular of the western Sahelian vegetation productivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A multi-temporal LiDAR study of an active landslide at Montaguto (Italy) is presented. Four LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Models acquired on May 2006, July 2009, April 2010 and June 2010 are used. The interpretation of selected morphometric parameters (surface roughness, residual topographic surface) and the statistical analysis of the temporal variations of such parameters allowed the reconstruction and tracking of the landslide. The landslide boundary monitoring was achieved and zones of uplift and subsidence, volumes of removed and/or accumulated material, and average rates of vertical and horizontal displacement (retreat rate of the crown and advancement rate of the toe) were estimated. Deformation structures (scarps, cracks, folds) affecting the landslide in different times were also mapped: some of such structures represent precursors of impending instability processes or give information on the mechanism of emplacement. Various types of activity (e.g. rock-fall, flow) and geometry (e.g., channelized flow) are recognized and zones whose topographic features change with time due to artificial drainage and earth handling/removal work were detected. The LiDAR-derived information allows us to decipher the kinematics of the landslide. The results provide new insight on the use of airborne LiDAR in the monitoring strategies of gravity-controlled processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The formation of diurnal warming events in sea surface temperature (SST) observations in the Arctic is investigated using multiple satellite derived SST products and in situ buoy temperature measurements. Significant diurnal warming events (of the order of several K) are shown to occur even in the Arctic during summer months, when the total daily insolation at high latitudes is, in fact, higher than that at low and mid latitudes. The observed Arctic diurnal warming events are shown to usually happen in persistent low wind conditions, and are more frequent in shallow waters than deep waters. During the studied period of June and July 2008, significant diurnal warming events were observed over most of the studied area, although with smaller spatial extent and reoccurring less often when compared to events reported at low and mid latitudes.

AB High-quality and gap-free satellite time series are required for reliable terrestrial monitoring. Moderate resolution sensors provide continuous observations at global scale for monitoring spatial and temporal variations of land surface characteristics. However, the full potential of remote sensing systems is often hampered by poor quality or missing data caused by clouds, aerosols, snow cover, algorithms and instrumentation problems. A multisensor fusion approach is here proposed to improve the spatio-temporal continuity, consistency and accuracy of current satellite products. It is based on the use of neural networks, gap filling and temporal smoothing techniques. It is applicable to any optical sensor and satellite product. In this study, the potential of this technique was demonstrated for leaf area index (LAI) product based on MODIS and VEGETATION reflectance data. The FUSION product showed an overall good agreement with the original MODIS LAI product but exhibited a reduction of 90% of the missing LAI values with an improved monitoring of vegetation dynamics, temporal smoothness, and better agreement with ground measurements.

AB A new technique relying on SimpLe Approximations for cLOudy Media (SLALOM) for the retrieval of cloud optical and microphysical parameters from optical satellite data during daytime is introduced. The technique is based on simple yet highly accurate approximations of the asymptotic solutions of the radiative transfer theory which have already been implemented in the forward radiative transfer model CLOUD. These approximations enable a solution of the equations of the corresponding backward model during runtime leading to a very fast computation speed. Since these asymptotic solutions are generally applicable to weakly absorbing media only, pre-calculated look-up tables for the reflection function of a semi-infinite cloud (and also the escape function) are used to overcome this restriction within this new retrieval.

AB Monitoring and understanding plant phenology is becoming an increasingly important way to identify and model global changes in vegetation life cycle events. High elevation biomes cover twenty percent of the Earth's land surface and provide essential natural resources. These areas experience limited resource availability for plant growth, development, and reproduction, and are one of the first ecosystems to reflect the harmful impact of climate change. Despite this, the phenology of mountain ecosystems has historically been understudied due to the rough and variable terrain and inaccessibility of the area. In addition, although numerous studies have used synoptically sensed data to study phenological patterns at the continental and global scales, relatively few have focused on characterizing the land surface phenology in mountainous areas. Here we use the MODIS/Ferra + Aqua satellite 8-day 500 m Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance product to quantify the land surface phenology. We relate independent data for elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and temperature as well as longitude and latitude with the derived phenology estimates. We present that satellite derived SOS can be predicted based on topographic and weather variables with a significant R(2)adj between 0.56 and 0.62 for the entire western mountain range. Elevation and latitude exhibit the most significant influences on the timing of SOS throughout our study area. When examined at both the local and regional scales, as well as when accounting for aspect and temperature, SOS follows closely with Hopkins' Bioclimatic Law with respect to elevation and latitude.

AB Remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation uses a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) to monitor plant characteristics, but these indices can be very sensitive to canopy background reflectance. This study investigated background influences on VIs applied to intertidal microphytobenthos, using a synthetic spectral library constituted by a spectral combination of three contrasting types of sediment (sand, fine sand, and mud) and reflectance spectra of benthic diatom monospecific cultures obtained in controlled conditions. The spectral database exhibited, for the same biomass range (3-182 mg chlorophyll am(-2)), marked differences in albedo and spectral contrast linked to sediment variability in water content, grain size, and organic matter content. Several VIs were evaluated, from ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, to hyperspectral indices (derivative analysis, continuum removal). Among the ratios, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appeared less sensitive to background effects than VIs with soil corrections such as the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) or the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The lower efficacy of soil-corrected VIs may be explained by the structural differences and optical behavior of soil vs. canopies compared to sediment vs. microphytobenthos biofilms. The background effects were minimized using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 632 nm and 675 nm, and the second derivative at 632 nm, while poor results were obtained with the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and the second derivative at 675 nm. The least sensitive index was the Phytobenthos Index which is very similar to the NDVI, but uses a red wavelength at 632 nm instead of 675 nm, to account for the absorption by chlorophyll c. The modified NDVI705, where the 705 nm wavelength replaces the red band, showed moderate background sensitivity. Moreover, the NDVI705 and the Phytobenthos Index have the additional relevant property of being less sensitive to the index saturation response with increasing biomass. Unfortunately, these VIs cannot be applied to broad-band multispectral satellite images, and require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this study showed that the background influence was not a limitation to applying the ubiquitous NDVI to map intertidal microphytobenthos using multispectral satellite images.

AB Three process based models are used to estimate terrestrial heat fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET) at the global scale: a single source energy budget model, a Penman-Monteith based approach, and a Priestley-Taylor based approach. All models adjust the surface resistances or provide ecophysiological constraints to account for changing environmental factors. Evaporation (or sublimation) over snow-covered regions is calculated consistently for all models using a modified Penman equation. Instantaneous fluxes of latent heat computed at the time of satellite overpass are linearly scaled to the equivalent daily evapotranspiration using the computed evaporative fraction and the day-time net radiation. A constant fraction (10% of daytime evaporation) is used to account for the night time evaporation. Interception losses are computed using a simple water budget model. We produce daily evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux for the global land surface at 5 km spatial resolution for the period 2003-2006. With the exception of wind and surface pressure, all model inputs and forcings are obtained from satellite remote sensing.
   Satellite-based inputs and model outputs were first carefully evaluated at the site scale on a monthly-mean basis, then as a four-year mean against a climatological estimate of ET over 26 major basins, and finally in terms of a latitudinal profile on an annual basis. Intercomparison of the monthly model estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes with 12 eddy-covariance towers across the U.S. yielded mean correlation of 0.57 and 0.54, respectively. Satellite-based meteorological datasets of 2 m temperature (0.83), humidity (0.70), incident shortwave radiation (0.64), incident longwave radiation (0.67) were found to agree well at the tower scale, while estimates of wind speed correlated poorly (0.17). Comparisons of the four year mean annual ET for 26 global river basins and global latitudinal profiles with a climatologically estimated ET resulted in a Kendall's tau>0.70. The seasonal cycle over the continents is well represented in the How-libeller plots and the suppression of ET during major droughts in Europe, Australia and the Amazon are well picked up. This study provides the first ever moderate resolution estimates of ET on a global scale using only remote sensing based inputs and forcings, and furthermore the first ever multi-model comparison of process-based remote sensing estimates using the same inputs.

AB Frost risk assessment is of critical importance in tropical highlands like the Andes where human activities thrives at altitudes up to 4200 m, and night frost may occur all the year round. In these semi-arid and cold regions with sparse meteorological networks, remote sensing and topographic modeling are of potential interest for understanding how physiography influences the local climate regime. After integrating night land surface temperature from the MODIS satellite, and physiographic descriptors derived from a digital elevation model, we explored how regional and landscape-scale features influence frost occurrence in the southern altiplano of Bolivia. Based on the high correlation between night land surface temperature and minimum air temperature, frost occurrence in early-, middle- and late-summer periods were calculated from satellite observations and mapped at a 1-km resolution over a 45,000 km(2) area. Physiographic modeling of frost occurrence was then conducted comparing multiple regression (MR) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Physiographic predictors were latitude, elevation, distance from salt lakes, slope steepness, potential insolation, and topographic convergence. Insolation influence on night frost was tested assuming that ground surface warming in the daytime reduces frost occurrence in the next night. Depending on the time period and the calibration domain. BRT models explained 74% to 90% of frost occurrence variation, outperforming the MR method. Inverted BRT models allowed the downscaling of frost occurrence maps at 100-m resolution, illustrating local processes like cold air drainage. Minimum temperature lapse rates showed seasonal variation and mean values higher than those reported for temperate mountains. When applied at regional and subregional scales successively, BRT models revealed prominent effects of elevation, latitude and distance to salt lakes at large scales, whereas slope, topographic convergence and insolation gained influence at local scales. Our results highlight the role of daytime insolation on night frost occurrence at local scale, particularly in the early- and mid-summer periods when solar astronomic forcing is maximum. Seasonal variations and interactions in physiographic effects are also shown. Nested effects of physiographic factors across scales are discussed, as well as potential applications of physiographic modeling to downscale ecological processes in complex terrains.

AB Tillage practices can affect the long term sustainability of agricultural soils as well as a variety of soil processes that impact the environment. Crop residue retention is considered a soil conservation practice given that it reduces soil losses from water and wind erosion and promotes sequestration of carbon in the soil. Spectral unmixing estimates the fractional abundances of surface targets at a sub-pixel level and this technique could be helpful in mapping and monitoring residue cover. This study evaluated the accuracy with which spectral unmixing estimated percent crop residue cover using multispectral Landsat and SPOT data. Spectral unmixing produced crop residue estimates with root mean square errors of 17.29% and 20.74%, where errors varied based on residue type. The model performed best when estimating corn and small grain residue. Errors were higher on soybean fields, due to the lower spectral contrast between soil and soybean residue. Endmember extraction is a critical step to successful unmixing. Small gains in accuracy were achieved when using the purest crop residue- and soil-specific endmembers as inputs to the spectral unmixing model. To assist with operational implementation of crop residue monitoring, a simple endmember extraction technique is described. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired during the summer of 2006 revealed island wakes in the lee of the Izu Islands, south of Japan. The wakes were formed of not only meandering disturbances but also a series of eddies with diameters on the order of those of the islands. The Kuroshio flowed near these islands in the summer of 2006, indicating that the island wakes were induced by a Kuroshio-island interaction. Satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) images observed during the summer of 2006 revealed low-SST and high Chl-a wakes, some of which included low-SST eddy trains. It is thus inferred that the phenomenon entailed upwelling and mixing processes and biological productivity known as the "island-mass effect." High-spatial-resolution SST derived by combining a LANDSAT infrared channel and AVHRR SST clearly revealed a well-defined SST front associated with the island wakes and a 1 km-scale low-SST wake pattern. A numerical simulation was performed to investigate the formation mechanism. The simulation qualitatively reproduced the cold-eddy pattern, with eddy-driven mixing developing a mixed layer down to 200 m, causing low-SST island wakes. The shedding frequency and spacing of the model-produced eddies were roughly close to those of the Karman vortex theory, suggesting that Karman-type cold-eddy trains are commonly formed behind the islands when the Kuroshio strong flow impinges on them.

AB The communities of benthic microalgae that form dense biofilms at the surface of aquatic sediments, or microphytobenthos, are important primary producers in estuarine intertidal flats and shallow coastal waters. The microalgal biomass present in the photic zone of the sediment is a key parameter for ecological and photophysiological studies on microphytobenthos, and has been routinely estimated using hyperspectral reflectance indices based on the chlorophyll (Chl) a red absorption peak at 675 nm, usually the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study reports that red region-based biomass indices measured on microphytobenthos biofilms can be significantly affected by the enrichment of reflected light with solar-induced Chl fluorescence emitted by the microalgae. Chl fluorescence emission peaks at 683 nm, counterbalancing the decrease in reflectance centered at 675 nm, thus causing the underestimation of NDVI. The interference of Chl fluorescence was found to be easily identified by a conspicuous double-peak feature in the 670-700 nm region of the second-derivative reflectance spectra. The fluorescence-induced NDVI underestimation was shown to be most pronounced for high surface biomass levels and low incident solar irradiance. Particular aspects of microphytobenthos biofilms, such as the increase in surface Chl fluorescence due the contribution of emission by subsurface layers, and vertical migratory responses by motile microalgae to changes in ambient light, further complicate the effects on biomass estimation using NDVI-like indices. By comparing NI)VI with a fluorescence-independent biomass index for a wide range of natural light conditions, it was found that Chl fluorescence interference may cause the underestimation of microalgal biomass to reach over 25%, with errors above 10% being expected for more than half of the measuring occasions. These results indicate that the use of NDVI may compromise the correct assessment of important aspects of microphytobenthos ecology, such as the characterisation of migratory behaviour or the determination of biomass-specific productivity rates, and call for the use of alternative biomass indices, not based on the Chl a red absorption peak.

AB This special issue is the result of sustained and highly collaborative efforts to improve the use of remotely sensed data to inform management of protected areas. The 15 papers in the issue address a diverse range of topics. These papers provide a conceptual basis and a framework for establishing monitoring programs, techniques and methods to make operational the use of remotely sensed data, case studies, and synthesis papers liking remotely sensed data to models used to inform ecological assessments. Studies in this issue necessarily confront the universal challenges of scale, both spatial and temporal, and the sometimes tenuous link between observed patterns and significant ecological process. A clear message is that the information needs of resource managers require information across scales, and these information demands will continue to motivate advances in the collection and analysis of remotely sensed data. This compilation of papers is unusual in (1) articulating a basic, if somewhat technical, foundation of remote sensing that is required for resource managers to effectively collaborate with remote sensing specialists, and (2) providing a framework for addressing monitoring resource issues that is likely to be of interest to many remote sensing specialists. We hope these papers inspire broader use of remotely sensed data to manage the increasingly rare and valuable resources in protected areas around the world. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Wildfire is an important disturbance agent in Canada's boreal forest. Optical remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat TM/ETM+), is well suited for capturing horizontally distributed forest conditions, structure, and change, while Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are more appropriate for capturing vertically distributed elements of forest structure and change. The integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LIDAR data provides improved opportunities to characterize post-fire conditions. The objective of this study is to compare changes in forest structure, as measured with a discrete return profiling LIDAR, to post-fire conditions, as measured with remotely sensed data. Our research is focused on a boreal forest fire that occurred in May 2002 in Alberta, Canada. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), the differenced NBR (dNBR), and the relative dNBR (RdNBR) were calculated from two dates of Landsat data (August 2001 and September 2002). Forest structural attributes were derived from two spatially coincident discrete return LIDAR profiles acquired in September 1997 and 2002 respectively. Image segmentation was used to produce homogeneous spatial patches analogous to forest stands, with analysis conducted at this patch level.
   In this study area, which was relatively homogenous and dominated by open forest, no statistically significant relationships were found between pre-fire forest structure and post-fire conditions (r<0.5; p>0.05). Post-fire forest structure and absolute and relative changes in forest structure were strongly correlated to post-fire conditions (r ranging from -0.507 to 0.712; p<0.0001). Measures of vegetation fill (VF) (LIDAR capture of cross-sectional vegetation amount), post-fire and absolute change in crown closure (CC), and relative change in average canopy height, were most useful for characterizing post-fire conditions. Forest structural attributes generated from the post-fire LIDAR data were most strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, while dNBR and RdNBR had stronger correlations with absolute and relative changes in the forest structural attributes. Absolute and relative changes in VF and changes in CC had the strongest positive correlations with respect to dNBR and RdNBR, ranging from 0.514 to 0.715 (p<0.05). Measures of average inter-tree distance and volume were not strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, dNBR, or RdNBR. No marked differences were found in the strength or significance of correlations between post-fire structure and the post-fire NBR, dNBR, RdNBR, indicating that for the conditions present in this study area all three burn severity indices captured post-fire conditions in a similar manner. Finally, the relationship between post-fire forest structure and post-fire condition was strongest for dense forests (>60% crown closure) compared to open (26-60%) and sparse forests (10-25%). Forest structure information provided by LIDAR is useful for characterizing post-fire conditions and burn induced structural change, and will complement other attributes such as vegetation type and moisture, topography, and long-term weather patterns, all of which will also influence variations in post-fire conditions.

AB In order to retrieve bathymetry, substratum type and the concentrations of the optically active constituents of the water column, an integrated physics based mapping approach was applied to airborne hyperspectral data of Moreton Bay, Australia. The remotely sensed data were sub-optimal due to high and mid-level cloud covers. Critical to the correct interpretation of the resultant coastal bathymetry map was the development of a quality control procedure based on additional outputs of the integrated physics based mapping approach and the characteristics of the instrument. These two outputs were: an optical closure term which defines differences between the image and model based remote sensing signal; and an estimate of the relative contribution of the substratum signal to the remote sensing signal. This quality control procedure was able to identify those pixels with a reliable retrieval of depth and to detect thin and thick clouds and their shadows, which were subsequently masked out from further analysis. The derived coastal bathymetry in depths ranging 4-13 m for the mapped area was within +/- 15% of boat-based multi-beam acoustic mapping survey of the same area. The agreement between the imaging spectrometry and the acoustic datasets varies as a function of the contribution of the bottom visibility to the remote sensing signal. As expected, there was greater agreement in shallower clear water (+/- 0.67 m) than quasi-optically deep water (+/- 1.35 m). The quantitative identification and screening of the optically deep waters and the quasi-optically deep waters led to improved precision in the depth retrieval. These results suggest that the physics based mapping approach adopted in this study performs well for retrieving water column depths in coastal waters in water depths ranging 4-13 m for the area and conditions studied, even with sub-optimal imagery.

AB Nearest neighbors techniques are non-parametric approaches to multivariate prediction that are useful for predicting both continuous and categorical forest attribute variables. Although some assumptions underlying nearest neighbor techniques are common to other prediction techniques such as regression. other assumptions are unique to nearest neighbor techniques. Graphical diagnostic tools are proposed to evaluate the assumptions and to address issues of bias, homoscedasticity, influential observations, outliers, and extrapolations. The tools are illustrated using results obtained from applying the k-Nearest Neighbors technique with Landsat imagery and forest inventory ground observations. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Hydrology is the single most important abiotic factor in the formation and functioning of a wetland. Many limitations still exist to accurately characterizing wetland hydrology over large spatial extents, especially in forested wetlands. Imaging radar has emerged as a viable tool for wetland flood mapping, although the limitations of radar data remain uncertain. The influence of incidence angle on the ability to detect flooding in different forest types was examined using C-HH Radarsat-1 data (23.5 degrees, 27.5 degrees, 33.5 degrees, 39.0 degrees, 43.5 degrees, and 47.0 degrees) during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons. The ability to detect flooding under leaf-on conditions varied much more according to incidence angle while forest type (open canopy tupelo-cypress, tupelo-cypress, and bottomland hardwood) had a greater effect during the leaf-off season. When all forest types were considered together, backscatter generally decreased with increasing incidence angle under all conditions (2.45 dB between 23.5 degrees and 47.0 degrees flooded, leaf-off; 2.28 dB between 23.5 degrees and 47.0 degrees not flooded, leaf-off; 0.62 between 23.5 degrees and 43.5 degrees flooded, leaf-on; 1.73 dB between 23.5 degrees and 43.5 degrees not flooded, leaf-on; slope was not constant between incidence angles), but the distinction between flooded and non-flooded areas did not decline sharply with incidence angle. Differentiation of flooded and non-flooded forests was similar during the leaf-off and leaf-on seasons. The ability to detect inundation under forest canopies was less than expected at smaller incidence angles and greater than expected at larger incidence angles, based on the results of previous studies. Use of a wider range of incidence angles during the entire year increases the temporal resolution of imagery which may, in turn, enhance mapping of inundation beneath forest canopies.

AB Spatial assessment of fire risk is very important for reducing the impacts of wildland fires. Several variables related to fire ignition, propagation and its effects are included in fire risk analysis. Life Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is one such variable, which is highly related to fire ignition, and propagation. A wide variety of methods have been applied to estimate LFMC, including field sampling and meteorological indices. Given the limitations of these methods, satellite images are a Sound alternative for estimating LFMC because of their capability to spatially and temporally monitor the vegetation status.
   This paper aims to improve previous empirical models to estimate LFMC from satellite images, by considering meteorological information. The Original models proposed by Clurvieco et al. [Chuvieco, E., Cocero, D., Riano, D., Martin, M.P., Martinez-Vega, J., et al., (2004). Combining NDVI and surface temperature for the estimation of live fuel moisture content in forest fire danger rating. Remote Sensing of Environment, 92, 322-331] for grasslands and shrublands were used as starting point for this research. High over-estimation of LFMC values from those models was found when applied to dry years. Consequently, the new models proposed in this paper use a simple drought index to discriminate between dry and wet years at the beginning of the spring season. A different harmonic function Was fitted to each group of hydrological years, to take into account the inter-annual variations in LFMC seasonal trends. Subsequently, two empirical models, one for grasslands and one for shrubs (Cistus ladanifer), were derived based on multivariate linear regression analysis of the data collected at Cabaneros National Park (Central Spain). Determination coefficients greater than 0.8 for grasslands and 0.7 for Shrubs were found. The models showed good performance too when applied to other plots of grasslands (R-2=0.76) and shrubland (R-2=0.71) with similar environmental characteristics to the calibration site.

AB Monitoring of photosynthetic efficiency (epsilon) over space and time is a critical component of climate change research as it is a major determinant of the amount of carbon accumulated by terrestrial ecosystems. While the past decade has seen progress in the remote estimation of c at the leaf, canopy and stand level using the photochemical reflectance index PRI (based on the normalized difference of reflectance at 531 and 570 nm), little is known about the temporal and spatial requirements for up-scaling PRI to landscape and global levels using satellite observations. One potential way to investigate these requirements is using automated tower-based remote sensing platforms, which observe stand level reflectance with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Prediction of epsilon from PRI diurnally or over a full year requires observations of canopy reflectance over multiple view and sun-angles. As a result, these observations are subject to directional reflectance effects which can be interpreted in terms of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) using semi-empirical kernel driven models. These semi-empirical models use a combination of physically based BRDF shapes and empirical observations to standardize rnulti-angular observations to a common viewing and illumination geometry. Directional reflectance effects are thereby modeled as a linear superposition of mathematical kernels, representing the bi-direction variation in reflectance from isotropic, geometric, and volumetric scattering components of the vegetation canopy. However, because variations in plant physiological conditions can also introduce bidirectional reflectance variations, we introduce an approach to separate bidirectional effects arising purely from plant physiological status from other effects by stratifying PRI observations into categories based on environmental conditions for which the expected physiological variability is low. Within each of these PRI strata, the derived physically based BRDF shapes were used to standardize multi-angular PRI measurements to a common viewing and illumination geometry. The method significantly enhanced the relationship found between PRI and epsilon (from r(2)=0.38 for the directionally uncorrected case to r(2)=0.82 for the directionally corrected case) from data measured continuously over the course of 1 year over an evergreen conifer forest using an automated platform. Results show that isotropic PRI scattering is highly correlated to changes in epsilon, while geometric scattering can be related to canopy level shading. Instrumentation and approaches such as the one demonstrated in this study may be integrated into current efforts aiming at predicting epsilon at global scales using satellite observations.

AB Remote sensing is the most practical means of measuring energy release from large open-air biomass burning. Satellite measurement of fire radiative energy (FRE) release rate or power (FRP) enables distinction between fires of different strengths. Based on a 1-km resolution fire data acquired globally by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites from 2000 to 2006, instantaneous FRP values ranged between 0.02 MW and 1866 MW, with global daily means ranging between 20 and 40 MW. Regionally, at the Aqua-MODIS afternoon overpass, the mean FRP values for Alaska, Western US, Western Australia, Quebec and the rest of Canada are significantly higher than these global means, with Quebec having the overall highest value of 85 MW. Analysis of regional mean FRP per unit area of land (FRP flux) shows that at peak fire season in certain regions, fires can be responsible for up to 0.2 W/m(2) at peak time of day. Zambia has the highest regional monthly mean FRP flux of similar to 0.045 W/m(2) at peak time of day and season, while the Middle East has the lowest value of similar to 0.0005 W/m(2). A simple scheme based on FRP has been devised to classify fires into five categories, to facilitate fire rating by strength, similar to earthquakes and hurricanes. The scheme uses MODIS measurements of FRP at 1-km resolution as follows: category 1 (< 100 MW), category 2 (100 to < 500 MW), category 3 (500 to < 1000 MW), category 4 (1000 to < 1500 MW), category 5 (2:1500 MW). In most regions of the world, over 90% of fires fall into category 1, while only less than 1% fall into each of categories 3 to 5, although these Proportions may differ significantly from day to day and by season. The frequency of occurrence of the larger fires is region specific, and could not be explained by ecosystem type alone. Time-series analysis of the proportions of higher category fires based on MODIS-measured FRP from 2002 to 2006 does not show any noticeable trend because of the short time period.

AB Meaningful relationships between forest structure attributes measured in representative field plots on the ground and remotely sensed data measured comprehensively across the same forested landscape facilitate the production of maps of forest attributes such as basal area (BA) and tree density (TD). Because imputation methods can efficiently predict multiple response variables simultaneously, they may be usefully applied to map several structural attributes at the species-level. We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data. The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF). To compare and evaluate these approaches, we computed a scaled Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between observed and imputed plot-level BA and TD for I I conifer species sampled in north-central Idaho. We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD. We concluded that RF was the most robust and flexible among the imputation methods we tested. We also concluded that canopy structure and topographic metrics derived from LiDAR surveys can be very useful for species-level imputation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB State of the arte assimilation techniques, such as 3D-Var, are relatively seldom used within climate analysis frameworks, partly because of the enormous numerical costs. In order to face this issue ESA's high performance computing Grid. on-Demand (G-POD) is used. We assimilate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based radio occultations (RO). RO data in general exhibit some favorable properties, like global coverage, all-weather capability expected long-term stability and accuracy. These properties and the continuity of data offered by the Meteorological Operational Satellite (MetOp) program and other RO missions are an ideal opportunity to study the long term atmospheric and climate variability. This paper investigates the assimilation of RO refractivity profiles into first guess fields derived from 21 years of ECMWF's ERA40 dataset on a monthly mean basis divided into four synoptic time layers in order to take the diurnal cycle into account. In contrast to NWP systems, the assimilation procedure is applied without cycling, thus enabling us to run our 3D-Var implementation within G-POD parallel for different time layers. Results indicate a significant analysis increment which is partly systematic, emphasizing the ability of RO data to add independent information to ECMWF analysis fields, with a potential to correct biases. This work lays the ground for further studies using data from existing instruments within a framework based on a mature methodology. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous models of evapotranspiration have been published that range in data-driven complexity, but global estimates require a model that does not depend on intensive field measurements. The Priestley-Taylor model is relatively simple, and has proven to be remarkably accurate and theoretically robust for estimates of potential evapotranspiration. Building on recent advances in ecophysiological theory that allow detection of multiple stresses on plant function using biophysical remote sensing metrics, we developed a bio-meteorological approach for translating Priestley-Taylor estimates of potential evapotranspiration into rates of actual evapotranspiration. Five model inputs are required: net radiation (R.), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), maximum air temperature (T-max), and water vapor pressure (ea). Our model requires no calibration, tuning or spin-ups. The model is tested and validated against eddy covariance measurements (FLUX-NET) from a wide range of climates and plant functional types-grassland, crop, and deciduous broadleaf, evergreen broadleaf, and evergreen needleleaf forests. The model-to-measurement r(2) was 0.90 (RMS = 16 mm/month or 28%) for all 16 FLUX-NET sites across 2 years (most recent data release). Global estimates of evapotranspiration at a temporal resolution of monthly and a spatial resolution of 1 degrees during the years 1986-1993 were determined using globally consistent datasets from the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP-II) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer (AVHRR). Our model resulted in improved prediction of evapotranspiration across water-limited sites, and showed spatial and temporal differences in evapotranspiration globally, regionally and latitudinally.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a basic quantity indicating crop growth situation and plays a significant role in agricultural, ecological and meteorological models at local, regional and global scale. It is a common approach to invert LAI based on canopy reflectance models using optimization method. Radiative transfer model for continuous vegetation canopy such as SAIL models is widely used for crop LAI inversion. However, crops are mostly planted as row structure in China and they don't fit the assumptions of continuous vegetation especially at the earlier growth stages. What kind of models should be used to invert LAI for typical row-planted crops at different growing stages? Taking corn as an example, the factors which influence the row planted crop LAI estimation are investigated in this paper. Using the computer simulated BRDF data sets, different models for LAI inversion at different growth stages are evaluated based on parameter sensitivity analysis. Bayes theory is used to introduce a priori knowledge in the inversion process. In 2005, a field campaign is carried out to validate LAI inversion accuracy during corn's growing stages in Huailai, Hebei Province, China. Inverted LAI from both the measured Canopy Reflectance (CR) data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are very promising. The results show that at least two kinds of models should be adopted for corn canopy at different growth stages, i.e., row structure model for early growth stage (before elongation) and homogeneous canopy model for later growth stage (after elongation).

AB Aerosol and cloud data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua are used to investigate interannual variability of smoke and warm cloud relationships during the dry-to-wet transition season (August-October) over the Amazon for two years and its association with meteorological conditions. In one year (2003), smoke aerosols are associated with an increase of cloud fraction and a decrease of cloud effective radius. These effects amplify the cooling at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by the aerosol extinction. However, in another year (2002) the cloud fraction decreases with increasing aerosol optical depth. Such a decrease of cloud fraction could offset the effect of increased reflection of solar radiation by the aerosols both at the surface and at TOA. The changes in radiative fluxes between these years would contribute to interannual changes of surface energy fluxes and radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere and influence variability of the wet season onset in the basin. In 2003, the atmosphere was more humid and less stable. These conditions may be relatively favorable for the activation of aerosol particles into cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud droplets. In 2002, the clouds were less extensive and thinner in a relatively dry atmosphere and presumably dissipated more easily. This study suggests that the aerosol-cloud relation can be influenced by atmospheric structure and convective motions, in addition to changes in aerosols properties. An adequate characterization of aerosol-cloud relationship would require a longer time series of data that includes a variety of climate conditions. The caveat of this analysis is that differences in aerosol absorption and its vertical distribution may have contributed to the observed interannual change of smoke-cloud relationship but could not be determined due to lack of adequate measurements.

AB We provide an overview of a project to develop and demonstrate radars for imaging the ice-bed interface, mapping shallow and deep internal layers, and measuring ice thickness. We developed an ultra-wideband very high-frequency (VHF) radar (120 to 300 MHz) for simultaneously measuring ice thickness, mapping internal layers at depth, and imaging the ice-bed interface, and an ultra high-frequency (UHF) ultra-wideband radar (500 to 2000 MHz) for fine-resolution mapping of near-surface internal layers. We used these radars to collect data at Summit Camp, Greenland, during July 2005, and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) deep drill core site during January 2006. These results provide us with an unprecedented view of basal characteristics and internal layers. We also developed an outreach program, a communications system, and rovers to facilitate geophysical measurements in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is an important variable in climate and hydrological studies in northern latitudes. To date, remote sensing tools, especially in the microwave domain, have shown their potential for monitoring this parameter. However, operational use at the regional and global scales needs further improvements. Strong uncertainties remain, mainly due to snow metamorphism as well to the presence of vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to use the semi-empitical Helsinski University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model to estimate SWE with a minimum number of ancillary ground information. Non linear inversion techniques were used to compute SWE considering snow grain size as a free parameter, and initializing the inversion process with rough values of snow depth and density. Results were validated by comparing SWE estimations derived from airborne and spaceborne 19.35 and 37.0 GHz brightness temperatures to ground based SWE measurements over Central Canada. We showed that remotely sensed SWE estimations, retrieved with an average root mean square error of 24 mm, permit the monitoring of the seasonal snow pack evolution, as well as interannual variation (tested over 11 years), useful for hydrological applications.

AB This paper proposes an angular and emissivity-dependent split-window equation that permits the determination of the sea surface temperature (SST) to a reasonable level of accuracy for any observation angle, including large viewing angles at the image edges of satellite sensors with wide swaths. This is the case of the MODIS radiometer both on EOS Terra/Aqua platforms, with observation angles of up to 65 at the surface, for which the split-window equation has been developed in this study. The algorithm takes into account the angular dependence of both the atmospheric correction (due to the increase of the atmospheric optical path with angle) and the emissivity correction (since sea surface emissivity (SSE) decreases with observation angle). Angular-dependent coefficients have been estimated for the atmospheric terms, and also an explicit dependence on the SSE has been included in the algorithm, as this parameter has values different to a blackbody surface for off-nadir angles, the SSEs also being dependent on surface wind speed. The proposed algorithm requires as input data at-sensor brightness temperatures for the split-window bands (31 and 32 of MODIS), the observation angle at each pixel, an estimate of the water vapor content (which is provided by the MODIS MOD07/MYD07 products) and accurate SSE values for both channels. The preliminary results show a good agreement between SSTs estimated by the proposed equation for off-nadir viewings of MODIS-Terra images and in situ SST measurements, with a root-mean square error (RMSE) of about +/- 0.3 K, for which the MODIS SST product gives an RMSE larger than +/- 0.7 K.

AB In order for quantitative applications to make full use of the ever-increasing number of Earth observation satellite systems, data from the various imaging sensors involved must be on a consistent radiometric scale. This paper reports on an investigation of radiometric calibration errors due to differences in spectral response functions between satellite sensors when attempting cross-calibration based on near-simultaneous imaging of common ground targets in analogous spectral bands, a commonly used post-launch calibration methodology. Twenty Earth observation imaging sensors (including coarser and higher spatial resolution sensors) were considered, using the Landsat solar reflective spectral domain as a framework. Scene content was simulated using spectra for four ground target types (Railroad Valley Playa, snow, sand and rangeland), together with various combinations of atmospheric states and illumination geometries. Results were obtained as a function of ground target type, satellite sensor comparison, spectral region, and scene content. Overall, if spectral band difference effects (SBDEs) are not taken into account, the Railroad Valley Playa site is a "good" ground target for cross calibration between most but not all satellite sensors in most but not all spectral regions investigated. "Good" is defined as SBDEs within +/- 3%. The other three ground target types considered (snow, sand and rangeland) proved to be more sensitive to uncorrected SBDEs than the RVPN site overall. The spectral characteristics of the scene content (solar irradiance, surface reflectance and atmosphere) are examined in detail to clarify why spectral difference effects arise and why they can be significant when comparing different imaging sensor systems. Atmospheric gas absorption features are identified as being the main source of spectral variability in most spectral regions. The paper concludes with recommendations on spectral data and tools that would facilitate cross-calibration between multiple satellite sensors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest canopy height is a critical parameter in better quantifying the terrestrial carbon cycle. It can be used to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon pools stored in the vegetation, and predict timber yield for forest management. Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) uses polarimetric separation of scattering phase cderived from interferometry to estimate canopy height. A limitation of PollnSAR is that it relies on sufficient scattering phase center separation at each pixel to be able to derive accurate forest canopy height estimates. The effect of wavelength-dependent penetration depth into the canopy is known to be strong, and could potentially lead to a better height separation than relying on polarization combinations at one wavelength alone. Here we present a new method for canopy height mapping using dual-wavelength SAR interferometry (InSAR) at X- and L-band. The method is based on the scattering phase center separation at different wavelengths. It involves the generation of a smoothed interpolated terrain elevation model underneath the forest canopy from repeat-pass L-band InSAR data. The terrain model is then used to remove the terrain component from the single-pass X-band interferometric surface height to estimate forest canopy height. The ability of L-band to map terrain height under vegetation relies on sufficient spatial heterogeneity of the density of scattering elements that scatter L-band electromagnetic waves within each resolution cell. The method is demonstrated with airborne X-band VV polarized single-pass and L-band HH polarized repeat-pass SAR interferometry using data acquired by the E-SAR sensor over Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, UK. This is one of the first radar studies of a semi-natural deciduous woodland that exhibits considerable spatial heterogeneity of vegetation type and density. The canopy height model is validated using airborne imaging LIDAR data acquired by the Environment Agency. The rmse of the LIDAR canopy height estimates compared to theodolite data is 2.15 m (relative error 17.6%). The rmse of the dual-wavelength InSAR-derived canopy height model compared to LIDAR is 3.49 m (relative error 28.5%). From the canopy height maps carbon pools are estimated using allometric equations. The results are compared to a field survey of carbon pools and rmse values are presented. The dual-wavelength InSAR method could potentially be delivered from a spaceborne constellation similar to the TerraSAR system. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate the potential of combining satellite altimetry and radiometry for lake ice studies using the example of Lake Baikal in Siberia. We show the synergy using active and passive microwave observations available from the recent satellite altimetry missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ENVISAT and Geosat Follow-On), cornplemented by the SSM/I passive data. We assess the applicability of altimetric and radiometric data for ice/water discrimination, and discuss the drawbacks and benefits of each type of sensor. An ice discrimination method, based on the combined use of the data from the four altimetric missions and SSM/I, is proposed and validated using available in situ observations and MODIS imagery. The method is applied to the entire satellite data set and used to define specific dates of ice events (first appearance of ice, formation of stable ice cover, first appearance of open water, complete disappearance of ice) and associated uncertainties. Using these satellite-derived estimates, we can extend the existing time series of ice events in the Southern Baikal up to 2004 and provide new information on the Middle and Northern Baikal, regions where no recent in situ ice cover observations are available. Our data show that over the last 10-15 years, trends towards earlier ice formation and later ice break-up result in a tendency for longer fast ice duration over the whole Lake Baikal. The methods proposed here have been tested for Lake Baikal, but they are applicable for other lakes and water bodies with seasonal ice cover. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the surface deformation of the eastern California area that includes Long Valley caldera and Mono Basin. We apply the SAR Interferometry (InSAR) algorithm referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach that allows us to generate mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series for the investigated area. The results presented in this work represent an advancement of previous InSAR studies of the area that are mostly focused on the deformation affecting the caldera. In particular, the proposed analysis is based on 21 SAR data acquired by the ERS-1/2 sensors during the 1992-2000 time interval, and demonstrates the capability of the SBAS procedure to identify and analyze displacement patterns at different spatial scales for the overall area spanning approximately 5000 km(2). Two previously unreported localized deformation effects have been detected at Paoha Island, located within the Mono Lake, and in the McGee Creek area within the Sierra Nevada mountains, a zone to the south of the Long Valley caldera. In addition a spatially extended uplift effect, which strongly affects the caldera, has been identified and analyzed in detail. The InSAR results clearly show that the displacement phenomena affecting the Long Valley caldera have a maximum in correspondence of the resurgent dome and are characterized by the sequence of three different effects: a 1992-1997 uplift background, a 1997-1998 unrest phenomenon and a 1998-2000 subsidence phase. Moreover, the analysis of the retrieved displacement time series allows us to map the extent of the zone with a temporal deformation behavior highly correlated with the detected three-phases deformation pattern: background uplift-unrest-subsidence. We show that the mapped area clearly extends outside the northern part of the caldera slopes; accordingly, we suggest that future inversion models take this new evidence into account. The final discussion is dedicated to a comparison between the retrieved InSAR measurements and a set of GPS and leveling data, confirming the validity of the results achieved through the SBAS-InSAR analysis.

AB Observations in the visible and infrared spectral bands from the Imager instrument onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) have been used to derive snow depth. The technique makes use of correlation between depth of the snow pack and satellite-derived subpixel fractional snow cover. Previous efforts to infer snow depth from satellite data with this technique were focused oil grasslands and croplands, where the snow depth/snow fraction relationship is most pronounced. In this paper we improve the retrieval algorithm to extend snow depth estimates to forested areas. The enhanced algorithm accounts for the tree cover fraction and for the type of forest, deciduous or coniferous. The developed technique was used to derive maps of snow depth over mid-latitude areas of North America during winter seasons of 20032004 and 2004-2005. Satellite-based snow depth maps were produced daily at 4 km spatial resolution. To validate the retrievals we compared them with surface observations of snow depth and with the snow depth analysis prepared at the NOAA National Operational Hydrological Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC). The estimated retrieval error was about 30% for snow depths below 30 cm and increased to 50% for snow depths ranging from 30 to 50 cm. Snow depth retrievals were limited to scenes with less than 80% deciduous forest cover fraction and less than 50% needle leaf forest cover. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of the bidirectional behavior of forest canopy have shown that the total reflectance of a forest canopy is the combination of illuminated and shaded components of the tree crown as well as the background. In this study, we estimate the background portion from the bidirectional reflection observed by Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument which scans the earth in nine different view angles in an oblique plane relative to the sun. The nadir and 60 degrees forward directions of the MISR images were used to derive the reflectivity of the forest background based on the probabilities of viewing the illuminated tree crown and background on those view angles. The probabilities were estimated using the Four-Scale model. In the study, background reflectivity mosaic images in red and NIR wavelengths covering the BOREAS region during winter and spring seasons were obtained. The mosaic images of winter show high background reflectivity in both wavelengths, and in most of the areas the reflectivity was more than 0.3. In mosaic images of spring the spatial variations in the background reflectivity were considerable. The seasonal changes in the background reflectivity were also studied with multi temporal MISR data, and a similarity in the temporal pattern was found between the retrieved forest background reflectivity and grass land reflectance. These spatial and temporal patterns of the background component retrieved from MISR would be critically important in retrieving the biophysical parameters of vegetation and in ecosystem modeling.

AB Surface moisture stress and vegetation condition can be derived from spectral vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The combination of thermal infrared data with these vegetation indices is often plotted as a triangular scatterplot. One such relationship uses the radiant temperatures versus the NIR/blue ratio developed for a semiarid area from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Given that the thermal range of this index was invalid when applied to a humid temperate region, this study evaluated the utility of using the NIR/blue ratio alone as an indicator of land use/land cover (LULC) separability under spatially varying moisture conditions. It also explored the additional information gained from using multiple view angles (MVA) of this ratio. Results indicate that for the Howland Forest, Maine study site in August 2003, the MVA version of the NIR/blue ratio discriminated among moisture-driven LULC variations, wetland types and moisture stress extent. Separability was best captured by forward view angles and the optimum multi-angular composite was the An/Af/Bf RGB. The multi-angular ratio was sensitive to variations in species type and vigour, water/vegetation proportions and moisture gradients across emergent wetlands. The study extends the original NIR/blue ratio to include wetlands, aquatic vegetation and other temperate LULC types and has the potential to avoid false change detection while contributing to improved mapping and land cover classifications.

AB Various empirical techniques have been developed to identify turbid marine waters within satellite ocean color imageries. The present technique, which essentially rests on the enhancement of reflectance in the green part of the spectrum when sediments are present, accounts for the improved knowledge regarding the relationship between the chlorophyll concentration and the scattering coefficient in oceanic case-1 waters. It also accounts for the bidirectional character of the light field emerging from a water body and thus for the sensitivity of the water-leaving radiance to the observational conditions (viewing angle and sun angle). Therefore, the thresholds, above which the turbid waters can be detected, are not constant. They depend on the chlorophyll concentration and on geometry (on the zenith-sun angle). The practical way of implementing such a discriminating tool is explained. Examples of the application of this technique are provided for level-2 and level-3 satellite data (SeaWiFS and MERIS).

AB The validation of satellite ocean color data products is a critical component in establishing their measurement uncertainties, assessing their scientific utility, and identifying conditions for which their reliability is suspect. Such efforts require a considerable amount of high quality in situ data, preferably consistently processed and spanning the satellite mission lifetime. This paper outlines the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group's (OBPG) method for validating satellite data products using in situ measurements as ground truth. Currently, the OBPG uses the described method for validating several historical and operational ocean color missions. By way of a case study, results for the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) are shown. These results indicate that for the majority of the global ocean, SeaWiFS data approach the target uncertainties of 5% for clear water radiances as defined prior to launch. Our results add confidence in the use of these data for global climate studies, where a consistent, high quality data set covering a multi-year time span is essential. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Early warning systems (EWS) tend to focus on the identification of slow onset disasters such famine and epidemic disease. Since hazardous environmental conditions often precede disastrous outcomes by many months, effective monitoring via satellite and in situ observations can successfully guide mitigation activities. Accurate short term forecasts of NDVI Could increase lead times, making early warning earlier. This paper presents a simple empirical model for making 1 to 4 month NDVI projections. These statistical projections are based on parameterized satellite rainfall estimates (RFE) and relative humidity demand (RHD). A quasi-global, I month ahead, F study demonstrates reasonable accuracies in many semi-arid regions. In Africa, a 0.1 degrees cross-validated skill assessment quantifies the technique's applicability at 1 to 4 month forecast intervals. These results suggest that useful projections can be made over many semi-arid, food insecure regions of Africa, with plausible extensions to drought prone areas of Asia, Australia and South America.

AB Wildfires have a range of significant environmental effects with respect to both Earth's surface and atmosphere. Spaceborne remote sensing of active fires has been undertaken for more than two decades, but the bi-spectral Infrared Detection (BIRD) Experimental Small Satellite (2001-04) is the first mission dedicated to this task. This paper summarizes the experience gained during the BIRD mission, which has focused both on active fire detection and active fire characterization, in terms of quantifying effective fire temperature (T(F)), effective fire area (A(F)) and fire radiative power (FRP). A detailed error analysis for each parameter is undertaken, and the accuracy of FRP retrieval is shown to be significantly better than that of T(F) or A(F). For key fire-affected forest, bush and savanna environments (Australia, Benin, Borneo, Brazil, Canada-US, Portugal and Siberia) BIRD data allows FRP estimation to within 30% in 75% of fires examined, and for the first time from space BIRD is able to allow estimation of fireline length, effective fireline depth and radiative fireline intensity for the more pronounced fire fronts. Some indication of the predominant combustion regime (smoldering or flaming), which has implications for the relative concentrations of emitted pollutant products, is possible through use of the T(F) parameter. This experience demonstrates the advantages of the new infrared sensor technologies employed in BIRD, and offers suggestions for future fire monitoring sensors based on similar technologies.

AB Land surface temperature plays an important role in many environmental studies, as for example the estimation of heat fluxes and evapotranspiration. In order to obtain accurate values of land surface temperature, atmospheric, emissivity and angular effects should be corrected. This paper focuses on the analysis of the angular variation of canopy emissivity, which is an important variable that has to be known to correct surface radiances and obtain surface temperatures. Emissivity is also involved in the atmospheric corrections since it appears in the reflected downwelling atmospheric term. For this purpose, five different methods for simulating directional canopy emissivity, have been analyzed and compared. The five methods are composed of two geometrical models, developed by Sobrino et al. [J. A. Sobrino, V Caselles, & F. Becker (1990). Significance of the remotely sensed thermal infrared measurements obtained over a citrus orchard. ISPRS Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 44, 343-354] and Snyder and Wan [W. C.

Extension of SAIL to a 4-component optical-thermal radiative transfer model simulating thermodynamically heterogenous canopies. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing], in which the vegetation is considered as a turbid medium. Over surfaces with sparse and low vegetation cover, high angular variations of canopy emissivity are obtained, with differences between at-nadir view and 80 degrees of 0.03. Over fully vegetated surfaces angular effects on emissivity are negligible when radiative transfer models are applied, so in these situations the angular variations on emissivity are not critical on the retrieved land surface temperature from remote sensing data. Angular variations on emissivity are lower when the emissivity of the soil and the emissivity of the vegetation are closer. All the models considered assume Lambertian behaviour for the soil and the leaves. This assumption is also discussed, showing a different behaviour of directional canopy emissivity when a non-Lambertian soil is considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Flooding over the Mackenzie River Basin, which is situated in northwestern Canada, is a complex and rapid process. This process is mainly controlled by the occurrence of ice jams. Flood forecasting is of very important in mitigating social and economic damage. This study investigates the potential of a rating curve model for flood forecasting. The proposed approach is based on the use of a Water Surface Fraction derived from SSM/I passive microwave images and discharge observations. The rating curve model is based on an existing correlation between flooded areas and measured discharge. However, a time lag can be observed between these two variables. Thus, the rating curve model has been modified by the introduction of a lag term that could vary depending on the flooding intensity and the features of the basin. Hence, the lag term is computed dynamically using a cross-correlation function between Water Surface Fraction values which are derived from SSM/I observations and the discharge vectors. The rating curve model is based on two empirical parameters that depend on the site features, which vary in both space and time. To overcome this dependency, the rating curve model was linked to a Kalman filter in order to dynamically estimate the empirical parameters according to the forecasting errors encountered at each time step. With the Kalman filter, the dynamic rating curve model continuously readjusts its parameters to satisfy the non-stationary behavior of hydrological processes. The model is thus sufficiently flexible and adapted to various conditions. Simulations were carried out over the Mackenzie River Basin (1.8 million km(2)) during the summers of 1998 and 1999. NOAA-AVHRR images were used to validate the forecast WSF values. The predicted flooded areas agree well with those derived from the NOAA-AVHRR images. Further simulations were carried out from 1992 to 2000 using the rating curve model to predict discharge at a downstream location. Even though an interannual variability of the water surface fractions was observed over the PAD area, the modified model was sufficiently flexible to be readjusted and to reproduce satisfactory results. This implies that a combination of passive microwave data and discharge observations presents an interesting potential in flood and discharge prediction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the ice covered waters of the Greenland Sea the polarisation ratio of QuikSCAT SeaWinds Ku-band (13.4 GHz) scatterometer measurements and the polarisation ratio of DMSP-SSM/I 19 GHz radiometer measurements are used in combination to classify new-ice and mature ice. In particular, the formation of the new-(frazil/pancake)-ice 'Odden' (8 degrees W, 75 degrees N) March 11th-18th, 2001, is used in the study. The results of the ice cover classification in the Greenland Sea are compared to model parameters from a sea ice model. The classification of each ice pixel is performed using its backscatter and radiative properties as reflected in the polarisation ratio. Our results based on these comparisons show that the transformation into older mature (sheet) ice occurs within 5 - 10 days. During one day the new-ice cover increased by 33 000 km(2). The new-ice appears in March 2001 as a peninsula (maximum extent 56000 km(2)) appended to the belt of older ice drifting along the East Coast of Greenland. These results are consistent with the ice model and with Radarsat images. Furthermore, using the ice model it is demonstrated that the new-ice/mature ice threshold in the classification corresponds to the physical transition of the ice cover from pancake ice to a consolidated young-ice sheet. The classification of each pixel into ice or water is done using two scatterometer parameters, namely the polarisation ratio and the daily standard deviation of the backscatter.

AB An algorithm for burned area mapping in Africa based on classification trees was developed using SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) imagery. The derived 1 km spatial resolution burned area maps were compared with 30 m spatial resolution maps obtained with 13 Landsat ETM+ scenes, through linear regression analysis. The procedure quantifies the bias in burned area estimation present in the low spatial resolution burned area map. Good correspondence was observed for seven sites, with values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.787 to 0.983. Poorer agreement was observed in four sites (R-2 values between 0.257 and 0.417), and intermediate values of R-2 (0.670 and 0.613) were obtained for two sites. The observed variation in the level of agreement between the Landsat and VGT estimates of area burned results from differences in the spatial pattern and size distribution of bums in the different fire regimes encompassed by our analysis. Small and fragmented burned areas result in large underestimation at I kin spatial resolution. When large and compact burned areas dominate the landscape, VGT estimates of burned area are accurate, although in certain situations there is some overestimation, Accuracy of VGT burned area estimates also depends on vegetation type. Results showed that in forest ecosystems VGT maps underestimate substantially the amount of burned area. The most accurate estimates were obtained for woodlands and grasslands. An overall linear regression fitted with the data from the 13 comparison sites revealed that there is a strong relationship between VGT and Landsat estimates of burned area, with a value of R-2 of 0,754 and a slope of 0.803. Our findings indicate that burned area mapping based on I kin spatial resolution VGT data provides adequate regional information. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A measurement campaign to assess the feasibility of remote sensing of sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) from a coniferous canopy was conducted in a boreal forest study site (Finland). A Passive Multi-wavelength Fluorescence Detector (PMFD) sensor, developed in the LURE laboratory, was used to obtain simultaneous measurements of ChlF in the oxygen absorption bands, at 687 and 760 nm, and a reflectance index, the PRI (Physiological Reflectance Index), for a month during spring recovery. When these data were compared with active fluorescence measurements performed on needles they revealed the same trend. During sunny days fluorescence and reflectance signals were found to be strongly influenced by shadows associated with the canopy structure. Moreover, chlorophyll fluorescence variations induced by rapid light changes (due to transient cloud shadows) were found to respond more quickly and with larger amplitude under summer conditions compared to those obtained under cold acclimation conditions. In addition, ChlF at 760 nm was observed to increase with the chlorophyll content. During this campaign, the CO2 assimilation was measured at the forest canopy level and was found remarkably well correlated with the PRI index. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite study of oceanic eddy formation, propagation, interactions, and fate was first conducted by sea surface temperature derived at infrared wavelengths. For visible wavelength ocean color reflectances, it is shown that recent radiative transfer model inversions provide additional characteristics of eddies: their constituent absorption and backscattering inherent optical properties. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient has the highest contrast and is therefore the most visually evident inherent optical property (while the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and backscattering coefficients are respectively less discernible). For use as an analytical tool, comparisons suggests that the chromophoric, dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient has a similar to 10x higher contrast (i.e., similar to 5% vs. 50%) in the Middle Atlantic Bight making eddy events detectable over longer time periods than with SST imagery. Example imagery illustrates the application of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and phytoplankton absorption coefficient inherent optical properties to the visual injection of dissolved and particulate organic carbon into the deep ocean by a Gulf Stream ring.

AB Using streamflow and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) measurements as constraints, the evaluation of the Moderate Resolution lmaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily and 8-day snow-cover products is carried out using the Upper Rio Grande River Basin as a test site. A time series of the snow areal extent (SAE) of the Upper Rio Grande Basin is retrieved from the MODIS tile h09v05 covering the time period from February 2000 to June 2004 using an automatic Geographic Information System (GIS)-based algorithm developed for this study. Statistical analysis between the streamflow at Otowi (NM) station and the SAE retrieved from the two MODIS snow-cover products shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between the streamflow and SAE for both products. This relationship can be disturbed by heavy rainstorms in the later springtime, especially in May. Correlation analyses show that the MODIS 8-day product has a better correlation r=-0.404) with streamflow and has less percentage of spurious snowmelt events in wintertime than the MODIS daily product (r=-0.300). Intercomparison of these two products, with the SNOTEL data sets as the ground truth, shows that (1) the MODIS 8-day product has higher classification accuracy for both snow and land; (2) the omission error of misclassifying snow as land is similar for both products, both are low; (3) the MODIS 8-day product has a slightly higher commission error of rnisclassifying land as snow than the MODIS daily product; and (4) the MODIS daily product has higher omission errors of misclassifying both snow and land as clouds. Clouds are the major cause for reduction of the overall accuracy of the MODIS daily product. Improvement in suppressing clouds in the 8-day product is obvious from this comparison study. The sacrifice is the temporal resolution that is reduced from 1 to 8 days. The significance of the results is that the 8-day product will be more useful in evaluating the streamflow response to the snow-cover extent changes, especially from the long-term point of view considering its lower temporal resolution than the daily product. For clear days, the MODIS daily algorithm works quite well or even better than the MODIS 8-day algorithm. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional approaches to training a supervised image classification aim to fully describe all of the classes spectrally. To achieve a complete description of each class in feature space, a large training set is typically required. It is not, however, always necessary to have training statistics that provide a complete and representative description of the classes, especially if using nonparametric classifiers. For classification by a support vector machine, only the training samples that are support vectors, which lie on part of the edge of the class distribution in feature space, are required; all other training samples provide no contribution to the classification analysis. If regions likely to furnish support vectors can be identified in advance of the classification, it may be possible to intelligently select useful training samples. The ability to target useful training samples may allow accurate classification from small training sets. This potential for intelligent training sample collection was explored for the classification of agricultural crops from multispectral satellite sensor data. With a conventional approach to training, only a quarter of the training samples acquired actually made a positive contribution to the analysis and allowed the crops to be classified to a high accuracy (92.5%). The majority of the training set, therefore, was unnecessary as it made no contribution to the analysis. Using ancillary information on soil type, however, it would be possible to constrain the training sample acquisition process. By limiting training sample acquisition only to regions with a specific soil type, it was possible to use a small training set to classify the data without loss of accuracy. Thus, a small number of intelligently selected training samples may be used to classify a data set as accurately as a larger training set derived in a conventional manner. The results illustrate the potential to direct training data acquisition strategies to target the most useful training samples to allow efficient and accurate image classification.

AB Shrub encroachment into and and semi-arid grasslands in the southwestern United States is of concern because increased shrub cover leads to declines in species diversity, water availability, grazing capacity, and soil organic matter. Although it is well known that shrubs have increased over time, we have little quantitative information related to the non-linear nature of this vegetation change over a particular period. On the Jornada Experimental Range (JER; USDA-ARS) and the adjacent Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC; New Mexico State University) in southern New Mexico, shrub increase has been measured with various ground survey techniques extending back to 1858. For this study, we used 11 aerial photos taken between 1937 and 1996 that covered a 150-ha study area and had sufficient resolution for shrub detection. A QuickBird satellite image provided coverage for 2003. We used image segmentation and object-based classification to monitor vegetation changes over time. Shrub cover increased from 0.9% in 1937 to 13.1% in 2003, while grass cover declined from 18.5% to 1.9%. Vegetation dynamics reflected changes in precipitation patterns, in particular, effects of the 1951-1956 drought. Accuracy assessment showed that shrub and grass cover was underestimated due to the constraint of the pixel size. About 87% of all shrubs >2 m(2) were detected. The use of object-based classification has advantages over pixel based classification for the extraction of shrubs from panchromatic aerial and high-resolution satellite imagery. Incorporating both spectral and spatial image information approximates the way humans interpret information visually from aerial photos, but has the benefit of an automated classification routine. Combining several scales of analysis in a hierarchical segmentation method is appropriate in an ecological sense and allows for determining shrub density in coarser level classes. Despite encountering difficulties in analyzing a greatly varying aerial photo data set, including variability in spectral and spatial resolutions, moisture conditions, time of year of observation, and appearance of grass cover, aerial photos provide an invaluable historic record for monitoring shrub encroachment into a desert grassland.

AB This paper presents an appraisal of satellite imagery types and texture measures for identifying and delineating settlements in four Districts of Kenya chosen to represent the variation in human ecology across the country. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of the four districts were obtained and supervised per-pixel classifications of image combinations tested for their efficacy at settlement delineation. Additional data layers including human population census data, land cover, and locations of medical facilities, villages, schools and market centres were used for training site identification and validation. For each district, the most accurate approach was determined through the best correspondence with known settlement and non-settlement pixels. The resulting settlement maps will be used in combination with census data to produce medium spatial resolution population maps for improved public health planning in Kenya.

ID SPECTROMETER; COASTAL; AVIRIS
AB The accuracy of environmental variable estimation from remote sensing is strongly related to the capacity of the measurement for separating the desired radiance signal from the overall noise in a pixel or image. Therefore, an algorithm for locating the most suitable spatial areas for environmental noise equivalent retrieval in a remote sensing image was developed and validated, first on a custom-built monochromatic image and then on a multi-temporal, hyperspectral data set. The algorithm, Automated Local Convergence Locator (ALCL), successfully identified areas in the custom-built image where known amounts of added noise equivalents could be accurately retrieved. Applying ALCL to the hyperspectral data (four Hyperion scenes of the same tropical coral reef scene) confirmed that noise equivalent characteristics vary limitedly on a scene-by-scene basis. The four Hyperion noise equivalent spectra collected in locations identified by ALCL as suitable showed consistency in both shape and magnitude despite being acquired 6 months apart, and differed from equivalent spectra from image locations identified as not suitable for noise estimation. The ALCL algorithm and associated methodology required limited user input while objectively determining the areas in an image most suitable for noise equivalent estimation. The ALCL methodology is applicable to studies where noise equivalent quantities in remote sensing imagery need to be objectively determined, such as feasibility studies, environmental monitoring, and sensitivity analysis.

AB This paper uses three recently generated southern African satellite burned area products for the month of September 2000 in a sensitivity study of regional biomass burning emissions for a number of trace gases and particulates. Differences in the extent and location of areas burned among products generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-VEGETATION), and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) data are significant and result in different emissions estimates for woodland and grassland land cover types. Due to the different emission profiles in woodlands and grasslands, favoring relatively more products of incomplete combustion in woodlands compared with products of complete combustion in grasslands in the late dry season, these changes are not proportional to the differences in the burned area amounts. The importance of accurate burned area information not just in terms of the total area but also in terms of its spatial distribution becomes apparent from our modeling results. This paper highlights the urgent need for satellite data producers to provide accuracy assessments associated with satellite-derived products. Preferably, these accuracy data will be spatially explicit, or defined in a way that can be applied in a spatially explicit modeling context, to enable emissions uncertainties to be defined with respect to different landscape units in support of greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

AB We investigate the spectral complexity and unique spectral characteristics of urban environments using a comprehensive regional field spectral library of more than 4500 individual spectra. Spectral properties of urban surface materials are presented and interpreted, and their separability is systematically analyzed using the Bhattacharyya distance (B-distance) as a quantitative measure of spectral discrimination. We find considerable spectral confusion between urban land cover types (i.e. specific roof and road types) but also show the potential of fine spectral-resolution remote sensing for detailed mapping of urban materials and their condition based on their spectral signal. An evaluation of the most suitable wavelengths for separation of urban land cover identified specific spectral features that provided the best separation. There is a strong indication that current multispectral systems, including IKONOS and LANDSAT ETM+, provide only marginal abilities to resolve these important features and are limited for urban land-cover mapping.

AB To conserve the Earth's most extraordinary expressions of temperate biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA, the mapping of late seral (old and mature) conifer forests plays a critical role. For this paper, we define old conifer forests as >150 years and mature conifer forest between 50 and 150 years. We offer a new Optimal Iterative Unsupervised Classification (OIUC) procedure for mapping late seral conifer forests over an eight-ecoregion area. The key steps of the OIUC classification were: (1) fully using the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 15 m panchromatic channel merged with other 30 in bands 3 and 5 to make a pan-sharpened false color composite for high resolution image interpretation; (2) splitting the ETM+ scene by ecologically distinct areas, or ecoregions, to create relatively homologous images for classification; (3) using a procedure similar to cluster busting where multiple iterative manipulation of the ISODATA clusters was employed; and (4) edge matching of sub-scenes to form ecoregions, then later merged together to form a map for the entire PNW. Supporting data and information included ancillary spatial GIS data layers, aerial photos, Digital Ortho Quad images (DOQs), field investigations, and previously reported forest age results. Classification accuracy was assessed using 2081 stratified random locations on 105 individual DOQs covering the entire region. Approximately 4.7 million ha (similar to19%) of the PNW was classified as old conifer forest (>150 years). Another 4.8 million ha (similar to19%) was classified as mature conifer forest (50-150 years). Over 9.48 million ha (similar to 38%) of the PNW was late seral conifer forest. The extent of late seral forests (old and mature conifer cover classes) varied greatly between the eight ecoregions. The Central and Southern Cascades and Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregions contained the highest amount of late seral forest in the region. The results showed high accuracy of the late seral forest classification for the PNW with an overall accuracy of 90.72% and KAPPA test K value 0.8534. Producer's (Omission) accuracy for old and mature forests were 91.36% and 80.40%, User's (Commission) accuracy were 89.42% and 80.59%, respectively. Accuracy levels differed for the different ecoregions examined. In general, mature conifer forests exhibited higher levels of confusion than did old conifer forests, due to the spectral influences of high-density young conifer stands and terrain shadow effects. The results fill an important data gap needed for ongoing conservation planning purposes throughout the region. We found that for relatively large geographic areas the OIUC method is an efficient and cost-effective alternative that yields high quality results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Frequent blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, along the west coast of Florida are of considerable concern to state resource managers due to numerous ecological and health impacts. With the availability of remotely sensed ocean color imagery from SeaWiFS, a regional algorithm that compensates for the scattering of sediments in coastal waters can be applied to accurately estimate chlorophyll concentrations in coastal areas of Florida. Chlorophyll anomalies of 1 mug l-(1) based on a 60-day running mean are currently used along the Panhandle and west Florida coast, to detect K. brevis blooms exceeding 100,000 cells l(-1). This is the first step in an early warning system to forecast K. brevis blooms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A retrospective analysis was performed on imagery acquired from 1999, 2000 and 2001 to determine the accuracy of this technique in detecting K. brevis blooms in this region. During the K. brevis bloom season from August through April, chlorophyll anomalies accurately identified K. brevis blooms along the Florida Panhandle, from Tampa Bay to Cape Romano and Key West >83% of the time. Frequent chlorophyll anomalies were falsely observed in the spring and early summer, prior to the beginning of the K. brevis bloom season. Areas rich in colored dissolved and particulate matter were prone to anomalies that falsely identify K. brevis blooms; however, blooms rarely originate in these areas.

DE IKONOS; QuickBird; mangrove
AB Mangrove stands of differing species composition are hard to distinguish in conventional, coarse resolution satellite images. The new generation of meter-level satellite imagery provides a unique opportunity to achieve this goal. In this study, an IKONOS Geo bundle image and a QuickBird Standard bundle image were acquired for a study area located at Punta Galeta on the Caribbean coast of Panama. The two images cover the same area and were acquired under equivalent conditions. Three comparison tests were designed and implemented, each with separate objectives. First, a comparison was conducted band by band by examining their spectral statistics and species by species by inspecting their textural roughness. The IKONOS image had a higher variance and entropy value in all the compared bands, whereas the QuickBird image displayed a finer textural roughness in the forest canopy. Second, maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was executed with two different band selections. When examining only multispectral bands, the IKONOS image had better spectral discrimination than QuickBird while the inclusion of panchromatic bands had no effect on the classification accuracy of either the IKONOS or QuickBird image. Third, first- and second-order texture features were extracted from the panchromatic images at different window sizes and with different grey level (GL) quantization levels and were compared through MLC classification. Results indicate that the consideration of image texture enhances classifications based on the IKONOS panchromatic band more than it does classifications based on comparable QuickBird imagery. An object-based classification was also utilized to compare underlying texture in both panchromatic and multispectral bands. On the whole, both IKONOS and QuickBird images produced promising results in classifying mangrove species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data collected over 133 georeferenced field sample plots and 56 forest stands located in young and mature forest. The plot size was 300-400 m(2) and the average stand size was 1.7 ha. Spruce and pine were the dominant tree species. Canopy height distributions were created from both first and last pulse data. The laser data were acquired from two different flying attitudes, i.e., 530-540 and 840-850 m above ground. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. Corresponding metrics derived from the two different flying altitudes were compared. Only I of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data differed significantly between flying altitudes. For the last pulse data, the mean values of the height percentiles were up to 50 cm higher than the corresponding values of the low-altitude data. The high-altitude data yielded significantly higher values for most of the canopy density measures. The standard deviation for the differences between high and low flying altitude for each of the metrics was estimated. The standard deviations for the height percentiles ranged from 0.07 to 0.30 cm in the forest stands, indicating a large degree of stability between repeated flight overpasses.
   The effect of variable flying altitude on mean tree height (h(L)), stand basal area (G), and stand volume (P) estimated from the laser-derived height and density measures using a two-stage inventory procedure was assessed by randomly combining laser data from the two flying altitudes for each individual sample plot and forest stand. The sample plots were used as training data to calibrate the models. The random assignment was repeated 10,000 times. The results of the 10,000 trials indicated that the precision of the estimated values of h(L), G, and V was robust against alterations in flying altitude. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CONIFER
AB A comparison of the performance of three feature extraction methods was made for mapping forest crown closure (CC) and leaf area index (LAI) with EO-I Hyperion data. The methods are band selection (SB), principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transform (WT). Hyperion data were acquired on October 9, 2001. A total of 38 field measurements of CC and LAI were collected on August 10-11, 2001, at Blodgett Forest Research Station, University of California at Berkeley, USA. The analysis method consists of (1) conducting atmospheric correction with High Accuracy Atmospheric Correction for Hyperspectral Data (HATCH) to retrieve surface reflectance, (2) extracting features with the three methods: SB, PCA and WT, (3) establishing multivariate regression prediction models, (4) predicting and mapping pixel-based CC and LAI values, and (5) validating the CC and LAI mapped results with photo-interpreted CC and LAI values. The experimental results indicate that the energy features extracted by the WT method are the most effective for mapping forest CC and LAI (mapped accuracy (MA) for CC = 84.90%, LAI MA = 75.39%), followed by the PCA method (CC MA = 77.42%, LAI NIA 52.36%). The SB method performed the worst (CC MA = 57.77%, LAI MA = 50.87%). (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SUBSIDENCE
AB The differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) technique has been applied to a test site near Vauvert (France) to detect and monitor ground deformation. This site corresponds to the location of an industrial exploitation of underground salt using the solution mining technique. An area of subsidence has been observed using in situ measurements. Despite conditions unfavorable for InSAR because of the vegetal cover, we show that radar remote sensing observations provide valuable information which substantially improves our knowledge of the phenomenon. An adaptive phase filtering process has been used to improve the coherence level. In particular, our study shows that the geometry of the subsidence bowl is different to that previously assumed using ground-based techniques only. The size of the subsidence bowl (8 km) is larger than expected. This information will be useful for further modeling of the deformation and to improve the coverage of the in situ measurement networks. It also shows that radar interferometry can be used for the long-term monitoring of such sites and to predict potential environmental issues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Acquisition of earth science remote sensing observations from commercial
   sources: lessons learned from the Space Imaging IKONOS example
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOLUTION; LANDSAT; IMAGERY
AB Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis.
   Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys.
   To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations.
   The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

AB Five individual projects characterized the spatial performance of the IKONOS commercial imaging sensor. The result was determination of the spatial image quality of IKONOS data products in terms of the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS), the system Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), the system stability over its first year of operation, the characteristics of the Space Imaging MTF Compensation (MTFC) procedure, and the application-specific capabilities of IKONOS imagery. Both panchromatic and multispectral imagery were evaluated. Major conclusions of this work are that the system was stable in imaging performance during the first year of operation, that its MTF meets the specification for the NASA Scientific Data Purchase program, that the initial MTFC processing appears to be transposed in the in-track and the cross-track directions, that the MTFC results in a noise amplification of 2 X to 4 X in addition to sharpening the imagery, and that IKONOS panchromatic imagery achieves an average NIIRS rating of 4.5.

AB The biological and structural complexity of tropical forests and savannas results in marked spatial variation in shadows inherent to remotely sensed measurements. While the biophysical and observational factors driving variations in apparent shadow are known, little quantitative information exists on the magnitude and variability of shadow in remotely sensed data acquired over tropical regions. Even less is known about shadow effects in multispectral observations from satellites (e.g., Landsat). The IKONOS satellite, with 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral capabilities, provides an opportunity to observe tropical canopies and their shadows at spatial scales approaching the size of individual crowns and vegetation clusters.
   We used 44 IKONOS images from the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) data archive to quantify the spatial variation of canopy shadow fraction across a broad range of forests in the Brazilian Amazon and savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado. Forests had substantial apparent shadow fractions as viewed from the satellite vantage point. The global mean (+/-S.D.) shadow fraction was 0.25 +/- 0.12, and within-scene (e.g., forest stand) variability was similar to interscene (e.g., regional) variation. The distribution of shadow fractions for forest stands was skewed, with 30% of pixels having fractional shadow values above 0.30. Shadow fractions in savannas increased from 0.0 +/- 0.0 1 to 0.12 +/- 0.04 to 0.16 +/- 0.05 for areas with woody vegetation at low (<25% cover), medium (25-75%), and high (>75%) density, respectively.
   Landsat-like observations using both red (0.63-0.70 mum) and near-infrared (NIR) (0.76-0.85 mum) wavelength regions were highly sensitive to sub-pixel shadow fractions in tropical forests, accounting for similar to30-50% of the variance in red and NIR responses. A 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 3% and 10% decrease in red and NIR channel response, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of tropical forests was weakly sensitive to changes in shadow fraction. For low-, medium-, and high-density savannas,a 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 5-7% decrease in red-channel response. Shadows accounted for similar to15-50% of the overall variance in red-wavelength responses in the savanna image archive. Weak to no relationship occurred between shadow fraction and either NIR reflectance or the NDVI of savannas. Quantitative information on shadowing is needed to validate or constrain radiative transfer, spectral mixture, and land-surface models used to estimate material and energy exchanges between the tropical biosphere and atmosphere.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the response (sigmadegrees) of airborne P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric data versus biomass values of primary forest and secondary succession. To ensure that different landscapes of "Terra firme" tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon were represented, a test-site was selected in the lower Tapajos river region (Para State). The microwave signals from the P-band polarimetric images were related to the aboveground biomass data by statistical regression models (logarithmic and polynomial functions). In the field survey, physiognomic and structural aspects of primary forest and regrowth were collected and afterwards the biomass was estimated using allometric equations based on dendrometric, parameters. As an example of the potential use of P-band polarimetric images, they were classified by a contextual classifier (ICM), whose thematic stratification of land use/land cover was associated with biomass class intervals for mapping purposes. The main objective of this P-band experiment is to improve this tool for regional mapping of Amazon landscape changes, due to the growing rate of land use occupation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

ID SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; ACCURACY
AB Choice of a classification algorithm is generally based upon a number of factors, among which are availability of software, ease of use, and performance, measured here by overall classification accuracy. The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase.
   In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data ha's increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance.
   In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors-multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS-are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3% and 6%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A scale-adjusted measure of "Urban sprawl" using nighttime satellite
   imagery

ID UNITED-STATES
AB "Urban Sprawl" is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of "Urban Sprawl" range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The 'scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the "Urban Sprawl" of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the "Sprawl Line" determined by this regression. This "Sprawl Line" allows for a more fair comparison of "Urban Sprawl" between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more "Urban Sprawl" by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of "Urban Sprawl" by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to "Urban Sprawl". "Urban Sprawl" is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are 'scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of "Urban Sprawl" shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of "Urban Sprawl" are changing.

AB By using digital elevation model (DEM) data derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data, an approximately 70-km stretch of the southern North Carolina coastline was studied. The coastline consists of five barrier islands located between Masonboro, Island at the southern extent and Topsail Island at the northern extent. The high-resolution DEM data allowed for a comprehensive visual/quantitative investigation into the spatial patterns of morphologic change that occurred to the barrier islands' oceanfront beaches between 1997 and 2000. This study also demonstrated the usefulness of using laser altimetry to examine barrier islands' response to level of tropical activity, and showed that the coastal process of overwash was recognized as an integral component of barrier island landward migration. Means of net volumetric change per unit area (m(3)/m(2)) for study areas of different beach management practices, characterized as developed, undeveloped, and nourished beaches on a yearly basis for the period between 1997 and 2000 were derived. t-Test of the means has been conducted, and results showed that beaches differed statistically if different management practices were applied to them, and the differences were minimized or disappeared if sequential hurricanes or storms affected the beaches.

TI Upwelling in the Taiwan Strait during the summer monsoon detected by
   satellite and shipboard measurements
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Taiwan Strait is located at the confluence of the East China Sea and the South China Sea in the west Pacific Ocean. Several upwelling zones in the Taiwan Strait are noted for their high fisheries production; these upwelling zones have been studied in the past decade, but we have no overall picture on the size and temporal changes of these upwelling zones due to only limited in situ observation over short periods of time. The present paper investigates upwelling in the Taiwan Strait with satellite remote sensing data of NOAA-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and SeaWiFS-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and shipboard measurements during summer 1998. Results reveal five upwelling zones: (1) coastal upwelling near Pingtan Island (PTU), (2) coastal upwelling between Meizhou and Xiaman (MXU), (3) big coastal upwelling near Dongshan Island (DSU), sometimes extending to offshore, (4) small occasional upwelling near the Penghu Island (PHU) and (5) an intensive upwelling in the Taiwan Bank (TBU). TBU was extensively studied over summer 1998. Results showed that the TBU looks like a banana in shape in the southern edge of the Taiwan Bank; it intensifies in its southeastern edge. The size of TBU was about 2500-3000 km(2), with a mean value of 2796 km(2). The temperature difference between the upwelling and non-upwelling areas was about 2.5-3.5 degreesC for early August with a mean value of 2.3 degreesC on July to October. Series of images indicated a short-term variation of TBU and showed that high Chl-a concentrations (up to 0.8-2 mg m(-3)) zones coincided with low SST (25-26 degreesC) zones in terms of location, time, and shape. These upwelling zones change with size and intensity center from time to time. Field measurements of water temperature, salinity, and Chl-a in 1998 are consistent with satellite measurements.

AB This paper presents the status of land-surface temperature (LST) standard products retrieved from Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Based on estimates of the channel-dependence error and noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) and the calibration accuracy of MODIS thermal-infrared data, the impact of instrument performance on the accuracy of LST is discussed. A double-screen scheme based on the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST algorithm and the aggregated 1-km LST retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm, and the difference between daytime and nighttime LSTs, is proposed to remove the LSTs contaminated with cloud effects. The accuracy of daily MODIS LST product at 1-km resolution, which was produced by the generalized split-window algorithm, was validated in 11 clear-sky cases with in situ measurement data collected in field campaigns in 2000 and 2001. The MODIS LST accuracy is better than 1 K in the range from 263 to 300 K over Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, Mono Lake, Bridgeport grassland, and a rice field in Chico, CA, and Walker Lake, Nevada (NV), in the atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.0 cm. It is difficult to validate the daytime LST product over land sites rather than lakes with ground-based measurements alone because of the high spatial variations in the in situ LST measurement data, which was verified by the daytime data of the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) over a grassland in Bridgeport, CA, on October 6, 2000. In six cases over a silt playa in Railroad Valley, NV, the 1-km MODIS LSTs are a few Kelvin degrees lower than the in situ measured LSTs because the surface emissivities inferred from land cover types in the split-window LST method are often overestimated in semi-arid and arid regions. After a correction with the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST method and the LST aggregated from 1-km LSTs retrieved by the split-window method, the MODIS LSTs agree with in situ measured LSTs within 1 K in the range 263-322 K for the six cases in Railroad Valley and one case of snowcover in Bridgeport, CA, leading a recommendation for use of the 5-km LST product retrieved by the day/night LST method in bare and sparse vegetated areas.

AB We simulate vicarious calibration (VC) of a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)-like ocean color sensor relative to its longer near infrared (NIR) spectral band (865 nm) to understand the influence of calibration error at 865 nm, which is difficult to assess in orbit. We show that as long as the calibration error at 865 nm less than similar to 10% in magnitude, the post-vicarious-calibration-corrected radiances are sufficiently accurate to retrieve useful water-leaving reflectances at moderate aerosol optical depths. This is completely independent of the initial calibration error in the shorter-wave bands, but assumes an atmospheric correction approach similar to that currently used with ScaWiFS. Retrievals are only slightly improved by reducing the magnitude of the error at 865 nm below similar to 5%. The simulations immediately suggest that pre-launch calibration is necessary only to the extent required to set the sensitivity of the instrument in the desired range. Rather than trying to achieve a highly accurate pre-launch calibration, e.g., uncertainty <5%, we assert that resources would be better expended on improved radiometric stability (and its monitoring) and complete characterization of the instrument, e.g., polarization sensitivity, out-of-band response, etc. However, these assertions assume the existence of a permanent vicarious calibration facility, e.g., the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY).

AB The reflectance proper-ties of tree leaves and canopies are influenced by their biochemical concentration. Modelling and empirical studies have been used to better understand this relationship for the remote sensing of foliar biochemical concentration. The success of these studies have been predicated on two implicit assumptions; first, that variability in biochemical concentration and reflectance within any one canopy is small. and second, that foliar samples from a point (usually the top) of the canopy could be used to represent the canopy as a whole. To evaluate these two assumptions the three-dimensional variation of various biochemical and reflectance characteristics of a Sitka spruce canopy were examined. Biochemical concentrations varied with canopy depth and needle age: chlorophyll and cellulose concentrations increased slightly with canopy depth, water and lignin concentrations were greatest in the lower canopy, and nitrogen concentrations were similar throughout the canopy. Reflectance in visible wavelengths decreased with canopy depth, as did reflectance at the 'red edge'. Biochemical concentration also varied with needle age: chlorophyll concentration increased with needle age; lignin and cellulose concentrations were similar for all ages of needles though variations in water and nitrogen concentration were more complex. Overall. however, these variations in biochemical concentrations were slight and it was concluded that foliage samples taken from near the top of the canopy and incorporating needles of a variety of ages would be representative of the canopy as a whole for the purposes of the remote sensing of foliar biochemical concentration. This paper also explores the strength of the relationships between biochemical concentration and reflectance and found them all to be weak, with the exception of those between chlorophyll concentration and reflectance.

AB We identified stages of regrowth in replanted clearcuts in D ouglas-fir/western hemlock forests in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, southern Washington, USA, using a simple four-endmember constrained linear spectral mixing model applied to a multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper image in order to separate and quantify spectral contributions from significant scene components. Spectral unmixing produces images of the fractional amount of the spectral endmembers, which were green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil and "shade," which includes topographic shading and shadows. Changes in endmember fractions correspond to changes in surface composition (as viewed from above). Unresolved shadows comprise the primary indicator of canopy structure and hence, regrowth stage. To isolate shadows, shading predicted from a digital elevation model was removed from the image before mixture analysis. As stands regrow, the surface cover shifts from initial high proportion of slash and exposed soil, and low proportions of green vegetation and shadows, to low fractions of stems and soil with high fractions of green vegetation and shadows. This shift in surface composition defines a regrowth trend in an endmember fraction data space. Projection of data onto this line allows estimation of structural stage and stand age, and provides a framework for remote mapping and monitoring of forest regrowth. Field analysis of 495 forest stands, representing stand structural stages ranging from newly replanted cuts to stands greater than 250 years in age, was used to assess the accuracy and precision of predicted structural stages and stand ages. The spectral unmixing approach can be used to evaluate and monitor forest regrowth quickly over large areas of the Pacific Northwest forests, and is extendible to mapping basic vegetation community type as well as structural stage.

AB Knowledge of the surface emissivity is important for determining the radiation balance at the land surface. For heavily vegetated surfaces, there is little problem since the emissivity is relatively uniform and close to one. For and lands with sparse vegetation, the problem is more difficult because the emissivity of the exposed soils and rocks is highly variable, With multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) observations, it is possible to estimate the spectral emissivity variation for these surfaces. We present data from the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, which has six channels in the 8- to 12-mum region. TIMS is a prototype of the TIR portion of the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer) instrument on NASA's Terra (EOS-AM1) platform launched in December 1999. The Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, developed for use with ASTER data, is used to extract the temperature and six emissivities from the six channels of TIMS data. The algorithm makes use of the empirical relation between the range of observed emissivities and their minimum value. This approach was applied to the TIMS data acquired over the USDA/ARS Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico. The Jornada site is typical of a desert grassland where the main vegetation components are grass (black grama) and shrubs (primarily mesquite) in the degraded grassland. The data presented here are from flights at a range of attitudes from 800 to 5000 in, yielding a pixel resolution from 3 to 12 in. The resulting spectral emissivities are in qualitative agreement with laboratory measurements of the emissivity for the quartz rich soils of the site. The derived surface temperatures agree with ground measurements within the standard deviations of both sets of observations. The results for the 10.8- and 11.7-mum channels show limited variation of the emissivity values over the mesquite and grass sites indicating that split window approaches may be possible for conditions like these.

AB We investigated the possibility of using multiple polarization (SIR-C) L-band data to map forest biomass in a mountainous area in Siberia. The use of a digital elevation model (DEM) and a model-based method for reducing terrain effects was evaluated. We found that the available DEM data were not suitable to correct the topographic effects on the SIR-C radar images. A model-based slope correction was applied to an L-band cross-polarized (hv) backscattering image and found to reduce the topographic effect. A map of aboveground biomass was produced from the corrected image. The results indicated that multipolarization L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be useful for estimation of total aboveground biomass of forest stands in mountainous areas.

ID INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION; MISR
AB An airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR) instrument has been developed to assist in validation of the Earth Observing System (EOS) MISR experiment. The airborne instrument is built to the same performance specifications as MISR. Both instruments view the earth at nine discrete view angles, provide data products that are radiance scaled to Systeme International (SI) units, registered among the view angles, and geolocated. Whereas on-orbit MISR will acquire a global data set every 9 days, the aircraft version is restricted to a target size of 9 x 11 km per aircraft run. AirMISR does, however, have the advantages of offering a means to testbed new mission procedures or camera designs, provide data sets that predate the MISR launch, and a means of returning to the laboratory to update the camera calibrations. This paper provides the AirMISR laboratory calibration results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral reflectance data representing a wide range of canopies were simulated using the combined PROSPECT+ SAIL model. The simulations were used to study the stability of recently proposed vegetation indices (VIs) derived from adjacent narrowband spectral reflectance data across the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The prediction power of these indices with respect to green leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll density (CCB! was compared, and their sensitivity to canopy architecture, illumination geometry, soil background reflectance, and atmospheric conditions were analyzed. The second soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAV12) proved to be the best overall choice as a greenness measure. However? it is also shown that the dynamics of the VIs are very different in terms of their sensitivity to the different external factors that affects the spectral reflectance signatures of the various modeled canopies. it is concluded that hyperspectral indices are not necessarily better at predicting LAI and CCD, but that selection of a VI should depend upon (1) which parameter that needs to be estimated (LAI or CCB), (2) the expected range of this parameter, and (3) a priori knowledge of the variation of external parameters affecting the spectral reflectance of the canopy.

AB Forest ecosystem dynamics modeling, remote sensing data analysis, ann a geographical information system (GIS) were used together to determine the possible growth and development of a northern forest in Maine, USA. Field measurements and airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were used to produce maps of forest cover type and above ground biomass. These forest attribute maps derived with remote sensing data, along with a conventional soils map, were used to identify the initial conditions for forest ecosystem model simulations. Using this information along with ecosystem model results enabled the development of predictive maps of forest development The results obtained were consistent with observed forest conditions and expected successional trajectories. The study demonstrated that ecosystem models might be used in a spatial context when parametrized and used with georeferenced data sets. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001. All Rights Reserved.

TI Atmospheric correction of SeaWiFS imagery over turbid coastal waters: A
   practical method
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ZONE COLOR SCANNER; OCEAN-COLOR
AB The current SeaWiFS algorithms frequently yield negative water-leaving radiance values in turbid Case II waters primarily because the water-column reflectance interferes with the atmospheric correction based on the 765-nm and 865-nm spectral bands. Here we present a simple, practical method to separate the water-column reflectance from the total reflectance at 765 nm and 865 nm. Assuming the type of aerosol does not vary much over relatively small spatial scales (similar to 50-100 km), we first define the aerosol type over less turbid waters. We then transfer it to the turbid area by using a "nearest neighbor" method. While the aerosol type is fixed, the concentration can vary. This way, both the aerosol reflectance and the water-column reflectance at 765 nm and 865 nm may be derived. The default NASA atmospheric correction scheme subsequently is used to obtain the aerosol scattering components at shorter wavelengths. This simple method was tested under various atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico, and it proved effective in reducing the errors of both the water-leaving radiance and the chlorophyll concentration estimates. In addition, in areas where the default NASA algorithms created a mask due to atmospheric correction failure, water-leaving radiance and chlorophyll concentrations were recovered. This method, in comparison with field data and other turbid water algorithms, was tested for the Gulf of Maine and turbid, posthurricane Gulf of Mexico waters. In the Gulf of Maine it provided more accurate retrievals with fewer failures of the atmospheric correction algorithms. In the Gulf of Mexico it provided far fewer pixels with algorithms failure than the other methods, did not overestimate chlorophyll as severely, and provided fewer negative water-leaving radiance values.

ID RADIOSITY METHOD; REFLECTANCE
AB To explore the potential of multiangle remote sensing for estimating biophysical or ecological parameters over a variety of landscapes, a modeling tool that is capable of handling three-dimensional (3-D) heterogeneous structures, deriving ecological parameters from the vegetation structure, and effectively working on different scene scales is very desirable. A 3-D scene modeling approach for these purposes is presented in this paper. This 3-D model fulfills its goal by taking advantage of radiosity theory and computer graphics techniques. It consists of two major modules: a modified extended L-systems (MELS) method to gene-rate a 3-D realistic scene and a radiosity-graphics combined method (RGM) to calculate the radiation regime based on the 3-D structures rendered with MELS. The 3-D simulation tool is then evaluated using field measurements of both plant structure and spectra collected during the NASA Earth Observing Satellite Prototype Validation Exercise Jornada field campaign near Las Cruces, NM. The modeled scene reflectance is compared with measurements from three platforms (ground tower, and satellite) at various scales (from the size of individual shrub component to satellite pixels of kilometers). The agreement with measured reflectances is excellent at all sampling scales tested. As an example of the model's application, we use the model output to examine the validity of a linear mixture scheme over the Jornada semidesert scene. The result shows that the larger the sampling size (at least larger than the size of the shrub component), the better the hypothesis is satisfied because of the unique structure of the Jornada scene: dense plant clumps (shrub component) sparsely scattered on a predominantly bare soil background. A range of possible applications of this 3-D scene model is highlighted. and further work needed for 3-D modeling is also discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

ID LASER ALTIMETER MEASUREMENTS; DESERTIFICATION; TOPOGRAPHY; ROUGHNESS
AB Since the 1880s rangeland vegetation in southern New Mexico has changed dramatically over widespread areas, typically with shrublands displacing native grasslands. Coincident with these changes in vegetation dominance are increases in soil erosion, stream channel cutting, and shrub coppice dune formation on sandy soil. Where marked transitions in, vegetation type from grassland to honey mesquite shrubland have occurred, the local topography has been transformed with previously flat mesa becoming rolling duneland. The size, distribution, and morphological characteristics of these dunes have an important impact on fluxes of energy and nutrients at the surface; they also render the land far less useful as grazing land for domestic livestock. These shrub coppice dunes and the mesquite shrubs that grow on them may be considered roughness elements. Quantifying their morphology is important for the calculation of aerodynamic roughness length and displacement height. This article tests the ability of active scanning laser remote sensing techniques to provide accurate estimates of the three-dimensional shapes and areal distributions of dune and interdune areas. It shows that scanning laser with a footprint diameter of 0.38 m and a sampling interval of 1.5 m to 2 m can be used to measure the morphological characteristics of shrub coppice dunes in the desert grasslands of southern New Mexico with acceptable accuracy and precision for a range of uses, including important geomorphological and hydrological applications. The use of scanning laser systems together with optical multi-spectral data is shown to be highly synergistic, providing information that is not easily obtainable via other surveying methods.

AB This paper presents methods classifying Arctic sea ice using both passive and active (2-channel) microwave imagery acquired by the Russian OKEAN 01 polar-orbiting satellite series. Methods and results are compared to sea ice classifications derived from nearly coincident Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image data of the Barents, Kara, and Laptev Seas. The Russian OKEAN 01 satellite data were collected over weekly intervals during October 1995 through December 1997 Methods are presented for calibrating, georeferencing ng a,zn classifying the raw active radar and passive microwave OKEAN 01 data, and for correcting the OKEAN 01 microwave radiometer calibration wedge based on concurrent 37 GHz horizontal polarization SSM/I brightness temperature data. Sea ice type and ice concentration algorithms utilized OKEAN's two-channel radar and passive microwave data in a linens mixture model based on the measured values of brightness temperature and radar together with a priori knowledge about the scattering parameters and natural emissivities of basic sea ice types. OKEAN 01 data and algorithms tended to classify lower concentrations Of young or first-year sea ice when concentrations were less than 60%, and to produce higher concentrations of multi-year sea ice when concentrations were greater than 40%, when compared to estimate produced from SSM/I data. Overall, total sea ice concentration maps derived independently from OKEAN 01, SSM/I, and AVHRR satellite imagery were all highly correlated, with uniform biases, and mean differences In total ice concentration of less than four. percent (sd<15%).

AB Sequential infrared satellite images between November 1995 and August 1996 have been used to derive sea surface advective velocities in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean using the Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique. The infrared images, geometrically corrected and accurately registered to a map grid, are masked for land and cloud cover The linear displacements of the sea surface thermal features are determined by locating the maximum cross-correlation in windowed portions of successive images The advective velocities are estimated for each pair of images based on regular grids. Incoherent each pair vectors are eliminated from these fields using a statistical method. After this, a visual inspection by the operator is completed to remove the remaining fictitious vectors. The region studied includes the southern Brazilian, Uruguayan and northern Argentinian shelves and the neighboring oceanic area known as the Brazil-Mal;inas Con fluence. Despite the rather complex circulation of this region, the advective surface currents calculated by the MCC method are consistent with the shapes of the sea surface temperature features. The general patterns of the surface circulation estimated by the MCC agree well with previous studies that used direct measurements, hydrographic data, and/or modeling efforts. In the shallower areas of the study region, the MCC technique is less applicable due to the predominance, in violation of the assumptions of the method, of nonadvective processes.

However, for ecological approaches to forest management to become widely accepted by forest managers, and for these tools to be widely used, methods must be developed to characterize and map or model ecosystem classes at landscape scales for large regions. In this study, the site-specific Northwestern Ontario Forest Ecosystem Classification (NWO FEC) was adapted to provide a landscape-scale (1:20 000) forest ecosystem classification for the Rinker Lake Study Area located in the boreal forest north of Thunder Bay, Ontario. High spatial resolution remote sensing data were collected using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and analyzed using geostatistical techniques to obtain an understanding of the nature of the spatial dependence of spectral reflectance for selected forest ecosystems at high spatial resolutions. Based on these analyses it was determined that an optimal size of support for characterizing forest ecosystems (i.e., optimal spatial resolution), as estimated by the mean ranges of a series of experimental variograms, differs based on (i) wavelength, (ii) forest ecosystem class, and (iii) mean maximum canopy diameter (MMCD). In addition, maximum semivariance as estimated from the sills of the experimental variograms increased with density of understory. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The effects of view zenith angle on the relationship between three spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, GEMI) and forest biophysical characteristics is examined. The work uses both simulate reflectance data, derived from a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, and multiangle Advanced Solid-state Array Spectrometer (ASAS) data. Factorial analysis of variance was applied to the simulate reflectance data set in order to quantify the view angle dependence of the relative sensitivity of an index to independent variations in forest cover, crown leaf-area-index (LAI), stand structure, and background reflectance. Overall, it was found that off-nadir viewing improved the performance of the indices for discriminating cover and LAI, when compared with nadir viewing. The potential of the indices for discriminating forest cover was low either because of strong sensitivity to the other stand characteristics, or because of nonlinear relationships with cover. At low covers, GEMI performed best in the forward-scatter direction, while GEMI had poor sensitivity in the nadir case. The potential for discriminating crown LAI was good; both SAVI and GEMI were found to be sensitive to crown LAI in the backscatter direction. In the plane perpendicular to the solar principal plane, off-nadir viewing gave improved sensitivity to cover (NDVI) and to LAI (GEMI). The results indicate that Sun-sensor geometry may be exploited to improve discrimination of forest characteristics, using spectral indices, and further work is needed to test these findings with satellite data. The results are discussed in the context of off-nadir viewing sensors such as the ATSR-2. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter measurements from December 1992 to April 1998 were processed to study the sea surface height (SSH) variation in the South China Sea (SCS). Patterns of variance of the SSH deviations from the four-year (1993-1996) mean show that there are three high-variation areas in the deep basin. The first is at the northern basin west of Luzon Island (16 degrees-18 degrees N, 117 degrees-119 degrees E), the second is at the center of the SCS (14 degrees-16 degrees N, 113.5 degrees-114.5 degrees E), and the third is off the central Vietnam coast (12 degrees-13 degrees N, 110 degrees-112 degrees E). Front empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, we found that the variations of these three active areas are dominated by annual cycles, but out of phase. The first two areas have the highest SSH in June and the lowest SSH in December. The third one off the Vietnam coast has the highest SSH in Ft February and the lowest SSH in August . The EOF analysis also reveals that the variation of SSH in the SCS has a response to El Nino events. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Orbital radar images of the central Namib Desert show clearly the extent of relict fluvial deposits associated with former courses of the Tsondab and Kuiseb rivers. South of the Kuiseb River, radar data show the existence of a drainage network developed in a calcrete-cemented late Tertiary fluvial deposits. The sand-filled paleovalleys are imaged as radar-dark tones in contrast to the radar-bright interfluves where the calcreted gravels occur. The drainage network developed as a result of local runoff from indurated gravels and channeled surface and sub-surface flow to the sites of the many interdune lacustrine deposits found in the area.

AB This article introduces an adaptive fuzzy neural network classifier for environmental change detection and classification applied to monitor landcover changes resulting from the Gulf War. In this study, landcover change is treated as a qualitative shift between landcover categories. The Change Detection Adaptive Fuzzy (CDAF) network learns fuzzy membership functions for each landcover class present at the first image date based on a sample of the image data. An image from a later date is then classified using this network to recognize change among familiar classes as well as change to unfamiliar landcover classes. The CDAF network predicts landcover change with 86% accuracy representing an improvement over both a standard multidate K-means technique which performed at 70% accuracy and a hybrid approach using a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC)/K-means which achieved 65% accuracy. In this study, we developed a hybrid classified based on conventional statistical methods (MLC/K-means classifier) for comparison purposes to help evaluate the performance of the CDAF network. The CDAF compared with existing change detection methodology has two features that lead to significant performance improvements: 1) new landcover types created by a change event automatically lead to the establishment of new landcover categories through an unsupervised learning strategy, and 2) for each pixel the distribution of fuzzy membership values across possible categories are compared to determine whether a significant change has occurred.

AB In this article, bidirectional effects on NOAA/AVHRR short wavelength data were analyzed for the regional monitoring of the temperate pine (Pinus pinaster) Landes forest. Because of differences in soil hydrologic characteristics, the forest is described by five ecotypes, which determine the understorey type and rile potential for pine growth. Bidirectional visible and near-infrared reflectances were analyzed from a daily NOAA-11 archive through years 1990-1994 using the bidirectional reflectance function model of Rahman. Rahman's model fits 72% of AVHRR visible reflectance, and 93% of AVHRR near-infrared reflectance. A typical example shows that 1) in the principal plane, he ratio of hot spot to forward scatter reflectance is 2.9 and 2.1 for visible and near-infrared, respectively, 2) bidirectional effects become negligible across the principal plane, and 3) NDVI shows a shape opposite to that of reflectances. After normalization, the seasonal dynamics of AVHRR reflectances were related to the phenological cycle of pine trees and under-storey vegetation. Visible reflectance drops earlier on coastal than on inland sites, due to an advance in the onset of pine growth. Near-infrared reflectance increases in summer for annual understory, and remains steady foe evergreen understorey. Differences in the seasonal dynamics of NDVI consequently characterize each Landes ecotype. From the modeled reflectances, we estimated the seasonal dynamics of visible and near-infrared albedo. We calculated the solar albedo by a combination of the last two. The visible albedo displays a seasonal dynamic similar ru that normalized visible reflectance. The solar albedo was found constant and around 12.7% on each eco-type In both cases, albedo strongly increases with solar zenith angle, consistent with ground measurements. These results clearly show the usefulness of coarse spatial resolution satellite data for the regional monitoring and modeling of temperate coniferous ecosystems. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

DT Article
ID SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; ATTRIBUTES
AB Variations and fluctuations of forest floor scattering properties can lead to variability in. radar backscatter from forest, thereby interfering with SAR backscatter-based estimation of forest biophysical characteristics. Understanding how forest backscatter varies over the range of probable surface conditions is important in the selection of appropriate radar bands and incidence angles for forest sensing applications and for quantifying uncertainty of the derived forest characteristics. Using a canopy backscatter model, we examined the sensitivity of modeled C- and L-band backscatter to five surface para meters in three loblolly pine stands representing different stages of development in Duke Forest (NC). The parameters were litter depth and moisture content, soil ms height and correlation length, and soil moisture content. Of the bands considered L-HN backscatter had the highest sensitivity to the surface parameters, followed by L-VV. In the incidence angle range of 20 degrees-40 degrees, L-HH varied by 5.3-9.6 dB as the surface parameters changed over their range. whereas L-W varied by 3.7-4.5 dB. At shallower incidence angles, the sensitivities were lower but probably not negligible. C-HH and C-VV were sensitive only at steep incidence (theta(0)=20 degrees-30 degrees) for the lowest biomass stand studied. C-HH and C-VV sensitivity fell off with increasing incidence angle and stand maturity. L-HV showed slight sensitivity for the low-biomass stand and at theta(0)=20 degrees-30 degrees but was otherwise insensitive. C-HV was insensitive to the surface for all stands and angles. At L-band, the most influential of the five parameters was soil mts height, whereas, at C-band all parameters were about equal in influence. The modeled sensitivities suggested that the surface-related uncertainty in forest backscatter at L-HH and L-VV and at C-HH and C-W at steep incidence angles, may be unacceptably large for many applications.

ID IMAGING SPECTROMETER DATA; AVIRIS DATA; AIRBORNE
AB Differential absorption techniques are suitable to retrieve the total column water vapor contents from imaging spectroscopy data. A technique called Atmospheric Precorrected Differential Absorption (APDA) is derived directly from simplified radiative transfer equations. It combines a partial atmospheric correction with a differential absorption technique. The atmospheric path radiance term is iteratively corrected during the retrieval of water vapor. This improves the results especially over low background albedos. The error of the method for various ground reflectance spectra is below 7% for most of the spectra. The channel combinations for two test cases are then defined, using a quantitative procedure, which is based on MOD-TRAN simulations and the image itself. An error analysis indicates that the influence of aerosols and channel calibration is minimal. The APDA technique is then applied to two AVIRIS images acquired in 1991 and 1995. The accuracy of the measured water vapor columns is within a range of +/-5% compared to ground truth radiosonde data. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

AB We have expanded on previous methods for co,-rEding thermal infrared field measurements for atmospheric downwelling radiance (Salisbury and D'Aria, 1992; Korb et al., 1996; Hook and Kahle, 1996) by comparing the sensitivity of various input parameters (sample temperature, diffuse gold plate emissivity, and temperature) on this correction. We find that the sample temperature has the greatest influence on the applied atmospheric correction (cf. Nerry et al., 1990a,b; Labed and Stoll, 1991), and we present a method in which the sample temperature is varied to minimize the residual atmospheric emission liner in the measured field emissivity spectra. Direct comparison of laboratory hemispherical reflectance measurements of wet-sieved and dry-sieved samples with these appropriately corrected field observations of undisturbed and disturbed soils, respectively, provides a means to predict the expected infrared spectral contrast differences between such soils (see preceding article).

ID SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; MODEL
AB The dual-flight program (April and October) for the SIR-C/X-SAR instrument aboard the shuttle Endeavor was designed expressly to acquire Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery at two significantly different seasons. At the Michigan Forests Test Site (MFTS), the April mission occurred at the beginning of the spring thaw and the October mission occurred just prior to and during the fall color change. Four scenes are evaluated at a constant incidence angle. Seven features are extracted from the SAR data,for potential use in classification using powers at different frequencies and polarizations. Given multiseason SIR-C/X-SAR imagery, there are three possible approaches in the classifier development: 1) Under the assumption that the scene does not change significantly as a function of time, develop one classification for a set of x scenes using n features, with x times the number of samples per feature; 2) ignore the multiseason availability and develop independent classifications for each scene using n features; 3) develop a true multitemporal classification where N of features equals n (number of features) times x (number of scenes). Each of these is applied using a combination knowledge-based and Bayesian classifier. Level II (roughly forest community) results show that the true multitemporal April/October classification works very well (97%), as do those for the individual scenes (>90%). A pooled classifier works poorly (April=90%, October=77%) and shows that temporal changes in phenology and moisture conditions contribute significant noise in terrain classification.

AB We use a simple radiative transfer model with vegetation, soil, and atmospheric components to illustrate how the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf are index (LAI), and fractional vegetation cover are dependent. In particular, we suggest that LAI and fractional vegetation cover may not be independent quantities, at least when the former is defined without regard to the presence of bare patches between plants, and that the customary variation of LAI with NDVI can be explained as resulting from a variation in fractional vegetation cover. The following points are made: i) Fractional vegetation cover and LAI are not entirely independent quantities, depending on how LAI is defined. Care must be taken in using LAI and fractional vegetation cover independently in a model because the former may partially take account of the latter; ii) A scaled NDVI taken between the limits of minimum (bare soil) and maximum fractional vegetation cover is insensitive to atmospheric correction for both clear and hazy conditions, at least for viewing angles less than about 20 degrees from nadir; iii) A simple relation between scaled NDVI and fractional vegetation cover, previously described in the literature, is further confirmed by the simulations; iv) The sensitive dependence of LAI on NDVI when the former is below a value of about 2-4 may be viewed as being due to the variation in the bare soil component.

AB During April 1994, the three-frequency radar system flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour, known as SIR-C/X-SAR mission (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Synthetic Aperture Radar). Over the Orgeval watershed (France), the ground condition stayed very wet throughout the 5-day SAR mission. The SAR imagery allows a data collection over a range of roughness conditions on bare soils. Three classes were identified: very smooth sowings with crusted top layer, cloddy surfaces, and different ploughed fields for future crops. To complement the Shuttle Radar data (three frequencies, L, C, X, incidence range from 44 degrees to 57 degrees), the helicopter-borne scatterometer ERASME (C- and X-bands, copolarized configurations) were used. Merging of the two databases was possible. As a result, incidence angles ranging from 25 degrees to 50 degrees are available in C- and X-bands for the copolarized cross sections. Then the major objective of the article is, over this available surface backscattering models to natural surfaces, the theoretical integral equation model (IEM) of Fung et al. (1992) and the empirical model of Oh et al. (1994). It shows adequacies and limits. The IEM model reproduces well radar scatter over smooth surfaces, but fails over rough surfaces, predicting a flatter response with incidence angle than the observed signals in C- and X-bands. Difference in backscatter response due to direction angles (perpendicular and parallel to the row direction) is difficult to reproduce over smooth surfaces by this model integrating anisotropic surface but may be due to the unadequacy of the surface representation. The Oh algorithm agrees well with the backscatter response over rough surfaces at medium incidence angle, but fails with a systematic underestimation over smooth conditions. As a conclusion, further developments are necessary on derivation of theoretical solutions over rough surfaces and on validation of semiempirical algorithms over data sets of various training sources (radar and natural conditions).

AB The Mississippi River is the largest river in North America and 6th largest worldwide in terms of discharge. In this study, 5 years (1989-1993) of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite data were used to investigate the variability of the Mississippi River sediment plume and the environmental forcing factors responsible for its variability. Plume variability was determined by extracting information on plume area and plume length from 112 cloudl-free satellite images. Correlation and multiple regression techniques were used to quantify these relationships for possible predictive applications. River discharge and wind forcing were identifed as the main factors affecting plume variability. Seasonal and interannual variabilities in plume area were similar in magnitude and corresponded closely with large changes in river discharge. However, day-to-day variability in plume size and morphology was more closely associated with changes in the wind field. The plume parameters bst predicted by the multiple regression models were plume area, east and west of the delta. Predictive models were improved by separating the data into summer and winter seasons. The best predictive model for the western area was obtained during summer when 64% of plume variability was explained by river discharge, wind speed, and the east-west wind component. The best model for the eastern plume area was obtained during summer when river discharge, the north-south and east-west wind components explained 70% of plume variability. The best model for the offshore extent of the sediment plume was obtained during summer when 53% of plume variability was explained by the east-west wind component, river discharge, and wind speed. All plume measurements were maximized by eastward winds from slightly different directions. During winter, the area and length of the western plume was additionally enhanced by offshore winds associated with winter storms. Anticyclonic curvature of the plume west of the delta was observed in 42% of the satellite images. This circulation pattern was observed primarily in association with westward winds.

AB Thirty-two boreal forest sites were identified and sampled in the central region of Alaska to evaluate the sensitivity of the C-band ERS-1 and the L-band JERS-1 radar platforms to site biophysical properties. A growing body of research has shown a significant radar backscatter response to biomass in a variety of forest systems. Alaskan boreal forests may be well suited to radar remote sensing. The sites selected represent black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands in a post-fire chronosequence. Black spruce biomass ranged from less than 1 kg/m(2) to 5.6 kg/m(2) and white spruce from 8.8 to 21.5 kg/m(2). Results indicate both ERS-1 and JERS-1 backscatter is responsive to biomass, density, and height, though other factors, principally surface moisture conditions, are often a stronger influence. Sensitivity to forest biomass and structure appears greatest when surface moisture conditions are minimized as a factor. Biomass correlations with the radar backscatter were strongest in the late winter Imagery when all sites had a snow cover, and late summer when the surface is most dry. ERS-1 data may be more sensitive to surface moisture conditions than the JERS-1 data due to the shorter wavelength of the C-band sensor, though this is inconclusive because of limited JERS-1 L-band data for comparison. Also, though the ERS-1 platform has proved to provide a very stable signal, results must be interpreted with caution as the dynamic range for our study sites is often less than 4 dB, and the uncertainty of the backscatter estimate is +/- 1.5 dB.

AB This article is the continuation of a study of the relationship between NDVI and rainfall in semiarid Botswana. That study notes significant differences in the NDVI-rainfall relationship for various soil types and a much higher ratio of NDVI to rainfall over Botswana than over comparable regions of the Sahel or East Africa. The current article examines the extent to which differences in the rate of sell moisture generation, as a function of soil type or locality, can account for these results. It concludes that they cannot. This study demonstrates that the five soil types do differ significantly with respect to both the rate of soil moisture generation per unit rainfall and the ratio of NDVI to soil moisture. The most productive soils are the clay-rich vertisols; the arenosols are the feast productive, although the rate of soil moisture generation is about the same for both soil types. The results also suggest that over Botswana NDVI may be significantly influenced by soil reflectivity and that the vegetation growth is promoted by exogenous soil water originating as runoff in the surrounding higher terrain.

ID FOREST BIOMASS; RADAR BACKSCATTER; ECOSYSTEM
AB For young (< 15 years old) loblolly pine stands at Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA), when the ground was wet, the observed ERS-1 SAR backscatter from short-grass fields of 0.05 kg/m2 biomass was greater-than-or-equal-to the backscatter from the stands, and there was no significant correlation between the backscatter and biomass (r2 = 0.19). Under dry soil conditions, the backscatter increased about 2-3 dB as the biomass increased from 0.05 kg/m2 to about 0.5-1.5 kg/m2, and the backscatter may be saturated near a 0.5-1.5 kg/m2 biomass level. The correlation coefficient between the backscatter and biomass was r2 = 0.46. When the Santa Barbara microwave canopy backscatter model was applied to simulate the ERS-1 SAR backscatter from the stands over dry ground, modeled and observed backscatter had similar trends with increasing biomass. For these stands, sensitivity analyses using the model showed that as the surface-soil moisture increased, the major contributor to the total backscatter was changed from canopy volume scattering to surface backscatter between 0.4 kg/m2 and about 1 kg/m2. Signal saturating at low standing biomass and high sensitivity to soil moisture conditions limit the value of a short-wave (C-band) and steep local incidence angle (23-degrees) microwave sensor such as the ERS-1 SAR for forest monitoring.

AB The potentials and limits Of estimating canopy parameters are investigated using only a reflectance spectrum in the optical domain, and the PROSPECT + SAIL model. Simulations are performed on AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) equivalent spectra, corrected for the atmospheric effects. It is established that this model is numerically invertible. The sensitivity analysis of reflectance spectral features to changes in the values of canopy parameters (leaf mesophyll structure N, chlorophyll a + b concentration C(ab), water depth C(w), leaf area index, LAI, and average leaf inclination angle theta(1)) suggests that the accuracy of the inversion procedure needs some constraints. The C(ab) and C(w) parameters, which describe the leaf physiological status, can be generally retrieved with a reasonable accuracy; it is somewhat difficult to estimate the canopy geometrical parameters (LAI and theta(1)) separately. Determining the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) with parameters derived from the inversion procedure is discussed.

AB Most vegetation indices (VI) combine information contained in two spectral bands: red and near-infrared. These indices are established in order to minimize the effect of external factors on spectral data and to derive canopy characteristics such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (P). The potentials and limits of different vegetation indices are discussed in this paper using the normalized difference (NDVI), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and transformed soil adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI). The discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis in which the effect of canopy geometry (LAI and leaf inclination) and soil background are analyzed. The calculation is performed on data derived from the SAIL reflectance model. General semiempirical models, describing the relations between VI and LAI or P, are elaborated and used to derive the relative equivalent noise (REN) for the determination of LAI and P. The performances of VIs are discussed on the basis of the REN concept.

AB Accurate snow depth (SD) information at global scales is highly important for validation and calibration of hydrological model, snowmelt runoff prediction, and global water supplies estimation. Passive microwave remote sensing has been proven to be an efficient method to detect SD at regional or global scales. However, numerous heterogeneous snow property parameters and forest parameters affect the microwave radiation characteristics, which is a great challenge for SD retrieval. In this study, a novel SD retrieval algorithm that comprehensively considered the multiple sensitive factors was developed at global scales by coupling the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) model and machine learning (ML) technique. The exponential correlation length (Pec), snow density (& rho;), and forest cover fraction (fforest) are three sensitive parameters for retrieving SD from passive microwave observations based on the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) algorithm. The key parameter Pec, which characterizes the snow microstructure information inside snowpacks, was optimized by minimizing the brightness temperature between satellite observations and microwave radiative transfer model simulations by integrating the MEMLS, forest impact, and atmospheric radiation attenuation. The random forest (RF) ML technique was used, and the optimal combination of independent variables was selected by correlation heatmap and importance ranking of variables. Six selected essential parameters, including Pec, vertical polarized brightness temperature differences between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, & rho; from ERA5, fforest, elevation, and longitude together with target SD output were used to train the RF model. Seventy percent of the entire data at meteorological stations were randomly chosen to train the RF model, and the remaining 30% were adopted as the validation data from 2013 to 2020 to ensure the mutual independence of training data and validation data. Compared with independent in situ measurements, the overall RMSE of SD is 13.6 cm, which was noticeably lower than those of the international SD remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets, including AMSR2 (36.2 cm), GlobSnow 3.0 (25.3 cm), ERA5 (38.2 cm), and ERA5-land (29.9 cm). The results demonstrated that the new proposed algorithm, by coupling the MEMLS model with the ML technique, could significantly enhance the overall performance in SD retrieval at global scales.

AB Accurate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is essential for various applications, including land surface modeling, flood forecasting, drought monitoring and prediction. In situ precipitation datasets, remote sensingbased estimations, and reanalysis products have heterogeneous uncertainty. Numerous models have been developed to merge precipitation estimations from different sources to improve the accuracy of QPE. However, many of these attempts are mainly focused on spatial or temporal correlations between various remote sensing sources and/or gauge data separately, and thus, the developed model cannot fully capture the inherent spatiotemporal dependencies that could potentially improve the precipitation estimations. In this study, we developed a general framework that can simultaneously merge and downscale multiple user-defined precipitation products by using rain gauge observations as target values. A novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network architecture, namely, the precipitation data fusion network (PDFN), that combines multiple layers of 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM was developed to fully exploit the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation. This architecture benefits from techniques such as batch normalization, data augmentation schemes, and dropout layers to avoid overfitting and address skewed class proportions due to the highly imbalanced nature of the precipitation datasets. The results showed that the fused daily product remarkably improved the mean square error (MSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) by 35% and 16%, respectively, compared to the best-performing product.

AB Satellite nighttime light (NTL) images offer a valuable depiction of the rapidly changing world by revealing the presence of artificial illumination. Thus, daily NTL images are increasingly applied to monitor human dynamics and environmental events. However, data gaps caused by cloud contamination and low-quality observations inevitably impair the effectiveness of such applications. Although a temporal gap-filling method is employed in recent Black Marble NTL products to produce seamless images, the filled images are unsuitable for quantitative analysis. Therefore, we developed an effective method, named as Cloud Removing bY Synergizing spatioTemporAL information (CRYSTAL), to generate cloud-free NTL images with satisfactorily accurate pixel brightness and spatial continuity. Simulation experiments show that CRYSTAL can produce more accurate results than the temporal gap-filling method in fifteen cities worldwide, with an average RMSE reduction of 33.69%. Images generated by CRYSTAL restore temporal variances in NTL and are thus suitable for multi-temporal quantitative analysis. CRYSTAL can reconstruct daily NTL time series by filling gaps using available partially clear images. Experiments in two cities demonstrated that the reconstructed time series had 31.85% more valid values than the original time series and effectively revealed urban dynamics during the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In summary, CRYSTAL is a novel and effective gap-filling method for the restoration of invalid NTL observations and has the potential to generate high-quality NTL data for use in future applications.

AB In scenarios where sample collection is limited, studying few-shot learning algorithms such as prototypical networks (P-Net) is a keynote topic for supervised multiple tree species classification. In a previous study, we improved the P-Net by combining the feature enhancement algorithm based on the convolutional block attention module and several popular data augmentation methods in the computer vision domain, the classification accuracy can be significantly increased, and the degree of model overfitting can be reduced. However, there is a clear boundary between the data augmentations and the feature enhancement algorithm, which is manifested in that data augmentations are only used to enrich the diversity of the learned samples, but cannot directly affect the construction of the objective function, thus limiting the ability of data augmentations. In fact, in the supervised contrastive learning research, data augmentation methods are often used to generate positive samples of an anchor image to construct the objective function, i.e. supervised contrastive loss. The core idea for solving such a boundary problem is to use contrastive learning to make the anchor image close to its positive samples and the negative samples away from each other. Inspired by this, we introduced supervised contrastive learning in the P-Net, i.e., SCL-P-Net, which takes the discriminative feature representations as the constraints of the prototype clustering algorithm. In SCL-P-Net, data augmentation methods can not only extend the sample distribution, but also be used to construct the supervised contrastive loss directly. The study involves four airborne hyperspectral image datasets related to tree species classification, including the GFF-A and GFF-B datasets collected from Gaofeng Forest Farm in Nanning City, Guangxi Province, South China, the Xiongan dataset from Matiwan Village in Xiongan New Area, Hebei Province, North China, and the Tea Farm dataset from Fanglu Tea Farm in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, East China. The highest overall accuracy (OA) for the four datasets is 99.23% for GFF-A, 98.39% for GFF-B, 99.30% for Xiongan, and 99.54% for Tea Farm. It is concluded that the proposed SCL-P-Net classification framework can achieve multiple tree species classification with high-precision. Without changing the basic classification framework of P-Net, the introduction of supervised contrastive learning makes the combination of the data augmentations and the feature enhancement algorithm and plays a positive role in improving the distinguishability between samples.

AB The Limited surface observations of turbulent heat fluxes result in incomplete knowledge about the surface energy balance that drives the climate system. The highly parameterized surface energy balance models suffer from significant uncertainties. Remote sensing information of incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes are important input variables for turbulent heat flux models, though analytical solutions of surface energy budget from these variables are yet to be derived. Here, we developed a novel, purely physics-based analytical method grounded on the thermodynamic principle of maximum power. The approach derives the total turbulent heat flux only from the four inputs of incoming and outgoing longwave and shortwave radiations at the land surface, which are available from remotely sensed satellite data. The proposed approach does not use any parameteri-zation, unlike the existing surface energy balance models, and hence does not suffer from uncertainty due to the same. We validated our methodology with 102 eddy covariance observation stations around the globe with different land use land covers from FLUXNET2015 and available urban datasets. Based on monthly averages of the total turbulent flux estimates for the eddy covariance sites, we observed root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 23.2 & PLUSMN; 10.9 Wm-2, a mean bias error (MBE) of 11.9 & PLUSMN; 13.1 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.86 & PLUSMN; 0.15. Using the satellite observations of radiation fluxes from CERES at a spatial resolution of 10, we obtained the global flux field of total turbulent flux (QJ) and land surface heat storage (& UDelta;Qs) fluxes. On validation of QJ with FLUXNET sites for six grids for different land use land cover, we found RMSE of 20.1 & PLUSMN; 7 Wm-2, MBE of 14.4 & PLUSMN; 9 Wm-2 and R2 value of 0.96 & PLUSMN; 0.02. Further, from the evaporative stress factor of GLEAM, which is based on microwave remotely sensed vegetation optical depth and root zone soil moisture, we have obtained spatially distributed global estimates of Sensible(H) and latent heat (LE). In addition, our analytical estimates address the distribution of residual energy associated with the surface energy balance closure problem driven by the land use land cover. The theoretical estimates of all surface energy balance components from remote sensing based observations will improve our understanding of surface warming for different land use land covers across the globe.

AB Ground-based snowfall observations over Antarctica are rare due to the harsh environment and high logistical, equipment maintenance, and operational costs. Satellite measurements are crucial to provide continent-wide precipitation estimates, and this highlights the importance of validating the satellite estimates with measurements collected by ground-based Antarctic stations. The NASA CloudSat satellite, launched in 2006, is equipped with a 94 GHz (W-band) Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) that provides measurements of reflectivity profiles of clouds and precipitation, whereas the incoming ESA/JAXA EarthCARE mission will add Doppler capability to a 94 GHz radar. This study explores how the synergy between two instruments available at most Antarctic stations, i.e., Micro Rain Radar (24 GHz, K-band) and laser disdrometer, can be used to validate satellite-borne W-band radar measurements, including Doppler estimates. A new validation methodology (K2W) was proposed to combine these instruments for simulating the 94 GHz reflectivity and Doppler measurements from Micro Rain Radar spectra. Assessment of the proposed K2W conversion methodology showed that the CloudSat Ze profiles can be simulated by the method with 0.2 dB mean difference at the lowest satellite radar range bin when time lag within +/- 12.5 min and the distance within 25 km around the CloudSat overpass were considered. With the K2W method, the 94 GHz Doppler velocity below 1 km altitude that would be observed by EarthCARE was obtained, and the standard deviation of the simulated Doppler velocity was found to be smaller than about 0.2 m s-1. The simulated 94 GHz Doppler radar profile information, which is less affected by attenuation compared to groundbased 94 GHz radar, will significantly improve the quantification of precipitation over Antarctica. This methodology will be applied to further assess the EarthCARE CPR Doppler velocity measurement accuracy as well as the Level 2 standard products for precipitation in Antarctica and at many other ground observation sites.

AB Based on a global matchup between satellite observations and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements, we developed a deep-learning-based model (DL-PPCE model) for globally estimating concentrations of 17 different phytoplankton pigments. The model adopted a fusion architecture of residual and pyramid networks to achieve robust estimation performance. The model inputs include three different data types: essential ocean color parameters, satellite-derived environmental parameters, and the slope of above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). We compared the model performances with various input parameters to determine the most effective inputs. The results showed that R-rs in the essential ocean color parameters and sea surface temperature (SST) in the environmental parameters were the most critical input parameters. The estimation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations was validated against HPLC data using the leave-one-out crossvalidation method. Except for three pigments, 19'-butanoyloxy-fucoxanthin, prasinoxanthin, and lutein, the estimated pigment concentrations and in-situ observations were strongly correlated for all other pigments (an average relative root-mean-square error of 0.59, R-2 >= 0.60, and regression slopes close to 1). In addition, a time series analysis was performed on the MODIS retrieved global pigment concentrations during 2003-2021 using the established DL-PPCE model to explore the relationship between the distribution of phytoplankton groups and El Nino in the western equatorial Pacific. Our findings revealed that the prokaryotes-dominated area extended eastward from180 degrees E to 150 degrees W during the 2015/2016 El Nino event. From 2003 to 2021, prokaryotic abundance was positively correlated with El Nino intensity ( R = 0.65, P << 0.01) but negatively correlated with the abundance of the entire phytoplankton community ( R = -0.53, P << 0.01). These results demonstrate that the DLPPCE model presents a novel approach for estimating the concentration of 17 pigments worldwide, and the estimated pigment concentrations are advantageous for analyzing the phytoplankton community dynamics on a large spatiotemporal scale.

AB Large-scale information on several vegetation properties ('plant traits') is critical to assess ecosystem functioning, functional diversity and their role in the Earth system. Hyperspectral remote sensing of plant canopies offers a key tool to map multiple plant traits. However, we are still lacking generalized methods to translate hyperspectral reflectance into a suite of relevant plant traits across biomes, land cover and sensor types. The absence of globally representative data sets and the gap between the available reflectance data with corresponding in-situ measurements have hampered such approaches. In recent years, the scientific community acquired multiple data sets encompassing canopy hyperspectral reflectance and plant traits from different plant types and sensors. To combine these heterogeneous data sets, we propose three multi-trait modeling approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to simultaneously infer a broad set of 20 structural and chemical traits (e.g. leaf mass per area, leaf area index, pigments, nitrogen). The performance of these multi-trait CNN models predicting these traits was compared against single-trait CNN as well as single-trait partial least squares regression (PLSR). We found that the multi-trait CNNs performances significantly increased from single-trait CNNs (nRMSE = 0.027-19.61%) and the state-of-the-art PLSR models (nRMSE = 1.94-40.07%) across a broad range of vegetation types (crops, forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland) and sensor types. Thus, providing a single model for multiple traits not only proved to be computationally more efficient, but also more accurate, since it enabled the model to incorporate traits' co-variation. Despite the data heterogeneity of the merged data set, our models performances' were comparable or exceeded those of previous studies. Overall, this study highlights the potential of weakly supervised approaches to overcome the scarcity of in-situ measurements and take a step forward in creating efficient predictive models of multiple biochemical and biophysical vegetation properties.

AB Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential variable in the study of the carbon cycle, and remote sensing provides the only viable means for mapping and monitoring biomass at large scales in time and space. Still, inconsistencies in biomass estimates are large which necessitates methods to achieve consistent mapping of biomass over time and space. In this study, we combine Lidar-derived biomass-estimates from GLAS measurements, time series analysis of 20 years of Landsat data, and machine learning algorithms to map biomass for a study area in the Amazon basin. The results show that we are able to map AGB consistently over space and time at annual intervals between 1999 and 2019, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 64 to 92 Mg AGB ha-1 (depending on the evaluation methodology used) for the best performing models, with AGB estimates ranging between 0 to 600 Mg AGB ha-1. Models run with the Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) resulted in the lowest errors. The presented methodological approach makes it possible to map biomass over time in large areas with wide biomass ranges, and without saturation below 400 Mg AGB ha-1.

AB Accurately estimating river discharge from satellite-derived river hydraulic variables (e.g., width, height, and slope) is the overarching goal of the remote sensing of discharge (RSQ) community. Numerous past studies have developed and intercompared different RSQ algorithms to demonstrate their feasibility, yet relatively few have focused on assessing how the RSQ algorithms are adapted to a wide range of rivers globally. As the community is now ready to expand to the global scale given advances in computing power, sensors, and the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, a much broader geographic view of RSQ ac-curacy should be prioritized toward "better generalizability" instead of "higher accuracy at limited places". To help close this gap, we extracted multi-temporal river widths from >350 K Landsat scenes at >3 K river reaches globally, and used them to estimate discharge using the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced variant (geoBAM). We use this framework to demonstrate how to apply an 'off the shelf'RSQ algorithm and test it globally without methodological intervention and answer: does it live up to its promise? Our daily discharge inversions (1984-2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27% of the gauges for BAM and 39% for geoBAM, and this percentage increased to 46-65% after feeding richer priors on flow seasonality and monthly variability, amounting to 1400-2000 successful inversions. Exploratory analyses showed that the inversion is the most sensitive to a channel geomorphological parameter b and climate aridity, where the optimal conditions are high -b, humid environments, as well as moderate width variability, leaf area index (LAI), and river width. Although specific to BAM/geoBAM, constraining the factors to their optimal ranges led to a median KGE of 0.33 for >600 gauges, which highlights the promising potential for global RSQ. We further discussed the optimal configuration of the RS/priors by analyzing results derived from different infor-mation content in priors. Overall, our critical assessment of BAM/geoBAM reveals a successful global imple-mentation of an existing algorithm that SWOT will improve. We suggest similar large-scale assessments for other RSQs be prioritized to identify the emerging challenges as we move into a new era with global river monitoring capability from space.

AB With the increasing problem of eutrophication, lacustrine ecosystem can undergo complex changes, often resulting in a shift from a clear macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid phytoplankton-dominated state. How-ever, it's not clear how lake transitions occur at regional and global scales. This is due to a lack of long-term monitoring and an effective algorithm that can distinguish floating/emergent aquatic vegetation (FEAV), sub-merged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and algal bloom (AB). This paper presents a novel three-step classification algorithm based on Landsat imagery, (ie., vegetation and bloom indices (VBI) algorithm): (1) to distinguish between aquatic vegetation (AV) and non-aquatic vegetation (non-AV) extents by an aquatic vegetation index (AVI) derived from tasseled cap transformation; (2) to identify FEAV and SAV within AV extent by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and (3) to extract AB from non-AV extent with floating algae index (FAI). The performance of the VBI algorithm was validated using 1307 field samples collected across 22 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLY) in China, with a pooled overall accuracy of 84.49%. Finally, the VBI algorithm was applied to Landsat data from 1985 to 2021 to quantify the temporal changes of FEAV, SAV and AB in large lakes (i.e., > 50 km2) along the MLY. Within these lakes, AV showed a significant decrease over the past 37 years, mainly due to the decrease of SAV; while AB occurred with higher frequency and in more lakes. The transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a phytoplankton-dominated aquatic systems is still ongoing in the MLY area. This study shows outstanding innovation in the construction of a new classification index (i.e., AVI), and the method of calculating the adaptive threshold, which makes VBI algorithm have great potential in mapping long-term changes and capturing transformation between lake communities on a global scale.

AB Remote sensing is widely used to detect forest disturbances (e.g., wildfires, harvest, or outbreaks of pathogens or insects) over spatiotemporal scales that are infeasible to capture with field surveys. To understand forest ecosystem dynamics and the ecological role of human and natural disturbances, researchers and managers would like to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of several types of disturbance. Recent advances include the development and testing of algorithms to automatically detect and attribute an array of disturbance types across large forest landscapes from remotely sensed imagery. We reviewed the scientific literature for automated disturbance type attribution in forest ecosystems to synthesize current knowledge and inform future work. We created metrics that characterize study contexts, methods, and outcomes to evaluate 34 studies that automated the attribution of several (two or more) forest disturbance types. Reported accuracies of similar to 80% for up to eight disturbance types at local (500 km(2)) to continental (6.5 x 106 km(2)) spatial extents reaffirm the potential for attributing forest disturbances from remote sensing data at scales relevant to ecological research and forest management. Generally, greater accuracies were reported for attributing disturbance types that affect most of a pixel and exhibit spectral signatures distinct from other disturbances or the prior (undisturbed) condition. Accuracy of attributing disturbance type tends to be notably lower for disturbances with smaller spatial extents or resulting in subtle spectral changes, such as small patches of tree mortality covering <40% of a pixel or areas of tree damage without evident mortality (e.g., defoliator outbreaks). Nearly all (33 of 34) studies used Landsat image time series to attribute disturbance types because the Landsat archive is freely accessible, spans several decades (allowing longer-term change analyses), is calibrated to facilitate change analyses, and has multiple spectral bands that aid algorithms. In our synthesis, most studies focused on specific disturbance types of interest within a particular study area, rather than a comprehensive list of types that would make the algorithm more generally applicable at broader spatial extents. We recommend several future research areas to improve the thematic resolution, accuracy, and potentially the transferability of attribution algorithms. Further development and testing of algorithms will continue to reveal the most effective approaches for attributing disturbance types that have been more difficult to detect with available spectral data to date, such as insect damage or low severity wildfire, and to evaluate model sensitivity as well as accuracy. The lessons that collectively emerge from automated forest disturbance attribution studies have the potential to guide future research and management applications.

AB Multi-source merging is an established tool for improving large-scale precipitation estimates. Existing merging frameworks typically use gauge-based precipitation error statistics and neglect the inter-dependence of various precipitation products. However, gauge-observation uncertainties at daily and sub-daily time scales can bias merging weights and yield sub-optimal precipitation estimates, particularly over data-sparse regions. Likewise, frameworks ignoring inter-product error cross-correlation will overfit precipitation observation noise. Here, a Statistical Uncertainty analysis-based Precipitation mERging framework (SUPER) is proposed for addressing these challenges. Specifically, a quadruple collocation analysis is employed to estimate precipitation error variances and covariances for commonly used precipitation products. These error estimates are subsequently used for merging all products via a least-squares minimization approach. In addition, false-alarm precipitation events are removed via a reference rain/no-rain time series estimated by a newly developed categorical variable merging method. As such, SUPER does not require any rain gauge observations to reduce daily random and rain/ no-rain classification errors. Additionally, by considering precipitation product inter-dependency, SUPER avoids overfitting measurement noise present in multi-source precipitation products. Results show that the overall RMSE of SUPER-based precipitation is 3.35 mm/day and the daily correlation with gauge observations is 0.71 [- ] - metrics that are generally superior to recent precipitation reanalyses and remote sensing products. In this way, we seek to propose a new framework for robustly generating global precipitation datasets that can improve land surface and hydrological modeling skill in data-sparse regions.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential parameter connecting the hydrological cycle, energy balance and carbon cycle. The angular effect (AE) of remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), one of the obstacles hindering the application of single-source energy balance models in continental and global ET estimates, is a long-standing issue that has rarely been witnessed in the last decade. In this study, we propose a general framework for correcting the angular effect that could be practically applied to reduce the uncertainties in the ET estimations with any single-source energy balance-based model, under the guidance of simulation of thermal radiation directionality through the integration of a directional module from the soil-canopy spectral radiances, photosynthesis, fluorescence, temperature, and energy balance (SCOPE) and an artificially added ET estimation module. The correction was conducted by adjusting the directional reflectance and then the reflectance-based fractional vegetation coverage to the view zenith angle of interest, together with estimating the soil and vegetation component temperatures. This framework was later tested on the widely applied surface energy balance system (SEBS) driven by the directional LST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collected on 94 clear-sky days between 2009 and 2010 at the Yucheng site. The simulation results indicated that (1) the AE obviously increased as the view zenith angle increased; (2) the AE was more apparent in the backward scattering direction than in the forward scattering direction; and (3) most of the AE first increased evidently and then decreased with the increase in the leaf area index. The correction results related to the SEBS-based ET estimations, compared to the in situ ET measurements, showed that the proposed framework greatly improved the estimations of ET, with the root mean square error decreasing by 27.6 W/m(2)(similar to 8%, relative to the average 339 W/m(2)) from 86.8 W/m(2) (similar to 25%) to 59.2 W/m(2) (similar to 17%) and the bias decreasing from 49.7 W/m(2) (similar to 15%) to similar to 6.5 W/m(2) (similar to 2%). In conclusion, the proposed framework efficiently corrected the angular effect of remotely sensed LST on ET estimation. We expect more attention to be paid to the angular effect and hope our work could provide insight for solving this pendent issue.

AB Estimating proportion of area from a stratified random sample and reference class labels obtained by ground visit or interpretation of satellite imagery is a common strategy in land cover monitoring. Confidence intervals for the proportion of area are typically estimated using the Wald interval, a procedure that is known to yield less than nominal coverage (i.e., undercoverage) when the proportion of area is small (i.e., comprising 10% or less of the region of interest). The practical implication of undercoverage is that confidence intervals will include the true proportion of area for a smaller percent of samples than is implied by the stated confidence level (e.g., 95%). For simple random sampling, alternate confidence interval methods such as Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Clopper-Pearson have been developed to remedy the undercoverage of the Wald interval, but these methods are not directly applicable to stratified sampling. In this study, we evaluated the Wald interval and two alternative general confidence interval approaches for the case of two strata. One alternative approach, previously proposed in the literature, is based on estimating effective sample size (neff method), whereas the other approach is a new method based on summing stratum-specific confidence bounds (sumstrat method) computed using one of the alternate confidence interval approaches (Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Clopper-Pearson) for each stratum. The coverage and length of confidence intervals estimated from the different methods were compared using Monte Carlo simulation applied to a set of populations representing diverse conditions of prevalence of the target class and user's and producer's accuracies of the map used to construct the strata. The commonly applied Wald interval achieved coverage well below the nominal 95% confidence for many of the populations evaluated, and the neff method improved upon this undercoverage in only a few populations. The Wilson sumstrat intervals provided the best coverage as this method achieved close to the nominal 95% coverage or greater for most populations. Length of the Wilson sumstrat intervals was comparable to length of other methods. Further study is needed to determine which confidence interval methods are effective when the number of strata exceeds two.

AB The detectability of ocean surface currents in global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) observations is analyzed. We use a large dataset of spaceborne GNSS-R measurements from NASA cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. The data is collocated with ocean wind and near-surface current measurements. Our analysis reveals clear responses of the GNSS-R sigma 0 to the presence of currents. The response depends on the wind conditions and is more prominent for wind speeds below 6 m/s. A current velocity of 0.5 m/s under an opposing wind can, on average, suppress the GNSS-R sigma 0 by 0.8 decibels for low incidence angles. The interaction of the same current with a codirectional wind can enhance sigma 0 by almost the same amount. This enhancement is most visible at high incidence angles. We develop a model that improves the prediction of the GNSS-R sigma 0 in the presence of surface currents. The detected signatures of wind-current interactions highlight the potential of GNSS-R sensors onboard small satellites for observing ocean surface currents.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been widely used to track vegetation photosynthesis at different scales ranging from in-situ measurements to satellite products. Airborne platforms sample SIF data at a spatial scale intermediate between in-situ and satellite, matching that of ground measurement (e.g. flux tower footprints and other field sampling), enabling us to explore causes of SIF variation and validate satellite-based SIF products. However, harmonizing SIF across sensors and platforms (correcting for systematic errors to yield a consistent, comparable SIF product) is challenging because SIF can be retrieved in different absorption windows, with different instruments and methods complicating the comparison between different observational levels (i.e., ground, airborne, satellites) and between sites equipped with different instruments with varying optical prop-erties (spectral resolution and sampling intervals, spatial resolution). Additionally, the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric properties can influence the retrieval of the weak SIF signal. Because of these com-plications, direct comparisons of airborne and ground SIF across scales are rarely attempted. In this study, we combined airborne SIF data with simultaneous 'ground truth' data collected by stationary and mobile platforms in a soybean field in Nebraska, USA. In this effort, we tested several SIF extraction methods, including Fraunhofer Line Discrimination (FLD), improved Fraunhofer Line Discrimination (iFLD), Spectral Fitting Method (SFM), SpecFit, and a Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) method. The SpecFit method was sensitive to the 715-740 nm water bands and removing the water bands in the fitting process yielded better agreement between the airborne and ground SIF spectra. Accurate estimation of the ground level downwelling irradiance obtained by ground measurements over a calibration target improved agreement between airborne and ground SIF retrievals at the O2A band, and allowed us to derive a SIF dataset with improved agreement across platforms and sampling scales. This experimental approach provided a method for generating comparable SIF signals across instruments, methods and platforms, which is critical to understanding the SIF-GPP relationship at different scales and to cross-validate the diversity of platforms used for satellite products calibration and validation.

AB The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite is a medium-resolution and multi-spectral push-broom imager acquiring radiance in 21 spectral bands covering from the visible to the far near-infrared. These measurements are primary dedicated to land & ocean color applications, but actually include also reliable information for atmospheric aerosol and surface brightness characterization. In the framework of the EUMETSAT funded study to support the Copernicus Program, we describe the retrieval of aerosol and surface properties from OLCI single-viewing multi-spectral Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiances based on the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. The high potential of the OLCI/GRASP configuration stems from the attempt to retrieve both aerosol load and surface reflectance simultaneously using a globally consistent high-level approach. For example, both over land and ocean surfaces OLCI/GRASP uses 9 spectral channels (albeit with different weights), strictly the same prescribed aerosol models and globally the same a priori constraints (though with some differences for observations over land and ocean). Due to the lack of angular multi-viewing information, the directional properties of underlying surface are strongly constrained in the retrieval: over ocean the Fresnel reflection together with foam/whitecap albedo are exclusively computed using a priori wind speed; over land, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is slightly adjusted from a priori values of climatological Ross-Li volumetric and geometric terms. Meanwhile, the isotropic reflectance is retrieved globally under mild spectral smoothness constraints. It should be noticed that OLCI/GRASP configuration employs innovative multi-pixel concept (Dubovik et al., 2011) that enhance retrieval by simultaneously inverting large group of pixels. The concept allows for benefiting from knowledge about natural variability of the retrieved parameters. The obtained OLCI/GRASP products were validated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and surface products. The overall performance is quite comparable to the community -referenced MODIS. Over ocean the OLCI/GRASP results are encouraging with 67% of the AOD (550 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement using AERONET coastal sites and 74% using MAN deep ocean measurements, and an AOD (550 nm) bias 0.01 with AERONET and nearly zero bias with MAN. Over land, 48% of OLCI/GRASP AOD (550 nm) satisfy the GCOS requirement and a bias within +/- 0.01 for total and AOD < 0.2. Key challenges are identified and discussed: adequate screening of cloud contaminations, retrieval of aerosol over bright surfaces and in the regions containing complex mixtures of aerosol.

AB Mangrove deforestation has rapidly declined by an order of magnitude compared to that reported for the 20th century, but the remaining mangrove ecosystems are still undergoing biodiversity loss and degradation. Laborintensive ground surveys that are usually used for terrestrial plant biodiversity assessment are difficult to conduct in the mangrove forests. Assessing plant biodiversity from space does offer a novel perspective, but existing solutions are mainly focused on estimating alpha- or beta-diversities (i.e., diversity within communities or diversity among communities) alone. This paper applied a novel holistic biodiversity approach that could partition gamma-diversity into alpha- and beta-diversities for plant diversity mapping with operational satellites (WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and Zhuhai-1) and field plots in the Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. We compared the resulting outputs of the alpha-diversity from the holistic method (SD alpha) to those by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Rao's Q index, and the contributions of individual spectral features to alpha- and beta-diversity were also measured. Results indicated that alpha- and beta-diversities accounted for -30% and - 70% of the total diversity in the Reserve, respectively. alpha-diversity derived from the WorldView-2 images showed statistically higher correlations with the observed Shannon's index (R2: 0.20-0.42) compared to that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (R2: 0.03-0.15). beta-diversity derived from WorldView-2 images had the highest accuracy (90.00%), followed by that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (83.33% and 73.33%, respectively). Red-edge and near-infrared spectral features were the most informative features for diversity mapping while shortwave infrared (SWIR) features were also valuable for beta-diversity mapping. Concurrent mapping of alpha- and beta-diversities of mangrove forests represents the first step toward achieving rapid biodiversity monitoring schemes of mangrove forests over a national or global scale.

AB Measuring terrain deformation over several spatial and temporal scales is relevant for many applications in Earth Sciences (i.e. active faults, volcanoes, landslides or glaciers understanding). The growing volume of freely available data represents nowadays a challenge in terms of storage capacity and computing resources which, together with the complexity of the processing (code parameterization, combination of the image sequences, coregistration of the images) may prevent the exploitation of long time series. We propose here a new version of the Multiple-Pairwise Image Correlation toolbox for processing OPTical images (MPIC-OPT). The toolbox proposes an end-to-end solution to compute the horizontal sub-pixel ground deformation time series from large Sentinel-2 datasets. In addition to time series inversion, several corrections and filtering options are integrated to reduce the noise and improve the accuracy and precision of the measurements. In particular, an automatic jitter correction based on wavelet filtering is proposed. Moreover, the MPIC-OPT service is deployed on the Tier 1.5 HighPerformance Computing cluster (e.g. Datacentre/EOST-A2S) of the University of Strasbourg and is accessible on-line through the ESA Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) and the ForM@Ter Solid Earth computing infrastructure with a user-friendly environment to query the satellite data catalogues, parameterize the processing and visualize the outputs. We test the performances of MPIC-OPT on several use cases: the measurement of the co-seismic ground deformation of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence (USA), of the rapid motion of the Slumgullion landslide (USA) and of the glaciers of the Mont-Blanc massif (France/Italy). We show that the results of MPIC-OPT are in agreement with in-situ data. The jitter correction significantly improves the precision (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=0.5m) and the accuracy (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=1.3m) of the measurement of the co-seismic displacement of the Rigdecrest seismic deformation. We show that the precision and accuracy of the terrain deformation estimation depend mainly on the correlation threshold and the temporal matching range parameters and we quantify and discuss their impacts. This work opens new perspectives to monitor automatically surface displacements/velocities of natural hazards over large scales and large periods of time.

AB The estimation and mapping of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is an active area of applied research in the fields of agriculture and water resources. Thermal remote sensing-based methods, using coarse resolution satellites, have been successful at estimating ETa over the conterminous United States (CONUS) and other regions of the world. In this study, we present CONUS-wide ETa from Landsat thermal imagery-using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Over 150,000 Landsat satellite images were used to produce 10 years of annual ETa (2010-2019) at unprecedented scale. The accuracy assessment of the SSEBop results included point-based evaluation using monthly Eddy Covariance (EC) data from 25 AmeriFlux stations as well as basin-scale comparison with annual Water Balance ETa (WBET) for more than 1000 sub-basins. Evaluations using EC data showed generally mixed performance with weaker (R-2 < 0.6) correlation on sparsely vegetated surfaces such as grasslands or woody savanna and stronger correlation (R-2 > 0.7) over well-vegetated surfaces such as croplands and forests, but location-specific conditions rather than cover type were attributed to the variability in accuracy. Croplands performed best with R-2 of 0.82, root mean square error of 29 mm/month, and average bias of 12%. The WBET evaluation indicated that the SSEBop model is strong in explaining the spatial variability (up to R-2 > 0.90) of ETa across large basins, but it also identified broad hydro-climatic regions where the SSEBop ETa showed directional biases, requiring region-specific model parameter improvement and/or bias correction with an overall 7% bias nationwide. Annual ETa anomalies over the 10-year period captured widely reported drought-affected regions, for the most part, in different parts of the CONUS, indicating their potential applications for mapping regional-and field-scale drought and fire effects. Due to the coverage of the Landsat Path/Row system, the availability of cloud-free image pixels ranged from less than 12 (mountainous cloud-prone regions and U.S. Northeast) to more than 60 (U.S. Southwest) per year. However, this study reinforces a promising application of Landsat satellite data with cloud computing for quick and efficient mapping of ETa for agricultural and water resources assessments at the field scale.

AB Spatiotemporal data fusion, as a feasible and low-cost solution for producing time-series satellite images with both high spatial and temporal resolution, has undergone rapid development over the past two decades with more than one hundred spatiotemporal fusion methods developed. Accuracy assessment of fused images is crucial for users to select appropriate methods for real-world applications. However, commonly used assessment metrics do not comprehensively cover multiple aspects of spatiotemporal fused image quality, contain redundant information, and are not comparable across different study areas. To address these problems, this study proposed a novel framework to assess all-round performances of spatiotemporal fusion methods. Four accuracy metrics, including RMSE, AD, Edge, and local binary patterns (LBP), were selected as the optimal set of assessment metrics according to the assessment criteria. These metrics not only quantify the spectral and spatial information in the fused images but also greatly alleviate information redundancy and feature computational simplicity. Furthermore, inspired by Taylor diagrams, we designed an all-round performance assessment (APA) diagram to provide a visual tool for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of spatiotemporal fusion methods, supporting cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods by considering the effects of input data and land surface characteristics. The case study in three typical sites demonstrated that the proposed framework can better differentiate the performances of six spatiotemporal fusion methods. This new framework can promote the cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods and guide users to select suitable methods for real-world applications, as well as facilitate the establishment of a standard accuracy assessment procedure for spatiotemporal fusion methods.

AB Arctic permafrost surface freeze-thaw (FT) changes related to warming could regulate the magnitude of global warming by altering the terrestrial carbon cycle and energy balances. This study investigated the sensitivity of surface FT changes to warming over Arctic permafrost regions by analyzing long-term changes in surface FT phenology from satellite remote sensing and meteorological variables from the climate data for the period from 1979 to 2017. Averaging over the entire Arctic permafrost regions, spring thawed date apparently advanced by -2.05 days decade-1, whereas autumn frozen date showed weak delaying trend of 0.83 days decade-1, implying the lengthening of the thawed season. Dividing the regions by permafrost types, advancing trends of thawed dates in continuous and high ice content permafrost areas (-2.57 and -2.70 days decade-1) were stronger than those over the discontinuous and low ice content permafrost areas (-1.61 and -1.73 days decade-1). The difference in changes in spring thawed dates between the regions is attributed to the difference in absolute magnitude of warming trends (e.g., 0.72 degrees C decade- 1 for continuous vs. 0.44 degrees C decade- 1 for discontinuous). However, the temperature sensitivity over discontinuous (low ice content) permafrost areas was 23% (10%) stronger than that over continuous (high ice content) permafrost areas for thawed date. In case of autumn, delaying trends of frozen dates were smaller over continuous and high ice content areas (0.69 and 0.74 days decade-1) than those over discontinuous and low ice content areas (1.01 and 0.88 days decade-1). This is mainly explained by the difference in temperature sensitivity (e.g., 1.57 days degrees C- 1 for continuous vs. 2.18 days degrees C- 1 for discontinuous) to warming between the regions rather than the difference in the absolute warming trends between the regions (e.g., 0.91 degrees C decade- 1 for continuous vs. 0.51 degrees C decade- 1 for discontinuous). The stronger temperature sensitivity of discontinuous and low ice content permafrost could be related to the lower demand of latent heat for the phase change of ground ice (or water). Overall, our results suggest that discontinuous and low ice content permafrost are more vulnerable to atmospheric warming. In addition to the magnitude of warming, the sensitivity to warming also needs to be considered when predicting permafrost FT changes.

AB Methane is one of the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases with a significant impact on the Earth's radiation budget and tropospheric background ozone. Despite a well-constrained global budget, quantification of local and regional methane emissions has proven challenging. Recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments such as from the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) provide 2-D observations of CH4 plume column enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1-5 m over large geographic areas. Quantifying an emission rate from observed plumes is a critical step for understanding local emission distributions and prioritizing mitigation efforts. However, there exists no method that can predict emission rates from detected plumes in real-time without ancillary data reliably. In order to predict methane point-source emissions directly from high resolution 2-D plume images without relying on other local measurements such as background wind speeds, we trained a convolutional neural network model called MethaNet. The training data was derived from large eddy simulations of methane plumes and realistic measurement noise over agricultural, desert and urban environments. Our model has a mean absolute percentage error for predicting unseen plumes under 17%, a significant improvement from previous methods that require wind information. Using MethaNet, a validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within the precision error estimate. Our results support the basis for the applicability of using deep learning techniques to quantify CH4 point sources in an automated manner over large geographical areas, not only for present and future airborne field campaigns but also for upcoming space-based observations in this decade.

AB Snowpack on sea ice can adjust changes in sea ice conditions and plays a vital role in the Earth's climate system. Snow depth, an important parameter of snowpack, is a necessary variable for retrieving sea ice thicknesses based on satellite altimeter data. Here, regression analysis (RA) is used to determine the best gradient ratio (GR) combination of brightness temperatures for estimating snow depths, and the RA model is proposed. Based on the RA model, one additional deep learning model is built, namely, the 5-variable long short-term memory (5VLSTM) model (or the RA-5VLSTM model). Meanwhile, an additional neural network model is built for comparisons, namely, the 5-variable genetic wavelet neural network (5VGWNN) model (or the RA-5VGWNN model). Using Operation IceBridge (OIB) and ice mass balance buoy (IMB) data, these three models, plus three existing algorithms, are compared to assess their performances in estimating snow depth. The results show that the RA-5VLSTM model performed pretty well among the six algorithms, with an RMSE of 7.16 cm. The RA5VLSTM model, a robust approach, was less influenced by the uncertainty in the input data. From January to April during 2012-2020, the average monthly snow depth in the Beaufort Sea and the Chukchi Sea mainly showed a downward trend, while an upward trend was observed in the Central Arctic in most months. Variations in snow depth in the Central Arctic were mainly affected by the autumn 2-m air temperature (T2m) and the sea surface temperature (SST). Variations in snow depth in the Chukchi Sea were mainly affected by the autumn sea ice velocity.

AB Many countries and regions build underground gas storages (UGSs) to regulate the energy demand and supply in different seasons. The Hutubi underground gas storage (HUGS) in Xinjiang province is the largest UGS in China, so it is of great significance to monitor its operation. At present, the researches on the HUGS mainly rely on traditional geodetic monitoring (e.g., in-situ leveling and global navigation satellite system (GNSS)), which has a short time span and low spatial resolution. The whole-domain and long-temporal sequence surface displacements induced by gas recovery (before 2013) and injection/extraction (since 09/06/2013) were seldom reported. In this study, the large-scale background deformation was firstly obtained using the ALOS PALSAR data (2006-2011), and the displacement time series of the HUGS over 2003-2020 was observed by all available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from multiple SAR sensors (Envisat ASAR, TerraSAR/TanDEM-X, Sentinel1). The results show that this area had a long history of slow subsidence (2.2 mm/yr) before 2013. Since 06/ 2013, the surface of the HUGS showed periodic uplift and subsidence with a net uplift. The average uplift rate in the center was about 7 mm/yr during 08/2013-07/2015 and 13 mm/yr during 03/2015-05/2020. The deformation has a temporal correspondence with the gas extraction/injection process. The accuracy is assessed by the cross-validation of the results of different datasets and the GNSS measurements. The compound dislocation model (CDM) is used to model the dynamic displacements caused by gas injection/extraction in HUGS. This model can reflect the UGS volume changes and the estimated central depth (3499.7 m) and height (108.6 m) of the storage are consistent with the actual central depth (-3585 m) and height (-110 m). We also restore the dynamic change of the pore pressure and the injected gas volume during the 5-7 cycles, on the basis of the linear relations between gas injection volume, pore pressure, and CDM parameters. In 12/2017, the estimated gas inventory of the HUGS is 91.29 x 108 m3, about 4.7% smaller than the real gas inventory of 95.77 x 108 m3. At the end of the seventh injection/extraction cycle, the predicted maximum gas injection volume and pore pressure reached 11.2 billion m3 and 36 MPa, respectively.

AB Disentangling the individual contributions from vegetation and soil in measured canopy reflectance is a grand challenge to the remote sensing and ecophysiology communities. Since Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is uniquely emitted from vegetation, it can be used to evaluate how well reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) can separate the vegetation and soil components. Due to the residual soil background contributions, Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and Difference Vegetation index (DVI) present offsets when compared to SIF (i.e., the value of NIRv or DVI is non-zero when SIF is zero). In this study, we proposed a simple framework for estimating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation from Hyperspectral measurements (NIRvH) with minimal soil impacts. NIRvH takes advantage of the spectral shape variations in the red-edge region to minimize the soil effects. We evaluated the capability of NIRvH, NIRv and DVI in isolating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation using the data from both the model-based simulations and Hyperspectral Plant imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) measurements. Benchmarked by simultaneously measured SIF, NIRvH has the smallest offset (0-0.037), as compared to an intermediate offset of 0.047-0.062 from NIRv, and the largest offset of 0.089-0.112 from DVI. The magnitude of the offset can vary with different soil reflectance spectra across spatio-temporal scales, which may lead to bias in the downstream NIRv-based photosynthesis estimates. NIRvH and SIF measurements from the same sensor platform avoided complications due to different geometry, footprint and time of observation across sensors when studying the radiative transfer of reflected photons and SIF. In addition, NIRvH was primarily determined by canopy structure rather than chlorophyll content and soil brightness. Our work showcases that NIRvH is promising for retrieving canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf inclination angle, and for estimating fluorescence yield with current and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite measurements.

AB Remote spectroscopy of terrestrial ecosystems generally falls into one of two categories: UV, Visible and Short Wave InfraRed (VSWIR) methods measuring reflected solar illumination, and Thermal InfraRed (TIR) methods measuring radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Both interpret the measured radiance with inversion algorithms that estimate surface reflectance, emissivity, surface temperatures, and the atmospheric state. However, the two regimes have traditionally used independent inversion methods. Here we present the first simultaneous inversion of the upwelling radiance spectrum from the UV through the VSWIR and the Thermal Infrared. Maximum A Posteriori estimation determines the surface and atmosphere state that is most consistent with measured radiance across the entire range. We find that the complementary information in the two intervals improves estimates of atmospheric properties, surface emissivity, and surface temperature. Posterior uncertainty is 40% lower in surface temperature and 60% in air temperature. Spurious correlations between atmospheric and surface state are also reduced, with 90% lower correlated uncertainty between total column water vapor and both surface and air temperature. Temperature-emissivity separation also improves, with a 33% reduction in correlated posterior uncertainty between the parameters. We demonstrate the method on coincident data from the Classic Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) operating in the VSWIR range, and the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) in the TIR range, during flights on NASA's high-altitude ER-2 aircraft. Measurements spanning 0.4 to 12 microns can improve estimates of surface and atmospheric properties, significantly advancing studies in terrestrial ecosystems, geology, agriculture, and urban management.

AB Leaf chlorophyll, as a key factor for carbon circulation in the ecosystem, is significant for the photosynthetic productivity estimation and crop growth monitoring in agricultural management. Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) provides feasible solutions for obtaining crop leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) by the advantages of its repeated and high throughput observations. However, the data redundancy and the poor robustness of the inversion models are still major obstacles that prevent the widespread application of hyperspectral RS for crop LCC evaluation. For winter wheat LCC inversion from hyperspectral observations, this study described a novel hybrid method, which is based on the combination of amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2D correlation spectrum (2DCOS) and transfer learning. The innovative feature selection method, amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS, which originated from 2DCOS, additionally considered the relationships between external perturbations and hyperspectral amplitude and shape characteristics to enhance the dynamic spectrum response. To extract the representative LCC featured wavelengths, the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS was conducted on the leaf optical PROperties SPECTra (PROSPECT) + Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) (PROSAIL) simulated dataset, which covered most possible winter wheat canopy spectra. Nine wavelengths (i.e., 455, 545, 571, 615, 641, 662, 706, 728, and 756 nm) were then extracted as the sensitive wavelengths of LCC with the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS. These wavelengths had specificity to LCC and showed good correlation with LCC from the aspect of photosynthesis mechanism, molecular structure, and optical properties. The transfer learning techniques based on the deep neural network was then introduced to transfer the knowledge learned from the PROSAIL simulated dataset to the inversion tasks of field measured LCC. Parts of the labeled samples in field observations were used to finetune the model pre-trained by the simulated dataset to improve the inversion accuracy of the winter wheat LCC in different field scenes, aiming to reduce the need for the field measured and labeled sample size. To further ascertain the universality, transferability and predictive ability of the proposed hybrid method, field samples collected from different locations at different phenological phases, including the jointing and heading stages in 2013, 2014, and 2018, were utilized as target tasks to validate the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, the LCC of winter wheat estimated with the proposed method was evaluated with the ground-based platform and the UAV-based platform to verify the model versatility for different monitoring platforms. Various validations demonstrated that the hybrid inversion method combining the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS and the fine-tuned transfer learning model could effectively estimate winter wheat LCC with good accuracy and robustness, and can be extended to the detection and inversion of other key variables of crops.

AB Surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD), as an indicator of vegetation wet biomass, from passive microwave remote sensing have been increasingly applied in global ecology and climate research. Both soil moisture and VOD are retrieved from satellite brightness temperature measurements assuming a zeroth order radiative transfer model, commonly known as the tau-omega model. In this model the emission of a vegetated surface is dependent on soil moisture, vegetation absorption and vegetation scattering. Vegetation scattering is normally represented by the single scattering albedo, omega, and is commonly assumed to be a time-invariant calibration parameter to achieve high accuracy in soil moisture estimation. Therefore, little is known about omega dynamics in the context of its ecological information content. Furthermore, VOD and omega are functions of more fundamental absorption and scattering coefficients kappa(a) and kappa(s). In this study, we retrieve both VOD and omega as well as kappa(a) and kappa(s) in two separate tau-omega model frameworks using known soil moisture information. Our sensitivity analysis confirms that vegetation attenuation has a strong impact on the sensitivity of the retrieval to noise. If vegetation attenuation approaches zero, omega is weakly constrained, which leads to strong w dynamics. If vegetation attenuation is very high, VOD, kappa(a) and kappa(s) are increasingly less constrained and susceptible to noise, while omega becomes quasi time-invariant. Coinciding with our sensitivity study, global retrievals from SMAP brightness temperatures exhibit large omega dynamics in drylands and deserts, decreasing rapidly with increasing vegetation cover. In drylands omega might peak during the dry season at the seasonal VOD minimum. With increasing vegetation attenuation, omega dynamics start to follow leaf phenology before they transition to a nearly time-invariant omega in forested areas. VOD, kappa(a) and kappa(s) follow the dynamics of wet biomass and peak after the maximum of leaf area index and precipitation. Our results suggest that zeroth order scattering is generally time-invariant over a majority of the global vegetated areas. In general, time dynamic omega and kappa(s) might provide additional information on the state of the vegetation canopy, which can be valuable for biosphere studies and relevant for the parameterization of vegetation scattering in soil moisture retrievals.

AB The long record of Landsat imagery, which is the cornerstone of Earth observation, provides an opportunity to monitor land use and land cover (LULC) change and understand the interactions between the climate and earth system through time. A few change detection algorithms such as Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) have been developed to utilize all available Landsat images for change detection and characterization at local or global scales. However, the reliable, rapid, and reproducible collection of training samples have become a challenge for time series land cover classification at a large scale. To meet the challenge, we proposed an automatic phenology learning (APL) method with the assumption that the temporal profiles of samples within the same land cover type are the same or similar at a local scale to generate evenly distributed training samples automatically. We designed the method to build land cover patterns for each category based on consensus samples derived from multiple existing scientific datasets including LANDFIRE's (LF) Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Then we calculated the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (twDTW) distance between any undefined samples and land cover patterns in the same geographical region as prior knowledge. Finally, we selected the optimal land cover category for each undefined sample from the land cover products based on the designed criteria iteratively using the twDTW distance as an indicator. The method was applied in the footprint of 10 selected Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) tiles in the eastern and western conterminous United States (CONUS) to produce annual land cover maps from 1985 to 2017. The accuracy assessment and visual comparison revealed that the APL method can generate reliable training samples without any manual interpretation, producing better land cover results especially for the grass/ shrub and wetland land cover classes. Applying the APL method, the overall accuracy of the annual land cover maps was improved by 2% over the accuracy of Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Collection 1.0 Science Products in the research regions. Our results also indicate that the APL method provides an approach for best use of different land cover products and meets the requirement of intensive sampling for training data collection.

AB NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission has been providing high-quality global estimates of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) using L-band radiometry since 2015. To date, a variety of retrieval algorithms as well as surface roughness and scattering albedo have been developed. However, a comprehensive evaluation of different algorithms with the new surface parameters across diverse biomes, climates, and terrain slopes is lacking. To narrow down this knowledge gap, here we examine the performance of various existing algorithms, including V-pol Single Channel Algorithms (SCA-V), H-pol Single Channel Algorithms (SCA-H), classic DCA, extended DCA (E-DCA), regularized DCA (RDCA), land parameter retrieval model (LPRM), multi-temporal DCA (MT-DCA), constrained multi-channel algorithm (CMCA), and spatially constrained multi-channel algorithm (S-CMCA). The SM estimates are evaluated against in-situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) while VOD estimates are compared with the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), tree height, and aboveground biomass. This study has led to several important findings: (1) The overall bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of SM estimates from different algorithms generally increase with vegetation density while their temporal correlations with in-situ measurements decrease as the terrain slope increases. (2) The divergence between different SM estimates is relatively larger over forested areas than non-forested areas. (3) In terms of temporal correlation with in-situ measurements, the SCA-V and RDCA outperform other algorithms over most land cover types and climates. (4) SCA-H typically underestimates SM more compared to other algorithms across sparsely vegetated areas and most climates. (5) The ubRMSE values demonstrate that all algorithms have close performance when EVI2 is less than 0.3; however, the performance of classic DCA decays notably when EVI2 exceeds 0.3. (6) VOD retrievals from RDCA exhibit improved spatial correlations with EVI2, tree height, and aboveground biomass across the globe compared to other algorithms. Overall, RDCA exhibits a good compromise between the high performance of SM and VOD.

AB Radar altimeters are important tools to monitor the volume of the ice sheets. The penetration of radar waves in the snowpack is a major source of uncertainty to retrieve surface elevation. To correct this effect, a better understanding of the sensitivity of the radar waveforms to snow properties is needed. Here, we present an extension of the Snow Model Radiative Transfer (SMRT) to compute radar waveforms and conduct a series of simulations on the Antarctic ice sheet. SMRT is driven by snow and surface roughness properties measured over a large latitudinal range during two field campaigns on the Antarctic Plateau. These measurements show that the snowpack is rougher, denser, less stratified, warmer, and has smaller snow grains near the coast than on the central Plateau. These simulations are compared to satellite observations in the Ka, Ku, and S bands. SMRT reproduces the observed waveforms well. For all sites and all sensors, the main contribution comes from the surface echo. The echo from snow grains (volume scattering) represents up to 40% of the amplitude of the total waveform power in the Ka band, and less at the lower frequencies. The highest amplitude is observed on the central Plateau due to the combination of higher reflection from the surface, higher scattering by snow grains in the Ka and Ku bands, and higher inter-layer reflections in the S band. In the Ka band, the wave penetrates in the snowpack less deeply on the central Plateau than near the coast because of the strong scattering caused by the larger snow grains. The opposite is observed in the S band, the wave penetrates deeper on the central Plateau because of the lower absorption due to the lower snow temperatures. The elevation bias caused by wave penetration into the snowpack show a constant bias of 10 cm for all sites in the Ka band, and a bias of 11 cm, and 21 cm in the Ku band for sites close to the coast and the central Plateau, respectively. Now that SMRT is performing waveform simulations, further work will address how the snowpack properties affect the parameters retrieved by more advanced retracking algorithms such as ICE-2 for different snow cover surfaces.

AB We present a joint exploitation of space-borne and ground-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) and Multi Temporal (MT) InSAR measurements for investigating the Stromboli volcano (Italy) deformation phenomena. In particular, we focus our analysis on three periods: a) the time interval following the 2014 flank eruption, b) the July-August 2019 eruption and c) the following post-eruptive phase. To do this, we take advantage from an unprecedented set of space-borne and ground-based SAR data collected from April 2015 up to November 2019 along two (one ascending and one descending) Sentinel-1 (S-1) tracks, as well as, in the same period, by two ground-based systems installed along the Sciara del Fuoco northern rim. Such data availability permitted us to first characterize the volcano long-term 3D deformation behavior of the pre-eruptive period (April 2015-June 2019), by jointly inverting the space-borne and ground-based InSAR measurements. Then, the GB-SAR measurements allowed us to investigate the sin-eruptive time span (3rd July 2019 - 30th August 2019) which revealed rapid deformation episodes (e.g. more than 30 mm/h just 2 min before the 3rd July 2019 explosion) associated with the eruptive activity, that cannot be detected with the weekly S-1 temporal sampling. Finally, the S-1 measurements permitted to better constrain the post 2019 eruption deformations (31st August 2019 - 5th November 2019), which are mainly located outside the GB-SAR sensed area. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint exploitation of the InSAR measurements obtained through satellite and terrestrial SAR systems, highlighting their strong complementarity to map and interpret the deformation phenomena affecting volcanic areas.

AB Understanding surface melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is important for evaluating the effect of the changing global climate on humanity, and for forecasting sea level rise. We demonstrate a recently developed L-band passive microwave algorithm for the retrieval of snow liquid water and snow and firn density over the GrIS. The retrievals are performed using brightness temperatures from the ESA SMOS satellite. The density retrievals show potential for mapping the equilibrium line altitude of the ice sheet by determining where retrieved densities exceed typical seasonal snowpack density, thus indicating the presence of firn. We integrate snow liquid water retrievals over area and time to obtain water column maps and daily estimates of the surface liquid water present over Greenland. The integrated annual surface liquid water retrieved over the entire ice sheet compares on the same order as modeled estimates of total meltwater available in current literature.

AB Recent developments in remote sensing are enabling automatic, high resolution, and non-destructive survey of agriculture fields, providing the key basis for advancing plant breeding. Among the used remote sensing modalities, LiDAR has attracted wide attention for its ability to directly provide accurate 3D information. Despite the increasing utilization of LiDAR technology in phenotyping, there is still a lack of effective quality control strategies, in particular, quality control of LiDAR data collected on a multi-temporal basis. This study proposes a targetless framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data quality control and crop characterization in mechanized agricultural fields. Features extracted from the fields ? terrain patches and row/alley locations ? are utilized for evaluating the vertical and planimetric relative accuracy of the point clouds. Row/alley locations in the field are automatically identified from the point clouds based on the assumption that higher point density and/or higher elevation correspond to plant locations. The performance of the proposed quality control strategies is evaluated using multi-temporal datasets collected in agricultural fields of different sizes, orientation, crops, and growth stages. The result shows that the net vertical and planimetric discrepancies between multi-temporal point clouds are ?3 cm and ?8 cm, respectively. While the former reflects the actual accuracy of the point clouds, the latter is a combined effect of the LiDAR point cloud accuracy, rasterization artifacts, crop type, growth pattern, and wind condition during data acquisition. In terms of row and alley detection, the result shows that the proposed strategy achieves high performance and can deal with different planting orientation, crop types, growth stages, canopy cover, and planting density. In conclusion, this study presents a quality control framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data. Moreover, the row and alley detection leads to automated extraction of plots, and hence facilitates the use of remotely sensed data for automated phenotyping.

TI Feature extraction for hyperspectral mineral domain mapping: A test of

AB Hyperspectral (HS) imaging holds great potential for the mapping of geological targets. Innovative acquisition modes such as drone-borne or terrestrial remote sensing open up new scales and angles of observation, which allow to analyze small-scale, vertical, or difficult-to-access outcrops. A variety of available sensors operating in different spectral ranges can provide information about the abundance and spatial location of various geologic materials. However geological outcrops are inherently uneven and spectrally heterogeneous, may be covered by dust, lichen or weathering crusts, or contain spectrally indistinct objects, which is why classifications or domain mapping approaches are often used in geoscientific and mineral exploration applications as a means to discriminate mineral associations (e.g. ore or alteration zones) based on overall variations in HS data. Feature extraction (FE) algorithms are prominently used as a preparatory step to identify the first order variations within the data and, simultaneously, reduce noise and data dimensionality. The most established FE algorithms in geosciences are, by far, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF). Major progress has been conducted in the image processing community within the last decades, yielding innovative FE methods that incorporate spatial information for smoother and more accurate classification results. In this paper, we test the applicability of conventional (PCA, MNF) and innovative FE techniques (OTVCA: Orthogonal total variation component analysis and WSRRR: Waveletbased sparse reduced-rank regression) on three case studies from geological HS mapping campaigns, including drone-borne mineral exploration, terrestrial paleoseismic outcrop scanning and thermal HS lithological mapping. This allows us to explore the performance of different FE approaches on complex geological data with sparse or partly inaccurate validation data. For all case studies, we demonstrate advantages of innovative FE algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and geological interpretability. We promote the use of advanced image processing methods for applications in geoscience and mineral exploration as a tool to support geological mapping activities.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key diagnostic indicator of agricultural water use and crop stress. LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co -collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST (similar to 70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180-270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.

AB The recent and projected investments across the world on radar satellite missions (e.g., Sentinel-1, SAOCOM, BIOMASS and NISAR) provide a great opportunity for operational radar soil moisture mapping with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, there is no retrieval algorithm that can make complementary use of the multi-frequency data from those missions, due to the large uncertainties in observations collected by the different sensors, different validity regions of the forward models, and the fact that inversion algorithms have been designed for specific data sources. In this study, the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues. Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution, multiple soil moisture retrievals (termed sub-retrievals) with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and/or time instances randomly selected from the available data, with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output. The ensemble retrievals, taking one existing snapshot method and two multi-temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms, were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources. An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non-ensemble retrieval in most cases, with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014 m(3)/m(3) in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and an increase of 0.01 to 0.16 in correlation coefficient (R). Weakly biased and correlated sub-retrievals were confirmed to be the basic requirement of an effective ensemble retrieval, being consistent with use of ensemble learning in other applications.

AB Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The po-tential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC >= 50% and SPC >= 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (<= 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.

AB With a revisit time of 1 h, spatial resolution of 500 m, and high radiometric sensitivity, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) is widely used to monitor diurnal dynamics of oceanic phenomena. However, atmospheric correction (AC) of GOCI data with high solar zenith angle ( > 70 degrees) is still a challenge for traditional algorithms. Here, we propose a novel neural network (NN) AC algorithm for GOCI data under high solar zenith angles. Unlike traditional NN AC algorithms trained by radiative transfer-simulated dataset, our new AC algorithm was trained by a large number of matchups between GOCI-observed Rayleigh-corrected radiance in the morning and evening and GOCI-retrieved high-quality noontime remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). When validated using hourly GOCI data, the new NN AC algorithm yielded diurnally stable Rrs in open ocean waters from the morning to evening. Furthermore, when validated by in-situ data from three Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) stations (Socheongcho, Gageocho and Ieodo), the GOCI-retrieved Rrs at visible bands obtained using the new AC algorithm agreed well with the in-situ values, even under high solar zenith angles. Practical application of the new algorithm was further examined using diurnal GOCI observation data acquired in clear open ocean waters. Results showed that the new algorithm successfully retrieved Rrs for the morning and evening GOCI data. Moreover, the amount of Rrs data retrieved by the new algorithm was much higher than that retrieved by the standard AC algorithm in SeaDAS. Our proposed NN AC algorithm can not only be applied to process GOCI data acquired in the morning and evening, but also has the potential to be applied to process polar-orbiting satellite ocean color data at high-latitude ocean that also include satellite observation with high solar zenith angles.

AB Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) is an effective tracer for monitoring atmospheric transport processes and for detecting pollution sources of anthropogenic origin. However, very few observation systems exist that are capable of providing measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution to identify hotspots for emission control purposes. Here we introduce a mountain-top remote sensing observatory, the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS), for mapping the enhancement of CO column-averaged mixing ratio (XCO) over the Los Angeles (LA) megacity. Compared to conventional observation network, CLARS is unique in the following ways: (1) it mimics a geostationary satellite observatory for LA with approximately hourlyand kilometer-scale mapping capability; (2) the free tropospheric background atmosphere is simultaneously measured; and (3) the measurements are highly sensitive to anthropogenic emissions due to the long light path along the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The CO slant column density and XCO are retrieved from reflected sunlight measurements in the 2.3 mu m CO band and the 1.27 mu m oxygen (O2) band. Data filtering and corrections for aerosol scattering and geometric effects are then implemented to derive the XCO enhancement, which is the XCO excess in the PBL compared to the background value. In the LA megacity, the XCO enhancement shows a distinctive diurnal cycle primarily driven by changes in anthropogenic emissions and sea-breeze circulation. Such diurnal patterns can be reproduced by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The enhancement also shows a significant weekly cycle resulting from the weekly pattern in anthropogenic CO emissions. On average, the XCO enhancements on Sunday and Saturday are 16.1% and 4.4%, respectively, lower than weekday values. The weekly XCO enhancement patterns also show high correlation with traffic counts. A seasonal pattern of XCO enhancement with high (low) spatial contrast in summer (winter), resulting from changing sea-breeze circulation, can be observed. These diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns of XCO enhancement serve as tracers of the atmospheric pulse of the LA megacity. The CLARS observatory can serve as a testbed for future geostationary missions to track anthropogenic emissions in cities.

AB Atmospheric water vapor plays a key role in the global water and energy cycles. Accurate estimation of water vapor and consistent representation of its spatial-temporal variation are critical to climate analysis and model validation. This study used ground observational data from global radiosonde and sunphotometer networks to evaluate MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) precipitable water vapor (PWV) products for 2000-2017. The products included the thermal-infrared (TIR) (Collection 6, C006) and its updated version (Collection 061, C061), and near-infrared (NIR) products (C061). Our results demonstrated that compared to its earlier version subject to sensor crosstalk problem, the C061_TIR data showed improved accuracy in terms of bias, standard deviation, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination, regression slope and intercept. Among the PWV products, C061_NIR data achieved the best overall performance in accuracy evaluation. The C061_NIR revealed the PWV had a multi-year average of 2.50 +/- 0.08 cm for the globe, 2.03 +/- 0.06 cm for continents, and 2.70 +/- 0.09 cm for oceans in 2000-2017. The PWV values yielded an increasing rate of 0.015 cm/year for the globe, 0.010 cm/year for continents, and 0.017 cm/year for oceans. Nearly 98.95% of the globe showed an increasing trend, 80.74% of statistical significance, mainly distributed within and around the tropical zones. The findings should be valuable for understanding of global water and energy cycles.

AB The rampant encroachment of Spartina alterniflora into coastal wetlands of China over the past decades has adversely affected both coastal ecosystems and socio-economic systems. However, there are no annual or multi-year epoch maps of Spartina saltmarsh in China, which hinders our understanding and management of Spartina invasion. In this study, we selected Chongming island, China, where Spartina saltmarsh had expanded rapidly since its introduction in the 1990s. We investigated phenology of Spartina, Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes, and the time series vegetation indices derived from Landsat images showed that Spartina saltmarsh did not green-up in April-May and stayed green in December-January, which differed from the phenology of Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm that used time series Landsat data to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh, and we applied it to quantify the temporal dynamics (expansion and removal) of Spartina saltmarsh on Chongming island during 1995-2018. The resultant maps showed that Spartina saltmarsh area on Chongming island increased from similar to 4 ha in 1995 to similar to 2067 ha in 2012 but dropped substantially to similar to 729 ha in 2016 after a large-scale ecological engineering project (US$ 186 million) was started to remove Spartina during 2013-2016. Chongming island still had similar to 1315 ha Spartina saltmarsh in 2018, and majority of it was distributed outside the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, which could serve as the sources for reinvasion in the near future. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using time series Landsat images, pixel- and phenology-based algorithm, and GEE platform to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh over years in the region, which is useful to the management of invasive plants in coastal wetlands.

AB Surface all-wave net radiation (R-n) plays an important role in various land surface processes, such as agricultural, ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes. Recently, remote sensing of R-n at regional and global scales has attracted considerable attention and has achieved significant advances. However, there are many issues in estimating all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes, such as posing greater uncertainty by surface and atmosphere satellite products at high latitudes, and unavailability of real-time and accurate cloud base height and temperature parameters. In this study, we developed the LRD (length ratio of daytime) classification model using the genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) to estimate all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. With a very high temporal repeating frequency (similar to 6 to 20 times per day) at high latitudes, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to test the proposed method. R-n measurements at 82 sites and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data of MODIS from 2000 to 2017 were matched for model training and validation. Two models for estimating daily average R-n were developed: model I based on instantaneous daytime MODIS observation and model II based on instantaneous nighttime MODIS observation. Validation results of model I showed an R-2 of 0.85, an RMSE of 23.66 W/m(2), and a bias of 0.27 W/m(2), whereas these values were 0.51, 15.04 W/m(2), and -0.08 W/m(2) for model II, respectively. Overall, the proposed machine learning algorithm with the LRD classification can accurately estimate the all-sky daily average R-n at high latitudes. Mapping of R-n over the high latitudes at 1 km spatial resolution showed a similar spatial distribution to R-n estimates from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. This method has the potential for operational monitoring of spatio-temporal change of R-n at high latitudes with a long-term coverage of MODIS observations.

AB Mapping and assessment of water-related ecosystems is a challenging task that requires advanced processing techniques with clear rules and standards in terminology and definition of class features. These ecosystems are hydrologically and ecologically connected at catchment level and co-exist within a human context. The SWOS (Satellite based Wetland Observation Service - Horizon 2020) national service case for mapping and assessing the 10 Greek Ramsar wetland sites and their catchment areas is built on the requirements of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. It contributes directly to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Global Indicator 6.6.1 "Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems". An Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach was adopted using Sentinel-2 satellite images for the year 2017, to discriminate 31 classes (wetland and non-wetland) over an area of 2,015,591 ha. The classification model was further adjusted to Landsat 5 TM imagery of previous years (1986-1987) in order to extract possible changes in the spatial extent of water-related ecosystems. The Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) ecosystem typology, as this was enhanced within SWOS, was applied. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the employed classification model, techniques and rules, in obtaining highly accurate (over 90%) mapping results on the spatial extent of water-related ecosystems. Also, they highlight the contribution of Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial analysis in assessments of area-based changes and their causes, as well as in identification of conservation and management priorities (i.e. areas for restoration). In addition, to address the need to strengthen national capacities, the established SWOS service lines have been used as a contribution to the user community.

AB Operated since the end of 2009, the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission is the first orbiting radiometer that collects regular and global observations from space of two Essential Climate Variables of the Global Climate Observing System: Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and Soil Moisture. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius mission, with the primary objective to provide global SSS measurements from space operated from mid-2011 to mid-2015. NASA's Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, primarily dedicated to soil moisture measurements, but also monitoring SSS, has been operating since early 2015. The primary sensors onboard these three missions are passive microwave radiometers operating at 1.4 GHz (L-band). SSS is retrieved from radiometer measurements of the sea surface brightness temperature (TB). In this paper, we first provide a historical review of SSS remote sensing with passive L-band radiometry beginning with the discussions of measurement principles, technology, sensing characteristics and complementarities of the three aforementioned missions. The assessment of satellite SSS products is then presented in terms of individual mission characteristics, common algorithms, and measurement uncertainties, including the validation versus in situ data, and, the consideration of sampling differences between satellite SSS and in situ salinity measurements. We next review the major scientific achievements of the combined first 10 years of satellite SSS data, including the insights enabled by these measurements regarding the linkages of SSS with the global water cycle, climate variability, and ocean biochemistry. We also highlight the new ability provided by satellites to monitor mesoscale and synoptic-scale SSS features and to advance our understanding of SSS' role in air-sea interactions, constraining ocean models, and improving seasonal predictions. An overview of satellite SSS observation highlights during this first decade and upcoming challenges are then presented.

AB In this century, one of the main objectives of agriculture is sustainability addressed to achieve food security, based on the improvement of use efficiency of farm resources, the increasing of crop yield and quality, under climate change conditions. The optimization of farm resources, as well as the control of soil degradation processes (e.g., soil erosion), can be realized through crop monitoring in the field, aiming to manage the local spatial variability (time and space) with a high resolution. In the case of high profitability crops, as the case of vineyards for high-quality wines, the capability to manage and follow spatial behavior of plants during the season represents an opportunity to improve farmer incomes and preserve the environmental health. However, any field monitoring represents an additional cost for the farmer, which slows down the objective of a diffuse sustainable agriculture.
   Satellite multispectral images have been widely used for production management in large areas. However, their observation is limited by the pre-defined and fixed scale with relatively coarse spatial resolution, resulting in limitations in their application.
   In this paper, encouraged by recent achievements in convolutional neural network (CNN), a multiscale full-connected CNN is constructed for the pan-sharpening of Sentinel-2A images by UAV images. The reconstructed data are validated by independent multispectral UAV images and in-situ spectral measurements. The reconstructed Sentinel-2A images provide a temporal evaluation of plant responses using selected vegetation indices. The proposed methodology has been tested on plant measurements taken either in-vivo and through the retrospective reconstruction of the eco-physiological vine behavior, by the evaluation of water conductivity and water use efficiency indexes from anatomical and isotopic traits recorded in vine trunk wood.
   In this study, the use of such a methodology able to combine the pro and cons of space-borne and UAVs data to evaluate plant responses, with high spatial and temporal resolution, has been applied in a vineyard of southern Italy by analyzing the period from 2015 to 2018. The obtained results have shown a good correspondence between the vegetation indexes obtained from reconstructed Sentinel-2A data and plant hydraulic traits obtained from tree-ring based retrospective reconstruction of vine eco-physiological behavior.

AB A prompt and overall understanding of building damages following a disaster is critical, as they are closely related to casualties. As an important active remote sensing technology, synthetic aperture radar can be a valuable tool for assessing building damages in disasters, owing to its large coverage, quick response, non-contact, and independence of weather and light capabilities. Various approaches have been proposed for SAR-based building damage assessment with the development of radar technology and interpretation techniques. While providing numerous choices, these multifarious approaches also make it burdensome to ponder the applicable approach in a specific case, and to reflect on potential fields for further research. Accordingly, this paper hierarchically classified and summarized these approaches to provide a structured understanding of the research status in this field, for assisting in approach decisions and promising field considerations. First, depending on the pre-event data availability, the numerous approaches were classified into change detections employing both pre- and post-event data, and assessments applying only post-event data. Then, determined by the data resolution level and acquisition mode, the plentiful change detection approaches were further distinguished into block-unit approaches analyzing intensity, coherence, or polarimetry features, and building-unit approaches that simply generalize the block-unit approaches, or that concretely explore the detailed individual building features. The post-event data-based assessments, with relatively fewer approaches, were further introduced as methods exploring polarimetry or/and texture features. In each classification category, the principle was first introduced to explain the basic concept and essence of the approaches. An approach review was then provided by organizing relevant studies in a logical or structured way, to facilitate a clear understanding of the overall research status. Favorable parameters in each category were also summarized for easy reference and application in the future.

AB The Landsat archive offers great potential for monitoring forest cover change, and new approaches moving from categorical towards continuous change products emerge rapidly. Most approaches, however, require vast amounts of high-quality reference data, limiting their applicability across space and time. We here propose the use of a generalized regression-based unmixing approach to overcome this limitation. The unmixing approach relies on temporally generalized machine learning regression models (random forest regression [RFR] and support vector regression [SVR]), which are trained on synthetically mixed data from a multi-year library of pure and hence easy to identify image spectra. We apply the model to three decades of Landsat data, mapping both overall forest cover and broadleaved/coniferous forest cover fractions across space and time. The resulting maps well represented the spatial-temporal patterns of forest (change) in our study region. The SVR model outperformed the RFR model, yielding accuracies of r(2) = 0.74/RMSE = 0.18 for the forest cover fraction maps, r(2) = 0.50/RMSE = 0.24 for the broadleaved forest cover fraction maps, and r(2) = 0.59/RMSE = 0.23 for coniferous forest cover fraction maps, respectively. Highest map errors were found in mature stands, residential areas, and recently disturbed forests. We also found some variability in forest cover fractions for stable forest pixels over time, which were explained by variation in Landsat image acquisition dates. We conclude that regression-based unmixing using synthetically mixed training data from a multi-year spectral library offers an innovative strategy for mapping forest cover fractions and forest types throughout the Landsat archive that likely can be extended to large areas.

AB Recent advances in L-band passive microwave remote sensing provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor soil moisture at similar to 40 km spatial resolution around the globe. Nevertheless, retrieval of the accurate high spatial resolution soil moisture maps that are required to satisfy hydro-meteorological and agricultural applications remains a challenge. Currently, a variety of downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation techniques have been proposed as the solution to disaggregate the coarse passive microwave soil moisture into high-to-medium resolutions. These techniques take advantage of the strengths of both the passive microwave observations of soil moisture having low spatial resolution and the spatially detailed information on land surface features that either influence or represent soil moisture variability. However, such techniques have typically been developed and tested individually under differing weather and climate conditions, meaning that there is no clear guidance on which technique performs the best. Consequently, this paper presents a quantitative assessment of the existing radar-, optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling techniques using a singular extensive data set collected specifically for that purpose, being the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx)-4 and -5 airborne field campaigns, and the OzNet in situ stations, to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of their performances. The oversampling-based soil moisture product best captured the temporal and spatial variability of the reference soil moisture overall, though the radar-based products had a better temporal agreement with airborne soil moisture during the short SMAPEx-4 period. Moreover, the difference between temporal analysis of products against in situ and airborne soil moisture reference data sets pointed to the fact that relying on in situ measurements alone is not appropriate for validation of spatially enhanced soil moisture maps.

AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced rapid warming in recent decades. However, the meteorological stations of the TP are scarce and mostly located at the eastern and southern parts of the TP where the elevation is relatively low, which increases the uncertainty of regional and local climate studies. Recently, the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has been used to estimate the surface air temperature (SAT). However, the thermal infrared based LST is prone to cloud contamination, which limits the availability of the estimated SAT. This study presents a novel all sky model based on the rule-based Cubist regression to estimate all sky daily average SAT using LST, incident solar radiation (ISR), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The model is trained using station data of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) and corresponding satellite products. The output is evaluated using independent station data with the bias of -0.07 degrees C and RMSE of 1.87 degrees C. Additionally, the 25-fold cross validation shows a stable model performance (RMSE: 1.6-2.8 degrees C). Moreover, the all sky Cubist model increases the availability of the estimated SAT by nearly three times. We used the all sky Cubist model to estimate the daily average SAT of the TP for 2002-2016 at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. We compared our all sky Cubist model estimated daily average SAT with three existing data sets (i.e., GLDAS, CLDAS, and CMFD). Our model estimation shows similar spatial and temporal dynamics with these existing data sets but outperforms them with lower bias and RMSE when benchmarked against the CMA station data. The estimated SAT data could be very useful for regional and local climate studies over the TP. Although the model is developed for the TP, the framework is generic and may be extended to other regions with proper model training using local data.

AB Slope deformation in mountainous terrain can be driven by different processes, the nature of which is either gravitational and irreversible or seasonal and reversible, the latter induced by permafrost variations or by hydromechanical or thermomechanical effects. The importance of identifying such deformations is not only related to the hazard they can pose, but also to the understanding of changes that permafrost or local hydrological conditions undergo. Here, we carry out a multi-temporal InSAR analysis over a mountainous area 8000 km(2) large, straddling north-western Bhutan and southern Tibet. We propose a methodology to separate locally deforming areas from the effects of long-wavelength signals through the analysis of the spatio-temporal behaviour of 4-years long time series of surface displacements. We present the mapping of hundreds of small-scale features that appear to be actively deforming, as well as several examples of reversible deformation rarely detected at this scale in such a challenging and vast region. The analysis of the multi-annual trend of ground deformation shows a relatively small number of irreversible gravitational movements clearly related to rock slides which attests a low level of recent activity of large rock slope instabilities in the region. In the southernmost, lower elevation parts of the study area, we quantify reversible surface displacements with amplitudes ranging between 5 and 17 mm, and showing maximum displacements towards the satellite in summer months, thus compatible with hydro-mechanical effects related to groundwater table variations. In addition, the ground movement induced by the active layer's response to thawing and freezing over the gentler slopes and high-elevation permafrost regions of Bhutan and southern Tibet is on average around 10 mm, with maxima up to 28 mm. The localised displacements appear to be largely associated to braided stream plains, glacier outwash plains or low angle, fine sediment covered slopes.

AB Remote sensing is useful for detecting and quantifying cyanobacteria blooms for managing water systems. In particular, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing has an advantage in precise cyanobacteria detection with high spatial and spectral resolution. Many bio-optical algorithms have been developed and utilized to estimate algal concentration. However, achieving the optimal conventional optical model accuracy is still challenging in freshwater owing to the biophysical complexity of the inland water and the seasonal reflection of site-specific optical properties. Thus, this study applied convolutional neural network (CNN) with various input windows to estimate the concentrations of phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and generated a phytoplankton pigment map. We proposed that the Point-centered regression CNN (PRCNN) showed accurate PC and Chl-a simulations, with R-2 > 0.86 and 0.73, respectively, and root mean square errors of <10 mg.m(-3), which were smaller than the conventional optical algorithm in our study area. In addition, the generated PC and Chl-a map from PRCNN closely followed the spatial distribution of the pigment and showed reasonable concentration levels. Through testing we found that a small input size and deep spectral bands contributed to the CNN model to achieve strong capacity to reflect the dynamic spatial feature of phytoplankton pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that CNN regression has the potential to detect and quantify cyanobacteria with high accuracy and can be an alternative to bio-optical algorithms.

AB Accurate knowledge of seasonal and inter-annual distributions of plant species is required for many research and management agendas that track ecosystem health. Airborne imaging spectroscopy data have been used successfully to map plant species, but often only in a single season or over a limited spatial extent due to data availability. NASA's Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) preparatory airborne campaign flew an imaging spectrometer from 2013 to 2015. This dataset captured a severe drought and thus provided the opportunity to evaluate species discrimination over an extreme range in environmental conditions. Here we evaluate the portability of image-based training data and accuracy of species discrimination. The imagery was acquired in the spring, summer, and fall seasons of 2013-2015 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Reference spectral libraries were developed with three sets of spectra: spectra from a single image date, combining spectra from multiple dates (by season, by year, and from all dates), and creating leave-one-out (LOO) libraries that pooled spectra from all dates but one. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was applied to reduce data dimensionality, and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). When only spectra from the same image date were used, plant species were classified with a mean kappa accuracy ranging between 0.80 and 0.86 for the nine dates. Seasonal and annual spectral libraries had comparable accuracies with mean kappa 0.79-0.83 and 0.78-0.83, respectively. Seasonal libraries performed slightly better than annual libraries for species because they better-incorporated changes in spectra due to phenology. Spectral libraries were not transferable across dates, with mean kappa accuracies dropping to 0.31-0.73 for LOO spectral libraries. These results emphasize that spectral libraries built from previously collected imagery may not be able to map plant species over new images accurately. Specifically, our results highlight the need to use reference spectra that adequately represent the phenological and biophysical status of the plant species within an image for accurate mapping. Our research provides relevant insight for advanced species-mapping techniques across broad spatial and temporal scales using imagery from sensors like HyspIRI.

AB Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.

AB The primary goal of this study was to bridge the gap between hyperspectral data classifications and their practical implementation for forest management. Information on the distributions and abundances of tree species can help forest managers understand the spatial coverage of tree species and manage the species composition by establishing a specific strategy. For this purpose, classification of tree species was applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a determination of selected forest stand characteristics (i.e., main tree species, species cover proportions, and species mixture patterns) was made.
   We selected the Milicz Forest District of southwestern Poland as our study area. Sixteen airborne hyper-spectral images were acquired with the HySpex VNIR-1800 and SWIR-384 sensors on 19 August 2015. We classified four deciduous tree species (Black alder, Pedunculate oak, Silver birch, and European beech) and coniferous species using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. To properly evaluate the classification accuracy, the level of crown visibility from above was determined during ground measurements. The obtained information was used to create a reference set integrated with the Remote Sensing data.
   The classification accuracy was 91%. The main tree species found in the sample plots were correctly assessed based on the coverage area for 92% of the sample plots. The species cover proportions were estimated correctly for 75-94% of the sample plots with a tolerance threshold <= 10 percentage points depending on the species considered. Similarities of the species structures shown in the sample plots between the classification map and reference field data were found by Morisita's index (0.92). Spatial mixture pattern detection was performed for 316 forest stands. The results of the developed method were found to agree to field data with 69% accuracy. This study shows that airborne hyperspectral data serve as a reliable source for the precise description of forest characteristics, such as the main tree species, tree species cover proportions and mixture patterns.

AB Large-scale spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature (LST) can be derived from satellite observations, particularly for remote high-elevated mountain glaciers where in situ observations are scarce. Our previous LST retrieval study on Qiyi Glacier of China employed a generalized single-channel algorithm and Landsat thermal infrared data, but a clear LST summertime overestimation was observed, particularly on the glacier tongue. Here we extend our previous study by calculating the thermal radiance on Qiyi Glacier that is emitted from the surrounding terrain, and incorporating this thermal radiation term into two generalized single-channel LST algorithms to analyze its influence on the errors of glacier surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing data. In addition, we also discuss other possible causes of this overestimation in LST retrieval. The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) The surrounding terrain provides nonnegligible summertime thermal radiation to the glacier in the Landsat7 band 6 spectrum range (10.4-12.5 mu m) that is 2.6 times larger than the atmospheric down-welling thermal radiance on the glacier tongue. The retrieved LSTs yield an overestimation of up to 0.28 K when the effect of thermal radiation from the surrounding slopes is not considered. (2) The average errors due to the surrounding topographic thermal radiation and the cubic convolution resampling method (CC method) employed in the Landsat7 thermal infrared data processing are only 0.07 K and - 0.01 K, respectively. These are much smaller than the average LST errors (1.79 K), indicating that the neither the surrounding topographic thermal radiation nor the CC method are primary factors in the retrieved LST overestimation. (3) The sole dependence of the generalized single-channel algorithm on the atmospheric water vapor content may therefore be the most likely cause of this overestimation, as high-altitude regions generally possess low atmospheric water contents. Radiative transfer models (e.g., MODTRAN) may provide a solution to this problem by simulating the influence of other atmospheric constituents on LST retrieval under conditions of low water vapor, which can then indicate any additional input variables that should be incorporated into the LST algorithm.

AB This paper presents a new coastline extraction method that improves water classification accuracy by benefitting from an ever-increasing volume of repeated measurements from commercial satellite missions. The widely-used Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is tested on a sample of around 12,600 satellite images for statistical analysis. The core of the new water classification method is the use of a water probability algorithm based on the stacking of repeat measurements, which can mitigate the effects of translational offsets of images and the classification errors caused by clouds and cloud shadows. By integrating QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images, the final data product provides a 2 m resolution coastline, as well as a 2 m water probability map and a repeat-count measurement map. Improvements on the existing coastline (GSHHS-the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database, 50 m-5000 m) in terms of resolution (2 m) is substantial, thanks to the combination of multiple data sources.

AB The uncertainty of surface soil moisture (SM) retrievals from satellite brightness temperature (TB) observations depends primarily on the choice of radiative transfer model (RTM) parameters, prior SM information and TB inputs. This paper studies the sensitivity of several established and experimental SM retrieval products from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to these choices at 11 reference sites, located in 7 watersheds across the United States (US). Different RTM parameter sets cause large biases between retrievals. Whereas typical RTM parameter sets are calibrated for SM retrievals, it is shown that a parameter set carefully optimized for TB forward modeling can also be used for retrieving SM. It is also shown that the inclusion of dynamic prior SM estimates in a Bayesian retrieval scheme can strongly improve SM retrievals, regardless of the choice of RTM parameters. The second part of this paper evaluates the ensemble uncertainty metrics for SM retrievals obtained by propagating a wide range of RTM parameters through the RTM, and the relationship with time series metrics obtained by comparing SM retrievals with in situ data. As expected for bounded variables, the total spread in the ensemble SM retrievals is smallest for wet and dry SM values and highest for intermediate SM values. After removal of the strong long-term SM bias associated with the RTM parameter values for individual ensemble members, the remaining anomaly ensemble SM spread shows higher values when SM deviates further from its long-term mean SM. This reveals higher-order biases (e.g. differences in variances) in the retrieval error, which should be considered when characterizing retrieval error. The time-average anomaly ensemble SM spread of 0.037 m(3)/m(3) approximates the actual time series unbiased root-mean-square-difference of 0.042 m(3)/m(3) between ensemble mean retrievals and in situ data across the reference sites.

AB Night-time light (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operation Linescan System (OLS) provide important observations of human activities; however, DMSP-OLS NTL data suffer from problems such as saturation and blooming. This research developed a self-adjusting model (SEAM) to correct blooming effects in DMSP-OLS NTL data based on a spatial response function and without using any ancillary data. By assuming that the pixels adjacent to the background contain no lights (i.e., pseudo light pixels, PLPs), the blooming effect intensity, a parameter in the SEAM model, can be estimated by pixel-based regression using PLPs and their neighboring light sources. SEAM was applied to all of China, and its performance was assessed for twelve cities with different population sizes. The results show that SEAM can largely reduce the blooming effect in the original DMSP-OLS dataset and enhance its quality. The images after blooming effect correction have higher spatial similarity with Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images and higher spatial variability than the original DMSP-OLS data. We also found that the average effective blooming distance is approximately 3.5 km in China, which may be amplified if the city is surrounded by water surfaces, and that the blooming effect intensity is positively correlated to atmospheric quality. The effectiveness of the proposed model will improve the capacity of DMSP-OLS images for mapping the urban extent and modeling socioeconomic parameters.

AB Since the outbreak of a large-scale Ulva prolifera bloom in the Yellow Sea during the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Competition in summer 2008, Ulva blooms have been a marine hazard every summer. Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T-0 and T-1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAI(sw), is constructed to determine T-0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T-1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T-1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.

AB After being launched in September 2018, measurements from the ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) will be available to the science community starting in the Spring of 2019. These data offer new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation as well as monitoring of the Earth's carbon stocks. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICESat-2 will utilize photon counting technology for the altimetry observations. Photon counting technology is relatively new to the vegetation mapping community thus requires development of new algorithm approaches for terrain surface and canopy height retrievals. Photon counting systems provide range measurements for individual photons given the instrument's detection sensitivity. The sensitivity enables higher laser repetition rates for improved spatial coverage but is susceptible to solar background noise making the separation of signal and noise challenging and the data volume large. The algorithm developed specifically for the extraction of terrain and canopy heights from the ATLAS point clouds produces the ATL08 geophysical data product. This paper provides a detailed description of the ATL08 methodology, presents the data format, discusses many of the critical parameters likely to be of interest to future ICESat-2 data users, and describes the predicated uncertainties for terrain and canopy heights using two simulated ATLAS data sets. The first critical function in the ATL08 algorithm needs to accurately retrieve the surface is to identify the signal photons apart from the noise photons. Using a series of iterative filters, the ground and top of canopy surfaces are then identified in the signal. Next, individual photons are classified as either noise, canopy, or ground photons based on their distance above (or below) the estimated ground and top of canopy surfaces. The ATL08 algorithm has been tested on several simulated ATLAS data sets, and the results from two different ecosystems are described. The terrain extraction results saw sub-meter RMSE for the Alaska Tundra/Taiga ecotone and < 2 m RMSE in Sonoma County, California which is characterized by complex topography and dense vegetation. Although canopy heights on the ATL08 data product will underestimate the true canopy height within a segment, the ICESat-2 derived canopy height is found to be correlated with relative height metrics produced from airborne lidar (i.e. truth). For the sparse boreal forests of Alaska, the ATL08 canopy height was most correlated with the 95th percentile relative height (RH95). However, for the dense coniferous forests of Sonoma County, CA, ATL08 canopy height is correlated with 75th percentile relative height (RH75). Data from ICESat-2 will provide a new and exciting data set to the scientific community by providing global terrain and canopy height estimates as well as showing potential for estimation of forest biomass.

AB There is an increasing demand for clove products, mainly dried buds and essential oil on global markets. Consequently, the importance of clove trees as a provisioning service is increasing at the local level, particularly for smallholders cultivating clove trees as cash crops. Due to limited availability of data on local production, using remote sensing-based methods to quantify today's clove production is of key interest. We estimated the clove bud yield in a study site in northeastern Madagascar by detecting individual clove trees and determining relevant productio n systems, including pasture and clove, clove plantation and agroforestry systems. We implemented an individual tree detection method based on two machine learning approaches. Specifically, we proposed using a circular Hough transform (CHT) for the automated detection of individual clove trees. Subsequently, we implemented a tree species classification method using a random forests (RF) classifier based on a set of features extracted for relevant trees in the above production systems. Finally, we classified and mapped different production systems. Based on the number of detected clove trees growing in a clove production system, we estimated the production system-dependent clove bud yield. Our results show that 97.9% of all reference clove trees were detected using a CHT. Classifying clove and non-clove trees resulted in a producer accuracy of 70.7% and a user accuracy of 59.2% for clove trees. The classification of the clove production systems resulted in an overall accuracy of 77.9%. By averaging different clove tree yield estimates obtained from the literature, we estimated an average total yield of approximately 575 tons/year for our 25,600 ha study area. With this approach, we demonstrate a first step towards large-scale clove bud yield estimation using remote sensing data and methodologies.

AB Due to the large carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, dynamics of photosynthesis can have significant effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and lead to large uncertainties in ecosystem C budgets. Remote sensing approaches using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) hold the potential to directly assess ecosystem photosynthesis. However, many challenges remain linked to using the SIF emission signal to estimate gross primary production (GPP). The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationships between GPP and SIF over different time scales (minutes to years) and under varying environmental conditions. Two different ecosystems were investigated, a cropland and a mixed forest, with continuous eddy covariance flux measurements. Continuous tower-based SIF retrievals were performed in 2015 and 2016 at both ecosystems.
   In both ecosystems, SIF was found to be more affected by environmental conditions than GPP. Annual cycles for GPP and SIF differed at the mixed forest due in part to the influence of the different footprint size of the two independent measurements. Diurnal cycles in GPP and SIF corresponded well under unstressed conditions and followed the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). However, depressions in SIF were found at both sites either at midday or in the afternoon during the growing season. At the cropland site, reductions in SIF occurred at high PPFD (PPFD > 1470 mu mol M-2 S-1, R-2 = 0.62) and high VPD (VPD > 1590 Pa, R-2 = 0.35). Whereas at the forest site, reductions in SIF were linked to high VPD (VPD > 1250 Pa, R-2 = 0.25), but not to high PPFD (R-2 = 0.84). The depression in SIF was also associated with an increase in non-photochemical quenching, as indicated by the photochemical reflectance index (R-2 = 0.78), thus showing the complementarity between SIF and non-photochemical quenching as different energy pathways. Our results show the importance of characterizing the influence of different environmental conditions on SIF-GPP relationships for specific ecosystems to reliably estimate GPP from remote sensing measurements.

AB Understanding the diurnal dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is an indispensable step towards their full interpretation at multiple time scales. However, because of the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data, the climatology, variety, and taxonomy of diurnal SUHI (DSUHI) patterns remain largely unknown for numerous cities with different bioclimates. By combining daily MODIS LST data with a newly developed four -parameter diurnal temperature cycle(DTC) model, we selected 354 Chinese megacities located in different bioclimatic zones to examine the characteristics of the DSUHI descriptors and systematically investigate the prevalent DSUHI temporal patterns.
   The DSUHI variations demonstrate that both the daily maximum and minimum SUHI intensity (SUHII) can occur during most periods of the day, although these intensities are more likely to occur in the early morning and noon/afternoon. Our results also reveal that both strong SUHIs (SUHII > 3 K) and surface urban cool islands (SUCIs) (SUHII < 0 K) are more prevalent than those identified directly through the four MODIS transits. According to the SUHI dynamics, five typical DSUHI temporal patterns are identified: standard-spoon, weak spoon, quasi-spoon, inverse-spoon, and straight-line patterns. A gradient was found with spoon-like patterns (DSUHI dynamics typically with a daytime valley and a roughly constant trend or a small peak at night) in North China and inverse-spoon (DSUHI dynamics with a typical daytime peak and a constant trend at night) or straight-line patterns (DSUHI dynamics virtually unchanged all day) in South China. The DSUHI shapes were found to be greatly controlled by the urban-rural contrast in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and urban geometry. Our results not only advance our understanding of the diurnal climatology of SUHIs but also provide a basis for urban surface heat mitigation by identifying the possible timing of the mitigation requirement.

AB Several new satellite-derived and long-term surface water datasets at high-spatial resolution have recently become available at the global scale, showing different characteristics and abilities. They are either based on visible imagery from Landsat - the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) - or on the merging of passive/active microwave and visible observations - Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS-D3) - that has been downscaled from a native resolution of 25 km x 25 km to the 90 m x 90 m resolution. The objective of this paper is to perform a thorough comparison of the different water surface estimates in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and propose a strategy for future developments of high-resolution surface water databases. Results show that due to their very high spatial resolution (30 m) the Landsat-based datasets are well suited to retrieve open water surfaces, even at very small size. GIEMS-D3 has a better ability to detect water under vegetation and during the cloudy season, and it shows larger seasonal dynamics. However, its current version overestimates surface water extent on water-saturated soils, and due to its low original (i.e. before downscaling) spatial resolution, it is under-performing at detecting small water bodies. The permanent waters for G3WBM, GSWE, GIEMS-D3 and GLWD represent respectively: 2.76, 2.05, 3.28, and 3.04 million km(2). The transitory waters shows larger discrepancies: 0.48, 3.72, 10.39 and 8.81 million km(2).
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (from ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Sentinel and soon the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)) would be a good complementary information because they have a high nominal spatial resolution and are less sensitive to clouds than visible measurements. However, global SAR datasets are still not available due to difficulties in developing a retrieval scheme adequate at the global scale. In order to improve our estimates of global wetland extents at high resolution and over long-term records, three interim lines of action are proposed: (1) extend the temporal record of GIEMS-D3 to exploit the full time series of microwave observations (from 1978 to present), (2) develop an approach to fuse the GSWE and GIEMS-D3 datasets leveraging the strengths of both, and (3) prepare for the release of SAR global datasets.

AB Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) requires detailed insight into how the forest biomass is measured and distributed. Studies so far have estimated forest biomass stocks using rough assumptions and unreliable data. High-resolution data and robust methods are required to capture the spatial variability of forest biomass with sufficient precision. Here we aim to improve on previous approaches by using radar satellite ALOS PALSAR (25-m resolution) and optical Landsat-derived tree cover (30-m resolution) observations to estimate forest biomass stocks in Madagascar, for the years 2007-2010. The radar signal and in situ biomass were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.71) and the root mean square error was 30% (for biomass ranging from 0 to 500 t/ha). Using our map at 25-m resolution for the entire island of Madagascar, we estimated the total above-ground forest carbon for the four years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 to be 1.1173 +/- 0.0304, 1.1029 +/- 0.0303, 1.0916 +/- 0.0301 and 1.0773 +/- 0.0298 PgC, respectively. Carbon stocks were found to have decreased constantly over this period due to anthropogenic deforestation and likely also to climate change. The results are expected to serve as a more accurate benchmark for monitoring progress on REDD and to provide strong supports for current and future spaceborne missions such as ALOS-2, SAOCOM and BIOMASS.

AB Given the common trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions of current satellite sensors, spatial-temporal data fusion methods could be applied to produce fused remotely sensed data with synthetic fine spatial resolution (FR) and high repeat frequency. Such fused data are required to provide a comprehensive understanding of Earth's surface land cover dynamics. In this research, a novel Spatial-Temporal Fraction Map Fusion (STFMF) model is proposed to produce a series of fine-spatial-temporal-resolution land cover fraction maps by fusing coarse-spatial-fine-temporal and fine-spatial-coarse-temporal fraction maps, which may be generated from multi-scale remotely sensed images. The STFMF has two main stages. First, FR fraction change maps are generated using kernel ridge regression. Second, a FR fraction map for the date of prediction is predicted using a temporal-weighted fusion model. In comparison to two established spatial-temporal fusion methods of spatial-temporal super-resolution land cover mapping model and spatial-temporal image reflectance fusion model, STFMF holds the following characteristics and advantages: (1) it takes account of the mixed pixel problem in FR remotely sensed images; (2) it directly uses the fraction maps as input, which could be generated from a range of satellite images or other suitable data sources; (3) it focuses on the estimation of fraction changes happened through time and can predict the land cover change more accurately. Experiments using synthetic multi-scale fraction maps simulated from Google Earth images, as well as synthetic and real MODIS-Landsat images were undertaken to test the performance of the proposed STFMF approach against two benchmark spatial-temporal reflectance fusion methods: the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, STFMF was able to generate more accurate FR fraction maps and provide more spatial detail than ESTARFM and FSDAF, particularly in areas with substantial land cover changes. STFMF has great potential to produce accurate time-series fraction maps with fine-spatial-temporal-resolution that can support studies of land cover dynamics at the sub-pixel scale.& nbsp;

AB The xanthophyll cycle regulates the energy flow to photosynthetic reaction centres of plant leaves. Changes in the de-epoxidation state (DEPS) of xanthophyll cycle pigments can be observed as changes in the leaf absorption of light with wavelengths between 500 to 570 nm. These spectral changes can be a good remote sensing indicator of the photosynthetic efficiency, and are traditionally quantified with a two-band physiologically based optical index, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). In this paper, we present an extension of the plant leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect (Fluspect-CX) that reproduces the spectral changes in a wide band of green reflectance: a radiative transfer analogy to the PRI. The idea of Fluspect-CX is to use in vivo specific absorption coefficients for two extreme states of carotenoids, representing the two extremes of the xanthophyll de-epoxidation, and to describe the intermediate states as a linear mixture of these two states. The 'photochemical reflectance parameter' (C-x) quantifies the relative proportion of the two states. Fluspect-CX simulates leaf chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) excitation-emission matrices, as well as reflectance (R) and transmittance (7) spectra as a function of leaf structure, pigment contents and C. We describe the calibration of the model and test its performance using various experimental datasets. Furthermore, we retrieved C-x from optical measurements of various datasets. The retrieved C-x correlates well with xanthophyll DEPS (R-2 = 0.57), as well with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of fluorescence (R-2 = 0.78). The correlation with NPQ enabled us to incorporate Fluspect-CX in the model SCOPE to scale the processes to the canopy level. Introducing the dynamic green reflectance into a radiative transfer model provides new means to study chlorophyll fluorescence and PRI dynamics on leaf and canopy scales, which is crucial for the remote sensing.

AB Designing predictive models of global solar radiation can be an effective renewable energy feasibility studies approach to resolve future problems associated with the supply, reliability and dynamical stability of consumable energy demands generated by solar-powered electrical plants. In this paper we design and present a new approach to predict the monthly mean daily solar radiation (GSR) by constructing an extreme learning machine (ELM) model integrated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based satellite and the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data for solar rich cities: Brisbane and Townsville, Australia. A self-adaptive differential evolutionary ELM (i.e., SaDE-ELM) is proposed, utilizing a swarm-based ant colony optimization (ACO) feature selection to select the most important predictors for GSR, and the SaDE-ELM is then benchmarked with nine different data-driven models: a basic ELM, genetic programming (GP), online sequential ELM with fixed (OS-ELM) and varying (OSVARY-ELM) input sizes, and hybridized model including the particle swarm optimized-artificial neural network model (PSO-ANN), genetic algorithm optimized ANN (GA-ANN), PSO-support vector machine model (PSO-SVR), genetic algorithm optimized-SVR model (GA-SVR) and the SVR model optimized with grid search (GS-SVR). A comprehensive evaluation of the SaDE-ELM model is performed, considering key statistical metrics and diagnostic plots of measured and forecasted GSR. The results demonstrate excellent forecasting capability of the SaDE-ELM model in respect to the nine benchmark models. SaDE-ELM outperformed all comparative models for both tested study sites with a relative mean absolute and a root mean square error (RRMSE) of 2.6% and 2.3% (for Brisbane) and 0.8% and 0.7% (for Townsville), respectively. Majority of the forecasted errors are recorded in the lowest magnitude frequency band, to demonstrate the preciseness of the SaDE-ELM model. When tested for daily solar radiation forecasting using the ECMWF Reanalysis data for Brisbane study site, the performance resulted in an RRMSE approximate to 10.5%. Alternative models evaluated with the input data classified into El Nino, La Nifia and the positive and negative phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole moment (considering the impacts of synoptic-scale climate phenomenon), confirms the superiority of the SaDE-ELM model (with RRMSE 13%). A seasonal analysis of all developed models depicts SaDE-ELM as the preferred tool over the basic ELM and the hybridized version of ANN, SVR and GP model. In accordance with the results obtained through MODIS satellite and ECMWF Reanalysis data products, this study ascertains that the proposed SaDE-ELM model applied with ACO feature selection, integrated with satellite-derived data is adoptable as a qualified tool for monthly and daily GSR predictions and long-term solar energy feasibility study especially in data sparse and regional sites where a satellite footprint can be identified.

AB Understanding post-fire forest recovery is pivotal to the study of forest dynamics and global carbon cycle. Field based studies indicated a convex response of forest recovery rate to burn severity at the individual tree level, related with fire-induced tree mortality; however, these findings were constrained in spatial/temporal extents, while not detectable by traditional optical remote sensing studies, largely attributing to the contaminated effect from understory recovery. Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques (i.e., 1 m simultaneous airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR and 2 m satellite multi-spectral imagery) to separate canopy recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over large-scales. Our study was conducted in a mixed pine-oak forest in Long Island, NY, three years after a top-killing fire. Our studies remotely detected an initial increase and then decline of forest recovery rate to burn severity across the burned area, with a maximum canopy area-based recovery rate of 10% per year at moderate forest burn severity class. More intriguingly, such remotely detected convex relationships also held at species level, with pine trees being more resilient to high burn severity and having a higher maximum recovery rate (12% per year) than oak trees (4% per year). These results are one of the first quantitative evidences showing the effects of fire adaptive strategies on post-fire forest recovery, derived from relatively large spatial-temporal scales. Our study thus provides the methodological advance to link multi sensor remote sensing techniques to monitor forest dynamics in a spatially explicit manner over large-scales, with important implications for fire-related forest management and constraining/benchmarking fire effect schemes in ecological process models.

AB NASA's Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) is available at 500 m resolution since January 2012 with data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (SNPP). The retrieval algorithm, developed and implemented for routine global processing at NASA's Land Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), utilizes all high-quality, cloud-free, atmospheric-, terrain-, vegetation-, snow-, lunar-, and stray light-corrected radiances to estimate daily nighttime lights (NTL) and other intrinsic surface optical properties. Key algorithm enhancements include: (1) lunar irradiance modeling to resolve non-linear changes in phase and libration; (2) vector radiative transfer and lunar bidirectional surface anisotropic reflectance modeling to correct for atmospheric and BRDF effects; (3) geometric-optical and canopy radiative transfer modeling to account for seasonal variations in NTL; and (4) temporal gap-filling to reduce persistent data gaps. Extensive benchmark tests at representative spatial and temporal scales were conducted on the VNP46 time series record to characterize the uncertainties stemming from upstream data sources. Initial validation results are presented together with example case studies illustrating the scientific utility of the products. This includes an evaluation of temporal patterns of NTL dynamics associated with urbanization, socioeconomic variability, cultural characteristics, and displaced populations affected by conflict. Current and planned activities under the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Human Planet Initiative are aimed at evaluating the products at different geographic locations and time periods representing the full range of retrieval conditions.

In this paper, we derive a more fundamental and physically-based analytical radiative transfer model that yields a closed-form functional R(D) relationship for dry soils. Despite several simplifying assumptions, the proposed model shows good agreement with measured spectral reflectance (350-2500 nm) data of six soils covering a broad range of textures, colors, and mineralogies. The proposed S-shaped R(D) function resembles cumulative particle and pore size distributions as well as the soil water characteristic function. These analogies may potentially lead to new avenues for developing novel physical models for extracting important soil properties from remotely sensed reflectance data.

AB Invasive plant species can have high, self-reinforcing impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning that induce permanent changes of ecosystem properties. Therefore, early detection and timely management is required to alleviate ecosystem consequences of invasion. Integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data can deliver spatially explicit information on invader occurrence and ecosystem transformations even at early stages of invasion. However, relevant "model invaders" and well-characterized ecosystems need to be identified to both increase predictive power of invasion theory and prioritize management. In addition, there is still a knowledge gap regarding sensor-based approaches that are valid in space and time to assess the impact of invasive engineers on ecosystem functioning as well as the potential to induce regime shifts. In this study, occurrence and spatio-temporal impact of the invasive N-2-fixing shrub, Acacia longifolia, was assessed in a heterogeneous, Mediterranean dune ecosystem. The invader was mapped using vegetation indices derived from airborne hyperspectral images as well as airborne LiDAR data using Random Forest classification with a Sensitivity of 0.79, a Positive Predicted Value (PPV) of 0.81, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.77. Invaded sites varied between early stages with low cover, where isolated patches were detected, to heavily infested A. longifolia thickets. Analysis of historical images showed that the invader could establish under the harsh conditions of open dune plains, possibly triggered by human interference. The recently developed Near-Infrared Vegetation Index (NIRv), which is related to Gross Primary Production (GPP), increased linearly and significantly with increasing invader cover. This indicated a GPP-related regime shift induced by the invader, changing ecosystem productivity representative of open shrublands to that of forests. Such a shift could even be identified at early stages of invasion. Thus, the NIRv index may provide an appropriate sensor-based "model metric" to assess impacts of invasive engineers. This offers the opportunity to predict and anticipate regime shifts as a basis for timely management.

TI An assessment of the differences between spatial resolution and grid
   size for the SMAP enhanced soil moisture product over homogeneous sites
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE SMAP; Soil moisture; Spatial resolution; In situ
AB Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing typically involves a scanning antenna that makes measurements at irregularly spaced locations. These locations can change on a day to day basis. Soil moisture products derived from satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing are usually resampled to a fixed Earth grid that facilitates their use in applications. In many cases the grid size is finer than the actual spatial resolution of the observation, and often this difference is not well understood by the user. Here, this issue was examined for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced version of the passive-based soil moisture product, which has a grid size of 9-km and a nominal spatial resolution of 33-km. In situ observations from core validation sites were used to compute comparison metrics. For sites that satisfied the established reliability and scaling criteria, the impact of validating the 9-km grid product with in situ data collected over a 9-km versus a 33-km domain was very small for the sites studied (0.039 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root mean square difference for the 9-km case versus 0.037 m(3)/m(3) for the 33-km case). This result does not mean that the resolution of the product is 9-km but that for the conditions studied here the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over 9-km is a close approximation of the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over the 33-km resolution. The implication is that using the enhanced SMAP product at its grid resolution of 9-km should not introduce large errors in most applications.

AB National forest inventories routinely report estimates of parameters related to aboveground biomass (AGB), but sample sizes are often insufficient to satisfy precision guidelines and reporting requirements. Aerial photography, satellite imagery, and increasingly airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are all used as sources of auxiliary information to address this challenge.
   Combining inventory ground plot and ALS data requires that the data be co-registered to a common coordinate system. When measuring plots, inventory field crews typically obtain estimates of plot coordinates using global positioning system (GPS) receivers of varying degrees of accuracy. GPS-related errors in plot coordinates contribute to a sequence of adverse effects: (i) plot data are associated with erroneous ALS metrics, (ii) statistical models fit to such data may not adequately represent the true relationship between the plot data and the ALS metrics; and (iii) bias may be induced into model-assisted statistical estimators of population parameters.
   The primary objectives of the study focused on assessing the effects of GPS receiver inaccuracies on the estimated bias and precision of model-assisted estimators of mean AGB per unit area. The underlying motivation was to determine if the advantages of using ALS data as auxiliary information can be achieved apart from the substantial additional expense of purchasing GPS receivers with sub-meter accuracy. The analyses focused on comparing estimates based on three variations of plot coordinates obtained using field crew GPS receivers with maximum location errors on the order of 5-10 m to estimates based on plot coordinates obtained using survey grade GPS receivers with sub-meter accuracy. The study area was in north central Minnesota in the USA and is characterized by both upland and lowland forest areas interspersed with lakes and wetlands. The primary results were twofold. First, estimates of mean AGB per unit area based on plot coordinates obtained using the less accurate field crew GPS receivers varied little from estimates based on the much more accurate survey grade receivers. Second, standard errors were greater by as much as 20% when using field crew GPS receivers than when using survey grade GPS receivers. However, even though the ALS-assisted standard errors obtained using field crew GPS receivers were greater than when using survey grade receivers, they were still substantially smaller than satellite image-assisted standard errors. Thus, the operational conclusion is that avoiding the substantial additional cost of providing a survey grade GPS receiver for each of more than 100 field crews likely outweighs the adverse consequences of somewhat larger standard errors.

   integrating MODIS and AIRS/AMSU measurements

AB Longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is another major energy source received by the earth's surface apart from solar radiation. Its importance in regulating air temperature and balancing surface energy is enlarged especially under cloudy-sky conditions. Unfortunately, to date, a large number of efforts have been made to derive LWDR from space under only clear-sky conditions leading to difficulty in utilizing space-based LWDR in most models due to its spatio-temporal discontinuity. Currently, only a few studies are focused on LWDR estimation under cloudy skies, while their global application is still questionable. In this paper, an alternative strategy is proposed aiming to derive high-resolution (1 km) cloudy-sky LWDR by fusing collocated satellite multi-sensor measurements. The results show that the newly developed method works well and can derive LWDR at a better accuracy with RMSE < 27 W/m(2) and bias < 10 W/m(2) even under cloudy skies and at 1 km scales. By comparing the CCCM and SSF products of CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR over the Tibetan Plateau region, the new approach demonstrates its superiority in terms of accuracy, temporal variation and spatial distribution patterns of LWDR. Comprehensive comparison analysis also reveals that, except for the proposed product, the other four products (CERES, MERRA, ERA-interim and NCEP-CSFR) show a big difference from each other in the LWDR spatio-temporal distribution pattern and magnitude. The difference between these products can still be up to 60 W/m(2) even at the monthly scale, implying that large uncertainties exist in current LWDR estimations. More importantly, besides the higher accuracy of the proposed method, it provides unprecedented possibilities for jointly generating high-resolution global LWDR datasets by connecting the NASA's Earth Observing System-(EOS) mission (MODIS-AIRS/AMSU) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership-(NPP) mission (VIIRS-CrIS/ATMS). Meanwhile, the scheme proposed in this study also gives some clues towards multiple data fusing in the remote sensing community.

AB Two new remote sensing vegetation parameters derived from spaceborne spectrometers and simulated with a three dimensional radiative transfer model have been evaluated in terms of their prospects and drawbacks for the monitoring of dense vegetation canopies: (i) sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a unique signal emitted by photosynthetically active vegetation and (ii) the canopy scattering coefficient (CSC), a vegetation parameter derived along with the directional area scattering factor (DASF) and expected to be particularly sensitive to leaf optical properties. Here, we present the first global data set of DASF/CSC and examine the potential of CSC and SIF for providing complementary information on the controversially discussed vegetation seasonality in Amazon forests. A comparison between near-infrared SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) (overpass time in the morning and noon, respectively) reveals the response of SIF to instantaneous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Large-scale seasonal swings of GOME-2 SIF amount up to 21% (regarding the annual maximum) and peak in October and around February, while 000-2 SIF peaks in February. However, both time series agree very well if SIF is normalized by overpass time and wavelength. We further examine anistropic reflectance characteristics with the finding that the hot spot effect significantly impacts observed GOME-2 SIF values. On the contrary, our sensitivity analysis suggests that CSC is highly independent of sun-sensor geometry as well as atmospheric effects. The slight annual variability of CSC (3%) shows no clear seasonal cycle, while a relatively high spatial standard deviation points to a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in our study domain within the central Amazon Basin.

AB Near real-time satellite-derived flood maps are invaluable to river forecasters and decision-makers for disaster monitoring and relief efforts. With support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, flood detection software has been developed using Suomi-NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagery to automatically generate near real-time flood maps for National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFC) in the USA. The software, which is called VIIRS NOAA GMU Flood Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as VNG Flood V1.0), consists of a series of algorithms that include water detection, cloud shadow removal, terrain shadow removal, minor flood detection, water fraction retrieval, and floodwater determination. The software is designed for flood detection in any land region between 80 degrees S and 80 degrees N, and it has been running routinely with direct broadcast SNPP/VIIRS data at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW/SSEC) and the Geographic Information Network of Alaska at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF/GINA) since 2014. Near real-time flood maps are distributed via the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM), reviewed by river forecasters in AWIPS-II (the second generation of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) and applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from operational forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. The software capability has also been extended to areas outside of the USA via a case-driven mode to detect major floods all over the world. Offline evaluation efforts include the visual inspection of over 10,000 VIIRS false-color composite images, an inter-comparison with MODIS automatic flood products and a quantitative validation using Landsat imagery. The steady performance from the 3-year routine process and the promising evaluation results indicate that VNG Flood V1.0 has a high feasibility for flood detection at the product level.

AB Drought is a globally relevant hazard, and while various studies have investigated the relationship between droughts and different climate and ecosystem variables, they are often not global or they do not make use of direct soil moisture observations. Here we use satellite derived soil moisture observations from the Climate Change Initiative of the European Space Agency to quantify the relation between soil moisture drought and temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation during the peak of the growing season. Furthermore, we follow the temporal evolution of the buildup and recovery surrounding the drought peak. We find that in many regions longer-term precipitation deficits are the driving factors of large negative soil moisture anomalies. At the peak of the dry period large anomalies are found for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, while vegetation indices often show a delayed response. This delay is likely related to the limited information contained in the remotely sensed soil moisture signal on the deeper root zone, thus underestimating the available soil moisture for plants. Anomalies over grasslands are generally larger than over forests, likely linked to the ability of trees to better access water at deeper depths, and to save water during dry conditions. These results illustrate the relevance of remote-sensing based soil moisture as a new independent observation for studying land-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics at the global scale.

AB Criteria for discriminating between radar signatures of oil films and biogenic slicks visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface as dark patches are critically reviewed. We question the often claimed high success rate of oil spill detection algorithms using single-polarization SARs because the SAR images used to train these algorithms are based usually on subjective interpretation and are not validated by on-site inspections or multi-sensor measurements carried out from oil pollution surveillance planes. Furthermore, we doubt that polarimetric parameters derived from fully-polarimetric SAR data, like entropy, anisotropy, and mean scattering angle, are beneficial for discriminating between mineral oil films and biogenic slicks. We challenge the often made claim that another scattering mechanism than Bragg scattering applies for radar backscattering from mineral oil films than from biogenic slicks. This view is supported by data acquired by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) of NASA/JPL, which operates at L-band and has an extremely low noise floor. We suspect that opposing results obtained from previous analyses of spacebome polarimetric SAR data are caused by the high noise floors of the spacebome SARs. However, most of the analyzed spacebome polarimetric data were not acquired at L-band, but at C-and X-band. On the other hand, differences in the statistical behavior of the radar backscattering could be real due to the fact that, other than biogenic surface films, mineral oil films, can form multi-layers, whose thickness can vary within an oil patch. Radar back scattering from emulsion layers can also fluctuate due to variations of the oil/water mixture ratio. These effects could cause an increase of the standard deviation (STD) of the co-polarized phase difference (CPD) for scattering at mineral oil films and emulsions. In the special case of thick oil layers or oil/water emulsion layers, where the radar is sensitive to the dielectric constant of the oil, discrimination becomes possible due the fact that Bragg scattering depends on the dielectric constant of the scattering medium.

AB This study evaluates the performance of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) AOD retrieval algorithms, including Dark Target (DT) aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 3 and 10 km spatial resolutions, Deep Blue (DB) AOD at 10 km, and the merged DT-DB AOD at 10 km across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), South Asia. A total of 14,736 collocated Aqua MODIS C6 AOD at 550 nm were evaluated against AOD from six AERONET stations over IGP, measured during the satellite overpass (+/- 1 h) from 2006 to 2015. The effects of aerosol heterogeneity, in terms of both aerosol loading and the aerosol type, on the uncertainty of the satellite-borne AOD retrieval were examined. The DT algorithm at both resolutions (3 km and 10 km) overestimated the AOD by 14-25%, with only 51.37-61.29% of the retrievals falling within the expected error (EE). The DT 3 km algorithm underestimates the surface reflectance in comparison to the DT 10 km, with the latter outperforming the former both in terms of number of collocations and retrieval accuracy, especially over urban areas. The DB 10 km was able to retrieve AOD over both arid/desert regions and vegetated surfaces even under low aerosol loading conditions. Yet, its performance was still poor, with retrieval accuracy of 53.76%, low RMSE (0.214), and generally underestimated AOD across the IGP. The merged DT-DB AOD product was mostly dominated by DT retrievals (73%-100%), except over bright land surfaces and 56.03% of the merged DT-DB retrievals fell within the EE. The retrieval accuracy of MODIS C6 products was found to be strongly dependent on the estimated surface reflectance and the aerosol type. Across IGP, DB predicted the surface reflectance better while DT at both resolutions overestimated the surface reflectance at varying extent. For high aerosol loading conditions with varying aerosol size, retrieval accuracy of DT 10 km poses lower sensitivity while DT at 3 km exhibits larger uncertainty in estimating surface reflectance. In contrast, DB 10 km shows greater bias that depends on the aerosol size. For very high aerosol loading conditions, dominated by fine or mixed aerosols, all the algorithms have errors in the aerosol model. The DT 10 km, DB 10 km and the merged AOD performed almost equally within the threshold level while the DT 3 km showed the poorest performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and RMSE. We conclude that across IGP, DB 10 km AOD has the highest accuracy in retrieving fine mode aerosols while DT 10 km AOD has almost identical accuracy in retrieving varying aerosol types. For coarse dominated aerosols, when the dissimilarity between DT and DB remains highest, the merged AOD is found to have higher accuracy in retrieving AOD across IGP.

AB Researchers have been attending increasingly to impervious surface dynamics to better understand the urbanization process and its impacts on urban environments. Previously, numerous studies have only estimated and mapped impervious surface dynamics at annual or decadal time scales. It is challenging to estimate impervious surface dynamics at a finer time scale, such as on a monthly scale, while using a single source of medium spatial resolution satellite imagery. However, urban infrastructure construction could cause changes in impervious surfaces in a short period of time. This paper aimed at developing a new methodology for evaluating monthly impervious surface dynamics by fusing Landsat and MODIS time series. The Pearl River Delta in China, is located in a humid subtropical region and was selected as the study area due to its dramatic urbanization in the past three decades. Available Landsat images with cloud cover < 90%, 7-Day MODIS NDVI 250 m smooth time series, and daily MODIS LST 1000 m time series from 2000 to 2015 were downloaded. These data were used to develop temporal features of land covers (i.e., monthly Landsat NDVI and LST time series) and to monitor impervious surface dynamics using semi-supervised time series fuzzy clustering method. The results showed the effectiveness of temporal features in differentiating land covers. Additionally, the average overall classification accuracy yielded reasonable accuracies (up to 89.36%). The proposed methodology has illustrated numerous, considerable advantages over previous methods. It has offered consistent maps of impervious surfaces on a monthly time scale as well as enhanced distinguishability of land covers with similar spectral characteristics. This study can be utilized to establish relationships between urban expansion, climate change, urban environment, population, and other socio-economic variables on a monthly basis. The study is also crucial for predicting the timing, duration, and density of ecological change for increased impervious surfaces.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing is now an established tool to determine shallow water properties over large areas, usually by inverting a semi-analytical model of water reflectance. However, various sources of error may make the observed subsurface remote-sensing reflectance deviate from the model, resulting in an increased retrieval error when inverting the model based on classical least-squares fitting. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic forward model of shallow water reflectance variability that describes two of the main sources of error, namely, (1) the environmental noise that includes every source of above-water variability (e.g., sensor noise and rough water surface), and (2) the potentially complex inherent spectral variability of each benthic class through their associated spectral covariance matrix. Based on this probabilistic model, we derive two inversion approaches, namely, MILE (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise) and MILEBI (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise and Bottom Intra-class variability) that utilize the information contained in the proposed covariance matrices to further constrain the inversion while allowing the observation to differ from the model in the less reliable wavebands. In this paper, MILE and MILEBI are compared with the widely used least-squares (LS) criterion in terms of depth, water clarity and benthic cover retrievals. For these three approaches, we also assess the influence of constraining bottom mixture coefficients to sum to one on estimation results.
   The results show that the proposed probabilistic model is a valuable tool to investigate the influence of bottom intra-class variability on subsurface reflectance, e.g., as a function of optical depth or environmental noise. As expected, this influence is critical in very optically shallow waters, and decreases with increasing optical depth. The inversion results obtained from synthetic and airborne data of Quiberon Peninsula, France, show that MILE and MILEBI generally provide better performances than LS. For example, in the case of airborne data with depth ranging from 0.44 to 12.00 m, the bathymetry estimation error decreases by about 32% when using MILE and MILEBI instead of LS. Estimated maps of bottom cover are also more consistent when derived using sum-to-one constrained versions of MILE and MILEBI. MILE is shown to be a simple but powerful method to map simple benthic habitats with negligible influence of infra-class variability. Alternatively, MILEBI is to be preferred if this variability cannot be neglected, since taking bottom covariance matrices into account concurrently with mean reflectance spectra may help the bottom discrimination, e.g., in the presence of overlapping classes. This study thus shows that taking potential sources of error into account through appropriate para-meterizations of spectral covariance may be critical to improve the remote sensing of shallow waters, hence making MILE and MILEBI interesting alternatives to LS.

AB Past observations of sea ice thickness in the Eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) have generally been restricted to drill-hole measurements at a few local sites on landfast ice. Here we use data from the laser altimeter ICESat and the radar altimeter Cryosat-2 to present a 14-year record (2003-2016) of high-resolution and spatially extensive ice thickness observations for the ECA and identify 12 sub-regions with distinct patterns. The mean sea ice growth rate within the seasonally ice-covered ECA from November to April is 23 cm mo(-1) (565 km(3) mo(-1)), with the fastest increase in thickness occurring through strong ice convergence and deformation in eastern Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin. Our results demonstrate characteristically asymmetrical distributions of sea ice thickness in both Hudson Bay and Baffin Bay, but in opposing directions. In Hudson Bay the spring ice cover is 40 cm thicker in the eastern region compared to the northwestern region, whereas in Baffin Bay the ice is 20 cm thicker in the western half of the bay compared to the eastern half. In Hudson Bay we find that years with strong and positive ice drift vorticity (i.e. cyclonic and convergent conditions) correlate with increasingly asymmetrical sea ice covers, with the level of west-east asymmetry varying from 2 to 11 cm per 100 km. However, in Baffin Bay the ice drift vorticity is typically negative (i.e. anticyclonic and divergent) with no obvious link to the asymmetry of the spring ice cover. Finally, we estimate that large interannual variations in spring sea ice volume within the ECA lead to +/- 15% variations in the volume of freshwater available at the ocean surface during summer.

AB Quantifying freeze/thaw status of the landscape (soils and vegetation) is important for identifying the availability of liquid water in the high latitudes to support ecosystem processes controlling carbon sequestration and release. A better understanding of the seasonal transition of high latitude landscapes between frozen and thawed states is therefore critical for predicting carbon cycle feedbacks in a warming climate. However, observations of freeze/ thaw state are not at sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to observe fast (similar to days-weeks) transitions in highly heterogeneous regions. Here, we present new evidence that reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals captured by the SMAP radar receiver have the potential to quantify changes in high-latitude soil freeze/thaw state at kilometer-scale resolution. Boreal wetland observations indicate a similar to 10 dB seasonal difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in agreement with simulations from a simple reflectivity model. Our analysis indicates that ground-reflected GNSS signals as a form of L-band bistatic radar could be a robust observable to quantify soil freeze/thaw state at process-relevant scales. We describe the caveats and potential limitations of this approach, and highlight areas for continuing research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates changes in Ku-, X- and C-band microwave backscatter, co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios, to changes in in-situ measured snow thermophysical properties, driven by surface radiation measurements, during a 7-day transition from late winter to pre-early melt on a highly saline snow cover on smooth first-year ice. A surface-based Ku-, X- and C-band microwave scatterometer system is used near coincident with in-situ thermophysical snow measurements. A frequency-dependent penetration depth model is utilized to simulate diverse variations in Ku-, X- and C-band penetration during fluctuating snow thermophysical and atmospheric conditions. These results helped improve the interpretation of observed changes in Ku-, X- and C-band backscatter. Overall, dielectric loss associated with presence of brine throughout the snow volume, is observed to be the governing factor affecting microwave penetration. Our results indicate significant differences in observed microwave backscatter and derived co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios, for all three frequencies during the transition from cold late winter phase to warm pre-early melt onset phase. C-band demonstrates the greatest increase in backscatter and co-pol ratios, followed by X- and Ku-bands. The dual-frequency ratio combinations clearly demonstrate their ability to separate sensitivities in frequencies by characterizing changes in bacicscatter during the 7-day transition. Our results indicate strong direct influence of downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation on snow brine volume and dielectric properties, which drives changes to Ku-, X- and C-band microwave bacicscatter and its associated co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios. Our results demonstrate the ability of an observational multi-frequency active microwave approach to illustrate frequency- ,polarization-and incidence angle-dependent changes in microwave backscatter from snow covers on first-year ice, at varying atmospheric and snow thermophysical conditions.

AB Leaf area index estimates in dense evergreen tropical moist forest almost exclusively rest on indirect methods most of which being of limited accuracy or spatial resolution. In this study we examine the potential of full waveform Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) to derive accurate spatially explicit estimates of Plant Area Index (PAI).
   A discrete representation of the forest canopy is introduced in the form of a 3D voxelized space. For each voxel (elementary volume, typically one cubic m) a first estimate of local transmittance of vegetation is computed as the ratio of the sum of energy exiting a voxel to the sum of energy entering the same voxel. A spatially hierarchical model is subsequently applied to refine estimates of individual voxel transmittance. Plant area density (PAD) profiles are then computed from the local transmittance values by applying Beer Lambert's turbid medium approximation. PAI values are obtained from vertical integration of PAD profiles. The model is shown to be robust to low sampling intensity and high occlusion rates.
   We further compared simulated values of gap fraction obtained by ray tracing for 5 angular sectors with in situ LAI2200 measurements taken at 135 positions in a 05 ha forest plot located in the center of the scene. The overall patterns of simulated and measured values (average value per inclination and pattern of variation along a 70 m transect line) were highly consistent. A slight but systematic discrepancy was observed along the inclination gradient, gap fractions derived from ray tracing in the voxelized scene being slightly lower than the measured values. This difference might be the consequence of multiple reflections which have been found to bias gap fractions estimates produced by LAI2200.
   PAI estimates derived from LAI2200 measurements (either simulated 6.8 or observed 5.9) are much lower than the PAI derived from vertical integration of local PAD (13.6). This large difference reflects the fact that distribution of foliage is strongly spatially structured and that this structural information is not properly accounted for in PAI estimates derived from mean gap fraction per elevation angle. After adjusting local transmittance to match mean LAI 2200 profiles the PAI at plot level was found to be 13.2 m(2).m(-2).
   We conclude that Aerial Laser Scanning can produce accurate maps of Plant Area Index over large areas with unmatched efficacy, accuracy and ease. This should be of major relevance for many forest ecological studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI PhenoRice: A method for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal

AB Agricultural monitoring systems require spatio-temporal information on widely cultivated staple crops like rice. More emphasis has been made on area estimation and crop detection than on the temporal aspects of crop cultivation, but seasonal and temporal information such as i) crop duration, ii) date of crop establishment and iii) cropping intensity are as important as area for understanding crop production. Rice cropping systems are diverse because genetic, environmental and management factors (G x E x M combinations) influence the spatio-temporal patterns of cultivation.
   We present a rule based algorithm called PhenoRice for automatic extraction of temporal information on the rice crop using moderate resolution hypertemporal optical imagery from MODIS. Performance of PhenoRice against spatially and temporally explicit reference information was tested in three diverse sites: rice-fallow (Italy), rice-other crop (India) and rice-rice (Philippines) systems.
   Regional product accuracy assessments showed that PhenoRice made a conservative, spatially representative and robust detection of rice cultivation in all sites (r(2) between 0.75 and 0.92) and crop establishment dates were in close agreement with the reference data (r(2) = 0.98, Mean Error = 4.07 days, Mean Absolute Error = 9.95 days, p < 0.01). Variability in algorithm performance in different conditions in each site (irrigated vs rainfed, direct seeding vs transplanting, fragmented vs clustered rice landscapes and the impact of cloud contamination) was analysed and discussed. Analysis of the maps revealed that cropping intensity and season length per site matched well with local information on agro-practices and cultivated varieties. The results show that PhenoRice is robust for deriving essential temporal descriptions of rice systems in both temperate and tropical regions at a level of spatial and temporal detail that is suitable for regional crop monitoring on a seasonal basis.

AB The rapid and timely evaluation of urban environmental change is highly important for understanding urban sustainability in China. However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The invasive Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) has long been targeted for removal by land managers in the western United States. Biocontrol of the non-native tamarisk started in 2001 by introducing the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) to the riparian ecosystems. Since then, the beetles quickly established and substantial tamarisk defoliation was subsequently observed along river corridors in the western states. The ability to monitor and track the patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk defoliation across space and time is key to understand its impact on ecosystem functioning and processes. In the present study, spatiotemporal patterns of tamarisk defoliation caused by the subtropical tamarisk leaf beetle (D. sublineata) were successfully detected using a classification based method along the Lower Rio Grande in West Texas from 2009 to 2014. Our results indicated that the subtropical beetle species can sustain a dispersal rate of approximately 102 km yr(-1) during the first year after release. Tamarisk abundance was the most important factor in directing beetle dispersal. We also found that the beetles preferred to forage within dense, connected tamarisk stands along wide sections of the riparian river corridors. These new findings of our study will help inform the land managers of the possible outcomes of tamarisk biocontrol to make effective management plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimates of the quality and quantity of remnant habitats is critical for planning management activities for the conservation of threatened species. Although habitat quality usually is understood from a multidimensional niche space approach, the availability of foraging substrates can be a suitable and more proximate index of habitat quality for species with specialized habitat requirements, like woodpeckers that feed almost exclusively on larvae of wood-boring beetles in the trunks and branches of infested trees. Recent approaches use simple mathematical algorithms on spectral bands called Vegetation Indices (VI) to identify infestations, providing a new opportunity to assess habitat quality for woodpeckers. In this paper, we tested the ability of 102 VI to estimate tree attributes explaining habitat quality for Magellanic woodpeckers for its usage as a reliable foraging habitat quality estimator. We hypothesized that space use of Magellanic woodpeckers is positively associated with the spatial distribution of decayed trees in the landscape. We developed a methodological framework based on high-resolution, multispectral imagery with three basic steps. First, we mapped individual Nothofagus trees based on estimates of species composition from a supervised classification procedure, VI estimates and image segmentation. Second, we selected the best VI predicting the tree quality for Magellanic woodpeckers. Third, we tested these habitat quality predictors, the species composition and tree age, by using two Synoptic Models of Space Use (SMSU) of Magellanic woodpeckers based on very high-frequency (VHF) radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data.
   Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) showed that the VI that best predicted habitat quality at the tree-scale was the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI, computed as [Red-Blue]/Red-edge), included in almost all the most parsimonious models. The most parsimonious SMSU included only PSRI as an independent covariate, with a strong positive relation. Although coefficient differences were found between telemetry data (VHF vs. GPS data) both showed a positive overall response. Consequently, Red-edge based PSRI can be considered a reliable estimator of tree-scale foraging habitat quality at landscape extents for future research and management activities including Magellanic woodpeckers living on heterogeneous Nothofagus forests.

AB Since the late 1990s, remotely sensed night-time lights (NTL) satellite imagery has been shown to correlate with socioeconomic parameters including urbanization, economic activity, and population. More recent research demonstrates that multitemporal NTL data can serve as a reliable proxy for change over time in these variables whether they are increasing or decreasing. Time series analysis of Nn. data is especially valuable for detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic dynamics in countries and subnational regions where reliable official statistics may be lacking. Until 2012, multitemporal NTL imagery came primarily from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS), for which digital imagery is available from 1992 to 2013. In October 2011, the launch of NASA/NOAA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, whose Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor has a Day/Night Band (DNB) specifically designed for capturing radiance from the Earth at night, marked the start of a new era in NTL data collection and applications. In light of these advances, this paper reviews progress in using multitemporal DMSP-OLS and VIIRS imagery to analyze urbanization, economic, and population dynamics across a range of geographic scales. An overview of data corrections and processing for comparison of multitemporal NTL imagery is provided, followed by a meta-analysis and integrative synthesis of these studies. Figures are included that visualize the capabilities of DMSP-OLS and VIIRS to capture socioeconomic change in the post-Soviet Russian Far East and war-torn Syria, respectively. Finally, future directions for NTL research are suggested, particularly in the areas of determining the fundamental causes of observed light and in leveraging VIIRS' superior sensitivity and spatial and radiometric resolution.

AB Due to its high spectral and spatial resolutions, airborne hyperspectral imaging has great potential for becoming a powerful large-scale monitoring tool for coral reef communities. In recent years, methods based on radiative transfer model inversion have shown promising results for extracting information about seabed type, bottom depth and water constituents from hyperspectral imagery. However, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to low water-leaving radiance combined with environmental variability make it very difficult to design an optimal processing algorithm. Here, we selected a state-of-the-art, forward semi-analytical model in which we included a mixing model of four seabed albedo, namely sand, corals, algae and seagrass. The purpose of this paper was then to compare different setups of the inversion scheme, each one having its own theoretical strengths and weaknesses regarding the different confounding factors. Six inversion setups were implemented, corresponding to the combinations between (i) three cost functions: least square (LS), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and least square on spectral derivative (LSD), and (ii) two physical constraints imposed on the seabed type retrieval: abundance sum-to-one constraint (ASC) and a relaxed version (RASC). Performances of bathymetry and seabed type retrieval were evaluated on hyperspectral data acquired in a coral reef environment in Reunion Island. Our results showed that the accuracy and robustness of the bathymetric estimation were greatly influenced by the choice of the inversion setup. RASC-LSD produced the overall best performances even if SAM-based inversion setups showed particularly low error dispersion with respect to Lidar derived bathymetry. RASC-LSD also produced the most accurate results in terms of spatial coverage of benthic components on a very shallow area (inner part of a fringing reef). The results on our study areas clearly highlighted the interest of relaxing the ASC when the bottom depth is shallow. In deeper areas, ASC versions of LS- and LSD-based inversion setups produced the best seabed type mapping results. Only broad seabed types could be retrieved in areas deeper than 10 m.

AB This paper reviews four commonly-used microwave radiative transfer models that take different electromagnetic approaches to simulate snow brightness temperature (T-B): the Dense Media Radiative Transfer - Multi-Layer model (DMRT-ML), the Dense Media Radiative Transfer - Quasi-Crystalline Approximation Mie scattering of Sticky spheres (DMRT-QMS), the Helsinki University of Technology n-Layers model (HUT-nlayers) and the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS). Using the same extensively measured physical snow pack properties, we compared the simulated T-B at 11, 19 and 37 GHz from these four models. The analysis focuses on the impact of using different types of measured snow microstructure metrics in the simulations. In addition to density, snow microstructure is defined for each snow layer by grain optical diameter (Do) and stickiness for DMRT-ML and DMRT-QMS, mean grain geometrical maximum extent (Dmax) for HUT n-layers and the exponential correlation length for MEMLS. These metrics were derived from either in-situ measurements of snow specific surface area (SSA) or macrophotos of grain sizes (D-max), assuming non-sticky spheres for the DMRT models. Simulated T-B sensitivity analysis using the same inputs shows relatively consistent T-B behavior as a function of Do and density variations for the vertical polarization (maximum deviation of 18 K and 27 K, respectively), while some divergences appear in simulated variations for the polarization ratio (PR). Comparisons with ground based radiometric measurements show that the simulations based on snow SSA measurements have to be scaled with a model-specific factor of Do in order to minimize the root mean square error (RMSE) between measured and simulated T-B. Results using in-situ grain size measurements (SSA or D-max, depending on the model) give a mean T-B RMSE (19 and 37 GHz) of the order of 16-26 K, which is similar for all models when the snow microstructure metrics are scaled. However, the MEMLS model converges to better results when driven by the correlation length estimated from in-situ SSA measurements rather than D-max measurements. On a practical level, this paper shows that the SSA parameter, a snow property that is easy to retrieve in-situ, appears to be the most relevant parameter for characterizing snow microstructure, despite the need for a scaling factor.

AB Wildfire episodes are becoming more rampant with global warming and climate change. Every year it causes lot of damage in terms of burnt acres and also impacts the air quality and climate through emission of various trace greenhouse gases. As emissions from large fires increase with time, it is essential to monitor the extent and spatial distribution of such changes that can have both short term and long-term implications in terms of human health and feedback on global radiative forcing. In this paper we have used the vertical profile distributions of some of the key trace gases, from AQUA-AIRS sensor to better understand the impact of wildfires in terms of magnitude, spatial and seasonal distribution. Our study shows the impact of season on fire emission in the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere and also highlights areas in the continental United States (CONUS) where different trace gas emissions are more preponderant. Overall it successfully demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based sensors for regular monitoring of fire related trace gas emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Based on airborne LIDAR data on canopy morphology and height of Amazon forest trees, we developed allometric models to estimate dry biomass stored in the boles of dominant and co-dominant individuals and compared these results with those from equations based on traditional variables such as diameter at breast height (DBH). The database consisted of 142 trees of interest for logging in a forest under management for timber in Brazil's state of Acre. The trees chosen for study were selected through proportional sampling by diameter class (ranging from 45 to 165 cm DBH) in order to properly represent the dominant and co-dominant tree populations with diameters appropriate for harvest. Subsequent to LIDAR profiling of these trees, they were felled, subjected to a battery of dimensional measurements and sampled for wood-density determination. A set of models was generated, followed by model selection and identity testing in order to compare groups of basic wood density (low, medium and high). The morphometric variables of the crown had high explanatory power for bole biomass independent of whether the allometric equations included DBH. When calculating bole biomass with equations that include basic wood density, the best estimate is obtained using variables for both DBH and crown morphology. To obtain an allometric equation that encompasses species in all three classes of basic density, one should either use only independent variables representing crown dimensions or complement these with variables for basic density (BD) and total height (Ht). The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ground-based measurements to calibrate biomass models that include only LIDAR-based variables, allowing much larger areas to be surveyed with reasonable accuracy. The present study is designed to produce data needed for forest management, but the methods developed here can be adapted to studies aimed at reducing the uncertainty in biomass estimates of whole forests (not just harvestable trees) for use in quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and degradation.

AB Wildfire risk is increasing in the context of global change, and the need for accurate fuel model maps in broader areas is becoming urgent to manage large wildfires. Among remote sensing technologies, Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) is extremely useful for fuel mapping as it provides 3D information on vegetation distribution. A cost-effective methodology to obtain high-resolution fuel model maps in large forest areas from ALS data (1 pulse/m(2)) and Landsat-8 OLI images is presented. A two-phase approach was used to generate the fuel model maps: i) ad-hoc vegetation classification derived from ALS and Landsat-8 OLI, and ii) fuel model assignment based on fuel complex structure from a limited number of ALS-derived metrics: fractional canopy cover, fuel height, and canopy relief ratio. Fuel model maps for the Canary Islands (Spain) were generated for two fuel classification systems, standard Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (NFFL) and specific Canarian fuel models (CIFM), at 25 m resolution (3678 km(2)) according to decision rules based on ALS-derived metrics developed for each vegetation type. Fieldwork was used to validate the fuel model maps, obtaining an overall accuracy of 82% (kappa = 0.777) and 70% (kappa = 0.679) for the standard NFFL and CIFM fuel models respectively. Discrimination between fuel models associated to forests with and without understory was satisfactory, showing higher errors due to species composition classification rather than to ALS-derived fuel structure. Errors due to underestimation of ALS-derived fuel cover and height were more evident in mixed grassland and shrubland fuels. Results demonstrated the potential of combining imagery and ALS for fuel model mapping at a large scale from existing data sources, even with low laser pulse density and temporarily mismatched data sets. The proposed methodology may be applied for fuel mapping in other large areas provided that ALS information is available and that fuel model definition has explicit structure characteristics allowing decision rules based on ALS data. Once algorithms are defined for fuel model assignment, the low number of ALS-derived metrics and the semi-automated processing ensures that fuel model maps can be easily updated as new data sources become available providing managers with useful spatial information in large areas.

AB The Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor provided the longest single mission terrestrial remote sensing data record but temporally sparse station keeping maneuvers meant that the Landsat 5 orbit changed over the 27 year mission life. Long-term Landsat 5 TM reflectance inconsistencies may be introduced by orbit change induced' solar zenith variations combined with surface reflectance anisotropy, commonly described by the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This study quantifies the local overpass time and observed solar zenith angle changes for all the Landsat 5 TM images available at two latitudinally separated locations along the same north-south Landsat path (27) in Minnesota (row 26) and Texas (row 42). Over the 27 years the Landsat 5 orbit changed by nearly 1 h and resulted in changes in the Landsat 5 observed solar zenith angle of >10 degrees. The Landsat 5 orbit was relatively stable from 1984 to 1994 and from 2007 to 2011, but changed rapidly from 1995 to 2000, and from 2003 to 2007. Rather than directly examine Landsat 5 TM reflectance time series a modelling approach was used. This was necessary because unambiguous separation of orbit change induced Landsat reflectance variations from other temporal variations is non-trivial. The impact of Landsat 5 orbit induced observed solar zenith angle variations on the red and near-infrared reflectance and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were modelled with respect to different Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF land cover types. Synthetic nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) for the Landsat 5 TM observed and a modelled reference year 2011 solar zenith were compared over the 27 years of acquisitions. Ordinary leastsquares linear regression fits of the NBAR difference values as a function of the acquisition date indicated an increasing trend in red and near-infrared NEAR and a decreasing trend in NDVI NBAR due to orbit changes. The trends are statistically significant but small, no more than 0.0006 NDVI/year. Comparison of certain years of Landsat 5 data may result in significant reflectance and NDVI differences due only to Landsat 5 orbit changes and cause spurious detection of "browning" vegetation events and underestimation of greening trends. The greatest differences will occur when 1995 Landsat 5 TM data are compared with 2007 to 2011 data; NDVI values could be up to 0.11 greater in 1995 than in 2011 for anisotropic land cover types and up to 0.05 greater for average CONUS land cover types. A smaller number of Landsat 5 TM images were also examined and provide support for the modelled based findings. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research findings for Landsat 5 TM time series analyses. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Taking advantage of the improved radiometric resolution of Landsat-8 OLI which, unlike previous Landsat sensors, does not saturate over snow, the progress of fire recovery progress at the landscape scale (<100 m) is examined. High quality Landsat-8 albedo retrievals can now capture the true reflective and layered character of snow cover over a full range of land surface conditions and vegetation densities. This new capability particularly improves the assessment of post-fire vegetation dynamics across low- to high-burn severity gradients in Arctic and boreal regions in the early spring, when the albedos during recovery show the greatest variation. We use 30 m resolution Landsat-8 surface reflectances with concurrent coarser resolution (500 m) MODIS high quality full inversion surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) products to produce higher resolution values of surface albedo. The high resolution full expression shortwave blue sky albedo product performs well with an overall RMSE of 0.0267 between tower and satellite measures under both snow-free and snow-covered conditions. While the importance of post-fire albedo recovery can be discerned from the MODIS albedo product at regional and global scales, our study addresses the particular importance of early spring post-fire albedo recovery at the landscape scale by considering the significant spatial heterogeneity of burn severity, and the impact of snow on the early spring albedo of various vegetation recovery types. We found that variations in early spring albedo within a single MODIS gridded pixel can be larger than 0.6. Since the frequency and severity of wildfires in Arctic and boreal systems is expected to increase in the coming decades, the dynamics of albedo in response to these rapid surface changes will increasingly impact the energy balance and contribute to other climate processes and physical feedback mechanisms. Surface radiation products derived from Landsat-8 data will thus play an important role in characterizing the carbon cycle and ecosystem processes of high latitude systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB To evaluate and improve the quality of coarse-pixel land surface albedo products, validation with ground measurements of albedo is crucial over the spatially and temporally heterogeneous land surface. The performance of albedo validation depends on the quality of ground-based albedo measurements at a corresponding coarse pixel scale, which can be conceptualized as the "truth" value of albedo at coarse-pixel scale. In this paper, a sampling strategy based on multiple nodes using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, WSN-based albedo observation, is proposed. The WSN nodes are distributed in an optimal layout determined by a sequential selection method based on the representativeness of each sensor. The WSN dataset in this study includes 6 nodes. A method of weighting is used to upscale WSN node albedo to a coarse-pixel scale. The weights for each node are calculated with the ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression method. Compared with the multiple scale validation strategy, the dataset of WSN albedo "truth" at the coarse-pixel scale reveals a good quality both in stability and continuity. Application of this strategy is exemplified by validation of the MODIS 1 km albedo product. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The southwest tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO) (55 degrees E-65 degrees E, 5 degrees S-12 degrees S) features a seasonal thermocline ridge that has been shown to have important teleconnections with the Asian monsoon. Although several past studies have highlighted the lack of SWTIO salinity variability, vertical stratification may be sufficient to generate a regional barrier layer, a tropical phenomenon found throughout the Indian Ocean with the ability to affect local air-sea interactions. New global, remotely sensed sea surface salinity (SSS) obtained from the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA's Aquarius satellites gives us reason to revisit the region to see if these datasets can yield new information on salinity's role in SWTIO variability. We use Argo floats data to calculate mixed layer depth (MLD), isothermal layer depth (ILD), and barrier layer thickness (BLT = ILD MLD). We also use a novel approach to estimate satellite-derived BLT by replacing the Argo SSS estimate with the SMOS and Aquarius "skin" measurement to then recalculate the MLD and thus obtain a different BLT estimate. We find that while BLT estimates from all three products are in phase with one another, Aquarius and SMOS produce BLT estimates that are greater than Argo by 10-20 m on average. An anomalous event in 2011 demonstrates how BLT interannual variability may be created by changes in near surface salinity. Our observations suggest that the event was caused by subduction of surface waters due to increased near surface salinity and an anomalous downwelling Rossby wave generated by positive Indian Ocean dipole. Both mechanisms created a thick barrier layer followed by anomalous precipitation and SSS, a series of events consistent with barrier layer theory. Our results also suggest that new SSS measurements from SMOS and Aquarius provide a different interpretation of near surface salinity stratification that needs to be further explored.

AB L-band passive measurements (1.4 GHz) over continental areas are known to be related to surface soil moisture. Two satellite missions were recently launched to measure land surface emissions at this frequency band (SMOS-Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in 2009 and SMAP-Soil Moisture Active/Passive in 2015). In order to improve soil moisture retrievals from satellite data, ground-based radiometer systems operating at the same frequency were deployed over specified areas to investigate the L-band emission of various land covers under various climatological conditions. In this study, three years of L-band passive measurements from a radiometer installed on top of a steep mountain in the French Alps were analyzed and compared to L-band passive simulations. The innovative radiometer location led to large footprints due to the distance between the radiometer and the area under study. This experiment also produced microwave measurements affected by various potential difficulties typically encountered in SMOS/SMAP satellite missions: topography, heterogeneous footprints, dry/wet snow events, dew and vegetation litter. Based on in situ and modeling data, this paper investigates the potential of a radiative transfer model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere, L-MEB) to simulate L-band measurements and analyzes the differences with ELBARA observations. First, it was found that the topography generated a mixing of the horizontal and vertical polarizations. In addition, a large positive bias was found on ELBARA measurements (31 K and 12 K in horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively). Investigations showed that the sky reflection measured by the radiometer was partially substituted by land reflection coming from the surrounding topography. Second, the low-vegetation emission was investigated and highlighted the inability of the MODIS NDVI product to correctly represent the vegetation dynamics. Finally, dry snow conditions were found to have non-negligible impact at L-band and a particular signature was found during snow melting periods, with potential applications at the SMOS/SMAP spatial scales (similar to 40 km).

AB In this paper we present a method to restitute the volcanic gas/ash Plume Elevation Model (PEM) from optical satellite imagery. As the volcanic plume is moving rapidly, conventional satellite based photogrammetric height restitution methods do not apply as the epipolar offset due to plume motion adds up to the one generated by the stereoscopic view. This is because there are time-lags of tens of seconds between conventional satellite stereoscopic acquisitions, depending on the stereo acquisition mode. Our method is based on a single satellite pass. We exploit the short time lag and resulting baseline that exist between the multispectral (MS) and the panchromatic (PAN) bands to jointly measure the epipolar offsets and the perpendicular to the epipolar (P2E) offsets. The first are proportional to plume height plus the offsets due to plume velocity in the epipolar direction. The second, are proportional to plume velocity in the P2E direction only. The latter is used to compensate the effect of plume velocity in the stereoscopic offsets by projecting it on the epipolar direction assuming a known plume direction, thus improving the height measurement precision. We apply the method to Landsat 8 data taking into account the specificities of the focal plane modules. We focus on the Holuhraun 2014 fissure eruption (Iceland). We validate our measurements against ground based measurements. The method has potential for detailed high resolution routine measurements of volcanic plume height/velocity. The method can be applied both to other multifocal plane modules push broom sensors (such as the ESA Sentinel 2) and potentially to other push-broom systems such as the CNES SPOT family and Pleiades.

AB To generate sea surface temperature (SST) analyses, observations are assimilated onto a background field to produce a gap-free map of SST. The spatial influence of an observation as well as its weight are determined by the error covariance matrices used in the data assimilation.
   The background error covariance parameters for an SST analysis have been estimated using observation-minus background difference data from a long term SST reanalysis. Geographically varying estimates were obtained of both the error variance and the associated length scale of the background error which were decomposed into small-scale and large-scale errors. Both components of the background error variances were found to be seasonally variable. Minimal seasonality was observed in the error correlation length scales but they were found to be anisotropic. Observational errors were also estimated for the observation types used in the observation-minus-background calculations.
   The impact of updating the background error parameters in the Operational Sea surface Temperature and sea-Ice Analysis (OSTIA) was assessed. The updates improved the analysis accuracy compared to assimilated and independent reference observations. The covariance updates also improved the ability of the SST analysis to represent small-scale ocean features without introducing spurious noise. As OSTIA is used as boundary conditions in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system at the Met Office the impact on the NWP forecasts was also assessed. The OSTIA changes were found to have a positive impact on NWP forecast skill. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Four wide-field-of-view (WFV) instruments are onboard the Gaofen-1 (or GF-1) satellite, providing a combined swath of similar to 800 km. However, observations with large view angles pose new challenges for radiometric cross calibration with a simple image-based method when using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data as a reference. Based on radiative transfer modeling, a novel radiometric cross-calibration method has been proposed in this study to solve large view angle-associated problems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products were used to simulate the top of atmosphere (TOA) signal of the reference and target instruments, and the unequal bidirectional effects were corrected using MODIS bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) products. Extensive validations with both satellite data and in situ measurements revealed an uncertainty of similar to 8% for the newly produced cross-calibration coefficients when they were used to calibrate TOA reflectance for both close-nadir and off-nadir instruments. The improvements are discernable when compared with the official provided coefficients and that were derived using the image-based cross calibration method. This study demonstrated not only the usefulness of Landsat-8 OLI data in sensor radiometric calibration but also the impressive accuracy of the MODIS BRDF and aerosol products in radiative transfer simulations. The proposed method can be used in the future to monitor and correct potential radiometric degradations of the GF-1 WFV instruments, and it also can be easily extended to other similar satellite missions to conduct radiometric cross-calibrations.

AB The global forest ecosystem, which acts as a large carbon sink, plays an important role in modeling the global carbon balance. An accurate estimation of the total forest carbon stock in the aboveground biomass (AGB) is therefore necessary for improving our understanding of carbon dynamics, especially against the background of global climate change. The forest area of China is among the top five globally. However, because of limitations in forest AGB mapping methods and the availability of ground inventory data, there is still a lack in the nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB estimation map for China. In this study, we collected over 8000 ground inventory records from published literatures, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of these ground inventory data, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data. An uncertainty field model was introduced into the forest AGB mapping procedure to minimize the influence of plot location uncertainty. Our nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB mapping results show that the forest AGB density in China is 120 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 61 Mg/ha. Evaluation with an independent ground inventory dataset showed that our proposed method can accurately map wall-to-wall forest AGB across a large landscape. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error between our predicted results and the validation dataset were 0.75 and 42.39 Mg/ha, respectively. This new method and the resulting nationwide wall-to-wall forest AGB map will help to improve the accuracy of carbon dynamic predictions in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Satellite image time series (SITS) provide spectral-temporal features that describe phenological changes in vegetation over the growing season, which is expected to facilitate the classification of crop types. While most SITS-based crop type classifications were focused on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) temporal profiles, less attention has been paid to using the complete image spectral resolution of the time series. In this work we assessed different approaches to SITS-based classification of four major fruit-tree crops in the Maipo Valley, central Chile, during the 2013-14 growing season. We compared four feature sets from a time series comprised of eight cloud-free Landsat-8 images: the full-band SITS, the NDVI and NDWI (normalized difference water index) temporal profiles, and an image stack with all the feature sets combined. State-of-the-art classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, LDA; random forest; and support vector machine) were applied on each feature set at different training sample sizes (N = 100, 200, 400, 800 and 2291 fields), and classification results were assessed by cross-validation of the misclassification error rate (MER). For all the feature sets overall results were good (MERs <= 0.21) although substantially improved classification accuracies were achieved when the full-band SITS was employed (MER 0.14-0.05). Classifications applied on the NDVI temporal profile consistently had the worst performance. For a sample size of 200 fields, LDA using the full-band SITS of image dates 1, 3, 6 and 8 produced the best tradeoff between the number of images and classification accuracy (MER = 0.06), being the green, red, blue and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands of image date 1 (acquired at the early greenup stage) the most relevant for crop type discrimination. Our results show the importance of considering the complete image spectral resolution for SITS-based crop type classifications as the commonly used NDVI temporal profile and their red and near infrared bands were not found the most significant to discriminate the crop types of interest. Furthermore, in light of the good results obtained, the methodology used here might be transferred to similar agricultural lands cultivated with the same crop types, thus providing a reliable and relatively efficient methodology for creating and updating crop inventories.

AB Landsat imagery has long been used to measure glacier and ice sheet surface velocity, and this application has increased with increased length and accessibility of the archive. The radiometric characteristics of Landsat sensors, however, have limited these measurements generally to only fast-flowing glaciers with high levels of surface texture and imagery with high sun angles and cloud-free conditions, preventing wide-area velocity mapping at the scale achievable with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the newly launched Landsat 8 features substantially improves radiometric performance compared to preceding sensors: enhancing performance of automated Repeat-Image Feature Tracking (RIFT) for mapping ice flow speed. In order to assess this improvement, we conduct a comparative study of OLI and the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) performance for measuring glacier velocity in a range of surface and atmospheric conditions. To isolate the effects of radiometric quantization and noise level, we construct a model for simulating ETM+ imagery from OLI and compare RIFT results derived from each. We find that a nonlinearity in the relationship between ETM+ and OLI radiances at higher brightness levels results in a particularly large improvement in RIFT performance over the low-textured interior of the ice sheets, as well as improved performance in adverse conditions such as low sun-angles and thin clouds. Additionally, the reduced noise level in OLI imagery results in fewer spurious motion vectors and improved RIFT performance in all conditions and surfaces. We conclude that OLI imagery should enable large-area ice sheet and glacier mapping so that its coverage is comparable to SAR, with a remaining limitation being image geolocation.

AB We present retrievals of water cloud properties from the measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during the Polarimeter Definition Experiment (PODEX) held between January 14 and February 6, 2013. The RSP was onboard the high-altitude NASA ER-2 aircraft based at NASA Dryden Aircraft Operation Facility in Palmdale, California. The retrieved cloud characteristics include cloud optical thickness, effective radius and variance of cloud droplet size distribution derived using a parameter-fitting technique, as well as the complete droplet size distribution function obtained by means of Rainbow Fourier Transform. Multi-modal size distributions are decomposed into several modes and the respective effective radii and variances are computed. The methodology used to produce the retrieval dataset is illustrated on the examples of a marine stratocumulus deck off California coast and stratus/fog over California's Central Valley. In the latter case the observed bimodal droplet size distributions were attributed to two-layer cloud structure. All retrieval data are available online from NASA GISS website. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The fundamental basis for applying remote sensing methods to crop assessments is the interrelationships between crop features and canopy spectral characteristics. Thus, a thorough understanding of the differences in the distributions of crop variables among different vertical layers and modules, as well as the effects of these layers and modules on canopy spectral characteristics and derived vegetation indices, is vital to improving the performance of crop monitoring by remote sensing. The main goal of this work was to provide insight into the above issues based on field measurements of winter wheat under different treatments during anthesis. The results demonstrated that the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll a and b content (Chl(a+b)), nitrogen (N) content per unit leaf area (N-L), N concentration on a mass basis (N-M), dry matter accumulation (DM), N accumulation (NA), and water content (We) in leaves and stems generally exhibited great vertical differences within wheat canopies during anthesis. There were also significant differences in N-M, DM, NA, and W-c among the different plant modules (i.e., leaves, stems, and spikes) and the entire canopy. Moreover, the removal of wheat spikes and different vertical leaf layers had evident effects on the canopy spectral reflectance, and there were differences in the types and degrees of these effects at different wavelengths and treatments. In most cases, the vegetation indices decreased after removing wheat spikes and different leaf layers, although a few indices increased. There were also some vegetation indices that responded weakly to removal events. In comparison, the vegetation indices mostly showed stronger responses to the removal of the top 1st leaves than the spikes. To a certain extent, the responses to the removal of the top 2nd leaves were comparable to those of the top 1st leaves. The responses of most vegetation indices to the top 3rd leaves' removal were less than the responses to the top 2nd leaves' removal. In the case of the removal of the top 4th leaves and below, many of the R-V (i.e., relative variation rate) absolute values of vegetation indices were greater than those of the top 3rd leaves' removal but smaller than or close to those of the top 2nd leaves' removal; this may partly be because all the withered and dead leaves covering the soil surface were also removed in this case. The above findings indicated that crop features may not be well characterized when they are based solely on leaves, especially only the upper leaves, as the lower leaves, stems, and spikes also have important effects. Moreover, wheat spikes, not just leaves, and even bottom-layer leaves, could have evident effects on canopy reflectance characteristics and derived vegetation indices. More effort is needed in future research to obtain a thorough understanding of the effects of canopy heterogeneity on canopy spectral characteristics and the relationships between crop variables and spectral vegetation indices.

AB The light-use efficiency CLUE) model of photosynthesis is widely used to estimate ecosystem photosynthesis and net primary production from remote sensing measurements. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) is a dominant term in this model, and it is fundamentally important for model calculations of ecosystem productivity across large areas. The LUE term is sometimes considered a constant, but may be best represented as a variable scalar under stress conditions. The main objective of this study was to better understand factors influencing f(APAR), its relationship with seasonal variation in canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and the consequences of potential seasonal changes in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship for LUE model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis in a semi-arid grassland. We used two approaches to determine f(APAR), (i) direct incoming and outgoing radiation measurements above and below the canopy, and (ii) an inversion approach based on incident photosynthetically active radiation and the light response curve of net ecosystem productivity measured by eddy covariance at low light levels. The two approaches resulted in f(APAR) values that were very strongly correlated during the initial development of the canopy until peak leaf area index (LAI) was reached. During this time, a strong linear relationship also occurred between f(APAR) and NDVI calculated from spectral reflectance measurements of the grassland canopy. After peak LAI, there was hysteresis in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship, and the two f(APAR) estimates diverged. Light-use efficiency model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis made using f(APAR) values were strongly correlated with chamber CO2 exchange measurements during the initial development of the canopy leaf area. After peak LAI, a stress function, based on either soil moisture or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) measurements, was necessary to reduce quantum yield and model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis during periods of relatively low soil moisture and higher VPD later in the growing season. Both stress functions were similarly effective in improving the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values, and indicated reduced LUE under late season conditions. Modulating LUE based on the Photochemical Reflectance Index or the Water Band Index (both proposed as possible indicators of LUE) was not effective to improve the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values in this ecosystem.

AB Eroding coastlines composed of sequences of till, carbon rich peat and sand layers are characteristic of many formerly glaciated coastlines due to the interplay of relative land and sea levels. Dune cliffs cut into these materials represent one of the most sensitive systems to the processes of coastal change. Establishing appropriate scales for the quantification and analysis of change in coastal dune cliffs remains limited by the speed and nature of change, the intensity of environmental processes and the challenges of achieving adequate survey control. This paper presents the results from multi-scale analyses into the behaviour of dune cliffs on the northeast coast, UK, over a 118 year period. Repeat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey differences have been used to identify and quantify system behaviour, set in context with historic map comparisons. At the landform scale, monthly dune cliff dynamics have been analysed over the course of a year with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in order to gain insights into the drivers of contemporary dune cliff behaviour. Finally, pseudo three-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data are used to trace subsurface stratigraphy from which the potential extent of stored carbon (in excess of 100 t over 50 m of monitored dune cliff) at risk of release by coastal erosion over the next 50 years can be calculated. The consideration of multi-scale changes over time periods relevant to well-constrained sea level change has revealed a complex combination of failure mechanisms that have resulted in an acceleration in dune cliff recession (particularly over the last decade) and a form change to shallower, divergent profiles. This potential acceleration in contemporary dune cliff response holds significant implications for both coastal management and the contribution of this poorly quantified input to the coastal carbon flux.

AB In this study we evaluate the skill of a new, merged soil moisture product (ECV_SM) that has been developed in the framework of the European Space Agency's Water Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy and Climate Change Initiative projects. The product combines in a synergistic way the soil moisture retrievals from four passive (SMMR, SSM/I, TMI, and AMSR-E) and two active (ERS AMI and ASCAT) coarse resolution microwave sensors into a global data set spanning the period 1979-2010. The evaluation uses ground-based soil moisture observations of 596 sites from 28 historical and active monitoring networks worldwide. Besides providing conventional measures of agreement, we use the triple collocation technique to assess random errors in the data set. The average Spearman correlation coefficient between ECV_SM and all in-situ observations is 0.46 for the absolute values and 0.36 for the soil moisture anomalies, but differences between networks and time periods are very large. Unbiased root-mean-square differences and triple collocation errors show less variation between networks, with average values around 0.05 and 0.04 m(3) m(-3), respectively. The ECV_SM quality shows an upward trend over time, but a consistent decrease of all performance metrics is observed for the period 2007-2010. Comparing the skill of the merged product with the skill of the individual input products shows that the merged product has a similar or better performance than the individual input products, except with regard to the ASCAT product, compared to which the performance of ECV_SM is inferior. The cause of the latter is most likely a combination of the mismatch in sampling time between the satellite observations and in-situ measurements, and the resampling and scaling strategy used to integrate the ASCAT product into ECV_SM on the other. The results of this study will be used to further improve the scaling and merging algorithms for future product updates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing is commonly used to monitor the hydrological processes of the earth's surface (soil moisture) as well as key surface environmental processes (vegetation dynamics, snow cover, etc.). For many applications, it is important to model the effects of surface roughness. This study focuses on the unique PORTOS-93 measurement campaign that covered a wide range of bare soil conditions in terms of moisture, temperature and surface roughness. The PORTOS-93 campaign covers a frequency range from 1.41 to 90 GHz. In this study, based on the PORTOS-93 dataset, we compare the Wegmuller & Matzler (1999) model (referred to as WM99) with the Wang & Choudhury (1981) model (referred to as QHN) and evaluate their abilities to simulate the soil surface brightness temperature (TB). We show that improved results were obtained by tuning the parameters of the two models to the entire PORTOS-93 dataset for each frequency separately compared to the model tuned independently of frequency. In addition we found that the Mironov et al. (2009) soil permittivity model is slightly more accurate at lower frequencies (<11 GHz) for simulating soil permittivity than the Dobson et at (1985) soil permittivity model for the PORTOS-93 site. We also found that both of these permittivity models need to be tuned at higher frequencies (>20 GHz) and that using the Wang & Schmugge (1980) model tuned using parameters derived by Calvet et al. (1995a) at higher frequencies for the PORTOS-93 dataset gives best results. Using the proposed tuned reflectivity models for each frequency separately, we obtained an overall bias of -020 K and 021 K for the WM99 and QHN models respectively between the measured and modelled brightness temperatures. This corresponds to a significant improvement in comparison to the use of the tuned WM99 model independently of the frequency (bias = -38.08 K). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud property retrievals from 3 decades of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements provide a unique opportunity for a long-term analysis of clouds. In this study, the accuracy of AVHRR-derived cloud properties cloud mask, cloud-top height, cloud phase and cloud liquid water path is assessed using three state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. In addition, the same retrieval schemes are applied to the AVHRR heritage channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to create AVHRR-like retrievals with higher spatial resolution and based on presumably more accurate spectral calibration. The cloud property retrievals were collocated and inter-compared with observations from CloudSat, CALIPSO and AMSR-E The resulting comparison exhibited good agreement in general. The schemes provide correct cloud detection in 82 to 90% of all cloudy cases. With correct identification of clear-sky in 61 to 85% of all clear areas, the schemes are slightly biased towards cloudy conditions. The evaluation of the cloud phase classification shows correct identification of liquid clouds in 61 to 97% and a correct identification of ice clouds in 68 to 95%, demonstrating a large variability among the schemes. Cloud-top height (CTH) retrievals were of relatively similar quality with standard deviations ranging from 2.1 km to 2.7 km. Significant negative biases in these retrievals are found in particular for cirrus clouds. The biases decrease if optical depth thresholds are applied to determine the reference CTH measure. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is also retrieved well with relative low standard deviations (20 to 28 g/m(2)), negative bias and high correlations. Cloud ice water path (IWP) retrievals of AVHRR and MODIS exhibit a relative high uncertainty with standard deviations between 800 and 1400 g/m2, which in relative terms exceed 100% when normalized with the mean IWP. However, the global histogram distributions of IWP were similar to the reference dataset
   MODIS retrievals are for most comparisons of slightly better quality than AVHRR-based retrievals. Additionally, the choice of different near-infrared channels, 3.7 mu M as opposed to 1.6 mu m, can have a significant impact on the retrieval quality, most pronounced for IWP, with better accuracy for the 1.6 mu m channel setup. This study presents a novel assessment of the quality of cloud properties derived from AVHRR channels, which quantifies the accuracy of the considered retrievals based on common approaches and validation data. Furthermore, it assesses the capabilities of AVHRR-like spectral information for retrieving cloud properties in the light of generating climate data records of cloud properties from three decades of AVHRR measurements.

AB Wheat is the most important cereal crop traded on international markets and winter wheat constitutes approximately 80% of global wheat production. Thus, accurate and timely production forecasts are critical for making informed agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) developed an empirical generalized model for forecasting winter wheat production. Their approach combined BRDF-corrected daily surface reflectance from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) with detailed official crop statistics and crop type masks. It is based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the peak of the growing season, percent wheat within the CMG pixel (area within the CMG pixel occupied by wheat), and the final yields. This method predicts the yield approximately one month to six weeks prior to harvest. In this study, we include Growing Degree Day (GDD) information extracted from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in order to improve the winter wheat production forecast by increasing the timeliness of the forecasts while conserving the accuracy of the original model. We apply this modified model to three major wheat-producing countries: the Unites States (US), Ukraine and China from 2001 to 2012. We show that a reliable forecast can be made between one month to a month and a half prior to the peak NDVI (meaning two months to two and a half months prior to harvest), while conserving an accuracy of 10% in the production forecast.

AB Phytoplankton bloom in a shallow inland eutrophic lake (Taihu Lake) is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variation and a high concentration of chlorophyll-a (Cchl-a). The observation of the rapidly changing dynamic characteristics of algae is limited by the insufficient temporal resolution of satellite data. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), launched by Korea, can provide high temporal resolution satellite data to observe the hourly dynamics of algae. In this study, a simple regional NIR-red two-band empirical algorithm of Cchl-a for GOCI is proposed for Taihu Lake. Study results show that the GOCI-derived Cchl-a matches the in situ measured values well. Based on this validated algorithm of Cchl-a, we obtained the hourly maps of Cchl-a from GOCI level-1b data during the period August 6 to August 9, 2013. The spatial variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a also matches synchronous in situ measured values well, and the temporal variation of GOCI-derived Cchl-a coincides with buoy-measured Cchl-a. The northwestern area of the lake and Meiliang Bay are worst hit by phytoplankton bloom. GOCI-derived Cchl-a revealed a clear evidence of hourly spatial and temporal variations of Cchl-a in Taihu Lake. The vertical current plays an important role in the hourly scale of spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton. The horizontal current is important to the distribution of phytoplankton over the long term, but spatially and temporally limited in the short term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) can help detect, map and provide guidance for crop water needs in irrigated lands. Two remote sensing ET models based on thermal infrared (TIR), the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) and the Satellite-Based Energy Balance for Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), were tested for accuracy, and bias at fine (1 m) and moderate (30-120 m) spatial scales. Airborne and Landsat data were collected over Maricopa, Arizona in 2009 and 2011 as part of a cotton irrigation scheduling study. Based on soil moisture observations at 112 locations across 4.9 ha and image data spanning two growing seasons, TSEB and METRIC were found similarly accurate at both fine and moderate scales with average discrepancies no more than 1.9 mm/day. Tests at 1-m scales showed that TSEB and METRIC model sensitivities were seasonally correlated, with greater sensitivity modeled by METRIC in early growth and slightly greater sensitivity by TSEB at maturity. Time integration of flux estimates was done by assuming constant evaporative fraction and was also tested for 2011 data using ground-based TIR radiometers; this latter approach improved daily ET estimates by 0.8 mm/day or better in two cases. Time-series assessment of the utility of using evaporative fraction as a water-stress indicator was tested using Landsat data and both TSEB and METRIC. Two early season water depletion events were detected and none in mid-season. The impact of overpass frequency upon ET estimates was tested for the field as a whole and found that cumulative ET estimates were significantly affected, up to 200 mm out of-1000 mm consumed. Results from this study showed that for ET accuracy, TSEB and METRIC perform similarly. METRIC is preferred when model ancillary data are sparse, while TSEB is preferred when support data are plentiful. Future ET modeling should consider implementing both to take advantage of their seasonally dependent sensitivities. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban development at regional and global scales is increasingly important for urban planning, policy decision making and resource use and conservation. Continuous satellite derived observations of anthropogenic lighting signal at night provide consistent and efficient proxy measures of demographic and socioeconomic dynamics in the urbanization process. Previous studies have demonstrated significant positive correlations between the nocturnal light brightness, mainly derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), and population and economic variables. Quantitative measurements of artificial lighting emissions at night therefore can be indicative of the overall degree of socioeconomic development at regional to country levels. The spatio-temporal characteristics of anthropogenic night-time lighting, potentially connected to the dynamic patterns of spatially expanding human settlement and economic activities during the urban expansion process, however, has received less attention largely because of diversity of both socioeconomic activity and urban forms. Based upon the quadratic relationship between the pixel-level night-time light radiance and corresponding brightness gradient (i.e. the rate of maximum local change) at the local scale, we here proposed a spatially explicit approach for partitioning DMSP/OLS night-time light images into five types of night-time lighting areas for individual cities: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high, generally associated with urban sub-areas experienced distinctly different forms and human activity. At the country scale, our findings suggest that significant rises are commonly found in these five types of night-time lighting areas with different growth rates across 271 China's cities from 1992 to 2012. At the urban scale, however, five types of night-time lighting areas show various trends for individual cities in relation to the urban size and development levels. The marked increase in high night-time lighting area is highly prevalent in most of China's cities with rapid urbanization over the past 21 years while significantly decreased low and medium-low night-time lighting areas are most likely to occur in large and extra-large cities. Moreover, the transition between different types of night-time lighting areas could further portray the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban development. Analyzing results indicate that the spatial expansions of gradually intensified night-time light brightness correspond geographically with the rural-urban gradients following a stepwise transition of night-time light brightness during the urban expansion.

AB Since the beginning of the 1960s an escalating deterioration of reed beds in parts of Europe has been often observed. Hence, the 'reed die-back' as it was later named, has been a phenomenon of great scientific interest and concern to conservationists worldwide and intensively studied by field ecologists. Imaging spectroscopy has frequently been employed for vegetation mapping, but this paper is the first explicit analysis of the spectral information content for reed and an assessment of the potential for detecting the areas affected by the reed die-back syndrome using hyperspectral data at the near infrared and the chlorophyll absorption spectral regions. Leaf reflectance spectra and photophysiological information were acquired using a Hand-Held ASD spectroradiometer, a portable fluorometer and a chlorophyll metre in-situ concurrently from leaf samples along a transect perpendicular to the lake shore of Central Europe's largest inland lake in terms of area, Lake Balaton in-Hungary. A strong correlation between narrowband spectraLindices and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in assessing plant stability. Canopy hyperspectral data were collected from an airborne AISA Eagle sensor (400-1000 nm). An application of the findings from the field data analysis to airborne hyperspectral imagery reveals important information about reed condition-at the study area. Y(II) values, regarded as a proxy of photosystem activity, have been calculated from high R-2 combination of spectral ratio 612/516 representing Fs and 699/527 representing Fm'. ETR values are estimated based on the calculated Y(II) and the spectral ratio 463/488 for Photosynthetically Active Radiation. This research underpins the development of methods for the spectral discrimination of reed patches affected by stress caused by environmental conditions, and subsequently the reed die-back syndrome. A comparison with empirical vegetation indices from the literature shows significantly higher R2 values of the proposed indices for the specific application. We recommend spectral indices at leaf level for evaluating reed ecological status based on spectroscopic data to support the identification of affected vegetation patches and present R2 maps that can aid the selection of indices tailored to specifications of remote sensors.
