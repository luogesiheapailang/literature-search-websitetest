AB There is a strong need to develop remote sensing methods for mapping lake carbon content on regional to global scales. The use of in situ methods is impractical for monitoring lake water quality over large geographical areas, which is a fundamental requirement to understand the true role of lakes in the global carbon cycle. The coloured component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), called CDOM, absorbs light strongly in the blue part of the visible spectrum and can be used as a proxy for mapping lake DOC with remote sensing. However, iron associated to organic matter can cause extra browning of waters. Consequently, the remote sensing signal we interpret as DOC may partially be attributed to the presence of iron associated to organic matter, potentially hampering our ability to estimate carbon concentrations.
   A thorough analysis of biogeochemical parameters was carried out on Lake Malaren on August 23, 2010, and a MERIS full resolution image was acquired simultaneously. MERIS standard, Case 2 Regional, and Boreal processors were used to calculate remote sensing products, which were compared with different lake water characteristics.
   The carbon to iron ratio was different from the rest of the lake in one of the basins. MERIS standard and Case 2 Regional processors were sensitive to this difference as the correlation between MERIS CDOM product and DOC was low (R-2 = 0.43) for all sampling stations and increased to 0.92 when the one basin was excluded. The Boreal Lakes processor results were less disturbed by the different carbon-iron ratios found in one basin and produced reasonably good results (R-2 = 0.65).
   We found MERIS products (e.g. total absorption) that provided good correlation (R-2 = 0.80) with DOC-specific absorbance at 254 nm, called SUVA, which is a metric commonly used to assess drinking water treatability. However, none of the MERIS products were suitable for mapping the total organic carbon in Lake Malaren.MERIS total suspended matter product was a good (R-2 = 0.73) proxy for particulate iron, meaning that the particulate iron content in Malaren can be mapped from space.

AB A major landslide in Zhouqu, China occurred on August 8, 2010 and caused widespread damage and over 1700 casualties. We study the deformation of the slopes over a time period of about three years prior to the landslide by an enhanced StaMPS-SB technique with 16 ascending ALOS/PALSAR images. In particular, the orbit error and stratified troposphere that were not well dealt with in the original StaMPS-SB method have been satisfactorily corrected by a novel phase ramp correction method. The deformation in four regions of the study area has been retrieved with a maximum of up to 70 mm/yr. In the Luojiayu-Sanyanyu valley, the slopes where the 2010 giant landslide occurred have been found to be quite unstable before the event. Deformation exceeding 30 mm/yr has been detected in the Suoertou slope, which is a well-known place for an ancient fault zone landslide. Fast movement larger than 40 mm/yr is observed in the Xieliupo slope, which poses threats of landslide dam and dammed lake to the Pal-lung River together with another slope deformation detected in the opposite slope. In the Nanshanqiaotou slope, the detected similar to 30 mm/yr deformation can be viewed as the prelude of the large landslide occurred in October 2010. More important, it is found that the slope deformation time series has strong correlation with the precipitation in the area as well as with the devastating Wenchuan earthquake that occurred in May 2008 whose epicenter is about 300 km away from Zhouqu.

AB This study has been carried out to evaluate the relationship between Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) backscattering coefficients and the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a managed mangrove forest in Malaysia. Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve known as Matang Mangroves was selected as the study area. It covers about 41,000 ha of mangrove forest and is the largest single mangrove ecosystem in Peninsular Malaysia. A mosaic of L-band PALSAR fine beam dual (FBD) with 25 m pixel spacing data for the year 2010 was provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) within the framework of the ALOS Kyoto and Carbon (K&C) Initiative. A total of 320 sampling plots that were collected in 2010 and 2011 were used in the study. The calculated plot-based AGB were correlated to the pixels/backscatter of PALSAR data. The best correlation function (i.e. from HV backscatter) was used to estimate and determine the aboveground biomass of the Matang Mangroves. The study found that the estimated AGE in Matang Mangroves ranged between 2.98 and 378.32 +/- 33.90 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 99.40 +/- 33.90 Mg ha(-1) and a total AGB of about 4.25 million Mg. The HV backscatter started to saturate at an AGB of 100 Mg ha(-1) and the errors associated with the estimation occurred largely when the AGB exceeded 150 Mg ha(-1). The study also found that the manipulation of polarisation was useful in discriminating succession levels of mangroves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Fire severity, the degree of environmental change caused by a fire, is traditionally assessed by broadband spectral indices, such as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) from Landsat imagery. Here, we used an alternative indicator, the burned fraction derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA), to evaluate and compare the performance for assessing fire severity of broadband and narrowband imaging spectroscopy (IS) data in the visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 035-2.5 mu m). We used the band specifications of the broadband Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the narrowband Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). We integrated two techniques to account for endmember variability in the unmixing process, spectral weighting and iterative unmixing, in a model referred to as weighted multiple endmember SMA (wMESMA). Based on a separability index, we evaluated the separability between the different ground components, or endmembers, that comprise post-fire environments (char, green vegetation (CV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and substrate). We found that the near infrared region (0.7-1.3 mu m) had the highest discriminatory power, followed by the shortwave infrared 2 (SWIR2, 2-2.4 mu m), SWIR1 (1.5-1.7 mu m) and visible (0.35-0.7 mu m) regions. Individual narrowbands did not substantially outperform individual broadbands, however, the higher data dimensionality of IS resulted in significantly improved post-fire fractional cover and burned fraction estimates compared to multispectral data. Multispectral data captured a fair amount of the variability in fire severity conditions as represented by the different fractional cover estimates of the endmembers in both a multispectral narrow- and broadband scenario, however, fractional cover estimates derived from IS data using all viable bands were significantly better. This demonstrated the benefits of IS over traditional multispectral data to assess fire severity and also showed that the additional information gain was the result of higher data dimensionality and not because of certain narrowbands capturing narrow spectral features. In addition, we found that the burned fraction derived from all viable AVIRIS bands over a fire in California, USA, was highly correlated with two field measures of fire severity (Geo Composite Burn Index: R-2 = 0.86, and the percentage black trees and shrubs: R-2 = 0.65). Formal quantification of potential improvements of IS over multispectral methods is important with the advent of upcoming spaceborne IS missions (e.g. the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program and Hyperspectral Infrared Imager). Our analysis showed that IS data when combined with advanced analysis techniques significantly improved fire severity assessments. The improvements of using IS data require higher computational cost and advanced processing, thus multispectral data might still suit the needs of certain applications such as rapid fire damage assessments and global analysis of spatio-temporal fire severity patterns.

AB Short-rotation plantations are extending worldwide due to the increased demand for pulp and wood. Reliable estimations of recent expansion of short-rotation plantation areas and associated land use changes are a prerequisite to assess their environmental impact on regional carbon and water cycles, and on climate. A binary classification methodology using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day 250 m NDVI time series was developed and applied to classify Eucalyptus plantations across Brazil. The identification of Eucalyptus plantations specific patterns in the time series was based on the calculation of matching functions between the NDVI time series and a -2 years long reference time series. Among the seven tested matching functions, the bounding envelope was the most successful. This method was robust to residual noise on the NDVI time series, and a threshold coefficient for the binary classification was adjusted using an omission-commission criteria. With this method, it was possible to detect any presence of Eucalyptus between 2003 and 2009 at monthly time-steps, including the periods of bare soils between two rotations that are typically 6-7 years long. The dates of first afforestation, of clear-cut at the end of a rotation, and of re-planting at the beginning of a new rotation were retrieved from the NDVI time series with a precision of -66 days. The final almost continuous tri-dimensional map (space and time) was validated with three different datasets, from local to regional data. All three datasets gave similarly high global accuracy statistics, but a global underestimation of Eucalyptus areas compared to large scales census was observed. Discrepancies and way to improve the Eucalyptus area estimates were discussed in this study. The developed methodology could be applied to other short-rotation tree plantations.

AB In this study trends in the tropospheric NO2 concentrations during 2005-2010 across Europe were derived from the synergistic use of OMI NO2 tropospheric columns and the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS and were compared to reported NO emissions. The chemistry transport model captures a large fraction of the variability in NO2 columns at a synoptic timescale, although a seasonal signal in the bias between the modelled and retrieved column data remains. Using a simulation with constant emissions in time, trends were derived on the basis of the systematically changing bias between the modelled and retrieved columns. Significant negative trends of 5-6% a(-1) were found in highly industrialized areas across Western Europe. Strongest decreases in NO2 concentrations are observed over a region with many power plants in Northern Spain (10-20% a(-1)) and over the Po Valley (11% a(-1)). A source apportionment simulation was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to NO emission sources across Europe, identifying the importance of changes in the energy sector in Northern Spain. A comparative study on in-situ NO2 measurements shows that annual reductions at the surface are of 2-3% a(-1). This trend increases from rural polluted sites to remote areas (-4.5% a(-1)). The observed variability with station type may be explained by the increase in primary NO2 emissions combined with the representativeness of the measurement sites. Comparing country average trends in NO2 columns with national NO emission totals shows that these are generally within a factor 2 of each other. A better agreement was found for western European countries than for eastern European countries. The method described here is a promising methodology to complement and evaluate trends in NO2 columns and indirectly emission strengths. A strong advantage is the fact that the methodology using satellite data is in principle consistent throughout the entire domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current remote sensing studies of phenology have been limited to coarse spatial or temporal resolution and often lack a direct link to field measurements. To address this gap, we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive field measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices, five mathematical fits to model a continuous temporal response, and a suite of threshold estimates for "start of spring/season" (SOS) assessments were compared to field measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency, leaf area index, greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least five spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to field metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11 days for all species and elevation combinations, but improved to 9 days for hardwood dominated plots and 7 days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8 days when forest type (mixed, conifer hardwood) was used to refine predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low, inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology overtime. This was confirmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12 days of mean absolute error. However, image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The patchy and heterogeneous arrangement of vegetation in dryland areas complicates the extraction of phenological signals using existing remote sensing data. This study examined whether the phenological analysis of a range of dryland land cover classes would benefit from the availability of synthetic images at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time intervals. We assembled a series of 500 m MODIS and Landsat-5 TM datasets from April to November, 2005-2009, over a study site in central Arizona that encompasses diverse dryland vegetation classes along an elevation gradient of 2000 m. We applied the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to each MODIS image to create a time series of synthetic images at 30 m resolution. We subjected a subset of the synthetic imagery to a pixel-based regression analysis with temporally coincident Landsat images to analyze the effect of the underlying vegetation class on the accuracy of the STARFM results. To evaluate the usefulness of the increased spatial resolution compared to a MODIS product, we analyzed the variability of the date of peak greenness values of all 30 m pixels within unmixed MODIS pixels. Finally, we examined differences in the temporal distributions of peak greenness extracted from both the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) synthetic imagery time series. Our results indicate that characteristics of the vegetation classes strongly influence STARFM algorithm performance, with Pearson correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 depending on the Landsat band and the land cover class. Responses in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum yielded the lowest correlations, particularly for the Ponderosa Pine class. The phenological variability exhibited by each land cover class was dependent on the precipitation patterns of each growing season, but was sufficiently high to make the application of STARFM imagery at this scale uniformly beneficial. The peak greenness dates extracted from EVI and NDVI time series were temporally synchronized for the Grassland class but diverged for the classes of mixed woody and herbaceous vegetation types.

AB The discrimination of oil spills and look-alike phenomena (e.g., low wind area, wind front area and natural slicks) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is a crucial task in marine oil spill detection. Many classification techniques can be employed for this purpose. In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods, it is necessary to assess their performance differences and make recommendations for classifier selection and improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for oil-spill detection in RADARSAT-1 imagery. The data of this study consists of 15 features of 192 oil spills and look-alikes identified by Canadian Ice Service between 2004 and 2008 off Canada's east and west coastal areas. The studied classifiers include the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), tree-based ensemble classifiers (bagging, bundling and boosting), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). Two performance measures, the specificity at fixed sensitivity (80%) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), were estimated using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of classifiers at a high sensitivity. Overall, the bundling technique which achieved a median specificity of 90.7%, at sensitivity of 80%, significantly outperformed the second best (i.e. bagging) by 1.5 percentage points, and the worst (i.e. ANN) by 15 percentage points. The median values of AUC measure indicated consistent results. Bundling and bagging achieved comparable median AUC values of about 92%, followed by GAM and PLDA, with ANN yielding the smallest. Most classifiers (SVM, bundling and especially PLDA and ANN) performed significantly better on datasets pre-processed by log-transformation and standardization than on the original dataset. These results demonstrate the importance and benefit of selecting the optimal classifiers for oil spill classification, and configuring the classifiers by proper feature construction techniques.

AB Desertification of the Sahel region has been debated for decades, while the concept of a "re-greening" Sahel appeared with satellite remote sensing data that allowed vegetation monitoring across wide regions and over increasingly long series of years (nowadays 30 years with the GIMMS-3g dataset). However, the scarcity of long-term field observations of vegetation in the Sahel prevents ground validation and deeper analysis of such trends. After assessing the consistency of the new GIMMS-3g NDVI product by comparison to three other AVHRR-NDVI datasets and MODIS NDVI, regional GIMMS-3g NDVI trends over 1981-2011 are analyzed. Trends are found positive and statistically significant almost everywhere in Sahel over the 1981-2011 period. Long-term field observations of the aboveground herbaceous layer mass have been collected within the Gourma region in Mali (1984-2011) and within the Fakara region in western Niger (1994-2011). These observations sample ecosystem and soil diversity, thus enabling estimation of averaged values representative of the Gourma and Fakara. NDVI measurements are found in good agreement with field observations, both over the Gourma and Fakara regions where re-greening and negative trends are observed respectively. A linear regression analysis performed between spatially averaged seasonal NDVI and a weighted average of field measurements explains 59% of the variability for the Gourma region over 1984-2011, and 38% for the Fakara region over 1994-2011. In the Gourma, which is a pastoral region, the re-greening trend is mainly observed over sandy soils, and attests for the ecosystem's resilience to the 1980s' drought, able to react to the more favorable rainfall of the 1990s and 2000s. However, contrasted changes in the landscape's functioning have occurred locally. An increase in erosion and run-off processes in association with decreasing or stable vegetation cover was observed over shallow soils, which occupy 30% of the area. In the agro-pastoral Fakara, the decreasing trends observed both from satellite NDVI and field assessments of herbaceous mass are hardly explained by rainfall. These results give confidence in the dominant positive trends in Sahelian greenness, but indicate that degradation trends can also be observed, both in situ and from satellite time series.

AB The atmosphere strongly affects satellite measurements of Earth surfaces in the optical domain. Modeling this influence is complex. This is typically the case of the "Earth-Atmosphere" radiative coupling in the presence of Earth surfaces with spatially variable optical properties. In that case, it may be very difficult to couple Earth and cloud-free atmosphere radiative transfer models. This explains why an atmosphere module was input into the Earth radiative transfer (RT.) model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) in order to simulate accurately satellite images of natural and urban Earth surfaces. This paper presents how DART simulates the atmosphere IT. in the short wave and thermal infrared domains. The atmosphere is divided into 3 zones: bottom atmosphere (BA), mid atmosphere (MA) and high atmosphere (HA). The 3D distribution is arbitrary in BA and horizontally constant with any vertical distribution in MA and HA. The "Earth-Atmosphere" R.T. is modeled in 5 stages. 1) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., atmosphere thermal emission and/or sun radiation scattering). 2) Earth surface R.T. (i.e., Earth thermal emission and/or atmosphere and direct sun radiation scattering). 3) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., Earth radiation scattering). 4) Earth surface RT. (i.e., scattering of downward atmosphere radiation). 5) Simulation of satellite reflectance and/or brightness temperature images. The approach takes into account the earth curvature and the atmosphere non-Beer law behavior in the presence of strongly varying spectral properties. It uses optimally located scattering points for improving atmosphere R.T. accuracy, and it reduces computer time through the use of pre-computed transfer functions that transfer radiation between the different atmosphere levels (BA, MA, HA). Moreover, it can simulate automatically an atmosphere geometry that optimizes the trade-off "Computer time-Accuracy" of simulations. The robustness and accuracy of the DART atmosphere modeling were successfully validated with theoretical cases and with the MODTRAN atmosphere RT. model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing is an effective tool for capturing spatial and temporal variations of water surface temperature (WST) in large lakes. The WST of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was examined from 2007 to 2010, using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products. Spatial and temporal (diurnal, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual) variations of Urmia Lake WST were also investigated. Results indicate that the MODIS-derived WSTs are in a good agreement with the in situ data (R-2 = 0.92 and bias = -0.27). Spatial analysis of WST revealed that there are three thermal zones along the lake: the shallow region in barriers of the causeway, islands and the shoreline; the south part; and the deep north parts. Using validated MODIS-derived WST, the annual temperature cycles of Urmia Lake were extracted and quadratic curves were fitted to empirically display the monthly lake-averaged variations of the lake WST. Then the effect of including the spatial distribution of WST on the lake evaporation was assessed. According to the results of the energy balance method, a 147 mm/year (515 million m(3)) discrepancy can be expected in the estimated evaporation rate when the spatial distribution in the lake WST is considered in the energy balance equation. Findings of this study confirm the application of MODIS LST products for surface temperature studies in a large hyper-saline lake.

AB Surface albedo has a major influence on the energy balance of the Earth. The albedo difference between snow-covered and snow-free tundra is high. Earlier studies have shown that taller and denser vegetation causes earlier snowmelt, and that shrub height and abundance, as well as the total biomass in summer reindeer pastures are lower than in winter pastures. Therefore, reindeer summer grazing could eventually delay the snowmelt and decrease the absorbed solar energy on the ground. The effect of reindeer summer grazing on the vegetation, snowmelt timing, surface albedo and ground heating is investigated in this study by comparing summer and non-summer pastures in the northern tundra areas of Fennoscandia. A comparison of vegetation types, NDVI, fractional snow cover and albedo between the Finnish year-round (including summer) pastures and the Norwegian non-summer (winter or spring/autumn) pastures is performed. Other factors influencing the snowmelt, such as surface air temperature, ground elevation and incoming solar radiation are taken into account. Information about the vegetation on the ground is based on a vegetation map compiled from Landsat TM/ETM + satellite data and ancillary map information. The NDVI, snowmelt and albedo analyses are performed using multi-temporal remote sensing data such as GlobSnow SE and MODIS based NDVI, snow and albedo products. The results here support previous studies and indicate that vegetation in the summer pastures is shorter and sparser and that snowmelt there occurs later than in the more densely vegetated, non-summer pastures. More shrubs protruding above the snowpack and earlier snowmelt on the Norwegian side lower the albedo during the snowmelt season. This causes higher solar energy absorption of up to 6 W/m(2) in the snowmelt season and contributes up to 0.5 W/m(2) to the yearly energy balance. Therefore this study suggests that summer reindeer herding can be used to delay snowmelt, increase surface albedo and to decrease the ground heating in the snowmelt season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Foliar chlorophyll content in forested ecosystems plays a fundamental role in plant photosynthesis and can indicate vegetation stress and disturbance. However, leaf chlorophyll retrieval is complicated as canopy reflectance in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths is affected by confounding effects not only from leaf pigment concentration but also leaf area index (LAI), canopy architecture, illumination and viewing geometry and understory vegetation. Unlike empirical indices, which are often developed at leaf-level and can be species, site and time specific, a process modelling approach can account for the variation of other variables affecting canopy reflectance; therefore providing a more accurate estimate of chlorophyll content over multiple vegetation species, time-frames and across broader spatial extents. This study used a linked canopy (4-Scale) and leaf (PROSPECT) modelling approach to investigate the ability of radiative transfer models to estimate foliar chemistry for different vegetation types (broadleaf and needle leaf) from optical remote sensing data. Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species, including black spruce (Picea mariana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and a variety of canopy closures and structures. These sites were sampled over multiple time-frames to collect ground data including leaf area index, leaf reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm) and laboratory leaf chlorophyll content. Canopy reflectance data were acquired from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), Landsat 5 TM and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The model results show that leaf chlorophyll content derived from satellite images demonstrates a good relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll content, with validation results of R-2 = 0.62; p<0.001 (MERIS) and R-2 = 0.65; p<0.001 (Landsat 5 TM), and a strong linearity with negligible systematic bias. CASI data gave a regression coefficient of R-2 = 0.41 (p<0.05) on a reduced dataset. This research provides theoretical and operational bases for the future retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content across different vegetation species, canopy structures and over broad spatial extents; crucial characteristics for inclusion in photosynthesis and carbon cycle models.

AB Close range hyperspectral remote sensing is an important tool for cal/val of satellite and airborne remote sensing data. However, automated radiometer systems on jetties, ships of opportunity, and buoys as well as hand-held instruments are nowadays more frequently used as monitoring methods in their own right. One of the problems in interpreting the data collected during field measurements is removing sun and sky glint from the reflectance spectra. Current methods for removal of the surface effects have not been very successful. We developed a method where power functions are used to remove reflected component from measured reflectance spectra. Reflectance values in the 350-380 nm range are used to determine the slope of the power function and reflectance values in the 890-900 nm range are used to determine the absolute value of glint. We show that fitting a power function through these two spectral regions allows the removal of reflected light component from the measured reflectance spectra. Data from nearly 300 field sites in lakes and coastal waters as well as Hydrolight simulations were used to demonstrate the suitability of the method. The method performs well in optically deep and shallow waters as well as in variable illumination and wind conditions, does not require any auxiliary data besides the reflectance itself and is simple to apply even in the case of continuous data flow coming from field radiometers installed on buoys, research vessels or ships of opportunity.

AB Estimation of large area forest attributes, such as area of forest cover, from remote sensing-based maps is challenging because of image processing, logistical, and data acquisition constraints. In addition, techniques for estimating and compensating for misclassification and estimating uncertainty are often unfamiliar. Forest area for the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil was estimated from each of four satellite image-based land cover maps, and an independent estimate was obtained using observations of forest/non-forest for more than 1000 points assessed as part of the Santa Catarina Forest and Floristic Inventory. The latter data were also used as an accuracy assessment sample for evaluating the four maps. The map analyses consisted of identifying classification errors, constructing error matrices, calculating associated accuracy measures, estimating bias, and constructing 95% confidence intervals for proportion forest estimates using a model-assisted regression estimator. Overall accuracies for the maps ranged from 0.876 to 0.929. The standard errors of the estimates were all smaller than the standard error of the simple random sampling estimate by factors ranging from approximately1.23 to approximately 1.69. The model-assisted regression estimator lends itself to easy implementation for adjusting for estimated classification bias and for constructing confidence intervals. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In the framework of the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) My Ocean projects, funded by the European Commission, different remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) supercollated (L3S) and interpolated (L4) data are produced and distributed in near-real time by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima - Gruppo di Oceanografia da Satellite (CNR). These SST products are based on the night-time images collected by the infrared sensors mounted on different satellite platforms and cover the whole Southern European Seas (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea, including the eastern Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea). The CNR processing chains include several modules, from the data extraction and preliminary quality control, to cloudy pixel removal and satellite images collating/merging up to US. A two-step algorithm finally allows to interpolate SST data at High (HR 1/16 degrees) and Ultra-High (UHR 1/100 degrees) spatial resolution. The basic design and the main algorithms used in My Ocean processing chains are described hereafter. A validation of the HR super-collating procedure developed during MyOcean is presented. The Mediterranean HR and UHR US and L4 operational products have then been validated vs in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys, covering two years of data (2010-2011). The validation includes a comparison between the UHR CNR L4 and the G1SST 14 developed by Chao et al. (2009). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Oil palm expansion is a major threat to forest conservation in the tropics. Oil palm can also be a sustainable economic alternative if incentives for expansion outside forests are set in place. Consistent methods to monitor the time and location of oil palm expansion and the area converted from different land covers are essential for the success of such incentives. We developed methods to detect and quantify annual land cover changes associated with oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon between 2001 and 2010 at two spatial scales and for two production modes. At the coarse scale, comprising the whole Peruvian Amazon, we used MODIS data to detect forest conversion to large-scale, industrial oil palm plantations based on metrics characterizing temporal changes in vegetation greenness associated with the conversion. At the fine scale, we used data from the satellite sensors Landsat TM/ETM + and ALOS-PALSAR to map and quantify the area from different land covers converted into large and small-scale oil palm plantations annually, in a focus area near the city of Pucallpa. Estimates were obtained from the elaboration and further combination of maps representing oil palm plantations by ages in 2010 and non-oil palm land covers in each year between 2001 and 2010. Validation data were obtained in the field and from geospatial information from previous studies. At the coarse scale, MODIS detected deforestation in 73% of training events larger than 50 ha. Detected events added up to 95% of the training areas. Total area converted to oil palm annually was quantified visually by using data from Landsat TM/ETM + with 96.3% accuracy. At the fine scale, the combination of data from Landsat TM/ETM + and ALOS-PALSAR identified oil palm expansion in areas larger than 5 ha with 94% accuracy and the year of expansion with an uncertainty of +/- 1.3 years. This work underscores the need for data from multiple satellite sensors for a comprehensive monitoring of oil palm expansion, considering needs for information not only on the area expanded but also the time of conversion and land cover transitions associated with large- and small-scale plantations.

AB Quantitative iron (oxyhydr-)oxide (Fe-Ox), AlOH-clay and carbonate abundance maps of the Rocklea Dome in Western Australia have been derived from hyperspectral visible-near to shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) airborne data that were compensated for the influence of vegetation cover. The quantitative mineral maps were validated against field data, including similar to 5500 VNIR-SWIR spectra and similar to 300 portable X-ray fluorescence measurements. The error on these airborne mineral abundance estimates averages 13.4 wt.% Fe for the Fe-Ox abundance, 4.0 wt.% Al2O3 for the AlOH-clay abundance and 0.025 for the 2320D parameter used to quantify the carbonate abundance. The unmixed quantitative mineral abundance maps improve geological mapping, including characterisation and exploration for channel iron deposits (CID). In particular, some areas with out-cropping CID, which appear subeconomic from the airborne Fe-Ox abundance map without vegetation removal, show as potentially economic CID resources when the influence of vegetation cover is unmixed from the airborne hyperspectral data. These results show that seamless maps of mineral contents can be achieved using data collected from both proximal (drill core and field) and remote (airborne and satellite) hyperspectral sensing systems.

AB The availability of light in the water column and at the seabed determines the euphotic zone and constrains the type and the vertical distribution of algae species. Light attenuation is traditionally quantified as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the downwelling spectral irradiance at wavelength 490 nm (K-d490) or the photosynthetically available radiation (K-dPAR). Satellite observations provide global coverage of these parameters at high spatial and temporal resolution and several empirical and semi-analytical models are commonly used to derive K-d490 and K-dpAR maps from ocean colour satellite sensors. Most of these existing empirical or semi-analytical models have been calibrated in open ocean waters and perform well in these regions, but tend to underestimate the attenuation of light in coastal waters, where the backscattering caused by the suspended matters and the absorption by the dissolved organic matters increase light attenuation in the water column.
   We investigate two relationships between K-dPAR and K-d490 for clear and turbid waters using MERIS reflectances and the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) developed by Lee (2005). Satellite-derived fields of K-d490 and modelled K-dPAR are evaluated using coincident in-situ data collected over the world in both clear and turbid waters, and by using Ecolight simulations. Temporal means at 250 m resolution of K-dPAR and euphotic depth were computed over the period 2005-2009 for European coastal waters. These mean data were cross-tabulated with in-situ data of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and seagrass (Posidonia oceanica), respectively observed at locations on Atlantic and Mediterranean shores where the light is taken as the limiting factor to the depth distribution for these species. The minima observed for P. oceanica, in percent of energy, are very close to 1% of surface irradiance, the historical threshold known as euphoric depth as defined by Ryther (1956). Real estimates of the surface irradiance (Frouin, 1989) are used in conjunction with the estimated K-dPAR to calculate the residual energy at the lower limit of P. oceanica and L hyperborea in mol photons. m(-2) - day(-1) as a complement to the usual fraction of the surface energy. We show that the observed values, in terms of energy, for both species were equivalent to the values reported in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A common problem in agricultural remote sensing is the sub-pixel spectral contribution of background soils, weeds and shadows which impedes the effectiveness of spectral vegetation indices to monitor site-specific variations in crop condition. To address this mixture problem, the present study combines in situ measured soil status and remotely sensed hyperspectral data in an alternative spectral unmixing algorithm. The model driven approach, referred to as Soil Modeling Mixture Analysis (SMMA), combines a general soil reflectance model and a modified spectral mixture model providing as such the opportunity to simultaneously extract the sub-pixel cover fractions and spectral characteristics of crops. The robustness of the approach was extensively tested using ray-tracer data (PBRT) from a virtual orchard, and results showed an improved monitoring of the crop's chlorophyll, water content and Leaf Area Index (LAI). A significant increase in the R-2 between vegetation indices and the biophysical parameters was observed when index values were calculated from the pure vegetation signals as extracted by SMMA as opposed to index values calculated from the original (mixed) image pixels (GM1: Delta R-2 = 0.1 9 : MDWI: Delta R-2 = O.38; sLAIDI: Delta R-2 = 0.1 4).

AB Natural and anthropogenic sources of CO2 around the globe contribute to mid-tropospheric concentrations, yet it remains unknown how measurements of mid-tropospheric CO2 relate to regional ecosystem dynamics. NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) measurements of CO2 concentrations in the mid-troposphere from 2002 to 2010 were examined in relation to precipitation and vegetation phenology across the US Great Plains. Wavelet multi-resolution analysis and the information theory metric of relative entropy were applied to assess regional relationships between mid-tropospheric CO2, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and precipitation (PPT). Results show that AIRS observations of mid-tropospheric CO2 exchange greater amounts of information with regional PPT and NDVI at seasonal, annual, and longer time scales compared to shorter time scales. PPT and NDVI contribute to mid-tropospheric CO2 at the 18-month time scale, while spatial patterns seen at this time scale for PIT and mid-tropospheric CO2 are reflective of the influence of PPT on NDVI at the annual scale. Identification of these dominant temporal scales may facilitate utilization of AIRS CO2 for monitoring regional source/sink dynamics related to climate and land-use/cover change.

AB Cholera bacteria exhibit strong association with coastal plankton. Characterization of space-time variability of chlorophyll, a surrogate for plankton abundance, in the northern Bay of Bengal is an essential first step to develop any methodology for predicting cholera outbreaks in the Bengal Delta region using remote sensing. This study quantifies the space-time distribution of chlorophyll, using the data from SeaWiFS, in the Bay of Bengal region using 10 years of satellite data. Variability of chlorophyll at daily scale, irrespective of spatial averaging, resembles white noise. At a monthly scale, chlorophyll shows distinct seasonality and chlorophyll values are significantly higher close to the coast than in the offshore regions. At pixel level (9 km) on monthly scale, on the other hand, chlorophyll does not exhibit much persistence in time. With increased spatial averaging, temporal persistence of chlorophyll increases and lag 1 autocorrelation stabilizes around 0.60 for 1296 km(2) or larger areal averages. In contrast to the offshore regions, spatial analyses of chlorophyll suggest that only coastal region has a stable correlation length of 100 km. Presence (absence) of correlation length in the coastal (offshore) regions indicate that the two regions may have two separate processes controlling the production of phytoplankton. This study puts a lower limit on space-time averaging of satellite measured plankton at 1296 km(2) monthly scale to establish relationships with cholera incidence in Bengal Delta.

AB The potential of Landsat data processing to provide systematic continental scale products has been demonstrated by several projects including the NASA Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the MODIS Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The LEDAPS method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with AERONET corrected ETM+ data for 95 10 km x 10 km 30 m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30 m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the LEDAPS method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessing species composition and its changes through time across broad geographic regions is time consuming and a difficult endeavor. The synoptic view provided by imaging remote sensors offers an alternative. But while many studies have developed procedures for assessing biodiversity using multi- and hyper-spectral imagery, they may only provide snapshots at particular months/seasons due to the seasonal variability of spectral characteristics induced by vegetated land surface phenologies. Thus, procedures for remotely assessing biodiversity patterns may not fully represent the biodiversity on the ground if vegetated land surface phenologies are not considered. Using Mantel tests, ordinarily least square regression models and spatial autoregressive models, we assessed the relationship between floristic diversity and vegetated land surface phenologies, as captured by time series of vegetation indices derived from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The relationship was calibrated with data from temperate montane forests of the Qinling Mountains region, Shaanxi Province, China. Our results show that floristically similar areas also exhibit a comparable similarity in phenological characteristics. However, phenological similarity obtained using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), a spectral vegetation index found to be not only sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content but also linearly related with the relative content of foliar anthocyanins, exhibited the strongest relationship with floristic similarity. Therefore, analysis of the temporal dynamics of pigments through the use of satellite-derived metrics, such as VARI, may be used for evaluating the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of species composition across broad geographic regions.

AB A method is proposed to retrieve and interpret fine spatial variations of the sea surface roughness in sun glitter imagery. Observed sun glitter brightness anomalies are converted using a transfer function determined from the smoothed shape of sun glitter brightness. The method is applied to MODIS and MERIS sun glitter imagery of natural oil seeps and the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The short-scale roughness variations in the presence of mineral oils slicks are consistently extracted and compared to variations associated with the biogenic slicks. In doing so, the wind speed dependency on the roughness anomalies is also considered. A comparison to normalized radar cross section (NRCS) anomalies taken from the corresponding high resolution ASAR images is performed, and similarities as well as differences are investigated. The results document significant benefit from the synergetic use of sun glitter and radar imagery for detection and monitoring of surface slicks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Substantial research has been conducted to derive Leaf Area Index (LAI). an essential climate variable, from satellite imageries acquired by moderate resolution optical sensors. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is unique among such sensors in that it provides relatively high spectral (15 bands) and spatial (similar to 300 m resolution) sampling within visible and near infrared wavelengths. A recent evaluation of four operational MERIS LAI algorithms found that they did not consistently meet accuracy targets typical of operational requirements. One explanation for the mixed performance of these algorithms may be that they do not suitably exploit the enhanced spectral sampling of MERIS. We exploit this enhanced spectral sampling to estimate several (80) narrow-band vegetation indices (Vls) by interpolating MERIS surface reflectance. The interpolation accuracy was evaluated using Hyperion imagery. Regressions were then calibrated between estimated Vls and in-situ LAI over a range of land cover types. The strongest performance (root mean squared error < 0.92 and relative root mean squared error < 038) was observed for two selected Vls (the NDVI8 and the CTR) based on both training and validation data. This study demonstrates that MERIS has the information content to meet typical operational performance specifications for LAI retrieval within the 1 unit error margin for the given atmospheric, environmental, soil and plant cover conditions on the day of the overpass and using locally derived relationships. Therefore the development of robust algorithms for retrieving LAI using these Vls is recommended. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Defoliation by insect herbivores can be a persistent disturbance affecting ecosystem functioning. We developed an approach to map canopy defoliation due to gypsy moth based on site differences in Landsat vegetation index values between non-defoliation and defoliation dates. Using field data from two study areas in the U.S. central Appalachians and five different years (2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008), we fit a sigmoidal model predicting defoliation as a function of the difference in the vegetation index. We found that the normalized difference infrared index (NDII, [Band 4 Band 5]/[Band 4 + Band 51) and the moisture stress index (Band 5/Band 4) worked better than visible-near infrared indices such as NDVI for mapping defoliation. We report a global 2-term fixed-effects model using all years that was at least as good as a mixed-effects model that varied the model coefficients by year. The final model was: proportion of foliage retained =1/(1 + exp(3.057 - 31.483. [NDIIbase year -NDIIdisturbance year]). Cross-validation by dropping each year of data and subsequently refitting the remaining data generated an RMS error estimate of 14.9% defoliation, a mean absolute error of 10.8% and a cross-validation R-2 of 0.805. The results show that a robust, general model of percent defoliation can be developed to make continuous rather than categorical maps of defoliation across years and study sites based on field data collected using different sampling methods.

AB Tamarix leaf beetles (Diorhabda carinulata) have been widely released on western U.S. rivers to control introduced shrubs in the genus Tamarix. Part of the motivation to control Tamarix is to salvage water for human use. Information is needed on the impact of beetles on Tamarix seasonal leaf production and subsequent water use over wide areas and multiple cycles of annual defoliation. Here we combine ground data with high resolution phenocam imagery and moderate resolution (Landsat) and coarser resolution (MODIS) satellite imagery to test the effects of beetles on Tamarix evapotranspiration (ET) and leaf phenology at sites on six western rivers. Satellite imagery covered the period 2000 to 2011) which encompassed years before and after beetle release at each study site. Phenocam images showed that beetles reduced green leaf cover of individual canopies by about 30% during a 6-8 week period in summer, but plants produced new leaves after beetles became dormant in August, and over three years no net reduction in peak summer leaf production was noted. ET was estimated by vegetation index methods, and both Landsat and MODIS analyses showed that beetles reduced ET markedly in the first year of defoliation, but ET recovered in subsequent years. Over all six sites, ET decreased by 14% to 15% by Landsat and MODIS estimates, respectively. However, results were variable among sites, ranging from no apparent effect on ET to substantial reduction in ET. Baseline ET rates before defoliation were low, 394 mm yr(-1) by Landsat and 314 mm yr(-1) by MODIS estimates (20-25% of potential ET), further constraining the amount of water that could be salvaged. Beetle-Tamarix interactions are in their early stage of development on this continent and it is too soon to predict the eventual extent to which Tamarix populations will be reduced. The utility of remote sensing methods for monitoring defoliation was constrained by the small area covered by each phenocam image, the low temporal resolution of Landsat, and the low spatial resolution of MODIS imagery. Even combined image sets did not adequately reveal the details of the defoliation process, and remote sensing data should be combined with ground observations to develop operational monitoring protocols.

AB Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an effective tool to detect long-term seismotectonic motions by reducing the atmospheric artifacts, thereby providing more precise deformation signal. The commonly used approaches such as persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithms need to resolve the phase ambiguities in interferogram stacks either by searching a predefined solution space or by sparse phase unwrapping methods; however the efficiency and the success of phase unwrapping cannot be guaranteed. We present here an alternative approach - temporarily coherent point (TCP) InSAR (TCPInSAR) - to estimate the long term deformation rate without the need of phase unwrapping. The proposed approach has a series of innovations including TCP identification. TCP network and TCP least squares estimator. We apply the proposed method to the Los Angeles Basin in southern California where structurally active faults are believed capable of generating damaging earthquakes. The analysis is based on 55 interferograrns from 32 ERS-1/2 images acquired during Oct. 1995 and Dec. 2000. To evaluate the performance of TCPInSAR on a small set of observations, a test with half of interferometric pairs is also performed. The retrieved TCPInSAR measurements have been validated by a comparison with GPS observations from Southern California Integrated GPS Network Our result presents a similar deformation pattern as shown in past InSAR studies but with a smaller average standard deviation (4.6 mm) compared with GPS observations, indicating that TCPInSAR is a promising alternative for efficiently mapping ground deformation even from a relatively smaller set of interferograms.

AB Land surface temperature and emissivity are independent variables, and the thermal-infrared spectral radiance measured in remote sensing is dependent on both. Therefore the inverse Planck equation is under-determined, with two unknowns and a single measurement. Practical inversion algorithms designed to calculate temperature and emissivity from the measurements cannot do a perfect job of separation, and recovered temperature and emissivity may co-vary. For ASTER images, validation studies of recovered temperature and emissivity, regarded individually, have shown that they are within the precision and accuracy limits predicted in designing the ASTER TES algorithm used to calculate the standard products AST05 and AST08. Nevertheless, a closer look at emissivity recovered for water targets shows that emissivity appears to vary, incorrectly, as a function of temperature. One cause of this is electronic striping; another is incomplete characterization of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles used in compensation for atmospheric absorption and path radiance. The linkage varies from band to band, with the greatest emissivity effect of 0.0003 K(-1) for ASTER band 12 (9.1 mu m) relative to band 13 (10.6 mu m). Although this inaccuracy in emissivity is small, it can approach or exceed the inaccuracy prediction of +/- 0.015 for the standard product when the entire gamut of terrestrial water and land temperatures is examined. Therefore, spatial filtering and upgrading the atmosphere compensation algorithm to use watervapor scaling should be considered in making AST05 and AST08. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Today the water quality of many inland and coastal waters is compromised by cultural eutrophication in consequence of increased human agricultural and industrial activities. Remote sensing is widely applied to monitor the trophic state of these waters. This study investigates the performance of near infrared-red models for the remote estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations in turbid productive waters and evaluates several near infrared-red models developed within the last 34 years. Three models were calibrated for a dataset with chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and validated for independent and statistically different datasets with chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and 0 to 25 mg m(-3) for the spectral bands of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). The MERIS two-band model estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations slightly more accurately than the more complex models, with mean absolute errors of 2.3 mg m(-3) for chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 100 mg m(-3) and 1.2 mg m(-3) for chlorophyll-a concentrations from 0 to 25 mg m(-3). Comparable results from several near infrared-red models with different levels of complexity, calibrated for inland and coastal waters around the world, indicate a high potential for the development of a simple universally applicable near infrared-red algorithm.

AB Considerable controversy is associated with dry season increases in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), observed using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), compared with field-based estimates of decreasing plant productivity. Here, we investigate potential causes of intra-annual variability by comparing EVI from mature forest with field-measured Leaf Area Index (LAI) to validate space-based observations. EVI was calculated from 19 nadir and off-nadir Hyperion images in the 2005 dry season, and inspected for consistency with MODIS observations from 2004 to 2009. The objective was to evaluate the possible influence of the view-illumination geometry and of canopy foliage and leaf flush on the EVI. Spectral mixture models were used to evaluate the relationship between EVI and the shade fraction, a measure that varies with pixel brightness. MODIS LAI values were compared with LAI estimated using hemispherical photographs taken in two field campaigns in the dry season. To keep LAI and leaf flush conditions as constant variables and vary solar illumination, we used airborne Hyperspectral Mapper (Hymap) data acquired over mature forest from another region on the same day but with two distinct solar zenith angles (SZA) (29 degrees and 53 degrees). Results showed that intra-annual variability in MODIS and nadir Hyperion EVI in the dry season of tropical forest were driven by solar illumination effects rather than changes in LAI. The reflectance of the MODIS and Hyperion blue, red and near infrared (NIR) bands was higher at the end of the dry season because of the predominance of sunlit canopy components for the sensors due to decreasing SZA from June (44 degrees) to September (26 degrees). Because EVI was highly correlated with the reflectance of the NIR band used to generate it (r of + 0.98 for MOD1S and + 0.88 for Hyperion), this vegetation index followed the general NIR pattern, increasing with smaller SZA towards the end of the dry season. Hyperion EVI was inversely correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93). Changes in canopy foliage detected from MODIS LAI data were not consistent with LAI estimates from hemispherical photographs. Although further research is necessary to measure the impact of leaf flush on intra-annual EVI variability in the Querencia region, analysis of Hymap data with fixed LAI and leaf flush conditions confirmed the influence of the illumination effects on the EV1.

   mixture analysis
AB Desert spring ecosystems provide water resources essential for sustaining wildlife, plants, and humans inhabiting arid regions of the world. Disturbance processes in desert spring ecosystems are likely important but have not been well studied. Documentation of historic wildfires in these often remote areas has been inconsistent and proxy records are often not available. Remote sensing methods have been used in other environments to gain information about fires that have occurred over recent decades, but these methods have not been tested in desert spring environments. The differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) is the most commonly used method for delineating fire perimeters and burn severity mosaics, although another method, differenced linear spectral unmixing (dSmA), may produce more accurate results in heterogeneous desert spring ecosystems due to its ability to detect changes at the sub-pixel scale. This study compared dNBR and dSMA using field observations of burn presence and fire severity for two recent wildfires. The dNBR method outperformed dSMA, but required some post-processing manipulation to reduce errors of commission. The dNBR classification correctly indentified burned areas with 86% accuracy (3% omission error, 19% commission error) and classified fire severity with 76% accuracy. Misclassification errors were most common in dune and mesquite bosque/meadow land cover types (mean misclassification rate = 36%). Nine of the fifteen wildfires reported to have occurred in the study site were successfully identified, with five of the unidentified fires having reported sizes of less than one hectare. Additional refinement of remote sensing methods is necessary to better distinguish small (<5 ha) burned areas from areas of change resulting from soil moisture fluctuation and other short-term shifts in background conditions.

AB Surface energy budget is an important factor in weather and climate processes. To estimate the errors in satellite-retrieved surface radiation budget over the interior of China, instantaneous-footprint surface radiation fluxes from the Terra/Aqua FLASHFlux SSF product are compared with the measurements taken at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) from July 2008 to March 2010. Validation is performed separately for different conditions: clear-sky and cloudy-sky, daytime and nighttime for four seasons. Differences between the FLASHFlux CERES shortwave radiation flux and surface measurements have larger standard deviations in cloudy-sky conditions than in clear-sky conditions, indicating that cloud contamination increases uncertainty in the retrieval algorithm. Upward shortwave radiation flux (USW) is overestimated in cloudy conditions suggesting that the cloud parameters and surface scene type in the retrieval process are not optimal for northwestern China. The CERES downward longwave radiation fluxes (DLW) accurately follow the variation of surface measurements during daytime, but are slightly underestimated during nighttime due to the coarse sounding profile and undetected low clouds at nighttime. The CERES upwelling longwave radiation fluxes (ULW) are strongly underestimated during daytime but are slightly underestimated during nighttime regardless of cloud coverage. This large bias could be caused by an underestimate of surface skin temperature and/or surface emissivity, or spatial inhomogeneity around the site. Generally, except for diurnal ULW, other components of the surface radiative fluxes obtained from CERES SSF datasets are close to meeting the accuracy requirements for climate research.

AB Monitoring the extent and pattern of snow cover in the dry, high altitude, Trans Himalayan region (THR) is significant to understand the local and regional impact of ongoing climate change and variability. The freely available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover images, with 500 m spatial and daily temporal resolution, can provide a basis for regional snow cover mapping, monitoring and hydrological modelling. However, high cloud obscuration remains the main limitation. In this study, we propose a five successive step approach combining data from the Terra and Aqua satellites; adjacent temporal deduction; spatial filtering based on orthogonal neighbouring pixels; spatial filtering based on a zonal snowline approach; and temporal filtering based on zonal snow cycle to remove cloud obscuration from MODIS daily snow products. This study also examines the spatial and temporal variability of snow cover in the THR of Nepal in' the last decade. Since no ground stations measuring snow data are available in the region, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated by comparing the original MODIS snow cover data with least cloud cover against cloud-generated MODIS snow cover data, filled by clouds of another densely cloud-covered product. The analysis indicates that the proposed five-step method is efficient in cloud reduction (with average accuracy of >91%). The results show very high interannual and intra-seasonal variability of average snow cover, maximum snow extent and snow cover duration over the last decade. The peak snow period has been delayed by about 6.7 days per year and the main agropastoral production areas of the region were found to experience a significant decline in snow cover duration during the last decade.

AB The scan-line corrector (SIC) of the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor failed in 2003, resulting in about 22% of the pixels per scene not being scanned. The SLC failure has seriously limited the scientific applications of ETM+ data. While there have been a number of methods developed to fill in the data gaps, each method has shortcomings, especially for heterogeneous landscapes. Based on the assumption that the same-class neighboring pixels around the un-scanned pixels have similar spectral characteristics, and that these neighboring and un-scanned pixels exhibit similar patterns of spectral differences between dates, we developed a simple and effective method to interpolate the values of the pixels within the gaps. We refer to this method as the Neighborhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI). Simulated and actual SIC-off ETM+ images were used to assess the performance of the NSPI. Results indicate that NSPI can restore the value of un-scanned pixels very accurately, and that it works especially well in heterogeneous regions. In addition, it can work well even if there is a relatively long time interval or significant spectral changes between the input and target image. The filled images appear reasonably spatially continuous without obvious striping patterns. Supervised classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm was done on both gap-filled simulated SIC-off data and the original "gap free" data set, and it was found that classification results, including accuracies, were very comparable. This indicates that gap-filled products generated by NSPI will have relevance to the user community for various land cover applications. In addition, the simple principle and high computational efficiency of NSPI will enable processing large volumes of SIC-off ETM+ data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB An optimized artificial immune network-based classification model, namely OPTINC, was developed for remote sensing-based land use/land cover (LULC) classification. Major improvements of OPTINC compared to a typical immune network-based classification model (aiNet) include (1) preservation of the best antibodies of each land cover class from the antibody population suppression, which ensures that each land cover class is represented by at least one antibody; (2) mutation rates being self-adaptive according to the model performance between training generations, which improves the model convergence: and (3) incorporation of both Euclidean distance and spectral angle mapping distance to measure affinity between two feature vectors using a genetic algorithm-based optimization, which helps the model to better discriminate LULC classes with similar characteristics. OPTINC was evaluated using two sites with different remote sensing data: a residential area in Denver, CO with high-spatial resolution QuickBird image and LiDAR data, and a suburban area in Monticello, UT with HyMap hyperspectral imagery. A decision tree, a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network, and aiNet were also tested for comparison. Classification accuracy, local homogeneity of classified images, and model sensitivity to training sample size were examined. OPTINC outperformed the other models with higher accuracy and more spatially cohesive land cover classes with limited salt-and-pepper noise. OPTINC was relatively less sensitive to training sample size than the neural network, followed by the decision tree. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We calibrated upward sensing profiling and downward sensing scanning LiDAR systems to estimates of canopy fuel loading developed from field plots and allometric equations, and then used the LiDAR datasets to predict canopy bulk density (CBD) and crown fuel weight (CFW) in wildfire prone stands in the New Jersey Pinelands. LiDAR-derived height profiles were also generated in 1-m layers, and regressed on CBD estimates calculated for 1-m layers from field plots to predict three-dimensional canopy fuel loading. We then produced maps of canopy fuel metrics for three 9 km(2) forested areas in the Pinelands.
   Correlations for standard LiDAR-derived parameters between the two LiDAR systems were all highly significant, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.82 and 0.98. Stepwise linear regression models developed from the profiling LiDAR data predicted maximum CBD and CFW (r(2) = 0.94 and 0.92) better than those developed from the scanning LiDAR data (r(2) = 0.83 and 0.71, respectively). A single regression for the prediction of CBD at all canopy layers had r(2) values of 0.93 and 0.82 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Individual bin regressions for predicting CBD at each canopy height layer were also highly significant at most canopy heights, with r(2) values for each layer ranging between 0.36 and 0.89, and 0.44 and 0.99 for the profiling and scanning datasets, respectively. Relationships were poorest mid-canopy, where highest average values and highest variability in fuel loading occurred. Fit of data to Gaussian distributions of canopy height profiles facilitated a simpler expression of these parameters for analysis and mapping purposes, with overall r2 values of 0.86 and 0.92 for the profiling and scanning LiDAR datasets, respectively. Our research demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to generate accurate, three-dimensional representations of canopy structure and fuel loading at high spatial resolution by linking 1-m return height profiles to biometric estimates from field plots.

AB City size distributions, defined on the basis of population, are often described by power laws. Zipf's Law states that the exponent of the power law for rank-size distributions of cities is near -1. Verification of power law scaling for city size distributions at continental and global scales is complicated by small sample sizes, inappropriate estimation techniques, inconsistent definitions of urban extent and variations in the accuracy and spatial resolution of census administrative units. We attempt to circumvent some of these complications by using a continuous spatial proxy for anthropogenic development and treat it as a spatial complement to population distribution. We quantify the linearity and exponent of the rank-size distribution of spatially contiguous patches of stable night light over a range of brightnesses corresponding to different intensities of development. Temporally stable night lights, as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS), provide a unique proxy for anthropogenic development. Brightness and spatial extent of emitted light are correlated to population density (Sutton et al., 2001), built area density (Elvidge et al., 2007c) and economic activity (Doll et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2009) at global scales and within specific countries. Using a variable brightness threshold to derive spatial extent of developed land area eliminates the complication of administrative definitions of urban extent and makes it possible to test Zipf's Law in the spatial dimension for a wide range of anthropogenic development. Higher brightness thresholds generally correspond to more intense development while lower thresholds extend the lighted area to include smaller settlements and less intensively developed pen-urban and agricultural areas. Using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate power law linearity and exponent of the resulting rank-size distributions across a range of upper tail cutoffs, we consistently find statistically significant exponents in the range -0.95 to -1.11 with an abrupt transition to very large, extensively connected, spatial networks of development near the low light detection limit of the sensor. This range of exponents and transition are observed at both continental and global scales. The results suggest that Zipf's Law also holds for spatial extent of anthropogenic development across a range of intensities at both continental and global scales. The implication is that the dynamics of urban growth and development may be represented as spatial phase transitions when the spatial extent and intensity of development are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete entities.

AB The algorithms designed to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) using passive microwave measurements falter in lake-rich high-latitude environments due to the emission properties of ice covered lakes on low frequency measurements. Microwave emission models have been used to simulate brightness temperatures (Tbs) for snowpack characteristics in terrestrial environments but cannot be applied to snow on lakes because of the differing subsurface emissivities and scattering matrices present in ice. This paper examines the performance of a modified version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model that incorporates microwave emission from lake ice and sub-ice water. Inputs to the HUT model include measurements collected over brackish and freshwater lakes north of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada in April 2008, consisting of snowpack (depth, density, and snow water equivalent) and lake ice (thickness and ice type). Coincident airborne radiometer measurements at a resolution of 80 x 100 m were used as ground-truth to evaluate the simulations.
   The results indicate that subsurface media are simulated best when utilizing a modeled effective grain size and a 1 mm RMS surface roughness at the ice/water interface compared to using measured grain size and a flat Fresnel reflective surface as input. Simulations at 37 GHz (vertical polarization) produce the best results compared to airborne Tbs, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.2 K and 7.9 K, as well as Mean Bias Errors (MBEs) of -8.4 K and -8.8 K for brackish and freshwater sites respectively. Freshwater simulations at 6.9 and 19 GHz H exhibited low RMSE (10.53 and 6.15 K respectively) and MBE (-5.37 and 8.36 K respectively) but did not accurately simulate Tb variability (R= -0.15 and 0.01 respectively). Over brackish water, 6.9 GHz simulations had poor agreement with airborne Tbs, while 19 GHz V exhibited a low RMSE (6.15 K), MBE (-4.52 K) and improved relative agreement to airborne measurements (R= 0.47). Salinity considerations reduced 6.9 GHz errors substantially, with a drop in RMSE from 51.48 K and 57.18 K for H and V polarizations respectively, to 26.2 K and 31.6 K, although Tb variability was not well simulated. With best results at 37 GHz, HUT simulations exhibit the potential to track Tb evolution, and therefore SWE through the winter season. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A study was carried out to investigate the utility of L-band SAR data for estimating aboveground biomass in sites with low levels of vegetation regrowth. Data to estimate biomass were collected from 59 sites located in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in interior Alaska. PALSAR L-band data (HH and HV polarizations) collected on two dates in the summer/fall of 2007 and one date in the summer of 2009 were used. Significant linear correlations were found between the log of aboveground biomass (range of 0.02 to 22.2 t ha(-1)) and sigma degrees (L-HH) and sigma degrees (L-HV) for the data collected on each of the three dates, with the highest correlation found using the L-HV data collected when soil moisture was highest. Soil moisture, however, did change the correlations between L-band sigma degrees and aboveground biomass, and the analyses suggest that the influence of soil moisture is biomass dependent. The results indicate that to use L-band SAR data for mapping aboveground biomass and monitoring forest regrowth will require development of approaches to account for the influence that variations in soil moisture have on L-band microwave backscatter, which can be particularly strong when low levels of aboveground biomass occur.

AB Vegetation characteristics of a watershed can be important in estimating hydrological response variables (HRVs) such as streamflow (Q), evapotranspiration (ET), and river yield (Q/P). Quantifying the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation metrics and hydrological response to precipitation (P) has the potential to facilitate prediction of HRVs for ungauged watersheds, and/or aid in the assessment of watershed similarity as an initial phase of hydrological regionalization. The utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to estimate HRVs of watersheds at the regional scale (southern and central California) is tested in this study. An exhaustive statistical regression analysis was conducted to quantify the relationships between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs using both ordinary least squares and spatially varying parameter models. Additionally a confirmatory analysis was conducted to test the effect precipitation and potential evaporation have on the exploratory regression results. Results from both the exploratory and confirmatory analyses suggest that (1) while there are limitations in the water balance approach to estimating ET (errors associated with changes in storage and meteorological data are unknown), moderate statistical relationships exist between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs; (2) these relationships are heavily influenced by vegetation-precipitation relationships and general precipitation magnitudes; (3) relationships between MODIS metrics and precipitation/HRVs are strongest when drought conditions prevail; and (4) LAI has the strongest relationship with precipitation and HRVs compared to other MODIS vegetation metrics.

AB In New Caledonia (21 S, 165 E), shade-grown coffee plantations were abandoned for economic reasons in the middle of the 20th century. Coffee species (Coffee arabica, C canephora and C liberica) were introduced from Africa in the late 19th century, they survived in the wild and spontaneously cross-hybridized. Coffee species were originally planted in native forest in association with leguminous trees (mostly introduced species) to improve their growth. Thus the canopy cover over rustic shade coffee plantations is heterogeneous with a majority of large crowns, attributed to leguminous trees. The aim of this study was to identify suitable areas for coffee inter-specific hybridization in New Caledonia using field based environmental parameters and remotely sensed predictors. Due to the complex structure of tropical vegetation, remote sensing imagery needs to be spatially accurate and to have the appropriate bands for monitoring vegetation cover. Quickbird panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 0.6 to 0.7 m spatial resolutions and multispectral imagery at 2.4 m spatial resolution were pansharpened and used for this study. The two most suitable remotely sensed indicators, canopy heterogeneity and tree crown size, were acquired by the sequential use of tree crown detection (neural network), image processing (such as textural analysis) and classification. All models were supervised and trained on learning data determined by human expertise. The final model has two remotely sensed indicators and three physical parameters based on the Digital Elevation Model: elevation, slope and water flow accumulation. Using these five predictive variables as inputs, two modelling methods, a decision tree and a neural network, were implemented. The decision tree, which showed 96.9% accuracy on the test set, revealed the involvement of ecological parameters in the hybridization of Coffea species. We showed that hybrid zones could be characterized by combinations of modalities, underlining the complexity of the environment concerned. For instance, forest heterogeneity and large crown size, steep slopes (>53.5%) and elevation between 194 and 429 m asl, are favourable factors for Coffea inter-specific hybridization. The application of the neural network on the whole area gave a predictive map that distinguished the most suitable areas by means of a nonlinear continuous indicator. The map provides a confidence level for each area. The most favourable areas were geographically localized, providing a clue for the detection and conservation of favourable areas for Coffea species neo-diversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study aims to map and discriminate rangeland degradation from the effects of precipitation variability and thereby identify the driving forces of degradation in the grazing areas of Ghiling in Upper Mustang, Nepal. Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, and SPOT images covering the years 1976-2008 were analyzed. 8 km resolution NOAA NDVI from 1981 to 2006 were used to identify the long term interrelationship between vegetation greenness and precipitation variability. The use of time series residual of the NDVI/precipitation linear regression to normalize the precipitation effect on vegetation productivity and identify the long term degradation was extended at the local scale. A weighted grazing pressure surface model was developed combining information from satellite images, topography, forage availability and detailed field work data on points of livestock concentration, herders' ranking of forage quality and grazing pattern in each pasture unit. The grazing pressure of a given site was defined as the product of annual net stocking density and the inverse of the total friction of livestock movement. While annual precipitation was found as the dominant factor for the interannual vegetation variability, degradation in Upper Mustang was the result of grazing induced change and some localized natural processes.

AB Recent large-scale dieback of pinon-juniper (P-J) woodlands and forests across the western US occurred as a result of multi-year drought and subsequent insect and disease outbreaks. P-J vegetation is spatially extensive, thus large-scale mortality events such as the one that has occurred over the past several years could significantly alter regional carbon (C) budgets. Our objective was to use a remote sensing technique coupled with field-based data to estimate changes in aboveground live C stocks across a 4100 km(2) region of Colorado caused by P-J tree mortality. We hypothesized that dieback would amplify the phenological dynamics of P-J vegetation, and these variations would be related to drought-induced losses of live P-J aboveground biomass (AGB) that are discernible using time-series remote sensing vegetation data. Here, we assess live P-J AGB loss using dry season fractional photosynthetic vegetation cover (PV) derived from multi-year Landsat images. Our results showed a strong linear positive relationship between the maximum decline in PV and field-measured losses of live P-J AGB during the period 2000-05 (r(2) = 0.64, p = 0.002). These results were then used to map AGB losses throughout the study region. Mean live aboveground C loss (+/- sd) was 10.0 (+/- 3.4) Mg C ha(-1). Total aboveground live P-J C loss was 4.6 Tg C. which was approximately 39 times higher than the concurrent C loss attributed to wildfire and management treatments within or near to the national forests of the study region. Our results suggest that spatially extensive mortality events such as the one observed in P-J woodlands across the western US in the past decade may significantly alter the ecosystem C balance for decades to come. Remote sensing techniques to monitor changes in aboveground C stocks, such as the one developed in our study, may support regional and global C monitoring in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Lake Tanganyika is one of the world's great freshwater ecosystems. In recent decades its hydrodynamic characteristics have undergone important changes that have had consequences on the lake's primary productivity. The establishment of a long-term Ocean Color dataset for Lake Tanganyika is a fundamental tool for understanding and monitoring these changes. We developed an approach to create a regionally calibrated dataset of chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) and attenuation coefficients at 490 nm (K490) for the period from July 2002 to December 2006 using daily calibrated radiances retrieved from the MODIS-Aqua sensor. Standard MODIS Aqua Ocean Color products were found to not provide a suitable calibration for high altitude lakes such as the Lake Tanganyika. An optimization of the extraction process and the validation of the dataset were performed with independent sets of in situ measurements. Our results show that for the geographical, atmospheric and optical conditions of Lake Tanganyika: (i) a coastal aerosol model set with high relative humidity (90%) provides a suitable atmospheric correction; (ii) a significant correlation between in situ data and CHL estimates using the MODIS specific OC3 algorithm is possible; and (iii) K490 estimates provide a good level of significance. The resulting validated time series of bio-optical properties provides a fundamental information base for the study of phytoplankton and primary production dynamics and interannual trends. A comparison between surface chlorophyll-a concentrations estimated from field monitoring and from the MODIS based dataset shows that remote sensing allows improved detection of surface blooms in Lake Tanganyika.

AB Time series of optical satellite images acquired at high spatial resolution is a potentially useful source of information for monitoring agricultural practices. However, the information extracted from this source is often hampered by missing acquisitions or uncertain radiometric values. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses this issue by combining time series of satellite images with information from crop growth modeling and expert knowledge. In a fuzzy framework, a decision support system that combines multi-source information was designed to automatically detect the sugarcane harvest at field scale. The formalism that we used deals with the imprecision of the data and the approximation of expert reasoning. System performances were analyzed using a time series of SPOT-5 images. Results obtained were in substantial agreement with ground truth data: overall accuracy reached 97.80% with stability values exceeding 89.21% for all decisions. The contribution of fuzzy sets to overall accuracy reached 15.08%. The approach outlined in this paper is very promising and could be very useful for other agricultural applications.

AB Large areas of forest in the US and Canada are affected by insects and disease each year. Over the past century, outbreaks of the Eastern spruce budworm have become more frequent and severe. The notion of designing a more pest resistant landscape through prescriptive management practices hinges on our ability to effectively model forest-insect dynamics at regional scales. Increasingly, more detailed pixel-wise estimates of forest biophysical parameters are needed for such endeavors. Lidar technology, although promising, is not yet viable for repeated regional accounting, necessitating the development of methods which take advantage of existing spaceborne assets. Our objective is to use one of these assets (SPOT-5) to estimate a large set of forest structural attributes at a finer spatial grain size (5 m and 10 m) over a broader area than is currently available for the purpose of supplying needed input data for disturbance simulation modeling. We employ neighborhood statistics (standard deviation, variance, sill variance, and ratios of these metrics at 5 and 10 m) calculated from SPOT-5 sensor data and derivatives to estimate and map tree canopy diameter (CDIA), bole diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (HT), crown closure (CC), vertical length of live crown (LC), and basal area (BA). A partial least squares (PLS) regression approach was used with these local statistics and field data to produce models for pixel-wise estimation and mapping of mean values, respectively, for hardwood and coniferous forest CDIA (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.93, RMSE 0.62 and 0.47 m), DBH (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.90, RMSE 2.92 and 3.75 cm), HT (R-2 = 0.69 and 0.92, RMSE 1.27 and 1.59 m), CC (R-2 = 0.52 and 0.68, RMSE 5.49 and 6.02%), LC (R-2 = 0.58 and 0.81, RMSE 0.96 and 1.25 m), and BA (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.74, RMSE 2.47 and 4.58 m(2) ha(-1)) for a 3600 km(2) area in northeast Minnesota. This approach for quantifying forest structure is robust in the sense that a detailed forest cover type map is not required to stratify analysis at any step in the process. Hence, we show that multi-resolution SPOT-5 data are a practical alternative to lidar for regional characterization of forest biophysical parameters. However, lidar data may potentially be used to calibrate these SPOT-based structure models in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-temporal TerraSAR-X, ASAR/ENVISAT and PALSAR SAR data acquired at various incidence angles and polarizations were analyzed to study the potential of these new spaceborne SAR systems for monitoring sugarcane crops. The sensitivity of different radar parameters (wavelength, incidence angles, and polarization) to sugarcane growth stages was analyzed to determine the most suitable radar configuration for better characterisation of sugarcane fields and in particular the monitoring of sugarcane harvest. Correlation between backscattered signals and crop height was also carried out. Radar signal increased quickly with sugarcane height until a threshold height, which depended on radar wavelength and incidence angle. Beyond this threshold, the signal increased only slightly, remained constant, or even decreased. The threshold height is higher with longer wavelengths (L-band in comparison with C- and X-bands) and higher incidence angles (similar to 40 degrees in comparison with similar to 20 degrees).
   The radar backscattering coefficients (sigma degrees) were also compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from SPOT-4/5 images. Results showed a high correlation between the behaviors of sigma degrees and NDVI as a function of sugarcane crop parameters. A decrease in NDVI for fully mature sugarcane fields due to drying of the sugarcane (water stress) was also observed in the radar signal. This decrease in radar signal was of the same order as the decrease in radar signal after the sugarcane harvest. In general, it is more suitable to monitor the sugarcane harvest using high incidence angles regardless of the radar wavelength. SAR data in L- and C-bands showed an ambiguity between the signals of ploughed fields and those of fields in vegetation because of the high sensitivity of the radar signal at these wavelengths to surface roughness of bare soils. Indeed, sometimes the radar signal of ploughed fields was of the same order as that of harvested or mature sugarcane fields. Results showed better discrimination between ploughed fields and sugarcane fields in vegetation (sugarcane canopy) when using TerraSAR-X data (X-band).
   Concerning the influence of radar polarization, results showed that the co-polarizations channels (HH and VV) were well correlated, but had slightly less potential than cross-polarization channels (HV and VH) for the detection of the sugarcane harvest Finally, SAR data at high spatial resolution were shown to be useful and necessary for better analysis of SAR images when the fields were of small size.

AB The temporal evolution of the backscatter coefficient, sigma-nought (sigma degrees) from QuikSCAT was evaluated for monitoring ice phenology on Great Bear Lake (66 degrees N, 121 degrees W) and Great Slave Lake (61 degrees 40'N, 114 degrees W), Northwest Territories, Canada. Results indicated that sigma degrees from QuikSCAT can be used to detect melt onset, water clear of ice and freeze onset dates on both lakes. An ice phenology algorithm was then developed to assess the spatiotemporal variability on both lakes from QuikSCAT for the period 2000-2006. Results showed that for Great Slave Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on year day (YD) 123, the average water clear of ice date was on YD164, and the average freeze onset date was on YD330. On Great Bear Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on YD139, the average water clear of ice date was YD191, and the average freeze onset date was YD321. Ice cover remained present for at least five weeks longer on Great Bear Lake than on Great Slave Lake and most of the difference can be explained by earlier ice melt on Great Slave Lake. Spatially, on Great Bear Lake, melt onset took place first in the eastern arm, water clear of ice occurred first in southeastern and western arms, and freeze onset appeared first in the northern arm and along the shorelines. On Great Slave Lake, melt onset began first in the central basin and then progressed to the northern and eastern arms later in the season. The central basin of Great Slave Lake cleared earlier than the periphery due to the discharge from the Slave River. Freeze onset on Great Slave Lake occurred first within the east arm, closely followed by the north and west arms, and then finally in the centre of the main basin. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Optical techniques were investigated to enhance current bloom detection capabilities in support of an operational system for forecasting harmful Karenia brevis blooms along the west coast of Florida. within the Gulf of Mexico. Algorithms pertaining to backscatter and changes in spectral shape of remote-sensing reflectance were applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS imagery during known K. brevis and non-K. brevis events. A method to remove resuspended chlorophyll in Texas showed limited use when applied to several scenes following tropical storms off the west Florida coast. This analysis suggests that an ensemble image approach, wherein a combination of a chlorophyll anomaly, spectral shape at 490 nm and a backscatter ratio product would provide an improvement in satellite detection of K. brevis blooms. For southwest Florida, the combination of these methods through an ensemble approach may lead to an increase in user accuracy by 30-50%, as a result of correctly identifying non-K. brevis features. Where available, MODIS FLH scenes were analyzed to determine their use in K. brevis detection. However, insufficient imagery was available to make a fair assessment. Similar approaches could be applied to bloom tracking and monitoring in other regions. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Seasonal snow cover in South America was examined in this study using passive microwave satellite data from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on board the Nimbus-7 satellite and the Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSM/I) on board Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. For the period from 1979-2006, both snow cover extent and snow water equivalent (snow mass) were investigated during the coldest months (May-September), primarily in the Patagonia area of Argentina and in the Andes of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, where most of the seasonal snow is found. Since winter temperatures in this region are often above freezing, the coldest winter month was found to be the month having the most extensive snow cover and usually the month having the deepest snow cover as well. Sharp year-to-year differences were recorded using the passive microwave observations. The average snow cover extent for July, the month with the greatest average extent during the 28-year period of record, is 321,674 km(2). In July of 1984, the average monthly snow cover extent was 701,250 km(2) - the most extensive coverage observed between 1979 and 2006. However, in July of 1989, snow cover extent was only 120,000 km2. The 28-year period of record shows a sinusoidal like pattern for both snow cover and snow mass, though neither trend is significant at the 95% level. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Soil moisture will be mapped globally by the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to be launched in 2009. The expected soil moisture accuracy will be 4.0 %v/v. The core component of the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm is the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model which simulates the microwave emission at L-band from the soil-vegetation layer. The model parameters have been calibrated with data acquired by tower mounted radiometer studies in Europe and the United States, with a typical footprint size of approximately 10 m. In this study. aircraft L-band data acquired during the National Airborne Field Experiment (NAFE) intensive campaign held in South-eastern Australia in 2005 are used to perform the first evaluation of the L-MEB model and its proposed parameterization when applied to coarser footprints (62.5 m), The model could be evaluated across large areas including a wide range of land surface conditions, typical of the Australian environment. Soil moisture was retrieved from the aircraft brightness temperatures using L-MEB and ground measured ancillary data (soil temperature, soil texture, vegetation water content and surface roughness) and subsequently evaluated against ground measurements of soil moisture. The retrieval accuracy when using the L-MEB 'default' set of model parameters was found to be better than 4.0 %v/v only over grassland covered sites. Over crops the model was found to underestimate soil moisture by up to 32 %v/v. After site specific calibration of the vegetation and roughness parameters, the retrieval accuracy was found to be equal or better than 4.8 %v/v for crops and grasslands at 62.5-m resolution. it is suggested that the proposed value of roughness parameter H(R) for crops is too low, and that variability of HR With Soil moisture must be taken into consideration to obtain accurate retrievals at these scales. The analysis presented here is a crucial step towards validating the application of L-MEB for soil moisture retrieval from satellite observations in an operational context. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a novel approach for performing environmental gradient analysis to address the question: is maximum potential tree density in eastern Lake Tahoe Basin, NV limited by water, temperature/energetic constraints, or both? To address this question we fuse continuous tree density estimates derived from hyperspatial remote sensing imagery (pixels smaller than trees) with two topographically derived environmental gradients: elevation and yearly potential relative radiation (PRR). We based our analysis on the maximum tree density found in each of over 200 environmental gradient combinations found with our area of interest, drawing from a dataset consisting of over 300,000 30 m plots and over 3 million individual trees. At a given elevation, sites in which maximum tree density increases as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered to be temperature or energy limited. Conversely, sites in which maximum tree density decreased as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered water limited. We found that eastern Lake Tahoe appears to be a landscape which is both water limited (at lower elevation and brighter, south-facing slopes) and temperature/energy limited (at higher elevations and darker, north-facing slopes). We discuss how fusing accurate and ecologically relevant remote sensing outputs with direct and indirect continuous microclimate surfaces can provide a powerful tool for addressing major questions of tree distributions and life history parameters.

AB Tracking land cover changes using remotely-sensed data contributes to evaluating to what extent human activities impact the environment. Recent studies have pointed out some limitations of single-date comparisons between years and have emphasized the usefulness of time series. However, less effort has hitherto been dedicated to properly account for the temporal dependences typifying the successive images of a time series. An automated change detection method based on a per-object approach and on a probabilistic procedure is proposed here to better cope with this issue. This innovative procedure is applied to a tropical forest environment using high temporal resolution SPOT-VEGETATION time series from 2001 and 2004 in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. The principle of the method is to identify the objects that most deviate from an unchanged reference defined by objective rules. A probabilistic changed-unchanged threshold provides a change map where each object is associated with a likelihood of having changed. This improvement on a binary diagnostic makes the method relevant to meet the requirements of different users, ranging from a comprehensive detection of changes to a detection of the most dramatic changes. According to the threshold value, overall accuracy indices of up to 91 % were obtained, with errors involving change omissions for the most part. The isolation of changes within objects was made possible through a segmentation procedure implemented in a temporal context. In addition, the method was formulated so as to differentiate between inter- and intra-annual vegetation dynamics. These technical peculiarities will likely make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes in environments subject to a strongly marked phenology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper describes applications of non-parametric and parametric methods for estimating forest growing stock volume using Landsat images on the basis of data measured in the field, integrated with ancillary information. Several k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm configurations were tested in two study areas in Italy belonging to Mediterranean and Alpine ecosystems. Field data were acquired by the regional forest inventory and forest management plans, and satellite images are from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+. The paper describes the data used, the methodologies adopted and the results achieved in terms of pixel level accuracy of forest growing stock volume estimates. The results show that several factors affect estimation accuracy when using the k-NN method. For the two test areas a total of 3500 different configurations of the k-NN algorithm were systematically tested by changing the number and type of spectral and ancillary input variables, type of multidimensional distance measures, number of nearest neighbors and methods for spectral feature extraction using the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure. The best k-NN configurations were then used for pixel level estimation; the accuracy was estimated with a bootstrapping procedure; and the results were compared to estimates obtained using parametric regression methods implemented on the same data set. The best k-NN growing stock volume pixel level estimates in the Alpine area have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging between 74 and 96 m(3) ha(-1) (respectively, 22% and 28% of the mean measured value) and between 106 and 135 m(3) ha(-1) (respectively, 44% and 63% of the mean measured value) in the Mediterranean area. On the whole, the results cast a promising light on the use of non-parametric techniques for forest attribute estimation and mapping with accuracy high enough to support forest planning activities in such complex landscapes. The results of the LOO analyses also highlight the importance of a local empirical optimization phase of the k-NN procedure before defining the best algorithm configuration. In the tests performed the pixel level accuracy increased, depending on the k-NN configuration, as much as 100%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using five-year (2001-2005) ground-observed snow depth and cloud cover data at 20 climatic stations in Northern Xinjiang, China, this study: 1) evaluates the accuracy of the 8-day snow cover product (MOD10A2) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra satellite, 2) generates a new snow cover time series by separating the MODIS cloud masked pixels as snow and land, and 3) examines the temporal variability of snow area extent (SAE) and correlations of air temperature and elevation with SAE. Results show that, under clear sky conditions, the MOD10A2 has high accuracies when mapping snow (94%) and land (99%) at snow depth >= 4 cm, but a very low accuracy (<39%) for patchy snow or thin snow depth (<4 cm). Most of the patchy snow is misclassified as land. The mean accuracy of the cloud mask used in MOD10A2 for December, January and February is very low (19%). Based on the ratio of snow to land of ground observations in each month, the new snow cover time series generated in this study provides a better representation of actual snow cover for the study area. The SAE (%) time series exhibits similar patterns during six hydrologic years (2001-2006), even though the accumulation and melt periods do not exactly coincide. The variation of SAE is negatively associated with air temperature over the range of -10 degrees C to 5 degrees C. An increase in elevation generally results in longer periods of snow cover, but the influence of elevation on SAE decreases as elevation exceeds 4 km in the Ili River Watershed (IRW). The number of days with snow cover shows either a decreasing trend or no trend in the IRW and the entire study area in the study period. This result is inconsistent with a reported increasing trend based on limited in situ observations. Long-term continuance of the MODIS snow cover product is critical to resolve this dilemma because the in situ observations appear to undersample the region. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The vertical attenuation coefficient of diffuse downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (K-d 490) is a parameter that we routinely derive from SeaWiFS images of the Baltic Sea. Here, through model simulations, we examine the relationship between Kd(490), and the vertical attenuation coefficient of PAR (Kd PAR), as this later coefficient determines the light available for aquatic photosynthesis. A simple semi-analytical model is used to predict Kd(490) and Kd(PAR), as a function of the concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), suspended inorganic, and suspended organic particulate material. A series of model simulations based on variations in these optically significant constituents over a range realistic for the Baltic Sea, are used to define the relationship between the two attenuation coefficients.
   K-d(PAR) = 0.6677K(d)(490)(0.6763).
   This relationship was verified, using data collected independently from the data set used to derive model coefficients, and appears robust when applied to the Baltic Sea. Comparison to other studies and model sensitivity analyses suggest that the relationship will be dependent on relatively large regional variations in CDOM absorption. A relationship between K-d(490) and Secchi disk depth was also developed and verified. This relationship while useful was more uncertain. The uncertainty was related to a greater influence of scattering on Secchi disk depth estimates and the corresponding parameterization of scattering in our model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Offset fields between pairs of JERS-1 satellite SAR data acquired in winter with 44 days time interval were employed for the estimation of Arctic glacier motion over Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya and Franz-Josef Land. The displacement maps show that the ice caps are divided into a number of clearly defined fast-flowing units with displacement larger than about 6 in in 44 days (i.e. 50 m/year). The estimated error of the JERS-1 offset tracking derived displacement is on the order of 20 m/year. Occasionally, azimuth streaks related to auroral zone ionospheric disturbances were detected and dedicated processing steps were applied to minimize their influence on the estimated motion pattern. Our analysis demonstrated that offset tracking of L-band SAR images is a robust and direct estimation technique of glacier motion. The method is particularly useful when differential SAR interferometry is limited by loss of coherence, i.e. for rapid and incoherent flow and large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images. The JERS-1 results, obtained using SAR data acquired by a satellite operated until 1998, raise expectations of L-band SAR data from the ALOS satellite launched in early 2006. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The study and management of biological communities depends on systems of classification and mapping for the organization and communication of resource information. Recent advances in remote sensing technology may enable the mapping of forest plant associations using image classification techniques. But few areas outside Europe have alliances and associations described in detail sufficient to support remote sensing-based modeling. Northwestern Montana has one of the few completed plant association classifications in the United States compliant with the recently established National Vegetation Classification system. This project examined the feasibility of mapping forest plant associations using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data and advanced remote sensing technology and image classification techniques.
   Suitable reference data were selected from an extensive regional database of plot records. Fifteen percent of the plot samples were reserved for validation of map products, the remainder of plots designated as training data for map modeling. Key differentiae for image classification were identified from a suite of spectral and biophysical variables. Fuzzy rules were formulated for partitioning physiognomic classes in the upper levels of our image classification hierarchy. Nearest neighbor classifiers were developed for classification of lower levels (alliances and associations), where spectral and biophysical contrasts are less distinct.
   Maps were produced to reflect nine forest alliances and 24 associations across the study area. Error matrices were constructed for each map based on stratified random selections of map validation samples. Accuracy for the alliance map was estimated at 60%. Association classifiers provide between 54 and 86% accuracy within their respective alliances. Alternative techniques are proposed for aggregating classes and enhancing decision tree classifiers to model alliances and associations for interior forest types. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing data open up new opportunities for analyzing urban areas characterized by a large variety of spectrally distinct surface materials. Spectroscopic analysis using diagnostic spectral features yields the potential for automated identification and mapping of these materials. This study proposes a new approach for the determination and evaluation of such spectral features that are robust against spectral overlap between material classes and within-class variability. Analysis is based on comprehensive field and image spectral libraries of more than 21,000 spectra of surface materials widely-used in German cities. The robustness of the interactively defined spectral features is evaluated by a separability analysis. This method is performed based on confusion matrices for each material computed from classification results. For comparison this analysis is also performed for material-specific gray values of selected bands. The obtained commission and omission errors show superiority of the spectral features compared to gray values for most of the investigated materials. The results indicate that robust spectral features yield the potential for unsupervised detection of endmembers in hyperspectral image data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Air quality monitoring by satellite imagery is a potential complementary tool to in-situ measurements. Deriving particulate matter (PM) from the satellite derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is not straightforward. The relation between the two quantities is not explicit or, if so, too many unknowns exist. The idea, proposed by Pelletier et al. [Pelletier, B., Santer, R., & Vidot, J. (in press). Retrieving of particulate matter from optical measurements: A semiparametric approach. Journal of Geophysical Research, 112. doi:10.1029/2005JD006737], is to involve in the associations PM-AOT auxiliary meteorological information using a statistical approach. We use this method first on optical ground measurements and second on SeaWiFS imagery in the framework of a regional European project. A SeaWiFS archive was processed both over land and over ocean to produce AOT. A database was developed to associate locally and daily SeaWiFS AOT and PM. A part of this database was used to train the statistical method; another part of it was used for validation. Results are promising. Overall, the method allows retrieving the PM10 with a coefficient of determination of 0.42 and the PM2.5 with a coefficient of determination of 0.48. The outputs of this work are PM 10 SeaWiFS maps and a limited comparison with in-situ data is reported. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB National forest inventory programs are tasked to produce timely and accurate estimates for a wide range of forest resource variables for a variety of users and applications. Time, cost, and precision constraints cause these programs to seek technological innovations that contribute to measurement and estimation efficiencies and that facilitate the production and distribution of an increasing array of inventory data, estimates, and derived products. Many of the recent innovations have involved remotely sensed data and related statistical estimation techniques. Current applications of remote sensing in support of national forest inventories are reviewed for three areas: (1) observation or measurement, meaning using remotely sensed data in lieu of field observations or measurements; (2) estimation, meaning calculation of traditional inventory areal estimates such as forest area or volume per unit area; and (3) mapping. Future applications focus on two areas: augmenting field measurements with remotely sensed data obtained from lidar sensors and Internet accessible map-based estimation.

AB We studied the surface deformations affecting the southeastern sector of the Po Plain sedimentary basin, in particular the area of Bologna. To this aim an advanced DInSAR technique, referred to as DInSAR-SBAS (Small BAseline Subset), has been applied. This technique allows monitoring the temporal evolution of a deformation phenomenon, via the generation of mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series from a data set of acquired SAR images. In particular, we have processed a set of SAR data acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) sensors and compared the achieved results with optical levelling measurements, assumed as reference. The surface displacements detected by DInSAR SBAS from 1992 to 2000 are between 10 mm/year in the historical part of Bologna town, and up to 59 mm/year in the NE industrial and agricultural areas. Former measurements from optical levelling referred to 1897 show 2-3 mm/year vertical movements. This trend of displacement increased in the second half of the 20th century and the subsidence rate reached 60 mm/year. We compared the more recent levelling campaigns (in 1992 and late 1999) and DInSAR results from 1992 to 1999. The standard deviation of the difference between levelling data, projected onto the satellite Line Of Sight, and DInSAR results is 2 mm/year. This highlights a good agreement between the measurements provided by two different techniques. The explanation of soil movements based on interferometric results, ground data and geological observations, allowed confirming the anthropogenic cause (surface effect due to the overexploitation of the aquifers) and highlights a natural, tectonic, subsidence.

AB From July-December 2004 the experimental campaign 'Bray 2004' was conducted in the coniferous forest of Les Landes near Bordeaux, France, using a multi-angle L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer to measure from above the forest at horizontal polarization. At the same time, ground measurements were taken of soil and litter moisture content, while precipitation was also permanently monitored. This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band signal from forested areas for different wetness conditions and viewing angles. This is especially relevant for solving the problem of heterogeneity since a large fraction of SMOS pixels (similar to 30 x 30 km 2) is partially covered by forest.
   This paper describes the objectives and the overall set-up of the Bray-2004 experiment and shows some first results. The greater part of the horizontally polarized L-band signal is found to be dominated by the influence of physical temperature. Variations in soil and/or litter moisture content are visible in the angular signal and in the above-canopy microwave emission, although the dynamic range of this last effect is very small. This, together with the fact that emissivity values are very high, is possibly due to the presence of a substantial litter layer. However, decoupling of soil and litter effects is difficult because of the strong correlation found between soil and litter moisture. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The scope of this study is to establish the parameters of the L-band (1.4 GHz) Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model (L-MEB) for grass covers, and to assess surface soil moisture retrievals in areas covered by grass. L-MEB parameters are key ancillary information for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) retrieval algorithm that produces estimates of the surface soil moisture from measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band.
   L-band data sets from three ground-based experiments over grass are analysed in this paper: BARC (orchard grass and alfalfa), ELBARA-ETH (clover grass), and SMOSREX (grass and litter from a field left fallow). Modelling of the brightness temperature using the zero-th order radiative transfer model in L-MEB indicates that the vegetation appears isotropic to microwaves propagating with horizontal polarisation, and that the single scattering albedo can be neglected. At vertical polarisation, non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. Surface soil moisture is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil and litter emission are calibrated beforehand. Then surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth can be left as free parameters in the retrieval process. Finally, the study highlights the importance of detecting strong emission and attenuation by wet vegetation and litter due to rainfall interception in order to obtain accurate estimates of the surface soil moisture. The study illustrates how strong rainfall interception can be flagged straightforwardly using a microwave polarisation index. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   PROSPECT
AB Research has shown that remote sensing techniques can be used for assessing live fuel moisture content (LFMC) from space. The need for dynamic monitoring of the fire risk environment favors the use of fast, site-specific, empirical models for assessing local vegetation moisture status, albeit with some uncertainties. These uncertainties may affect the accuracy of decisions made by fire managers using remote sensing derived LFMC. Consequently, the analysis of these LFMC retrieval uncertainties and their impact on applications, such as fire spread prediction, is needed to ensure the informed use of remote sensing derived LFMC measurements by fire managers. The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, one of the most fireprone regions in the southeastern United States was chosen as our study area. Our study estimates the uncertainties associated with empirical site specific retrievals using NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index; (R-0.86 - R-1.24) / (R-0.86+R-1.24)) and NDII (Normalized Difference Infrared Index; (R-0.86 - R-1.64) / (R-0.86+R-1.64)) that are simulated by coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer models. In order to support the findings from those simulations, a second approach estimates uncertainties using actual MODIS derived indices over Georgia Forestry Commission stations that provide NFDRS model estimates of LFMC. Finally, we used the FARSITE surface fire behavior model to examine the sensitivity of fire spread rates to live fuel moisture content for the NFDRS high pocosin and southern rough fuel models found in Okefenokee. This allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of satellite based LFMC estimations for use in fire behavior predictions. Sensitivity to LFMC (measured as percentage of moisture weight per unit dry weight of fuel) was analyzed in terms of no-wind no-slope spread rates as well as normalized spread rates. Normalized spread rates, defined as the ratio of spread rate at a particular LFMC to the spread rate at LFMC of 125 under similar conditions, were used in order to make the results adaptable to any wind-slope conditions. Our results show that NDWI has a stronger linear relationship to LFMC than NDII, and can consequently estimate LFMC with lesser uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis shows that 66% of NDWI based LFMC retrievals over non-sparsely vegetated regions are expected to have errors less than 32, while 90% of retrievals should be within an error margin of 56. In pocosin fuel models, under low LFMC conditions (< 100), retrieval errors could lead to normalized spread rate errors of 6.5 which may be equivalent to an error of 47 m/h in no-wind no-slope conditions. For southern rough fuel models, when LFMC < 175, LFMC retrieval errors could amount to normalized spread rate errors of 0.6 or an equivalent error of 9.3 m/h in no-wind no-slope conditions. These spread rate error estimates represent approximately the upper bound of errors resulting from uncertainties in empirical retrievals of LFMC over forested regions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB According to the IPCC GPG (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Good Practice Guidance), remote sensing methods are especially suitable for independent verification of the national LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) carbon pool estimates, particularly the aboveground biomass. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential of standwise (forest stand is a homogenous forest unit with average size of 1-3 ha) forest inventory data, and ASTER and MODIS satellite data for estimating stand volume (m(3) ha(-1)) and aboveground biomass (t ha(-1)) over a large area of boreal forests in southern Finland. The regression models, developed using standwise forest inventory data and standwise averages of moderate spatial resolution ASTER data (15 in x 15 in), were utilized to estimate stand volume for coarse resolution MODIS pixels (250 in x 250 in). The MODIS datasets for three 8-day periods produced slightly different predictions, but the averaged MODIS data produced the most accurate estimates. The inaccuracy in radiometric calibration between the datasets, the effect of gridding and compositing artifacts and phenological variability are the most probable reasons for this variability. Averaging of the several MODIS datasets seems to be one possibility to reduce bias. The estimates obtained were significantly close to the district-level mean values provided by the Finnish National Forest Inventory; the relative RMSE was 9.9%. The use of finer spatial resolution data is an essential step to integrate ground measurements with coarse spatial resolution data. Furthermore, the use of standwise forest inventory data reduces co-registration errors and helps in solving the scaling problem between the datasets. The approach employed here can be used for estimating the stand volume and biomass, and as required independent verification data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) use both Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-5 TM imagery to monitor short-term woody vegetation changes throughout Queensland, Australia. In order to analyse more subtle long-term vegetation change, time-based trends resulting from artefacts introduced by the sensor system must be removed. In this study, a reflectance-based vicarious calibration approach using high-reflectance, pseudo-invariant targets in western Queensland was developed. This calibration procedure was used to test the existing calibration models for ETM+ and TM, and develop a consistent operational calibration procedure which provides calibration information for the MSS sensors. Ground based data, sensor spectral response functions and atmospheric variables were used as input to MODTRAN radiative transfer code to estimate top-of-atmosphere radiance. The estimated gains for Landsat-7 ETM+ (1999-2003), -5 TM (1987-2004), -5 MSS (1984-1993) and -2 MSS (1979-1982) are presented. Results confirm the stability and accuracy of the ETM+ calibration, and the suitability of this data as a radiometric standard for cross-calibration with TM. Vicarious data support the use of the existing TM calibration model for the red and two shortwave-infrared bands. However, alternative models for blue, green and near-infrared bands are presented. The models proposed differ most noticeably at dates prior to 1995, with differences in estimated gains of up to 9.7%, 10.8% and 6.9% for the blue, green and near-infrared bands respectively. Vicarious gains for Landsat-2 MSS and Landsat-5 MSS are presented and are compared with those applied by the on-board calibration system. Updated calibration coefficients to scale MSS data to the SLATS vicarious measurements are given. The removal of time based calibration trends in the SLATS data archive will enable the measurement of vegetation changes over the 26 year period covered by Landsat -2, -5 and -7.

AB This paper focuses on the high accuracy geo-location and co-registration performance operationally obtained for the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data via a robust production algorithm. The MISR instrument (which is part of the payload for NASA's Terra spacecraft) continuously acquires systematic, global, multi-angle imagery in reflected sunlight since it was launched in December 1999, with the objective of supporting ecology and climate studies. The moderate resolution data need to be autonomously geo-rectified prior to being used in subsequent scientific retrievals. This is particularly critical to the unique cloud height/wind retrievals which require sub-pixel co-registration accuracies on a global basis. In order to address this problem, the MISR ground data processing system is based on a fully photograrnmetric approach and is complemented with a quality monitoring system used to verify performance globally and over desired time periods. The georectification requirements were developed from a series of data quality investigations based partially on sensitivity requirements for the cloud height/wind retrieval algorithm. An update to the nominal production algorithm has been implemented, and the final operational results are presented in this paper. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive canopy characterization of forests is derived from the combined remote sensing signal of imaging spectrometry and large footprint LIDAR. The inversion of two linked physically based Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) provided the platform for synergistically exploiting the specific and independent information dimensions obtained by the two earth observation systems. Due to its measurement principle, LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) is particularly suited to assess the horizontal and vertical canopy structure of forests, while the spectral measurements of imaging spectrometry are specifically rich on information for biophysical and -chemical canopy properties. In the presented approach, the specific information content inherent to the observations of the respective sensor was not only able to complement the canopy characterization, but also helped to solve the ill-posed problem of the RTM inversion. The theoretical feasibility of the proposed earth observation concept has been tested on a synthetic data set generated by a forest growth model for a wide range of forest stands. Robust estimates on forest canopy characteristics were achieved, ranging from maximal tree height, fractional cover (fcover), Leaf Area Index (LAI) to the foliage chlorophyll and water content. The introduction of prior information on the canopy structure derived from large footprint LIDAR observations significantly improved the retrieval performance relative to estimates based solely on spectral information.

AB The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) collects five-channel thermal-infrared images that are calibrated, corrected for atmospheric effects, and then converted to land surface temperature and emissivity products by the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. TES scales low- and high-contrast surfaces differently, and has been validated over water (low contrast) and rock (high contrast). Performance of TES over agricultural areas, however, has not been evaluated specifically. To address this issue, field measurements of "ground truth" were made over bare soil in addition to green grass, alfalfa and corn, at an agricultural research site in Spain during two coincident campaigns (SPectrA Barrax Campaign, or SPARC, and Exploitation of AnGular effects in Land surface, or EAGLE) during an ASTER overflight. Comparison of the ASTER Standard Products for land surface temperature (AST-08) and emissivity (AST-05) with ground measurements for the crops (corn and barley, plus grass) showed that accuracies of +/- 1.5 K and +/- 0.01, respectively, were achieved there. However, bare soil was assessed incorrectly by TES as having high emissivity contrast, leading to inaccurate scaling and low apparent emissivities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LAND-COVER
AB In the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado River Accounting System (LCRAS), crop classifications derived from remote sensing are used to calculate regional estimates of crop evapotranspiration for water monitoring and management activities on the lower Colorado River basin. The LCRAS accuracy assessment was designed to quantify the impact of crop classification error on annual total crop evapotranspiration (ETc), as calculated from the Penman-Monteith method using the map crop classification as input. The accuracy assessment data were also used to generate a sample-based estimate of total ETc using the crop type identified by direct ground observation of each sample field. A stratified random sampling design was implemented using field size as the stratification variable. The stratified design did not markedly improve precision for the accuracy assessment objective, but it was highly effective for the objective of estimating ETc derived from the ground-ob served crop types. The sampling design and analysis methodology developed for LCRAS demonstrates the utility of a multi-purpose approach that satisfies the accuracy assessment objectives, but also allows for rigorous, sample-based estimates of other collective properties of a region (e.g., total ETc in this study). We discuss key elements of this multi-purpose sampling strategy and the planning process used to implement such a strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping and dating of arid and semi-arid alluvial fans are of great importance in many Quaternary studies. Yet the most common mapping method of these features is based on visual, qualitative interpretation of air-photos. In this study we examine the feasibility of mapping arid alluvial surfaces by using airborne hyperspectral reflective remote sensing methodology. This technique was tested on Late Pleistocene to Holocene alluvial fan surfaces located in the hyperarid southern Arava valley, Israel. Results of spectral field measurements showed that the surface reflectance is controlled by two main surficial processes, which are used as relative age criteria: the degree of desert pavement development (gravel coverage %) controls the absorption feature depths, while the rock coating development influences significantly the overall reflectance of the surface, but its effect on the absorption feature depths is limited. We show that as the percent of the surface covered by gravels increases, the absorption feature depth of the common gravels, in this case carbonate at 2.33 mu m, increases as well; whereas the absorption features depth of the fine particle in-between the gravels, decrease (hydroxyl and ferric absorption features at 2.21 mu m, and 0.87 mu m, respectively), as the fines are removed from the surface. Using these correlations we were able to map the surface gravel coverage (%) on the entire alluvial fan, by calculating the gravel coverage (%) in each pixel of the hyperspectral image. The prediction of gravel coverage (%) is with accuracy of +/- 15% (e.g. gravel coverage of 50% can be predicted to be 35% to 65%). Using extensive accuracy assessment data, we show that the spectral based mapping maintained high accuracy degree (R-2=0.57 to 0.83). The quantitative methodology developed in this study for mapping alluvial surfaces can be adapted for other surfaces and piedmonts throughout the arid regions of the world. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest leaf area index (LAI), is an important variable in carbon balance models. However, understory vegetation is a recognized problem that limits the accuracy of sate I lite-estimated forest LAI. A canopy reflectance model was used to investigate the impact of the understory vegetation on LAI estimated from reflectance values estimated from satellite sensor data. Reflectance spectra were produced by the model using detailed field data as input, i.e. forest LAI, tree structural parameters, and the composition, distribution and reflectance of the forest floor. Common deciduous and coniferous forest types in southern Sweden were investigated. A negative linear relationship (r(2) = 0.6) was observed between field estimated LAI and the degree of understory vegetation, and the results indicated better agreement when coniferous and deciduous stands were analysed separately. The simulated spectra verified that the impact of the understory on the reflected signal from the top of the canopy is important; the reflectance values varying by up to 18% in the red and up to 10% in the near infra-red region of the spectra due to the understory. In order to predict the variation in LAI due to the understory vegetation, model inversions were performed where the input spectra were changed between the minimum, average and maximum reflectance values obtained from the forward runs. The resulting variation in LAI was found to be 1.6 units on average. The LAI of the understory could be predicted indirectly from simple stand data on forest characteristics, i.e. from allometric estimates, as an initial step in the process of estimating LAI. It is suggested here that compensation for the effect of the understory would improve the accuracy in the estimates of canopy LAI considerably. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We developed a new 6-year daily, daytime and nighttime, NOAA-14 AVHRR based land surface temperature (LST) dataset over continental Africa for the period 1995 through 2000. The processing chain was developed within the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping System (GIMMS) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. This paper describes the processing methodology used to convert the Global Area Coverage Level-1b data into LST and collateral data layers, such as sun and view geometries, cloud mask, local time of observation, and latitude and longitude. We used the Ulivieri et al. [Ulivieri, C., M.M. Castronuovo, R. Francioni, and A. Cardillo (1994), A split window algorithm for estimating land surface temperature from satellites, Adv. Space Research, 14(3):59-65.] split window algorithm to determine LST values. This algorithm requires as input values of surface emissivity in AVHRR channels 4 and 5. Thus, we developed continental maps of emissivity using an ensemble approach that combines laboratory emissivity spectra, MODIS-derived maps of herbaceous and woody fractional cover, and the UNESCO FAO soil map. A preliminary evaluation of the resulting LST product over a savanna woodland in South Africa showed a bias of < 0.3 K and an uncertainty of < 1.3 K for daytime retrievals (< 2.5 K for night). More extensive validation is required before statistically significant uncertainties can be determined. The LST production chain described here could be adapted for any wide field of view sensor (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS), and the LST product may be suitable for monitoring spatial and temporal temperature trends, or as input to many process models (e.g., hydrological, ecosystem).

AB The correspondence analysis (CA) method was applied to two multitemporal Landsat images of Raleigh, North Carolina for land use land cover (LULC) change detection. After the spectral transformation of the individual date images into component space using CA, the first component (PC1) of the date I image was subtracted from the PC1 of the date 2 image to produce difference image highlighting change areas. Accuracy curves based on the cumulative Producer's and User's accuracies were then used to optimally locate threshold (cutoff) values in the high-end and low-end tails of the difference image's histogram. Results were then compared to the standardized and non-standardized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) differencing and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing methods for change detection. Results showed that there was 6.8% increase in urban related cover types in Raleigh metropolitan area between 1993 and 1999. Also, maps based on the CA differencing method were found to be thematically more accurate than maps based on PCA component differencing methods. Overall accuracy of change map produced by the CA method for the Raleigh metropolitan area was 92.5% with overall Kappa value of 0.88. In general, CA was found to be a powerful multivariate analysis technique when applied to change detection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, three different methods have been considered: (i) the single-channel method, which uses only one thermal band; (ii) the split-window method, which uses a combination of two thermal bands; and (iii) the TES (temperature and emissivity separation) method, which needs at least four thermal bands. The calibration of the AHS thermal bands and the algorithms have been tested with in situ measurements collected in the framework ofthe SPARC (Spectra Barrax Campaign) and EAGLE (Exploitation of AnGular effects in Land surface observations from satellites) field campaigns, which took place simultaneously in the agricultural area of Barrax (Albacete, Spain), and also in the framework of the AGRISPECTRA field campaign, carried out over an olive orchard in Cordoba (Spain), in July 2004. AHS flights were conducted at two different altitudes, 975m, and 2745 m above ground level. The results show that AHS bands 71 (8.18 mu m), 72 (8.66 mu m), and 73 (9.15 mu m) were affected by a calibration problem. Taking into account that AHS bands 74 (9.60 mu m) and 80 (12.93 mu m) are located in an absorption region, bands from 75 to 79 have been finally selected for land surface temperature retrieval. The single-channel method has been applied to AHS band 75 (10.07 mu m), which shows the highest atmospheric transmissivity, whereas the split-window method has been applied to the combination between bands 75 and 79 (12.35 mu m), which provides the best results according to simulated data. All the AHS thermal bands ranging from 75 to 79 have been used in the TES method. The tests conducted on the different algorithms used in this study show that single-channel and split-window methods provided similar results, with root mean square errors (RMSE) between 1.6 and 1.9K. The TES method slightly improved the results, with a RMSE of 1.4K. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-spectral classification and quantification technique is developed for estimating chlorophyll a concentrations, Chi, in shallow oceanic waters where light reflected by the bottom can contribute significantly to the above-water remote-sensing reflectance spectra, R, A Classification criteria for determining bottom reflectance contributions for shipboard R,().) data from the west Florida shelf and Bahamian waters (1998-2001; n=451) were established using the relationship between R-rs(412)/R-rs(670) and the spectral curvature about 555 run, [R,(412)*R-rs(670)]/R-rs(555)(2). Chlorophyll concentrations for data classified as "optically deep" and "optically shallow" were derived separately using best-fit cubic polynomial functions developed from the band-ratios R-rs(490)/R-rs(555) and R-rs(412)/R-rs(670), respectively. Concentrations for transitional data were calculated from weighted averages of the two derived values. The root-mean-square error (RMSE(log)10) calculated for the entire data set using the new technique was 14% lower than the lowest error derived using the best individual band-ratio. The standard blue-to-green, band-ratio algorithm yields a 26% higher RMSE(log)10 than that calculated using the new method. This study demonstrates the potential of quantifying chlorophyll a concentrations more accurately from multi-spectral satellite ocean color data in oceanic regions containing optically shallow waters.

AB This paper considers the design of an optimal sampling scheme for a multivariate fuzzy-k-means classifier. Fuzzy classification is applied to delineate vegetation patterns from remote sensing data. The confusion index distinguishes subareas with high uncertainty due to class overlapping from those with low uncertainty. These subareas govern allocation of sample points. A simulated annealing approach minimizes the mean of shortest distances between samples. Optimization was done by prioritizing the survey to areas with high uncertainty. The methodology is tested on a site located in the Amazonian region of Peru. It resulted into an almost equilateral triangular scheme at those parts of the area where uncertainty was highest. The study shows that optimal sampling can be successfully combined with fuzzy classification, using an appropriate weight function. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sur-face roughness at the scale of 10(-2)-10(1) m can be estimated using the ratio (RR) between surface-reflected solar radiance measured from two view angles at nearly the same time. As RR is primarily a function of the difference between effective sub-pixel shading observed from the two view-angles, the divergence from unity RR values, which are expected for smooth Lambertian surfaces (they have no shadows), was found to be proportional to roughness at the 10(-2)-10(1)-m scale of geomorphic desert surfaces. Ground-based RR values at similar to 1-m resolution, as well as remotely acquired RR values at 4-, 15- and 50-m resolutions, were compared with observed surface roughness in two hyperarid test sites, located in Death Valley, California USA and the southern Negev Desert in Israel. The ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) 15-m stereoscopic capability is identified as air effective resource for obtaining relative sub-pixel surface-roughness estimates that are largely independent of surface composition and relatively insensitive to atmospheric effects.

AB Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) is a remote sensing technique with the well-proven ability to monitor ground deformations. In this work we have applied an advanced DInSAR technique - the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) -, to study subsidence phenomena due to the excessive pumping of groundwater in the Vega Media of the Segura River (SE Spain) from 1993 to the present. The settlement map retrieved with DInSAR shows settlement of up to 8 cm at some points of the study area and has been compared with other data provided by ground instruments to analyse the relationship with ground deformation. A correlation has been observed between these measurements and the observations from on-site testing of piezometric groundwater fluctuations and borehole extensometric settlement. However, the distribution of damaged buildings, well points and basements does not show a clear relationship with measured subsidence values because the occurrence of damage also depends on the structural state of the buildings and the characteristics of their foundations. In addition, the distribution of pumping wells is not indicative of the distribution of the volume of water withdrawal which is the real conditioning factor of piezometric level changes. It can be concluded that the results obtained provide very useful spatial and temporal data about this phenomenon in an urban area at a low cost. The data can be used for forecasting purposes and helps to define zones with future ground settlement problems if the same conditions are repeated. This technique has also allowed the monitoring of ground subsidence in the Vega Media of Segura River for a period (1993-1995) where no instrument information was available. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Estimating near-surface moisture conditions from the reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm) of Sphagnum moss offers great opportunities for the use of remote sensing as a tool for large-scale detailed monitoring of near-surface peatland hydrological conditions. This article investigates the effects of changes in near-surface and surface moisture upon the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum moss. Laboratory-based canopy reflectance data were collected from two common species of Sphagnum subjected to drying and subsequent rewetting. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands and two biophysical indices (REIP and the chlorophyll index) were correlated with measures of near-surface moisture. All spectral indices tested were significantly correlated with near-surface moisture (with r between 0.27 and 0.94). The strongest correlations were observed using indices developed from the NIR liquid water absorption features (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)). However, a hysteretic response was observed in both NIR indices when the canopies were re-hydrated, a finding which may have implications for the timing of remote sensing image acquisition. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI), developed from the SWIR liquid water absorption feature also showed strong correlations with near-surface wetness although the range of moisture conditions over which the index was able to detect change was highly dependent on Sphagnum species. Of the biophysical spectral indices tested (REIP and the chlorophyll index), the most significant relationships were observed between the chlorophyll index and near-surface wetness. All spectral indices tested were species specific, and this is attributed to differences in canopy morphology between Sphagnum species. The potential for developing estimations of surface and near-surface hydrological conditions across northern peatlands using remote sensing technology is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB In order to aid land managers in monitoring and controlling the ongoing hemlock woolly adelgid outbreak, more accurate landscape scale tools are required to locate the hemlock resource, identify infestation and spot early decline. To this end, NASA's Airborne Visible Infra-red Imaging Spectrometer was flown over the infestation front in the Catskills region of New York during the summer of 2001. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering in ENVI was used to "unmix" spectra and quantify the hemlock signature contribution to each pixel. The resulting percent hemlock basal area coverage correctly identified hemlock dominated pixels (>40% basal area) with 83% accuracy. Key wavelengths and health indices were examined to determine if a subset of wavelengths could accurately predict an 11-class decline rating system. A linear regression based on reflectance at a chlorophyll sensitive wavelength (R683 nm), coupled with a water band index (R970/R900), was able to predict decline with 85% accuracy. The extreme accuracy at the low (0-3) end of the range indicated that these wavelengths might be used to assess early decline, before visual symptoms are apparent in the field. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB A lack of spatially and thematically accurate vegetation maps complicates conservation and management planning, as well as ecological research, in tropical rain forests. Remote sensing has considerable potential to provide such maps, but classification accuracy within primary rain forests has generally been inadequate for practical applications. Here we test how accurately floristically defined forest types in lowland tropical rain forests in Peruvian Amazonia can be recognized using remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ satellite image and STRM elevation model). Floristic data and a vegetation classification with four forest classes were available for eight line transects, each 8 km long, located in an area of ca 800 km. We compared two sampling unit sizes (line transect subunits of 200 and 500 m) and several image feature combinations to analyze their suitability for image classification. Mantel tests were used to quantify how well the patterns in elevation and in the digital numbers of the satellite image correlated with the floristic patterns observed in the field. Most Mantel correlations were positive and highly significant. Linear discriminant analysis was used first to build a function that discriminates between forest classes in the eight field-verified transects on the basis of remotely sensed data, and then to classify those parts of the line transects and the satellite image that had not been visited in the field. Classification accuracy was quantified by 8-fold crossvalidation. Two of the tierra firme (non-inundated) forest types were combined because they were too often misclassified. The remaining three forest types (inundated forest, terrace forest and Pebas formation/intermediate tierra firme forest) could be separated using the 500-m sampling units with an overall classification accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.62. For the 200-m sampling units, the classification accuracy was clearly lower (71%, Kappa 0.35). The forest classification will be used as habitat data to study wildlife habitat use in the same area. Our results show that remotely sensed data and relatively simple classification methods can be used to produce reasonably accurate forest type classifications, even in structurally homogeneous primary rain forests.

AB The remote sensing of fire severity is a noted goal in studies of forest and grassland wildfires. Experiments were conducted to discover and evaluate potential relationships between the characteristics of African savannah fires and post-fire surface spectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral region. Nine instrumented experimental fires were conducted in semi-arid woodland savannah of Chobe National Park (Botswana), where fire temperature (T-max) and duration (dt) were recorded using thermocouples positioned at different heights and locations. These variables, along with measures of fireline intensity (FLI), integrated temperature with time (T-sum) and biomass (and carbon/nitrogen) volatilised were compared to post-fire surface spectral reflectance. Statistically significant relationships were observed between (i) the fireline intensity and total nitrogen volatilised (r(2) =0.54, n=36, p<0.001), (ii) integrated temperature (Tsum-mu) and total biomass combusted (r(2) = 0.72, n = 32, p < 0.001), and (iii) fire duration as measured at the top-of-grass sward thermocouple (dt(T)) and total biomass combusted (r(2) = 0.74, n = 34, p < 0.001) and total nitrogen volatilised (r(2) = 0.73, n = 34, P < 0.001). The post-fire surface spectral reflectance was found to be related to dt and T,,. via a quadratic relationship that varied with wavelength. The use of visible and shortwave infrared band ratios produced statistically significant linear relationships with fire duration as measured by the top thermocouple (dt(T)) (r(2) = 0.76, n = 34, p < 0.001) and the mean of T-sum (r(2) = 0.82, n = 34, p < 0.001). The results identify fire duration as a versatile measure that relates directly to the fire severity, and also illustrate the potential of spectrally-based fire severity measures. However, the results also point to difficulties when applying such spectrally-based techniques to Earth Observation satellite imagery, due to the small-scale variability noted on the ground. Results also indicate the potential for surface spectral reflectance to increase following higher severity fires, due to the laying down of high albedo, white mineral ash. Most current techniques for mapping burned area rely on the general assumption that surface albedo decreases following a fire, and so if the image spatial resolution was high enough such methods may fail. Determination of the effect of spatial resolution on a sensor's ability to detect white ash was investigated using a validated optical mixture modelling approach. The most appropriate mixing model to use (linear or non-linear) was assessed using laboratory experiments. A linear mixing model was shown most appropriate, with results suggesting that sensors having spatial resolutions significantly higher than those of Landsat ETM+ will be required if patches of white ash are to be used to provide EO-derived information on the spatial variation of fire severity.

AB A new semi-physical forest reflectance model, PARAS, is presented in the paper. PARAS is a simple parameterization model for taking into account the effect of within-shoot scattering on coniferous canopy reflectance. Multiple scattering at the small scale represented by a shoot is a conifer-specific characteristic which causes the spectral signature of coniferous forests to differ from that of broadleaved forests. This has for long led to problems in remote sensing of canopy structural variables in coniferous dominated regions. The PARAS model uses a relationship between photon recollision probability and leaf area index (LAI) for simulating forest reflectance. The recollision probability is a measurable, wavelength independent variable which is defined as the probability with which a photon scattered in the canopy interacts with a phytoclement again. In this study, we present application results using PARAS in Simulating reflectance of coniferous forests for approximately 800 Scots pine and Norway spruce dominated stands. The results of this Study clearly indicate that a major improvement in simulating canopy reflectance in near-infrared (NIR) is achieved by simply accounting for the within-shoot scattering. In other words, the low NIR reflectance observed in coniferous areas is mainly due to within-shoot scattering. In the red wavelength the effect of within-shoot scattering was not pronounced due to the high level of needle absorption in the red range. To conclude the paper, Further application possibilities of the presented parameterization model are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the Sahel, land surface processes are significantly interacting with climate dynamics. In this paper. we present an original method to control a simple Sahelian land surface model coupled to a radiative transfer model (RTM) on the basis of ERS wind scanerometer (WSC) observations. In a first step, a sensitivity study is implemented to identify those parameters of the land surface model that can be estimated through the assimilation of WSC data. The assimilation scheme relies on evolution strategies (ES) algorithm that aims at solving the parameter evaluation problem. These algorithms are particularly well suited for complex (nonlinear) inverse problems. The assimilation scheme is applied to several study sites located in the Sahelian mesoscale site of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Project (Gourma region, Mali). The results are compared with ground observations of herbaceous mass. After the WSC data assimilation. the simulated herbaceous mass curves compare well with observations [187 kilogram of dry matter per hectare (kg DM/ha) of average error]. The simulated water fluxes exhibit a behaviour in agreement with ground measurements performed over similar ecosystems during the Hapex Sahel experiment. The accuracy of estimated herbaceous mass and water fluxes resulting from uncertainties on climatic forcing variable is evaluated using a stochastic approach. The average error on the herbaceous mass values mainly depends on the rainfall estimate accuracy and ranges from 139 to 268 kg DM/ha that compares well with a previous study based on the sole inversion of the radiative transfer model. Finally, this study underlines the need for a multispectral assimilation approach to get a better constraint on water fluxes estimation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The UNFCCC and interest in the source of the missing terrestrial carbon sink are prompting research and development into methods for carbon accounting in forest ecosystems. Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content (AGCC) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne LiDAR. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve UK to estimate the AGCC of five stands from forest mensuration and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r=0.74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based AGCC estimates and those derived from the DCHM. Using a 20x20 in grids superposed to the DCHM, the AGCC was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the LiDAR estimates was r=0.85. At the woodland level, LiDAR estimates were nearly 24% lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the LiDAR 20x20 in grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of AGCC across the woodland. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fuel moisture content (FMC) is used in forest fire danger models to characterise the moisture status of the foliage. FMC expresses the amount of water in a leaf relative to the amount of dry matter and differs from measures of leaf water content which express the amount of water in a leaf relative to its area. FMC is related to both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content, and the relationships between FMC and remotely sensed reflectance will therefore be affected by variation in both leaf biophysical properties. This paper uses spectral reflectance data from the Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment (LOPEX) and modelled data from the Prospect leaf reflectance model to examine the relationships between FMC, leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and a range of spectral vegetation indices (VI) designed to estimate leaf and canopy water content. Significant correlations were found between FMC and all of the selected vegetation indices for both modelled and measured data, but statistically stronger relationships were found with leaf EWT; overall, the water index (WI) was found to be most strongly correlated with FMC. The accuracy of FMC estimation was very low when the global range of FMC was examined, but for a restricted range of 0-100%. FMC was estimated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15% in the model simulations and 51% with the measured data. The paper shows that the estimation of live FMC from remotely sensed vegetation indices is likely to be problematic when there is variability in both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content in the target leaves. Estimating FMC from remotely sensed data at the canopy level is likely to be farther complicated by spatial and temporal variations in leaf area index (LAI). Further research is required to assess the potential of canopy reflectance model inversion to estimate live fuel moisture content where a priori information on vegetation properties may be used to constrain the inversion process.

AB The influence of foliage vertical distribution on vegetation gross primary production (GPP) is investigated in this study. A new photosynthesis model has been created that combines the standard sunlit/shaded leaf separation (two-leaf) and the multiple layer approaches and uses vertical foliage profiles measured by SLICER (the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery). Daily gross carbon assimilation rates calculated by this model were compared with the rates calculated by two other models, the two-leaf model and the combined two-leaf multilayer model utilizing uniform foliage profiles. The comparison was made over a wide range of profiles and weather conditions for two mixed deciduous forest stands in eastern Maryland, measured by SLICER in September 1995. Incident radiation pattern, environmental parameters and total amounts of sunlit and shaded leaves were the same for all three models. The difference was in the distributions of radiation and sunlit/shaded leaves inside the canopy. For the combined models, these distributions were calculated based on the vertical foliage profiles, while for the two-leaf model, empirical equations were used to account for the average amounts of absorbed radiation. The simulations showed that: (1) the use of a uniform foliage distribution instead of the actual one results in large differences in the calculated GPP values, up to 46.4% and 50.7% for the days with partial and total cloud cover; (2) the performance of the two-leaf model is extremely sensitive to the absorbed radiation pattern, its disagreement with the proposed model becomes insignificant when the average amounts of absorbed radiation are the same; (3) days with partial cloud cover and a greater fraction of diffuse radiation are characterized by higher GPP rates. These findings highlight the importance of vertical foliage profile and separate treatments of diffuse and direct radiation for photosynthesis modeling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Mordor Complex consists of a series of potassic ultramafic rocks which were intruded into Proterozoic felsic gneisses and amphibolite and are overlain by quartzite and unconsolidated deposits. In situ and laboratory 0.4 to 2.5 mum reflectance spectra show Al-OH absorption features caused by absorption in muscovite, kaolinite, and illite/smectite in syenite, granitic gneiss, quartzite and unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, and Fe,Mg-OH features due to phlogopite, biotite, epidote, and hornblende in the mafic and ultramafic rocks. Ferrousiron absorption positioned near 1.05 mum is most intense in peridotite reflectance spectra. Ferric-iron absorption is intense in most of the felsic lithologies.
   HyMap data were recorded in 126 narrow hands from 0.43 to 2.5 pm along a 7-km-wide swath with approximately 6-m spatial resolution. Correction of the data to spectral reflectance was accomplished by reference to in situ measurements of an extensive, alluvial plain. Spectral classes for matched filter processing were selected by using the pixel purity index procedure and analysis of in situ and laboratory spectra. Considering the spatial distribution of the resulting 14 classes, some classes were combined, which produced eight classes characterized by Al-OH absorption features, and three Fe,Mg-OH absorption-feature classes.
   Comparison of the distribution of these I I spectral classes to a generalized lithologic map of the study area shows that the spectral distinction among the eight Al-OH classes is related to variations in primary lithology, weathering products, and vegetation density. Quartzite is represented in three classes, syenite corresponds to a single scattered class, quartz-muscovite-biotite schist defines a single very coherent class, and unconsolidated sediments are portrayed in four classes. The three mafic-ultramafic classes are distinguished on the basis of generally intense Fe,Mg-OH and ferrous-iron absorption features. A single class represents the main Mordor ultramafic mass. Epidote-bearing rocks define another class, which corresponds to biotite gneiss and, in the southern part of the area, to fracture zones. The third class, which exhibits Al-OH, as well as Fe,Mg-OH features, represents hornblende gneiss and other mafic gneisses. These results indicate the importance of analyzing the VNIR and SWIR spectral shape and albedo, as well as analyzing specific spectral features, for mapping lithologic units in this weathered terrain.

AB Few studies have tried to explain the summer distribution pattern of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, an area characterized with heterogeneous and transient hydrobiological features. Satellite imagery was used to gain knowledge on primary biomass over large time and space scales and to process environmental variables of significance to the problem of fin whale distribution.
   Fin whale distribution was obtained from survey data and expressed into sightings per unit of effort. Net primary production (g C/m(2)/day), NPP, can be estimated with a model by processing remote-sensed measurements of chlorophyll concentration, provided by SeaWIFS DAAC. NPP was integrated over different temporal scales, related to primary production cycles in the area. Additional variables were derived from sea surface temperature (AVHRR/NOAA sensors).
   Multiple cross-correlation coefficients were calculated between these environmental parameters and the fin whale summer distribution from 1998 to 2002. A predictive model, the potential grouping index, was developed from this statistical approach.
   This study improves our understanding of the variability of fin whale distribution in summer. While food availability at a particular time and place is a function of environmental conditions in the previous months, this study provides evidence that whales adapt their movements and group size directly to food availability rather than to instantaneous environmental conditions.

AB Monitoring of coral reef bleaching has hitherto been based on regional-scale, in situ data. Larger-scale trends, however, must be determined using satellite-based observations. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images, the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor coral reef bleaching is examined. The radiative transfer simulation indicates that the blue and green bands of Landsat TM can detect bleaching if at least 23% of the coral surface in a pixel has been bleached, assuming a Landsat TM pixel with a resolution of 30 x 30 in on shallow (less than 3 in deep) reef flats at Ishigaki Island, Japan. Assuming an area with an initial coral coverage of 100% and in which all corals became completely bleached, the bleaching could be detected at a depth of up to 17 in. The difference in reflectance of shallow sand and corals is compared by examining multitemporal Landsat TM images at Ishigaki Island, after normalizing for variations in atmospheric conditions, incident light, water depth, and the sensor's reaction to the radiance received. After the normalization, a severe bleaching event when 25-55% of coral coverage was bleached was detected, but a slight bleaching event when 15% of coral coverage was bleached was not detected. The simulation and data analysis agreed well with each other, and identified reliable limits for satellite remote sensing for detecting coral reef bleaching. Sensitivity analysis on solar zenith angle, aerosol (visibility) and water quality (Ch1 a concentration) quantified the effect of these factors on bleaching detection, and thus served as general guidelines for detecting coral reef bleaching. Spatial misregistration resulted in a high degree of uncertainty in the detection of changes at the edges of coral patches mainly because of the low (similar to30 m) spatial resolution of Landsat TM, indicating that detection of coral reef bleaching by Landsat TM is limited to extremely severe cases on a large homogeneous coral patch and shallow water depths. Satellite remote sensing of coral reef bleaching should be encouraged, however, because the development and deployment of advanced satellite sensors with high spatial resolution continue to progress.

AB The remote sensing of pasture quality as determined by nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentration is critical for a better understanding of wildlife and livestock feeding patterns. Although remote sensing techniques have proved useful for assessing the concentration of foliar biochemicals under controlled laboratory conditions, more investigation is required to assess their capabilities in the field, where inconsistent results have been obtained so far. We investigated the possibility of determining the concentration of in situ biochemicals in a savanna rangeland, using the spectral reflectance of five grass species. Canopy spectral measurements were taken in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer. We tested the utility of using four variables derived from continuum-removed absorption features for predicting canopy nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentration: (i) continuum-removed derivative reflectance (CRDR), (ii) band depth (BD), (iii) band depth ratio (BDR) and (iv) normalised band depth index (NBDI). Stepwise linear regression was used to select wavelengths from the absorption-feature-based variables. Univariate correlation analysis was also done between the first derivative reflectance and biochemicals. Using a training data set, the variables derived from continuum-removed absorption features could predict biochemicals with R-2 values ranging from 0.43 to 0.80. Results were highest using CRDR data, which yielded R-2 values of 0.70, 0.80, 0.64, 0.50 and 0.68 with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.01, 0.004, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.004 for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and magnesium, respectively. Predicting biochemicals on a test data set, using regression models developed from a training data set, resulted in R-2 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.70. The error of prediction (RSE) in the test data set was 0.08 (+/-10.25% of mean), 0.05 (+/-5.2% of mean), 0.02 (+/-11.11% of mean), 0.05 (+/-11.6% of mean) and 0.03 (+/-15% of mean) for nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium, respectively, using CRDR. When data was partitioned into species groups, the R-2 increased significantly to >0.80. With high-quality radiometric and geometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, the techniques applied in this study (i.e. continuum removal on absorption features) may also be applied on data acquired by airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers to predict and ultimately to map the concentration of macronutrients in tropical rangelands.

AB The West African Sahel rainfall regime is known for its spatio-temporal variability at different scales which has a strong impact on vegetation development. This study presents results of the combined use of a simple water balance model, a radiative transfer model and ERS scatterometer data to produce map of vegetation biomass and thus vegetation cover at a spatial resolution of 25 kin. The backscattering coefficient measured by spacebome wind scatterometers over Sahel shows a marked seasonality linked to the drastic changes of both soil and vegetation dielectric properties associated to the alternating dry and wet seasons. For lack of a direct observation, METEOSAT rainfall estimates are used to calculate temporal series of soil moisture with the help of a water balance model. This a priori information is used as input of the radiative transfer model that simulates the interaction between the radar wave and the surface components (soil and vegetation). Then, an inversion algorithm is applied to retrieve vegetation aerial mass from the ERS scatterometer data. Because of the nonlinear feature of the inverse problem to be solved, the inversion is performed using a global stochastic nonlinear inversion method. A good agreement is obtained between the inverse solutions and independent field measurements with mean and standard deviation of -54 and 130 kg of dry matter by hectare (kg DM/ha), respectively. The algorithm is then applied to a 350,000 km(2) area including the Malian Gourma and Seno region and a Sahelian part of Burkina Faso during two contrasted seasons (1999 and 2000). At the considered resolution, the obtained herbaceous mass maps show a global qualitative consistency (r(2) = 0.71) with NDVI images acquired by the VEGETATION instrument. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Urban development is shown to induce predictable changes in satellite-based measures of radiant surface temperature and evapotranspiration fraction-as long as certain features of the development are known. Specifically, the vegetation changes that accompany the development and the initial climatic state of the land parcel must be noted. Techniques are also developed for quantifying the effects of urbanization on the surface hydrology at a watershed scale. Streamflow and precipitation data are related graphically in order to determine a watershed's general ratio of stormwater runoff to rainfall, along with any changes in the ratio over time. Four distinct runoff responses, separated by season and antecedent moisture conditions, are distinguishable for a particular basin, with the response during the non-summer months under typical antecedent moisture conditions the most representative of and responsive to land-use patterns. This particular runoff response can be estimated from satellite-derived land cover patterns and certain physical attributes of a basin. These satellite-based microclimate and hydrologic analyses are coupled with an existing urban growth model (SLEUTH). The SLEUTH urban growth model simulates future development scenarios for a region of interest. The resulting changes in urban land use lead to the evolution of site-specific climate and hydrology based on the scheme that is presented in this paper. This study, as well as related tools and bodies of knowledge, can be used to broaden the scientific basis behind land-use management decisions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL
AB Remote sensed imagery can both describe urban sprawl on a watershed scale and provide essential information for modeling the impact of sprawl on watercourses. This paper looks at six watersheds in greater Cleveland, OH: two urban; two rural; and two undergoing rapid urbanization. Thematic Mapper imagery from 1984, 1988, 1994, to 1999 was classified into functional classes describing each watershed in terms of the position of each pixel along continua of [1] percentage permeability and [2] canopy cover. Because the functional classes represent positions along independent continua rather than thematic land-cover classes, they can easily be compared from image to image, and they provide quantitative estimates of parameters at 30-m resolution suitable for spatial simulation models. The imagery classified in this way makes it possible to observe the progress of urban sprawl both within these watersheds and over a study area which extends from the inner city to its rural surroundings.

AB This study focuses on mapping surface minerals using a new hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) sensor: the spatially enhanced broadband array spectrograph system (SEBASS). SEBASS measures radiance in 128 contiguous spectral channels in the 7.5- to 13.5-mum region with a ground spatial resolution of 2 in. In September 1999, three SEBASS flight lines were acquired over Virginia City and Steamboat Springs, Nevada. At-sensor data were corrected for atmospheric effects using an empirical method that derives the atmospheric characteristics from the scene itself, rather than relying on a predicted model. The apparent surface radiance data were reduced to surface emissivity using an emissivity normalization technique to remove the effects of temperature. Mineral maps were created with a pixel classification routine based on matching instrument- and laboratory-measured emissivity spectra, similar to methods used for other hyperspectral data sets (e.g. AVIRIS). Linear mixtures of library spectra match SEBASS spectra reasonably well, and silicate and sulfate minerals mapped remotely, agree with the dominant minerals identified with laboratory X-ray powder diffraction and spectroscopic analyses of field samples. Though improvements in instrument calibration, atmospheric correction, and information extraction would improve the ability to map more pixels, these hyperspectral TIR data nevertheless show significant advancement over multispectral thermal imaging by mapping surface materials and lithologic units with subtle spectral differences in mineralogy.

AB The characteristics of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series can be disaggregated into a set of quantitative metrics that may be used to derive information about vegetation phenology and land cover. In this paper, we examine the patterns observed in metrics calculated for a time series of 8 years over the southwest of Western Australia-an important crop and animal production area of Australia. Four analytical approaches were used; calculation of temporal mean and standard deviation layers for selected metrics showing significant spatial variability; classification based on temporal and spatial patterns of key NDVI metrics; metrics were analyzed for eight areas typical of climatic and production systems across the agricultural zone; and relationships between total production and productivity measured by dry sheep equivalents were developed with time integrated NDVI (TINDVI). Two metrics showed clear spatial patterns; the season duration based on the smooth curve produced seven zones based on increasing length of growing season; and TINDVI provided a set of classes characterized by differences in overall magnitude of response, and differences in response in particular years. Frequency histograms of TINDVI could be grouped on the basis of a simple shape classification: tall and narrow with high, medium or low mean indicating most land is responsive agricultural cover with uniform seasonal conditions; broad and short indicating that land is of mixed cover type or seasonal conditions are not spatially uniform. TINDVI showed a relationship to agricultural productivity that is dependent on the extent to which crop or total agricultural production was directly reduced by rainfall deficiency. TINDVI proved most sensitive to crop productivity for Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) having rainfall less than 600 mm, and in years when rainfall and crop production were highly correlated. It is concluded that metrics from standardized NDVI time series could be routinely and transparently used for retrospective assessment of seasonal conditions and changes in vegetation responses and cover.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) completed the first year of science data acquisition on February 24, 2000. The overall performance of the sensor and the on-board calibration systems for this first year have been very good. Several features of the performance lead to characteristics in the data set that merit special attention. These items are sometimes called data product caveats, and are described here. Uncertainty budgets for the 0.555-mum band, the 1.240-mum band and the 12.000-mum band are presented at several days throughout this first year. The uncertainty is estimated to be decreasing with time during this period, and to be near 1.8% in reflectance factor for 0.555 mum, 1.9% for the reflectance factor product for the 1.240 mum band, and 0.7% for the 12.000-mum band at nadir at the end of the first year. Degradation of the solar diffuser is 2.3% at 0.412 mum, known to an uncertainty of +/-0.5%. Solar diffuser degradation for wavelengths longer that 0.5 mum is indistinguishable from the uncertainty in trend determination for the first year. Mirror side degradation at 0.412 mum is 6 +/- 0.5%, with a mirror side difference of an additional 3%. The performance present in the data at the end of year 1 provides significant encouragement that many improvements in our understanding of the Earth system performance can and will be based on MODIS data during the coming years.

AB We evaluate the operational MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) product using field-sampled data collected at five sites in southern Africa in March 2000. One site (Mongu, Zambia) was sampled monthly throughout the year. All sites were along the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme's (IGBP) Kalahari Transect, which features progressively lower annual precipitation, and hence, lower vegetation productivity, from north to south. The soils are consistently sandy. At each site, we sampled the vegetation overstory along three 750-m transects using the Tracing Radiation and Architecture in Canopies (TRAC) instrument. The resulting plant area index values were adjusted with ancillary stem area data to estimate LAI. Despite some instrument characterization and production issues in the first year of MODIS operations, our results suggest the first-year MODIS LAI algorithm correctly accommodates structural and phenological variability in semiarid woodlands and savannas, and is accurate to within the uncertainty of the validation approach used here. Limitations of this study and its conclusions are also discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB This study created and tested predictive models developed using airborne imaging spectrometer and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) instruments for estimating the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in broad-leaved and coniferous forest plantations. Data were acquired using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and an Airborne Laser Terrain Mapping (ALTM) 1020 instrument in midsummer for study sites in the New Forest, England, along with concomitant in situ measurements of canopy properties. The stands used displayed a wide variation in the biophysical and biochemical properties of interest. When employing the imaging spectrometer data alone, there were no relationships between any spectral variables (band reflectance, band ratios, or first derivatives of reflectance) and canopy biophysical and biochemical properties when both broad-leaved and coniferous stands were analysed as a combined data set. However, for the broad-leaved stands alone, curvilinear relationships were found between the wavelength position of the red edge (ARE) and pigment concentrations per unit ground area (e.g., R-2=0.88** for chlorophyll a [Chl a]) and per unit leaf mass (e.g., R-2=0.76** for Chl a). The predictive value of these models was somewhat limited; for example, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 300 Mg m(-2) (27% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit ground area and 1.17 mg g(-1) (24% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit leaf mass. A ratio of a near-infrared and a green band (865 nm/553 nm) was linearly related to leaf area index (LAI) of the broad-leaved stands (R-2=0.71**) and the regression model was a reasonable predictor of the LAI for the independent test sites (RMSE=0.88; 18.6% of the mean). Canopy height information derived from the ALTM data was used to mask out canopy gap areas from the CASI imagery of each stand. This process had limited impact on the relationships between spectral and canopy variables for the broad-leaved stands, and lambda(RE) remained unrelated to pigment concentrations per unit ground area for the coniferous stands. However, the masking process substantially improved the strength of the relationship between lambda(RE) and pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass for the coniferous stands (e.g., for Chl a R-2=0.85**; RMSE of prediction=0.84 mg g(-1) [22% of the mean]). Therefore, the study demonstrates that for broad-leaved stands, spectral models can be applied to imaging spectrometer data to quantify forest pigments and LAI with moderate accuracy. For coniferous stands, the use of LIDAR data to remove canopy gap areas from the CASI imagery considerably increases the accuracy of spectral predictive models for quantifying pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass.

AB This paper describes the methodology used to create a spectral index to retrieve vegetation water content from remotely sensed data in the solar spectrum domain. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using radiative transfer models is used to understand and quantify vegetation water content effects on the signal measured at three levels: leaf, canopy, and atmosphere. An index is then created that optimises retrieval of vegetation water content (in terms of water quantity per unit area at canopy level) and minimises perturbing effects of geophysical and atmospheric effects. The new index, optimised for the new SPOT-VEGETATION sensor, is presented as an example. Limitations and robustness of the index are also discussed, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI Scaling of differentially eroded surfaces in the drainage network of the

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID RIVER NETWORKS; TOPOGRAPHY
AB Differentially eroded regions selected over the Ethiopian Plateau, Northeast Africa, were statistically analyzed using satellite images of various electromagnetic spectrum regions and resolutions (Landsat TM and ERS-1). The power spectrum exponent beta values for the Landsat TM2 (visible) and ERS-1 images over the same surface are associated to the intrinsic properties of the different sensor type and postprocessing of the data. Differences in the beta values were observed between eroded area (Blue Nile Canyon, BNC) and relatively noneroded area (plateau, PLA) for all data sets. These differences are associated to the mechanical erosion of the plateau. The remotely sensed data fields show scaling from 35 in to 15 km, with no break at 1.5 km, and are highly multifractal. Analyses of the Landsat TM bands over each area demonstrated something particular: beta values for bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) range differed from beta values for bands in the visible spectrum range in the plateau area by about 0,48, while in the drainage area, this difference is around 0.13. Landsat TM SWIR bands are sensitive to spectral signature of clay minerals, while data in the visible spectrum range mostly depict topography gradients. Two concurrent processes are highlighted, mechanical erosion and chemical erosion/deposition, which interact to produce the observed differences. In the drainage area, where cliffs and steep slopes are present and mechanical erosion intensively occurs, the alteration minerals are remobilized quickly, whereas in the plateau area, mechanical erosion is low, and alteration mineral deposition is less disturbed. Such new statistical highlights of topographic versus chemical surfaces will have to be taken into account in landforming models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A model for light interaction has been developed to compute spectral and bidirectional reflectance from discontinuous canopies approximated by an arbitrary configuration of plants. The model assumes certain principles of geometric models, e.g., that sensor integrates the radiance reflected from tree plants, shaded soil, and illuminated soil. However, the model attempts to compensate for errors due to multiple scattering in vegetation canopies that lead to nonlinear mixing. In contrast to geometric models, tree crowns are treated as porous (partially transmitting), geometric bodies. Reflectance of canopy and shadowed ground are nonlinear mixtures of leaves and background signatures, which are moreover influenced by parameters of canopy, such as leaf area index (LAI), coefficient of attenuation, and leaves transmittance. Optical parameters are not constant but stochastic variables are controlled by a certain texture in canopy envelopes, and roughness and relief in surface background. The model may also be run using backgrounds presenting variable topography and comprising different landscape features on imported real images. The model predicts the basic features of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF), i.e., bowl shape and the hotspot, but unlike common models, it is well suited to address the spectral and spatial domains. For example, the model provides a fast and efficient strategy to derive hyperspectral images at appropriate spatial resolutions (e.g., regional scale) over a wide range of ecosystems.

AB Quantification of biophysical parameters is needed by terrestrial process modeling and other applications. A study testing the role of multispectral data for monitoring biophysical parameters was conducted over a network of grassland field sites in the Great Plains of North America. Grassland biophysical parameters [leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), and biomass] and their relationships with ground radiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were established in this study (r(2) = .66-.85) from data collected across the central and northern Great Plains in 1995. These spectral/biophysical relationships were compared to 1996 field data from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma and showed no consistent biases, with most regression estimates falling within the respective 95% confidence intervals. Biophysical parameters were estimated for 21 "ground pixels" (grids) at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in 1996, representing three grazing/burning treatments. Each grid was 30 x 30 in in size and was systematically sampled with ground radiometer readings. The radiometric measurements were then converted to biophysical parameters and spatially interpolated using geostatistical kriging. Grid-based biophysical parameters were monitored through the growing season and regressed against Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) NDVI (r(2) = .92-.94). These regression equations were used to estimate biophysical parameters for grassland TM pixels over the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in 1996. This method maintained consistent regression development and prediction scales and attempted to minimize scaling problems associated with mixed land cover pixels. A method for scaling Landsat biophysical parameters to coarser resolution satellite data sets (I km(2)) was also investigated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The potential use of the information from a sampling of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BR-DF) has suffered from the lack of solid applications in ecology. where it is expected to play the role of an advanced descriptor of vegetation as a complement to hyperspectral measurements. Such a shortcoming stems from the lack of consistent angular data sets with an adequate resolution at global scale. In this context. the POLDER instrument is particularly relevant because it acquires directional radiance signatures at a high angular resolution and thereby provides the first global BRDF product. In this paper, we investigate how to discriminate vegetation types in using only a portion of the BRIDE in particular, the two paramount directional signatures, which are the maximum (hot spot) and the minimum (dark spot) of reflectance observed in the backscattering and forward scattering regions, respectively. A directional index hot-dark spot (HDS) is formulated using these two signatures. It is defined as the normalized difference between the reflectances at the hot spot and dark spot. It is shown that the HDS can be linearly related with the foliage clumping index for three different vegetation types observed by the spaceborne POLDER sensor. The significance of the clumping index mapping for ecological studies is evaluated using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). Considering foliage clumping in BEPS, the estimation of daily canopy photosynthesis can differ about 20% for a black spruce site. In this context, it is expected that the findings of this study will have a strong impact on the use of directional optical remote sensing to improve the assessment of terrestrial productivity and carbon cycle.

AB Aircraft measurements using a field spectrometer over variety of ground surfaces in Israel reveals that under clear sky conditions the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands around 1.6 and 2.1 mum are highly correlated with the visible-blue, green, and red- spectral bands. Empirical linear relationships, such as rho (0.469) = 0.25(rho2.1); rho (0.555) = 0.33(rho2.1); rho (0.645) = 0.5(rho2.1); and rho (0.645) = 0.66(rho1.6), were found to be statistically significant and consistent with previous findings. Based on the above relationships, a modified vegetation index (VI) is proposed and named Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI). Two versions of this VI are formulated as: AFRI(1.6) = (rho (NIR) - 0 66 rho (1.6))/(rho (NIR) + 0.66 rho (1.6)) and AFRI(2.1) = (rho (NIR) - 0.5 rho (2.1))/(rho (NIR) + 0.5 rho (2.1)). It is shown that under clear sky conditions, the AFRIs (and especially AFRI(2.1)) closely resemble the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and their values are almost identical. The advantage of the derived AFRIs, based on the ability of the SWIR bands is to penetrate the atmospheric column even when aerosols such as smoke or sulfates exist. Consequently, these indices have a major application in assessing vegetation in the presence of smoke, anthropogenic pollution, or volcanic plumes. This was demonstrated by applying the AFRI for a biomass burned forest in Brazil. Limited success of these indices is expected in case of dust due to presence of larger particles that are of similar size to the wavelength and therefore not transparent at 2.1 mum. The AFRIs can be implemented to data from any sensor that has the SWIR bands. Currently the most commonly used of such instruments are the Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER), and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-Optical System (JERS-OPS). Although the AFRI(2.1) was demonstrated to perform better than the AFRI(1.6), the latter still can be used for the same application in conjunction with instruments that have onboard only the 1.6-mum band, such as Systeme Probatoire d'Observation del la Terre (SPOT4)-VEGETATION, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS-IC/D), and Resource-21.

AB Time series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, collected daily over two 50-km targets during March-June 1997 in Hungary, were corrected for angular effects using coincident multiangle Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) Level-2 Land Surface data products. The POLDER data used consisted of narrow-band 0.67- and 0.765-mum reflectances corrected for ozone and water vapor absorption and Rayleigh scattering effects. The AVHRR visible (0.55-0.75 mum) and near-IR (0.68-1.05 mum) data were converted to reflectances, screened for clouds, and corrected for the same atmospheric effects as the POLDER data. Neither POLDER nor AVHRR data were collected for aerosol effects. POLDER reflectances were used to derive bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for each 6-km(2) POLDER grid box. The BRDFs were normalized to the near-nadir values at 45 degrees solar zenith angle, resulting in the anisotropic factors, which were derived for each month for each grid box. Thus, seasonal variability of local anisotropy for each POLDER, grid box in the target areas was established. The anisotropic factors were then applied to the AVHRR/GAC visible and near-IR reflectances mapped into the POLDER grid. The anisotropy-corrected AVHRR reflectances exhibit less fluctuation than the original uncorrected values, thus, facilitating the interpretation of short-term variability in surface conditions. Application of the POLDER BRDFs to AVHRR data is especially advantageous for processing AVHRR temporal composites because of the scarce angular statistics in the areas of frequent clouds, which hampers derivation of BRDFs from AVHRR data itself. Assuming that the local BRDF does not substantially vary from year to year, this approach could be extended to data from the growing seasons of other years. Ultimately, the multiyear time series could be corrected so that the variability, related to angular effects, inherent to AVHRR time series, is reduced. The current approach suggests a paradigm for a synergistic use of TERRA/EOS Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)/MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data stream.

AB This paper presents a new method to retrieve soil moisture and roughness from ERS-1. Wind scatterometer (WSC) data measured over the HAPEX-Sahel area (semiarid environment). The retrieval algorithm makes full use of the multiangular acquisitions and the high temporal repetition of the measured backscattering coefficients. The vegetation contribution to the signal is taken into account through a first-order radiative transfer model. The soil moisture and roughness are subsequently retrieved, throughout the rainy season, using the copolarization ratio as expressed by Oh et al. [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing GE-30 (1992) 370-381.]. The paper describes the data and the approach used, together with the results gained. A good sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient to soil moisture is obtained. The results are compared with data collected during the HAPEX-Sahel campaign. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID AVHRR DATA; TEMPERATURE
AB A comparative study has been carried out on the most recent algorithms for the estimation of land surface emissivity (epsilon) using Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Three of the algorithms are based on the Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) concept using atmospherically corrected channels 3,4, and/or 5, namely: (1) TISIBL, (2) TS-RAM, and (3) Delta day. The fourth is a simplified method based on the estimation of epsilon using atmospherically corrected data in the visible and near-infrared channels, called Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Thresholds Method (NDVITHM). This method integrates a wide spectral data set of bare soil reflectivity measurements in the 0.4-14-mum band and uses different approaches in function of the NDVI value. All methods have been applied to the Iberian Peninsula using AVHRR/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-14) data during March 17th, 1997. In terms of emissivity, the results dhow that the difference between the NDVITHM method and the other methods is always positive, with a bias of less than 0.010 and a root mean square (rms) error of 0.012 when compared to the TS-RAM method. In terms of land surface temperature, the NDVITHM method shows a bias of less than -0.4 K when compared to Delta day, and a bias of -1.1 K and an rms error of 0.5 K when compared to TS-RAM. In conclusion, although the TISIBL is a precise method, it needs the AVHRR channel 3 for its application, which is not alway available, for example, as in the AVHRR archives provided in the frame of the Pathfinder AVHRR Land project (more than 18 years of data). In this case we have shown that he NDVITHM method shows promising results and can be applied to obtain land surface temperature and emissivity from NOAA data without losing accuracy.

AB Observations by space-borne sensors can provide photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by a canopy (IPAR), which, together with radiation zee efficiency (RUE), can be used to estimate carbon assimilation by terrestrial plant communities. Evaluation of biological and environmental factors determining variability of RUE for daily total gross photosynthesis within and among species suggests a biophysically based approach for estimating daily total grass photosynthesis using satellite and ancillary data. Calculations have been done using leaf photosynthesis and canopy characteristics derived from field measure ments for six cultivated herbaceous and 12 uncultivated (herbaceous and needle leaf and broadleaf woody) species, and mixed species stands of temperate deciduous forest and tropical moist and dry forests. These data are for 65 canopies, divided about equally between cultivated and uncultivated species, and the leaf area index varies between 0.6 and 9.5. A model for instantaneous canopy photosynthesis, considering sunlit and shaded leaves, variation of maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy, and a solution of the radiative transfer equation for propagation of direct and diffuse PAR, is numerically integrated in space (angular variation of radiances and depth within the canopy) and time (diurnal variation) to obtain daily total gross photosynthesis and IPAR for varied incident irradiances. The results show that the maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis and magnitudes of direct and diffuse irradiance incident on the canopy are the major factors determining RUE for unstressed conditions. Also, while woody species on the average have lower RUE, they are found to utilize diffuse radiation more efficiently them cultivated species. Comparison of calculated RUE with observations for 10 cultivated species in varied environment gave differences of -23% to +11% for individual species, but aggregately they have almost equal coefficient of variation (similar to 25%) and their averages differ by -6% (underestimation), Monthly and annual gross photosynthesis determined using satellite and ancillary data are obtained for rainforest (in Brazil), boreal forest (in Canada), and cropland (in the United States). Annual photosynthesis calculated using satellite data for the three biomes differed from, that determined from field measurements by -29% to +15%, averaging to +6%. The above error estimates for RUE and photosynthesis are obtained without calibrating any model parameter. (C)2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Four one-dimensional radiative transfer models are compared in direct and inverse modes. These models are combinations of die PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves), IAPI, KUUSK and NADI (New Advanced Discrete Model) canopy reflectance models. To evaluate their ability to estimate canopy biophysical parameters, inversions were first performed on synthetic reflectance spectra (10 wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared). The simulated spectral and directional reflectances showed good agreement among the four models. A 1997 airborne experiment in the United States was used to test their performance on real data. This experiment gathered a unique data set composed primarily of 200 reflectance spectra acquired over corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max) fields, and the corresponding ground truth (chlorophyll a+b content and leaf area index), Only the first three models, which ran fast enough to allow the processing of a large data set, Lc;ere actually inverted by iterative optimization techniques, Inversions were conducted in successive stages where the number of retrieved parameters was reduced. No significant difference can be observed bet cc;een the three models. Globally, the leaf mesophyll structure parameter and leaf dry matter content couldn't be estimated. The chlorophyll content, the leaf area index, and the mean leaf inclination angle yielded better results, although the fatter wasn't validated due to missing ground data. Assuming that model inversion by iterative optimization techniques is a promising method to extract information on plant canopies, the SAIL and KUUSK models, which perform well in terms of accuracy and running ti,ne, proved to be good candidates for remote sensing application in ecology or agriculture (precision farming).

AB Global data sets on land surface albedo will be one of the core products to be derived from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), part of NASA's Earth Observing System. Widespread acceptance of this product by the user communities is dependent, in part, on a comprehensive and rigorous programme of calibration and validation. Since the MODIS albedo product will be produced at a spatial resolution of 1 km, while measurements obtained from field instruments typically relate to areas of only a few tens of meters, this requires an understanding of the spatial variability of land surface albedo and a robust means of scaling zip from field to satellite measurements. In this article, we examine these issues for a semidesert environment (the PROVE'97 field site at Jornada, New Mexico, USA). Spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo are related to the functional ground cover of different scene elements (live and senescent vegetation, soil and shadow) via a simple linear mixture model. Information on the fractional ground cover of the scene elements is derived from ground-based hemispherical photography. It is shown that the albedo values predicted by the mixture model are accurate to within 2% of the corresponding measured values. This approach offers considerable potential for the validation of MODIS-derived albedo values through the use of spectral mixture modelling applied to fine spatial resolution satellite sensor images.

ID CANOPIES
AB A model for the bidirectional reflectance over soils is coupled with a vegetation reflectance model to predict the bidirectional reflectance of semiarid landscape. The vegetation model is a hybrid of geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model for bidirectional reflectance over discontinuous plant canopies. The coupling is done by relaxing the assumption of Lambertian background into a non-lambertian case in the vegetation GORT model. The non-Lambertian soil background is modeled by a soil BRDF model. The coupled model is validated with POLDER and AVHRR imagery collected in a semiarid: site during the Jornada PROVE'97 campaign with good accuracy. It is a very simple but analytical model for bidirectional reflectance over a semiarid landscape and has the potential for surface parameter retrieval for the study of biosphere-atmosphere interaction.

AB The L-band broadcast signal from the Global Positioning System (GPS) reflected off of the sea surface is under study for use as a ocean, coastal, and wetlands remote sensing tool. The reflected signal from a given GPS satellite is cross-correlated with the pseudorandom noise code uniquely identifying that satellite. The shape of this cross-correlation, ordinarily, a very sharp triangle when tracking a direct line of sight signal, becomes wider and smoother as the mean square slope of the reflecting surface increases. It is proposed that the surface wind speed can be determined by matching the recorded shape of this cross-correlation to that predicted by theoretical models as a function od wind speed and direction. The significance of these effects increases with altitude of the receiver. Experimental data have been collected using a specially modified GPS receiver on aircraft and on a balloon at altitudes of up to 25 km. these data compare favorably with predictions of analytical models and demonstrate the dependence of the waveform shape on surface wind speed and receiver altitude. The advantages that this measurement technique has over conventional scatterometers is the small size, low cost and simplicity of the receiver hardware, no requirement for a transmitter, and the ability to simultaneously collect data from usually 10 or more points (from a low earth-orbiting satellite). This number could be larger if the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System satellites are also considered as additional sources of radiation. Furthermore, the bistatic scattering geometry is complementary to the backscatter used by conventional scatterometers. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

TI An anisotropic spatial modeling approach for remote sensing image
   rectification
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Rectification of a remote sensing image is commonly done by applying polynomial regression models to image coordinates and map coordinates of ground control points. A major drawback of the polynomial regression model is that it does not capture the random characteristic of terrain elevation. In fact, the distortion of a remote sensing image is attributed to the variation of terrain elevation and orbital parameters, the variations being random in nature. A more effective approach of remote sensing image rectification is a stochastic approach that takes into account the spatial variation structure of terrain elevation. This article presents an anisotropic spatial modeling approach of image rectification using ordinary kriging estimation. By considering the residuals of polynomial trend mapping as anisotropic random fields, the proposed approach models separately the spatial variation structures of the residuals in X and Y directions, and employs the ordinary kriging method for spatial interpolation of the residual random fields. By means of a cross validation procedure, residuals of image rectification by the polynomial trend mapping, the multiquadric interpolation function, and the ordinary kriging approaches are compared. The ordinary kriging approach yields smallest variances and root-mean-squared of mapping errors. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB A method of retrieval of the droplet radius and temperature of oceanic stratocumulus is presented. It is based on night imagery obtained from the infrared channels of NOAA-AVHRR and an atmospheric radiative transfer model that makes use of the discrete ordinate method DISORT. It uses the observed satellite brightness temperature differences (BTD) between channels 4 and 5 to obtain the cloud temperature and between channels 3 and 4 to extract the effective radius of the cloud droplets. We also studied the peculiarities of the method, taking into account the behavior of the single scattering parameters, deduced from Mie theory, with droplet size. Results obtained are compared with in situ data collected at the Canary Islands (Spain) during summer 1996. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB A hybrid segmentation procedure to integrate contextual information with per-pixel classification in a metropolitan area land cover classification project is described and evaluated. If is presented as a flexible tool within a commercially available image processing environment, allowing components to be adapted or replaced according to the users needs, the image type, and the availability of state-of-the-art algorithms. In the case of the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, die combination of die Shen and Castan edge detection operator with iterative centroid linkage region growing/merging based on Student's t-tests proved optimal when compared to other more common contextual approaches, such as majority filtering and the Extraction and Classification of Homogenous geneous Objects classifier. Postclassification sorting Further improved the results by reducing residual confusion between urban and bare soil categories. Overall accuracy of the optimal classification technique was 91.4% for a level II classification (10 classes) with a K-e of 90.5%. The incorporation of contextual information in the classification. process improved accuracy by 5.8% and K-e by 6.5%. As expected, classification accuracy for a simplified level I classification (five classes) was higher with 95.4% and 94.3% for K-e. A second important advantage of the technique is the reduced occurrence of smaller mapping units, resulting in a more attractive classification map compared to traditional per-pixel maximum likelihood classification results.

AB In preparation for new satellite sensors, such as VEGETATION on SPOT-4 and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), we investigate the potential of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) signal to improve Leaf Area Index (AI) retrieval in the boreal forests of Canada. Our study demonstrates that an empirical SWIR modification to the simple ration (SR) vegetation index, termed the reduced simple ration (RSR), has the potential to unify deciduous and conifer species in LAI retrieval, shows increased sensitivity to LAI, and demonstrates an improved correlation with LAI in individual jack pine and black spruce canopies. The unification of deciduous and conifer species suggests the possibility of not requiring a cover type stratification prior to retrieving LAI information from remotely sensed data, and has impact where no cover type information will be made or where the mix of cover types within a pixel is unknown. We use a geometric-optical canopy reflectance model to quantify the potential variation in jack pine and black spruce canopy reflectance caused by differences in background reflectance. The modeling study supports the results from the image analysis of the RSR showing increased sensitivity to LAI and reducing background effects in these conifer canopies.

ID SURFACE ALBEDO; GREENLAND; SUMMER; SHEET; AVHRR
AB This article deals with the anisotropic reflection of radiation by melting glacier ice. Ground-based measurements of the directional distribution of the reflected radiation over the hemisphere (so-called BRDFs=bidirectional reflectance distribution functions) were made on the Morteratschgletscher (Switzerland) in Landsat TM bands 2 (520-600 nm) and 4 (760-900 nm). These BRDFs cover a wide range of solar zenith angles (26-75 degrees) and surface characteristics (quantified by a variation in the spectrally integrated albedo between 0.14 and 0.50). All BRDFs exhibit a similar pattern with a minimum in the nadir direction and a maximum in the forward limb, but the amount of a anisotropy increases with increasing wavelength, with increasing solar zenith angle and with decreasing albedo. The data were used to derive parametrizations rations (one for each TM band) which relate the bidirectional reflectance (the reflectance in a specific direction) to the albedo for a given solar-view geometry. Specific parametrisations (one for each TM band) for near-nadir reflection" are also presented. All these parameterizations can be used to convert satellite-derived bidirectional reflectances into surface albedos and thus do correct for anisotropic reflectance. The residual uncertainty in the albedo due to inaccuracy of the correction is estimated to be 0.02 in both TM bands. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has potential use as a means of measuring soil-water content from space or high altitude airborne platforms. However, the signal from other landscape features, such as topography, vegetation, and surface roughness, may overwhelm and confound the soil moisture signal. Previous researchers tried to correct for topographic effects using incident angle (theta) as the most significant landscape variable. Those corrections were not effective because of the poor correlation between the SAR backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) and theta. This may be attributed to surface roughness, vegetation effects, or low resolution digital elevation data. In this article, we determined the effects of vegetation, surface roughness, and topography on sigma(0). By comparing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the SAR-based vegetation index (SBVI), it was found that the sparse vegetation cover of sagebrush in the rangeland areas of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) does not affect L band HH polarization SAR sigma(0). Root mean square (RMS) height of surface (h), determined using L band copolarized SAR sigma(0) in an empirical algorithm (Dubois et al., 1995), helped in stratifying the study area into low and high surface roughness areas. The high surface roughness areas, determined using the algorithm, were found to match with very rocky and extremely rocky areas, classified using detailed soil type information in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The performance of theta-based correction function improved significantly after incorporating h into the mode. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

ID SATELLITE; IMAGES
AB A method for constructing a pasture Tend cai;er classification for the high rainfall zone of eastern Australia from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NOAA-AVHRR NDVI) data is described. The method uses an established classification of pasture growth potential from single date, springtime, Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data to provide measures of subpixel mixture composition in mosaicked classes in the absence of ground truth or control sites. A sequence of AVHRR data front 1993 was transformed into a vegetation index and then classified to define pasture classes with differing patterns of NDVI. High-resolution classifications of pasture were constructed for ten selected sites within the study area by using Landsat TM scenes. The study area rc;as split into a northern and southern zone on the basis of the temporal pattern of moisture(re indices. The pasture land cover classes were described irt terms of the shape of the NDVI profiles, their geographical location, and the subpixel composition front Landsat Tn data. The classified NDVI data were combined with local government area (LGA) boundary data to allow the particular pasture state of each LGA to be estimated. The NDVI-Landsat TM procedure identified 21 and 22 classes in the northern and southern zones, respectively. These classes could be broadly grouped into eight types: seton perennial pastures, sown perennial pastures with woodland seton annual pastures (southern zone only), mixed pasture and cropping, native pastures, native pastures with woodland, degraded or revegetated areas, and forest. This eight-class classification, combining the two zones appeared to represent regional distribution of the major types quite well. The pasture land cover classification was evaluated for selected LGAs by using agricultural statistics and a specialist pasture survey. Local estimates of proportions of major pasture types were sometimes in-accurate owing to difficulties in distinguishing between perennial, annual, and native types where seasonal conditions caused rapid senescence or where open woodland confused profiles between improved and native pastures. The method is nevertheless usefull where ground truth or definitive spectral signatures for cover types are unavailable and IL;where description lit terms of art average or predominant cover type within a landscape mosaic is acceptable.

AB A method of predicting two forest stand structure attributes, basal area and aboveground biomass, from measurements of forest vertical structure was developed and tested using field and remotely sensed canopy structure measurements. Coincident estimates of the vertical distribution of canopy structure measurements. Coincident estimates of the vertical distribution of canopy surface area (the canopy height profile), and field-measured stand structure attributes were acquired for two data sets. the chronosequence data set consists of 48 plots in stands distributed within 25 miles of Annapolis, MD, with canopy height profiles measured in the field using the optical-quadrat method. The stem-map data set consists of 75 plots subsetted from a single 32 ha stem-mapped stand, with measurements of their canopy height profiles made using the SLICER (Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery) instrument, an airborne surface lidar system. Four height indices, maximum, median, mean, and quadratic mean canopy height (QMCH) were calculated from the canopy height profiles. Regressions between the indices and stand basal area and biomass were developed using the chronosequence data set. The regression equations developed from the chronosequence data set were then applied to height indices calculated from the remotely sensed canopy height profiles from the stem map data set, and the ability of the regression equations to predict the stem map plot's stand structure attributes was then evaluated. The QMCH was found to explain the most variance in the chronosequence data set's stand structure attributes, and to most accurately predict the values of the same attributes in the stem map data set. For the chronosequence data set, the QMCH predicted 70% of variance in stand basal area, and 80% of variance in aboveground biomass, and remained nonasymptotic with basal areas up to 50 m(2) ha(-1), and aboveground biomass values up to 450 Mg ha(-1). When applies to the stem-map data set, the regression equations resulted in basal areas that were, on average, underestimated by 2.1 m(2) ha(-1), and biomass values were underestimated by 16 Mg ha(-1), and explained 37% and 33% of variance, respectively. Differences in the magnitude of the coefficients of determination were due to the wider range of stand conditions found in the chronosequence data set; the standard deviation of residual values were lower in the stem map data set than on the chronosequence data sets. Stepwise multiple regression was performed to predict the two stand structure attributes using the canopy height profile data directly as independent variables, but they did not improve the accuracy of the estimates over the height index approach.

AB This article is devoted to the retrieval of bidirectional reflectivity in AVHRR Channel 3 (3.75 mu m). In the midinfrared spectral region, the ground radiance is a combination, of a radiance emitted by the surface and a reflected radiance due to sun irradiation. Using combined day/night AVHRR data, the emitted part of the radiance is estimated allowing; for the determination of the reflected part. Emphasis is placed on the accuracy achievable on the measurement of the reflectivity in AVHRR Channel 3. A detailed sensitivity analysis of the method is performed, taking into account the different sources of error. The analysis is applied to series of images covering a region of Northern Africa. Atmospheric corrections are performed using the MODTRAN code with atmospheric data extracted from the AVISO (Meteo France) data base. Processing a large number of orbits gives access to a wide range of satellite view angles. Furthermore, use of morning NOAA 12 and noon NOAA 14 overpasses leads to essentially two Sun illumination directions (principal and perpendicular planes). For several selected areas, the angular reflectivity is represented along with absolute error. Reflectivity exhibits a large angular variation demonstrating a non-Lambertian behavior at the scale of the measurements. The levels of reflectivity are different from one area to another. A simple semiempirical model is used to represent the angular reflectivity. Emissivity in Channel 3, retrieved from reflectivity by means of an angular form factor, may exhibit strong variations for large angles (>18%). If angular variation of reflectivity is not taken into account, error on emissivity can be up to 15% for the areas studied in this work. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB In an attempt to extract information relevant for agriculture in remotely sensed wheat crops, MIVIS hyperspectral images are analysed in the visible and near-infrared domains. Through the selection, by means of a principal component analysis (PCA), of two endmembers of wheat, related respectively to well-developed and stressed plants, a water deficiency is detected among the spectral population of wheat. The image is then modeled by a spectral mixture analysis (unmixing) of these two wheat endmembers rs, soil, and shade. Resulting fraction images are interpreted in terms of crop vitality (level of green biomass) in relation to stress presence and compared to field knowledge. In addition, these Images allow mapping the leaf area index (LAI) over the whole scene, with an empirical relationship based on 12 ground measurements of this variable. This work shows the interest of the approach combining PCA and unmixing for stress detection and napping of agronomic variables, with a good accuracy compared to spectral ratio analysis. It provides relevant support for crop monitoring and precision agriculture, by means of numerical cartographic products obtained by hyper- (super-) spectral remote sensing. It demonstrates the need for improved methodologies derived from hyperspectral data analysis, and reveals that, through such methods, one can, however, retrieve a significant amount of information with limited number of spectral channels (10-20), highlighting the potential of superspectral observations.

AB The objective of this article is to investigate the possibility of soil moisture retrieval from radar backscatter data in sugar beet fields. The analysis Is based on a simulation study using two models capable of computing electromagnetic backscattering front a vegetated surface, ci;., the model developed by Karam et al. (1995) and the model developed by Lang (1981). First, we validate the models based on data front, the AGRISCATT'88 field campaign, held in Flevoland, The Netherlands. The data collected during this campaign allows Its to test the model predictions under different soil surface and canopy conditions and for different radar configurations. In general, both models are capable of mimicking the change in backscattering due to changes in radar configuration nod surface-vegetation characteristics. Next, both models are subjected to a sensitivity analysis with respect to different surface and canopy parameters. Based on this.sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that estimates of surface soil moisture content under a medium sugar beet cover (15 cm high crop) from L-band radar observations are only possible within 10% accuracy. For a fully developed sugar beet field (50 nn high crop), soil moisture retrieval is not possible. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Multitemporal satellite images have been used to differentiate, measure the areal extent of, and determine transitional probabilities among different secondary forest age classes in the tropics. In these studies, temporal gaps in the satellite archive are common doe to difficulties associated with availability of cloud-free data, costs, temporal discontinuities between satellite sensors, etc. In this probability study, examples of multitemporal image sequences with data gaps are considered in order to illustrate error rates associated with estimating the age of secondary tropical forest. Results indicate that on the order of 8-32% of scene pixels may be misclassified with respect to age of land cover transitions which occur within the data gap(s) are ignored. Using secondary forest regeneration rates from the literature, calculations showed that these gap errors caused the above-ground biomass to be over-estimated by 8-23%. the error rates are scene-dependent. The results are presented to flag a potentially significant source of error. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB A two-stage modeling strategy significantly improves land-cover area estimates from low spatial resolution remote sensing by correcting measurements of class proportions within large blocks of pixels. Vegetation class-type information is developed through supervised classification of Thematic Mapper spectral data at both fine (30 m) and coarse (1020 m) resolutions. Stage 1 models use measurements of landscape spatial properties to estimate the slopes nad intercepts of proportion transition relationships between fine- and coarse-resolution classes within randomly located pixel blocks. Following this step, a Stage II model uses a linear estimator to predict true class proportions based on measured coarse-scale proportions and the slope and intercept estimates from the Stage I models. Model development and testing on a training site is followed by testing and inversion for a validation site. Model inversion involves using spatial variables measured only at the coarse resolution as input to the Stage I models. For both the training and the validation data, the procedure results in a statistically significant reduction in error when estimating land-cover area by class type within the sampling blocks.

TI Infrared measurements of pristine and disturbed soils 1. Spectral
   contrast differences between field and laboratory data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID EMISSIVITY; MINERALS; IMAGES; ROCKS
AB Comparison of emissivity spectra (8-13 mu m) of pristine soils in the field with laboratory reflectance spectra of the same soils showed that laboratory spectra tend to have less spectral contrast than field spectra (see following article). We investigated this phenomenon by measuring emission spectra of both undisturbed (in situ) and disturbed soils (prepared as if for transport to the laboratory). The disturbed soils had much less spectral contrast than the undisturbed soils in the resistrahlen region near 9 mu m. While the increased porosity of a disturbed soil can decrease spectral contrast due to multiple scattering, we hypothesize that the effect is dominantly the result of a difference in grain-site distribution of the optically active layer (i.e., fine particle coatings). This concept was proposed by Salisbury et al. (1994) to explain their observations that soils washed free of small particles adhering to larger grains exhibited greater spectral contrast than unwashed soils. Our laboratory reflectance spectra of wet- and dry-sieved soils returned from field sites also show greater spectral contrast for wet-sieved (washed) soils. We therefore propose that undisturbed soils in the field can be characterized as "clean" soils (washed free of fine particles at the surface due to rain and wind action) and that disturbed soils represent "dirty" soils (contaminated with fine particle coatings). The effect of packing soils in the field and laboratory also increases spectral contrast but not to the magnitude of that observed for undisturbed and wet-sieved soils. Since it is a common practice to use laboratory spectra of field samples to interpret spectra obtained remotely, we suggest that the influence of fine particle coatings on disturbed soils, if unrecognized, could influence interpretations of remote sensing data.

AB A linear mixture model was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper data to map iron-oxide content over the northern part of the Namib Sand Sea, Namibia. Field samples were collected to calibrate the remotely sensed iron oxide proportions to dithionite extractable Fe in mg g(-1), the in situ proportions correlating strongly with the remotely sensed estimates (r=0.91). The results reveal a region of high Fe-oxide concentration in the east, an area of low Fe-oxide concentration in the west, separated by a mixing zone. We interpret this to indicate that there is more than one sand source contributing to the sand sea. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID IMAGING SPECTROMETER DATA; CLASSIFICATION; VISUALIZATION; IMAGES
AB A new approach toward mineral mapping from imaging spectrometer data is presented, using a spectral matching algorithm based on the cross correlogram. A cross correlogram is constructed by calculating the cross correlation at different match positions, m, between a test spectrum (i.e., a pixel spectrum) and a reference spectrum (i.e., a laboratory mineral spectrum or a pixel spect-nlm Known to represent a mineral of interest) by shifting the reference spectrum over subsequent channel positions. The cross correlogram for perfectly matching reference and test spectra is a parabola around the central matching number (m = 0) with a peak correlation of 1. In laboratory spectra, deviations from this shape indicate differences in mineralogy, whereas, in image data, this may be partly attributed to spectral mixing, noise, changes in atmospheric and illumination conditions, and other scene and sensor-dependent variables. A cross correlogram spectral matching algorithm was designed and tested on 1994 data from the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer of the Cuprite mining area. Accurate mapping of kaolinite, alunite, and buddingtonite was achieved by extracting three parameters from the cross correlograms that were constructed on a pixel-by-pixel basis: the correlation coefficient at match position. zero, the moment of skewness (based on the correlation differences between match numbers of equal but reversed signs; e.g., m = 4 and m = -4), and the significance (based on a Student's t-test of the validity of the correlation coefficients).

AB Eolian sand covers a large part of the Arabian Peninsula. The flow of eolian sand is ongoing, and sand covers bedrock as well as fluvial features of the Peninsula; consequently, there is a gap in the understanding of the geological processes shaping the region. The extensive coverage of Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) data over the Arabian Peninsula has provided a new means of mapping sand obscured features. The preliminary interpretation of the data has identified several sites where L-band reveals sand-covered geological structures and drainage channels that are not shown on published maps and are not traceable with more conventional methods. The indications are that these radar data may lead to improving the geological and fluvial geomorphic understanding of the region. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

In contrast, reclamation efforts in the desert and coastal areas increase the amount of land cultivated In this study, field-calibrated, multitemporal NDVI features derived from 10 Landsat TM images dating from 1984 to 1993 were used to assess the status of agricultural lands in the Nile Delta, and adjacent Western Desert and coastal regions. Four classes central to agricultural planning in the Delta are healthy agricultural lands, fields of reduced productivity, urban settlements, and urban expansion. The results indicate that 3.74% of agricultural land in the Delta has reduced productivity. This quantity is greater than previously realized, indicating a need to incorporate these lands in reclamation planning. The amount of land lost to urbanization, defined as the encroachment of an existing urban settlement onto previously productive agricultural lands, is less than anticipated. Only 0.4% of productive agricultural lands were converted to new urban use between 1984 and 1990. Assessment of reclamation in the Western Desert and coastal areas over six time periods indicates continued high rates of reclamation. Between 1986 and 1993, the amount of cultivated land in these regions increased by 43.3%. The high overall accuracy of the map (95.85%) supports the use of multitemporal features in mapping the status of agricultural lands.

AB This article extends the calibration method of Mitchell, O'Brien, and Forgan (1992) to the calibration of the AVHRR on NOAA 11 using a data set obtained over the period January to May 1991. The method correlates AVHRR response against radiances computed from a radiative transfer model whose parameters are constrained by surface measurements. The data consist of cloud free AVHRR images over the ocean west of Tasmania and simultaneous sun photometer measurements of aerosol optical depth at Cape Grim, some 50 km from the ocean target. Ancilliary surface meteorological data are also employed. The best estimate of the mean gain in Channel 1 over the first half of 1991 is 1.75 +/- 0.09 counts per W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1), in good agreement with several other determinations using a variety of techniques. However, differences among results from the various methods suggests that ultimate accuracy in the determination of sensor gain is limited to similar to +/- 5%. Spurious results are obtained when the aerosol depth measured at Cape Grim does not characterize the airmass over the ocean target. This situation can arise when winds are light and variable in direction during the observing period. Under these circumstances it is not valid to use the sun photometer aerosol optical depths to model the upwelling radiance over the ocean. In addition, uncertainty In wind speed over the target site introduces significant error into the method. The technique is found to be unreliable in Channel 2 due to problems connected with water vapour absorption.

AB Geological and hydrogeological remote sensing techniques can be applied very favorably to Dinaric karst in the Balkans, a well-known reference area for studies of karst phenomena. The elements that make karst terrain of the Dinarides suitable for remote sensing are geomorphologic characteristics, in particular the specific surface drainage and karst forms, the varying vegetation that most often reflects the existence of different geologic formations on the surface, and distinct tectonic features. Some of the world's largest springs, ponors (sinks), and dolines are controlled by fractures visible on both satellite images and aerial photographs. Lineaments represent fault zones, systems of close faults with similar strike, or large individual faults which all are young or show recently renewed activity. Their neotectonic character and major importance for karst groundwater flow are confirmed by numerous field investigations including water tracing, geophysical research, and drilling.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is generally considered as an index minimizing the radiometric errors on image data has to be corrected radiometrically when a quantitative analysis is performed. In this article, the main factors affecting NDVI are analyzed: proper characteristics (MTF) and absolute calibration of the satellite sensor, Sun zenith angle, Earth-Sun distance, and atmospheric condition. The effects of these factors are theoretically and practically analyzed on two SPOT-HRV and Landsat-TM images acquired the same day over the same area in southeast France. Some simplified correction methods are proposed. The results show that: i) The conversion of digital counts into apparent reflectance is the most important step for NDVI correction. Without this correction, a relatively constant error affects NDVI depending on the sensor considered (- 0.18 for SPOT-HRV and - 0.10 for Landsat TM). ii) The MTF correction does not affect the average NDVI value; its interest is to restore the radiometric level of individual pixels that have a large contrast with their surroundings. iii) The atmospheric effects are similar in the homologous spectral bands of SPOT-HRV and Landsat TM. Their correction increases the dynamic range of NDVI variation (around 24% in the example presented) and consequently the contrast between different targets. The effect of the noncoincidence of SPOT-HRV and Landsat-TM spectral bands is also studied. This effect can be considered either as a source of error or as a supplementary source of information. An example shows that the combination of the spectral information given by the two satellites can be used to improve the discrimination of some targets such as bare soil and soil with a low vegetation density.

AB Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was applied to a 4.6-year sequence of AVHRR images off Baja California centered near Punta Eugenia to examine large- and mesoscale processes in this region of the California Current System (CCS). The mean structure found in the image sequence describes the seasonal cycle in sea surface temperature (SST) and the large-scale, north-south, oceanic SST gradient of the region. The first EOF-amplitude pair also describes the seasonal cycle in SST. Both results are consistent with long-term, large-scale, mean ship-board data for the region. The second EOF-amplitude pair defines two distinct regions paralleling the coast. The inshore region coincides with the coastal zone of Lynn and Simpson (1987), and the adjacent region farther offshore is identical to their transition zone.  The third through fifth EOF-amplitude pairs primarily represent meandering of the California Current and anticyclonic mesoscale eddy occurrences in the region; these results also are consonant with a large number of shipboard observations. The EOF results provide independent satellite-derived evidence for the existence of a transition zone off Baja California which is similar to that found off central and southern California. Moreover, the agreement between the satellite-based results and the shipboard observations indicates that satellite data can be used successfully to study other current systems (e.g., Peru Current), where in situ observations (ships, buoys) are less abundant.

AB To explore the effects of radar scene degradation on the interpretation of forest pattern, we used a model to simulate L-band (23 cm) backscatter (VV, HV, and HH, polarizations) for a range of resolutions (5 m, 10 m, 12.1 m, 15 m, and 24.2 m). Simulated pixels were parameterized with tree density and height for each tree (> 3 cm dbh) covering a 200 m x 150 m area from an immature, conifer-dominated stand in the Northern Experimental Forest located near Howland, Maine. Airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) imagery from the stand was used to evaluate the ability of the model to predict single pixel and textural patterns at 12.1 m resolution. Although the model was unable to accurately predict pixel-by-pixel responses, probably due to registration error, textural patterns from the HH polarized image were correlated to the simulated patterns. The model's assumption Of randomly distributed sterns within each pixel was another probable source of error as trees in this stand were aggregated at scales from 1 m to 50 m. Despite model inadequacies, significant pattern was found at all simulated backscatter resolutions for all polarizations for most quadrat sizes (< 10,000 m2), but only for smaller quadrat sizes (< 6,000 m2) for within-pixel structural properties (i.e., stem, branch, and leaf biomasses, stem density, and average height). This suggests that radar textural information resulting from forest heterogeneity should be available at scales coarser than 24.2 m for forests of similar structure.

AB Laser-induced fluorescence emission of green terrestrial vegetation has become of high interest in remote LIDAR techniques in recent years. The remote sensing of blue and red fluorescence signatures appears to be a suitable future tool to determine the state of health of plants. In this contribution we report about major factors which determine the intensities of the UV-laser (337 nm) excited blue fluorescence near 450 nm and the red chlorophyll fluorescence between 650 nm and 800 nm as well as the ratio of the blue to the red fluorescence F450/F690. In contrast to green plants grown in a phytochamber or at low light intensities, plants grown in the field at a high photon flux density (PFD) showed high values for the ratio of the blue to the red fluorescence F450/F690, which was due to a relatively low intensity of the red chlorophyll fluorescence. The strongly increased ratio F450/F690 was primarily caused by a much reduced penetration depth of the exciting UV light into the leaf which seemed to be due to substances absorbing in the epidermal layers. Etiolated wheat leaves exhibited a stronger blue fluorescence intensity than green leaves and showed also a small maximum around 530 nm (green fluorescence). White leaves of wheat treated with the bleaching herbicide norfluorazone (10(-4) M) and leaves from which the photosynthetic pigments had been extracted by acetone showed a fourfold and tenfold increase of the blue fluorescence, respectively. Isolated chloroplasts and thylakoids did not exhibit a blue-green fluorescence. It is concluded that the blue fluorescence is mainly caused by phenolic plant substances located in the cell wall and/or vacuoles of leaves. Partial reabsorption of the emitted blue and red fluorescence by the photosynthetic pigments modifies the shape of the fluorescence spectra.

AB Microwave emission from a soybean field was measured using a multifrequency radiometer:  PORTOS. The experiment was conducted throughout the growing season. The acquired data are used in this study to assess how passive microwave measurements could be used to estimate land surface parameters. To this end, a method of inversion of remotely sensed data using a random continuous model was developed. Both soil moisture and biomass, parameterized by the vegetation volume fraction, appear to have very significant effect on the evolution of the microwave signal. Using different polarization and frequency (1.4 GHz, 5.05 GHz, and 36.5 GHz) configurations of the radiometer, the estimation of these two parameters is discussed. When monitoring biomass increase by PORTOS, saturation of the microwave signal appears at 5.05 GHz and 36.5 GHz, whereas the 1.4 GHz signal goes on increasing. Soil moisture was well retrieved at 1.4 GHz and 5.05 GHz throughout the growing season. The results of this study should improve both the interpretation of passive remotely sensed data over vegetated areas and the use of continuous modeling for inversion algorithms of land surface parameters.

AB A study of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) in relation to surface roughness properties was conducted in arid land near Fowlers Gap Research Station, New South Wales, Australia. Such empirical study is necessary for investigating the possibility of determining terrain geomorphological parameters from bidirectional reflectance data. A new apparatus was developed to take accurate hemispherical directions radiance measurements (HDRM). A digitizer for three-dimensional in situ roughness measurements was also developed. More than 70 hemispherical data sets were collected for various illumination conditions and surface types of desert stony pavements and rocky terrain slopes. In general, it was found that most of the surfaces exhibited an anisotropic reflection, combining a major component of backscattering. The BRDF of different surface types in relation to their roughness properties as determined by the field digitizer were then examined. Results showed that sites that are considered to differ significantly from a geomorphological point of view would not necessarily form a different BRDF.

AB This study highlights advantages of using radar data combined with multispectral data to improve the interpretation of the geology over temperate agricultural regions. After speckle reduction and geometric correction, a Seasat image was combined with a multispectral SPOT image in order to enhance geological features. Two different merging procedures have been examined: photographic and numerical procedures. The photographic techniques consist in assigning the cyan, magenta, and yellow gun colors to the Seasat and SPOT channels. Combinations such as XS2-Seasat-XS3 or XS2-XS3-Seasat improve enhancement of the hydrological network and of the agricultural parcels, both features depending on the basement structure. The numerical procedures include principal components analysis (PCA) and IHS transforms. The PCA appears to be the best numerical procedure to merge Seasat and SPOT data, if centered and standardized data are used as input files. When using the IHS merging procedure, the best results were obtained after a weighting of Seasat by the XS3 SPOT channel. However, results obtained when using IHS transform show less enhancement than when using PCA. Lineament maps were derived from the merged color composites. The geometry of the south armorican shear zone is defined. This geometry corresponds to kilometric C surfaces and S planes. The merging of Seasat and SPOT also points out circular features which correspond to known or previously unmapped granites.

TI A CHANGE DETECTION STRATEGY FOR MONITORING VEGETATIVE AND LAND-USE COVER
   TYPES USING REMOTELY-SENSED, SATELLITE-BASED DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes to our environment are of critical concern in our world today; consequently, monitoring such changes and assessing their impacts are tasks demanding considerably higher priority. The ecological impacts of the natural global cycles of gases and particulates in the earth's atmosphere are highly influenced by the extent of ''changes'' to vegative canopy characteristics which dictates the need for a capability to detect and assess the magnitude of such changes. The primary emphasis of this paper is on the determination of the size and configuration of the sampling unit that maximizes the probability of its intersection with a ''change'' area. Assessment of the significance of the ''change'' in a given locality is also addressed and relies on a statistical approach that compares the number of elemental units (e.g., pixels) exceeding a reflectance threshold when compared to a previous point in time. Consideration is also given to a technical framework that supports quantifying the magnitude of the ''change'' over large areas (i.e., at regional, continental, and global levels-e.g., the estimated area changing from forest to agricultural land-use). The latter entails a multistage approach which utilizes satellite-based and other related data sources.

AB Several simple binary codes are applied to AVIRIS data to develop a spectral representation that facilitates efficient library searching in applications where identification is dependent on matching a measured spectrum against library prototypes. Excellent results are demonstrated using libraries generated by clustering image segments, suggesting the value of the procedure in general. Drawing on this experience, it is shown that good thematic mapping can also be achieved with spectra that have been binary-coded, using algorithms based on minimum Hamming distance measures.

AB The remote determination Of surface temperature and surface spectral emittance by use of airborne or satellite-borne thermal infrared instruments is not straightforward. The radiance measured is a function Of surface temperature, the unknown surface spectral emittance, and absorption and emission in the intervening atmosphere. With a single measurement, the solution for temperature and spectral emittance is underdetermined. This article reviews two of the early approximate methods which have been fairly widely used to approach this problem.

TI INFRARED (8-14 MU-M) REMOTE-SENSING OF SOIL PARTICLE-SIZE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Particle size of soils plays a significant role in erosion potential and other mechanical properties. Most soils are dominated by the residual mineral quartz, which displays prominent reststrahlen bands in the 8-14 mum atmospheric window. The Earth Observing System (EOS) will likely provide world-wide multispectral imagery in the 8-14 mum region via the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument. The ratio of ASTER bands 10/14 can be used to estimate particle size in soils, if other ASTER bands are used to minimize the confusion factors provided by soil moisture, vegetation cover, soil organic content, and the presence of abundant minerals other than quartz, Use of band ratios minimizes the effects of poor surface temperature estimates, but maximizes the need for high signal-to-noise data.

AB In the application of remote sensing at optical wavelengths to vegetated land surfaces from satellite-borne high-resolution instruments, such as those scheduled for the Earth Observing System, an understanding of the various physical mechanisms that contribute to the measured signal is important. In this context, numerical radiative transfer in three-dimensional coupled medium of atmosphere and vegetation has several applications, as in the development of correction routines for atmospheric perturbations, target information retrieval techniques, study of terrain elevation and adjacency effects, etc. A numerical method for solving the radiative transfer equation in three spatial dimensions was recently developed and analyzed for its numerical behavior. In this article, continued development of the method is reported, including an efficient acceleration algorithm. The reliability of coding and accuracy of the algorithm are evaluated by benchmarking. Parameterization of the method and results of a simulation are presented to document the utility of the code for applications in optical remote sensing studies of vegetated land surfaces. A simple model of the hot spot effect and sample calculations are presented. Finally, the radiative transfer method is tested with experimental data of vegetation canopy reflectance factors at two wavelengths.

DT Article
ID REFLECTANCE; CANOPIES; CORN
AB A general computer graphics based model, named DIANA, is presented for computer generation of objects of arbitrary shape (including vegetation canopies) and for calculating bidirectional reflectances and scattering from them, in the visible and near infrared regions. The computer generation uses a modified Lindenmayer system (L-system) approach. With this approach, one can, in a simple way, generate objects of arbitrary shapes (such as plants and trees and their canopies, houses of various shapes, and mountains) as well as simulation of their growth, dynamics, and movement. In rendering an object on a computer screen, the object is divided into facets (triangles and quadrilaterals), and some existing and some new computer graphics techniques are used to display the object, with shading and shadowing appropriately taken into account. These rendering techniques are also used, in an innovative way, to calculate the scattering and reflectance from the object. The use of the technique is illustrated with scattering from canopies of simulated corn plants. The scattering is quantified using traditional measures like bidirectional reflectance factor and albedo as well as rendering of the canopies with brightness of a facet proportional to the amount of light scattered from the object in the viewer's direction.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The ground-based, X-band radar backscattering of wheat, barley, and oats was investigated through the growing season at VV and HH polarizations, and at incidence angles from 10-degrees to 80-degrees.  The VV and HH backscattering of wheat and barley decreased at all incidence angles with crop growth until it fluctuated around a stable level from grain filling to dying of the canopy.  The VV backscattering of oats at low to medium angles of incidence decreased during vegetative growth and sharply increased to a steady level with the appearance of the panicles.  The geometrical architecture of the crop canopy was a major factor that influenced the X-band radar backscattering of wheat, barley, and oats.  Row spacing, crop variety, lodging, and ear orientation of barley had a large effect on the radar backscattering.  The architecture of the canopy also influenced the impact of the soil background on the radar backscattering of the whole crop.  Stubble and straw largely determined the radar backscattering of harvested fields.  Because of the many complex factors that influence the canopy structure, the radar backscattering was highly variable through the years.

AB Over the past several decades, Arctic sea ice has experienced a significantly longer summer melt season, with an earlier melt onset and delayed freeze onset. The early melt onset/melt onset date (EMO/MO) and early freeze onset/freeze onset date (EFO/FO) products developed using the passive microwave (PMW) algorithm derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave data are widely used in the study of the variability in Arctic sea ice freezing melting. Here, we apply the PMW algorithm to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E/2) dataset at a higher spatial resolution and improve the algorithm. We first limit the start and end dates according to the sea ice concentration (SIC). Then, we exclude false freezing signals by identifying high variability in SIC; finally, we consider changes in the distribution of sea ice types (first-year ice and multiyear ice) over time to obtain an improved algorithm. The early freeze onset (EFO) and FO derived from the AMSR data are then compared with results derived from the surface air tem-perature and sea skin temperature (SAT & SKT) and SSM/I products. The spatial distribution of the new EFO results shows greater consistency with SAT & SKT than with the results of SSM/I, with a mean error, absolute error, and root mean square error for the SAT & SKT comparison of 3.7 days, 10.4 days, and 16.0 days, respectively, for the AMSR2 period. The improved FO and EFO correct the small values caused by misidentified summer melt signals and the large values caused by sea ice dynamic processes after the melt season. There is a constant change in ice type over 20%-30% of the ice cover, and the improved FO and EFO correct for anomalies due to misidentified ice types. The improved results correlate better with the interannual variability in EFO derived from SAT & SKT in subregions, especially in ice marginal regions. The Arctic sea ice EFO north of 70 degrees N was delayed at a rate of 6.4 day/dec from 2003 to 2021, with remarkable trends found in the Laptev (14.6 day/ dec) and Kara (14.1 day/dec) Seas.

AB Accurate long-term sensor calibration and periodic re-processing to ensure consistency and continuity of atmospheric, land and ocean geophysical retrievals from space within the mission period and across different missions is a major requirement of climate data records. In this work, we applied the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC)-based vicarious calibration technique over Libya-4 desert site to perform calibration analysis of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. For both VIIRS sensors we characterized residual linear calibration trends and cross-calibrated both sensors to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua regarded as a calibration standard. The relative spectral response (RSR) differences were accounted for using the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) hyperspectral surface reflectance data. Our results agree with independent vicarious calibration results of both the MODIS/VIIRS Characterization Support Team as well as the CERES Imager and Geostationary Calibration Group within estimated uncertainty of 1-2%. Analysis of MAIAC geophysical products with the new calibration shows a high level of agreement of MAIAC aerosol, surface reflectance and NDVI records between MODIS and VIIRS. Excluding high aerosol optical depth (AOD), all three sensors agree in AOD with mean difference (MD) less than 0.01 and residual mean squared difference rmsd - 0.04. Spectral geometrically normalized surface reflectance agrees within rmsd of 0.003-0.005 in the visible and 0.01-0.012 at longer wavelengths. The residual surface reflectance differences are fully explained by differences in spectral filter functions. Finally, difference in NDVI is characterized by rmsd 0.02 and MD less than 0.003 for NDVI based on VIIRS imagery bands I1/I2 and less than 0.01 for NDVI based on VIIRS radiometric bands M5/M7. In practical sense, these numbers indicate consistency and continuity in MAIAC records ensuring the smooth transition from MODIS to VIIRS.

AB Advancements in satellite-based forest monitoring increasingly enable the near real-time detection of small-scale tropical forest disturbances. However, there is an urgent need to enhance such monitoring methods with automated direct driver attributions to detected disturbances. This would provide important additional information to make forest disturbance alerts more actionable and useful for uptake by different stakeholders. In this study, we demonstrate spatially explicit and near real-time methods to monitor direct drivers of small-scale tropical forest disturbance across a range of tropical forest conditions in Suriname, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We trained a convolutional neural network with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to continuously classify newly detected RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) alerts as smallholder agriculture, road development, selective logging, mining or other. Different monitoring scenarios were evaluated based on varying sensor combinations, post-disturbance time periods and confidence levels. In general, the use of Sentinel-2 data was found to be most accurate for driver classifications, especially with data composited over a period of 4 to 6 months after the disturbance detection. Sentinel-1 data showed to be valuable for more rapid classifications of specific drivers, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. Throughout all monitoring scenarios, smallholder agriculture was classified most accurately, while road development, selective logging and mining were more challenging to distinguish. An accuracy assessment throughout the full extent of our study regions revealed a Macro-F1 score of 0.861 and an Overall Accuracy of 0.897 for the best performing model, based on the use of 6-month post-disturbance Sentinel-2 composites. Finally, we addressed three specific monitoring use cases that relate to rapid law enforcement against illegal activities, ecological impact assessments and timely carbon emission reporting, by optimizing the trade-off in classification timeliness and confidence to reach required accuracies. Our findings demonstrate the strong capacities of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data for monitoring direct drivers of small-scale forest disturbance, considering different user interests.

AB Tropical Asia has shown a strong greening trend in recent years. However, detailed knowledge about changes in carbon stocks remain uncertain as only few studies have used remotely sensed vegetation products for moni-toring spatial and temporal changes of aboveground live biomass carbon (AGC) in that region. This study aims at evaluating optical-and microwave-based vegetation proxies (i.e., LAI, percent tree cover (PTC), L-/X-/C-band vegetation optical depths (VOD)) for understanding the spatio-temporal variations of tropical Asian AGC be-tween 2013 and 2019.Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of L-VOD and PTC were highly spatially correlated with four benchmark AGC maps used for comparison (R > 0.79 and R > 0.75, respectively). By employing L-VOD as the reference data in assessing AGC dynamics, the X-/C-VOD showed advantages in capturing AGC changes for low-medium (20-40 Mg C/ha) carbon density vegetation, respectively, while other vegetation proxies showed limited capabilities. All proxies presented limitations in tracking AGC dynamics at high AGC density (> 60 Mg C/ ha). Tropical Asian AGC stocks estimated using the L-VOD product indicated that tropical Asia accumulated carbon in biomass at a rate of +44+39+53 Tg C/yr between 2013 and 2019. This small sink is dominated by non-forest biomes (65.9%). The non-forest regions in southern India, southwest China, and southern Vietnam and southwest China showed a continuous AGC increase while forests in northern Laos, Malaysia, and central Indonesia experienced continuous decreases between 2013 and 2019 caused by deforestation.

AB The application of high-resolution stereoscopic imagery acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on the extraction of forest heights has grown rapidly in recent years. Most existing studies either required auxiliary terrain data, e.g., Digital Terrain Model (DTM) provided by lidar data, or focused on flat terrains. It is still a great challenge to extract tree heights in mountainous forests only using UAV leaf-on stereoscopic imagery. An al-gorithm referred to as AGAR (i.e., Approximation of Ground using Allometric Relationship) is proposed in this study to estimate individual heights of visible trees on UAV stereoscopic imagery in mountainous natural forests. The central idea of the AGAR algorithm is firstly to approximate the understory terrain elevations (i.e., DTM) based on attributes of tree crowns (e.g., crown area) and the iterative adjustment of allometric equation co-efficients. Then individual tree heights are determined by differencing the elevation of crown tops with that of the approximated ground surface. The proposed algorithm was demonstrated at five sites with different terrain conditions by taking field measurements and ICESat-2 data as references, respectively. Results showed that the AGAR algorithm worked well on the estimation of tree heights at all sites. In contrast, the classical progressive triangulation filter (PTF) algorithm was susceptible to terrains and forest structures. The root mean square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of tree heights estimated by the PTF algorithm were 4.4 m -6.3 m and 32.6% -37.6%, respectively. They were decreased by the AGAR algorithm to 1.7 m -2.5 m and 12.6% -15.2%, respectively. The AGAR algorithm will substantially advance the application of UAV stereoscopic im-agery on the extraction of tree heights in the absence of other available terrain data, and will also open new horizons for application of decimeter or even centimeter spaceborne stereoscopic imagery on forest vertical structures in the future.

AB The atmospheric correction (AC) of satellite ocean color remote sensing, which is affected by the vertical distribution of absorbing aerosols (AA), is prone to large uncertainties in the waters with AA, especially for remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(& lambda;)) retrievals in the blue and ultraviolet bands. In this study, a new AC algorithm called the Ocean Color-XGBoost with radiative transfer (RT) simulation Retrieval Tool (OC-XGBRT), which is based on extensive radiative simulation and machine learning model, was developed to retrieve the Rrs(& lambda;) at the short wavelength bands of visible light in the presence of AA while considering their vertical distributions. The goal of the OC-XGBRT AC algorithm is to improve the quality of ocean color satellite products over inland and coastal waters with AA and heavy aerosol loadings. The images acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite (MODIS-Aqua) over six regions with the cases of AA were utilized to assess the performance of OC-XGBRT. The Rrs(& lambda;) retrieved by OC-XGBRT were validated with in situ measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) and the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage (SeaBASS). The results showed that OC-XGBRT provided more accurate Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) products than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) v7.5 standard near-infrared (NIR) AC algorithms, the POLYnomial-based approach established for the atmospheric correction of MERIS data (PLOYMER), and the Ocean Color-Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART) over coastal and inland waters, with mean absolute percentage deviation (APD) and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than -36.9% and - 5.5 x 10-4 sr-1, respectively. Application results of OC-XGBRT in six typical regions further demonstrated that the quality of retrieved Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) had substantially improved compared with the original satellite products under the condition of AA. Moreover, the implementation of the OC-XGBRT contributes to a significant enhancement in the spatial coverage of utilizable Rrs(& lambda;) values at blue bands. Our proposed OC-XGBRT AC algorithm has the potential to process ocean color satellite data under the condition of AA.

AB Reflectance imagery is used to aid daytime cloud detection in thermal remote sensing. This paper presents new approaches to utilization of reflectance for sea surface temperature (SST) remote sensing for the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). SLSTR is an along-track scanning sensor with a complex instrumental viewing geometry, and no co-registration of the fields-of-view of reflectance and thermal pixels. Reflectance channels have twice the spatial resolution of thermal channels, and observations are placed on compatible "image grids" for the convenience of users of Level-1 data. We highlight limitations of simple methods, based on these image grids, of using reflectance imagery to inform cloud detection at the thermal resolution. We present improvements from averaging the N-nearest reflectance observations directly to the infrared instrument geometry, where N = 10 is chosen in this study when using the A and B stripes together. We show that the standard deviation of the N-nearest reflectance observations is another calculable quantity of use to improve the discrimination of clouds in the infrared image, beneficially reducing the weight placed on coarser-scale thermal spatial variability. The developments are illustrated by case studies in coastal zones over optically bright waters and around strong ocean fronts, and the benefit for SST products is quantified by the impacts on coverage and validation statistics. In a case study over optically bright waters, the clear-sky fraction increases from 46.2% to 93.1%. Coastal zone validation shows a 23.8-31.6% reduction in the false alarm rate and a corresponding 27.133.3% increase in the cloud detection true skill score. Globally the robust standard deviation for clear-sky matches between SLSTR-A and drifting buoys reduces from 0.3 to 0.29 with a 6% reduction in data due to improved screening of scattered cloud.

AB An accurate mapping of land disturbances with regard to their timing and locations is the prerequisite for the success of downstream disturbance characterization. This study introduces and tests a novel approach that integrates a spatial perspective into the dense Landsat time series analysis, called "Object-Based COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance" (OB-COLD). The new algorithm is based on the recognition that the pixels under effects of the same disturbance event often present similar spectral change concurrently in a short time; such pixels experiencing concurrent change could be grouped as an analytic spatial unit, namely "change object". OB-COLD first generates a change-magnitude snapshot every 60 days by applying per-pixel time series analysis to measure spectral change history. Then, an object-based change analysis is applied for each time-stamped snapshot: two levels of change objects are generated through over-segmentation and region merging; the changing area is determined by examining three object-level properties derived at different scales: the average change magnitude, the pre-change cover type, and the object size. Lastly, OB-COLD reconstructs model coefficients for each temporal segment based on the temporal breaks indicated by new snapshot-based change maps. We tested the new algorithm using 3000 randomly selected reference sample plots and eight Landsat ARD tiles across the continental United States. The accuracy assessment suggests that OB-COLD achieved 76.9% producer's accuracy, which is significantly higher than the per-pixel time series algorithm (i.e., COLD) (16.3 percentage increase) while keeping a comparable user's accuracies (58.7% vs. 57.8%). The quantitative and qualitative evaluations both suggest that OB-COLD could significantly reduce omission errors, particularly for stress disturbances. Most commission errors (73%) are attributed to agricultural practices and climate variability. The proposed algorithm is computationally scalable to large-scale spatiotemporal datasets with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources, holding great potential as the base detection algorithm for the next generation of land disturbance products.

AB Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are essential biotic components in desert ecosystems, yet they are vulnerable to climate change, especially changes in precipitation. Unfortunately, the scarcity and unreliable performance of mainstream precipitation products in desert regions has prevented further research on the responses of desert ecosystems to climate change scenarios. By taking advantage of the spectral sensitivity of biocrusts to hydration, this study aims to examine the potential to monitor rainfall events using the spectral response of biocrusts. First, BRDF harmonization enhanced the rainfall-induced spectral response. Then, a detectability analysis was per-formed to clarify how influential factors affect the spectral response. Finally, a random forest (RF) model was developed to derive the temporal dynamic and spatial pattern of detectable rainfall events. The results show that rainfall events induce significant changes in biocrust spectra, especially within some spectral bands (i.e., SWIR, Red, and Blue) and indices (i.e., BSCI and NDVI). A rainfall event is detectable if the precipitation amount is >6 mm and recorded by satellites within 24 h. The RF model performs better (F1 score symbolscript 0.78) than the mainstream precipitation products (F1 score between 0.19 and 0.52) in temporal monitoring. Additionally, the model can delineate the spatial pattern of rainfall events well. These findings imply that this phenomenon has great po-tential for application in rainfall monitoring in desert areas, which could greatly contribute to understanding the mechanisms of desert ecological processes on a large scale.

AB Accurate estimates of carbon, water and energy fluxes between the Earth surface and the atmosphere are crucial for enhancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions. Such estimates can be made by combining remote sensing derived land surface parameters with climate reanalysis data. We analysed to what degree generic (plant functional type (PFT)-independent) satellite-derived vegetation properties and climate reanalysis data can explain land surface fluxes and to what extent the PFT-specific information extends the flux simulations. For this purpose, we used the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer in plant leaves and vegetation canopies with photosynthesis and energy balance in a single model representation of the vegetation. We evaluated the performance of SCOPE in simulating fluxes by comparison to 63 eddy covariance sites representing 10 PFTs. We varied the sources of maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax25) and BallBerrySlope values (default vs literature), the seasonality of V-cmax25 and the meteorological forcing (locally measured and climate reanalysis). The average performance of daily flux in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 2.3 +/- 0.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (R-2 = 0.74 +/- 0.12) for gross primary productivity (GPP), 24 +/- 8 W m(-2) (R-2 = 0.68 +/- 0.16) for latent heat flux (lambda E) and 50 +/- 15 W m(-2) (R(2)0.47 +/- 0.17) for sensible heat flux (H). The inter-site variability of the annual accumulated GPP flux was captured well with seasonally varying PFT-specific V-cmax25 (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 308 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and bias = -68 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The annual accumulated evapotranspiration (ET) was overestimated (R-2 = 0.31, RMSE = 101 mm yr(-1) and bias = 37 mm yr(-1)), mainly in the ecosystems with subtropical Mediterranean climate, for which the soil resistance to evaporation from porous space (r(ss)) had to be constrained from soil moisture content (SMC) or land surface temperature (LST). Overall, the study demonstrates that SCOPE model can simulate ecosystem flux with high accuracy without site-specific calibration of its parameters.

AB Land surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta) are key parameters in multiple research fields. In this study, a global seamless (without missing values) and high-resolution (30 arcsecond spatial res-olution) temperature (for both Ts and Ta) dataset (GSHTD) from 2001 to 2020 was developed. First, a method called the estimation of the temperature difference (ETD) was proposed to reconstruct both clear-and cloudy-sky Ts. A global seamless 8-day and monthly average all-and clear-sky Ts data were then created using the MODIS Ts data and the ETD method. The seamless monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum Ta data were further developed using the seamless Ts data, in situ Ta data and Cubist machine learning algorithm. GSHTD has four main advantages. First, GSHTD includes seven types of temperature data: clear-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, all-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, and mean, maximum and minimum Ta. Second, it has global coverage and high spatial resolution. Third, using the ETD method proposed in this study, GSHTD has no missing values. Fourth, the accuracy of GSHTD is high; the average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ETD in reconstructing the 25 x 25 and 150 x 150 pixel clear-sky daytime (nighttime) Ts data were 0.724 (0.552) and 1.024 (0.895) degrees C, respectively. The MAEs of ETD were on average 23.2% and 23.7% lower than those of Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature reconstruction (RSDAST) and interpolation of the mean anomalies (IMAs). The MAEs of the estimated monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum Ta data were 0.797, 0.994 and 1.056 degrees C, respectively. The developed GSHTD is freely available at Middle Yangtze River Geoscience Date Center (https://cjgeodata.cug.edu.cn/#/pageDetail?id=97), which will be useful in many studies related to climate change, environmental science and ecology, and epidemiology and human health.

AB Offset-tracking is more commonly used in monitoring glacier velocity at Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) than the D-InSAR technique because of its robustness in handling low coherence and unnecessary of phase unwrapping. Large deformation rates of polar glaciers can cause a deformation gradient which exceeds the theoretical limi-tation of phase unwrapping. There is acceptable coherence for Sentinel-1 interferograms with very short tem-poral baselines, however, traditional D-InSAR still fails at the phase unwrapping step. Here, we propose a method to reduce the phase gradient of the D-InSAR interferogram via subtracting the estimated deformation phase to obtain a residual phase. Such rough deformation can be acquired by performing offset-tracking to the current pair of SAR images or can be calculated by any other glacier velocity products, which are usually obtained by the offset-tracking technique. Phase unwrapping is then performed on the residual phase and then the rough deformation phase is added to yield the final deformation fields. Four study sites located in northern Greenland are selected to test our proposed method, which improved the mean coherence of the residual phase by 0.037, 0.032, 0.037, and 0.039 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as compared to traditional D-InSAR interfer-ometry. The modulus of the phase gradient is also reduced, by 0.054, 0.044, 0.056, and 0.064 rad in each season. The coherence improvement is more sensitive to the temporal baseline in summer than other seasons, and our method is less effective. Seven unwrapped phase profiles of the glaciers find that our method performs better in spatial and temporal phase continuity than traditional D-InSAR. The maximum deformation detected during 6 -day baseline increases from-1.4 m by D-InSAR to-3.6 m by the proposed method. Our approach extends the area that can be unwrapped correctly, especially for the downstream zone of glaciers, where there are higher flow rates, in turn, this increases the robustness of the phase unwrapping and the possibility of applying the InSAR method for monitoring fast-moving glaciers in the GrIS.

AB Soil moisture is an important variable in agricultural and hydrological applications. Sentinel-1 (A/B) satellite provides high-resolution (similar to 10 m) synthetic aperture radar data, and its high revisit capability (6 days at the equator) with multi-track data provides great potential for global soil moisture monitoring. In this study, an algorithm was proposed for soil moisture retrieval using the Multi-Temporal Dual-Channel (MTDC) Sentinel-1 data. The MTDC algorithm first conducted an incidence angle normalization method based on time series data to normalize backscattering coefficients from multiple tracks. Subsequently, using the vegetation water content obtained through a vegetation index climatology, soil roughness and soil unfrozen water content could be estimated for the freezing period (unfrozen water content in the soil is assumed to be stable for January and December). The changes in total backscatter between successive observations were expressed as a function of the two-way vegetation transmissivity multiplied by the difference between soil backscatter, which was directly related to the changes in soil moisture. Considering the retrieved soil roughness as a constant for the entire year, and the average unfrozen water content as the initial soil moisture, the changes in and absolute values of soil moisture for each observation can be estimated by minimizing a cost function between the modeled and observed changes in total backscatter. Retrieval results were validated against the soil moisture network in a semi-arid watershed of Shandian River with an unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) of 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3), and a bias of-0.04 cm(3).cm(-3). With the initial soil moisture from in-situ measurements, a higher accuracy was achieved for the MTDC algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.01 cm(3).cm(-3)). Further, comparisons with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced products further verified the efficacy of the proposed algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.03 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.004 cm(3).cm(-3)), and demonstrated the feasibility of operational soil moisture products using the Sentinel-1 radar dataset.

AB Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an important indicator of foliar nitrogen status and photosynthetic capacity. Compared to physical models, the generality of empirical models based on vegetation indices is often questioned when they are used to estimate LCC due to the influence from canopy structure, such as leaf area index (LAI). A recent study developed the LAI-insensitive chlorophyll index (LICI) and established a semi-empirical LICI-based LCC quantification model, which inherits both the robustness of physical models and the simplicity of empirical models. However, it is unclear whether such a simple model is as accurate and generic as physical models. Here, we adopted an innovative approach to disentangle the confounding effects of LAI and LCC on LICI and found that LICI was strongly correlated to LCC but only marginally sensitive to LAI. Moreover, we also found that LICI was sensitive to the soil background and thus proposed a spectral separation of soil and vegetation (3SV) algorithm, which is automatic and does not require prior information of soil background. After implementing the 3SV al-gorithm to remove the contributed reflectance of soil, we then obtained the contributed reflectance of vegetation (CRv). Model simulations showed that the soil background effect on the CRv-derived LICI was largely eliminated and hence this index was viewed to be soil-removed. As a result, the accuracy and generality of the soil-removed LICI-based model for LCC estimation was evaluated using comprehensive datasets from multiple vegetation types, years, sites, and observation platforms and compared to that of a MatrixVI-based physical model and a MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)-based semi-empirical model. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for LCC estimated by the soil-removed LICI-based model was 6.22-6.87 mu g/cm2 for the crop datasets and 10.68 mu g/ cm2 for the multi-ecosystem dataset when the equivalent wet soil fraction was <0.7. Although further efforts are required to mitigate the effects of soil on the LICI-based model over sparse vegetation, this research is highly beneficial for extending its potential applications to the globe and advancing the development of an operational LCC monitoring system in the emerging satellite hyperspectral era.

AB L-band brightness temperature (TB) has been shown to provide the best sensitivity to soil moisture (SM) although C- and X-band based products offer a longer time-series from satellite-based measurements. Currently, global coverage SM is routinely produced from spaceborne measurements using all three frequency bands, but despite continued validation efforts of the products, the relative characteristics and performance of these observations have not been fully established. Therefore, this study focused on the parametrization of SM retrieval algorithms at L-, C- and X-bands using TB observations from the L-band radiometer on NASA's SM Active Passive (SMAP) mission and the C- and X-band channels of JAXA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W satellite. These can be applied in global SM retrieval algorithms using either one of the frequencies or a combination of them. The reference in situ SM data was obtained from 12 core validation sites across various land cover types around the world. The investigation highlighted the known challenges of retrieving SM from C- and X-band data compared to the higher sensitivity of the L-band data. Even with a sitespecific retrieval algorithm parameterization, the mean correlation of the C- and X-band retrievals for the core validation site SM measurement were much lower than that for L-band, being 0.52 (0.54) and 0.45 (0.47) for vertical (horizontal) polarization, respectively, while for the L-band retrieval the corresponding values were 0.81 (0.77). The parameterization exercise showed that matching the C- and X-band TB measurements with an emission model was not difficult; the problem was relating the observations to SM under the influence of large roughness and vegetation effects. As a result, parameter optimization produced values for some sites that were not realistic or did not allow any practical sensitivity to SM at C- and X-band. Considering the L-band observations, the parameter optimization resulted in superior bias performance as compared to the operational SMAP

AB The backscattered power recorded by a spaceborne scatterometer operating at C-band is sensitive to land surface parameters and is operationally used by some global remote sensing services, e.g., to estimate soil moisture. The estimation of forest variables, in particular above-ground biomass (AGB), from scatterometer data instead was seldom explored. Given the availability of multi-decadal sets of scatterometer observations from space, it is of interest to address the contribution of C-band scatterometer data to the quantification of carbon stocks stored in forests even if the spatial resolution of spaceborne scatterometers is very coarse. In this paper, we investigated the prospects of AGB estimation using backscatter observations by the MetOp Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. For this study, ASCAT observations acquired in 2010 were used to be contemporary with AGB datasets selected to benchmark the performance of the estimation. A Water Cloud Model that integrates two allometric equations derived from spaceborne LiDAR data reproduced the relationship between observations of radar backscatter as a function of AGB. Estimates of AGB from individual observations were then combined with a weighted average to reduce uncertainties. Finally, a correction was introduced to compensate for the offset introduced by sloped terrain and surfaces not covered by woody vegetation on the AGB estimate of a pixel. Uncertainties associated with the scatterometer observations, and the modelling framework were propagated to obtain per-pixel values of the standard deviation of an AGB estimate. The proposed method explains much of the variance in AGB estimates when compared to measurements from inventory data (R-2 = 0.72) and generated unbiased estimates globally (bias: -3.3 Mg.ha(-1)). Nonetheless, the discrepancy between estimated and plot-based AGB values tended to increase for decreasing biomass level from 20% to 60% of the reference AGB level. A further assessment related to global stocks indicated that the value estimated from the scatterometer dataset (596 Pg, 95% of which 563 Pg stored in forest land) was in line with two published estimates based on forest inventory data only (571 Pg and 600 Pg, respectively). Despite the coarse spatial resolution, our results indicate that C-band scatterometer observations from space can contribute to the characterization of terrestrial biomass pools. The record of observations starting in the early 1990s may provide an unprecedented way to look at long-term forest dynamics as well as to constrain the strength of carbon-climate cycle feedback simulated by Earth System models.

AB The Glacier Bay area in southeastern Alaska and British Columbia, encompassing Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, has experienced rapid glacier retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-1800s. The impact that rapid deglaciation has had on the slope stability of valley walls and on the sedimentation of fans and deltas adjacent to fjords and inlets is an ongoing research topic. Using 3-year (2018-2020) Sentinel-1 datasets, and an automated time-series persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) processing method, we detected landslides or delta subsidence at 27 sites within a vast 180 x 180 km remote region encompassing Glacier Bay proper. Most of the sites that we identified had not been previously identified. We categorized the hazard source areas that we identified into three general types:1) slow-moving landslides on steep rocky slopes not near (> 2 km away from) present-day glacier termini (e.g., Tidal Inlet landslide), 2) slow -moving landslides directly adjacent to (< 2 km away from), and associated with glacier thinning and retreat, and 3) subsidence of glacial outwash fan deltas. In categories 1 and 2, we observed 22 landslides moving at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 4 cm/yr. In category 3, we detected five fan deltas subsiding at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 6 cm/yr. Within our measurement error, these velocities were consistent during the monitoring period. Because acceleration was not observed, the issuance of warnings of imminent rapid failure is not warranted, however, continued remote monitoring is warranted. Our interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results could be combined with other data sets including field observations, subaerial and submarine landslide inventories, bedrock fabric mapping from newly available light detection and ranging (lidar) data, and geologic maps to produce an inherent susceptibility map for landslides in bedrock and fan deltas. This map could be used to forecast susceptibility for both earthquake and climatically induced landslides.

AB Remote detection and monitoring of the vegetation responses to stress became relevant for sustainable agri-culture. Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have provided tools to increase our un-derstanding of stress-related physiological processes. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly, representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring. Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance, i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance, i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods from simpler parametric ap-proaches towards more advanced physically-based and hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor com-binations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated from single-source sensor do-mains rather than using data in a synergistic way. We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recom-mend combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable respective management decisions.

AB L-band passive microwave remote sensing has evolved over the past decade to estimate soil moisture (SM) and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD). Novel Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) schemes and model parameterizations are proposed to achieve this goal. In this work, we attempt to characterize errors and uncertainties that prop-agate from RTMs and their parameters while retrieving SM and VOD from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. Three RTMs are considered, including a zeroth order model (Tau-omega model) and two first order models (First order RTM and 2-Stream Emission model (2S-EM)). Surface roughness (h; characterizes undulations on soil surface) and single scattering albedo (omega; accounts for the scattering of emissions due to vegetation structure) are the two parameters (of RTMs) considered. SM and VOD are retrieved concurrently using a multi-temporal RTM inversion scheme. Errors and uncertainty contributions are determined using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach. To assess the role of land cover conditions on error and uncertainties in retrievals, ten reference sites are chosen to represent various biomes. Initially, brightness temperatures are simulated by varying RTMs and their parameters to determine their sensitivity. The SM and VOD retrievals are compared with reference datasets, and the performance is found to be acceptable. Error decomposition analysis indicates RTMs and their parameters (h and omega) induce noticeable and significant error in SM and VOD retrievals. Errors contributions due to the above factors are more prominent in VOD retrievals compared to SM. However, the uncertainty contributions indicate minimal influence of RTMs and their parameters on SM retrievals. The omega parameter followed by the choice of RTM have significant contributions to the uncertainty in the VOD retrievals. The h parameter resulted in significant uncertainties in VOD retrievals under sparsely vegetated regions. The results are used to comment on the suitability of each of the three RTMs and the model parameterization design that could alleviate the issue of errors and uncertainties in concurrent retrievals of SM and VOD. These inferences shall contribute towards developing robust multi-parameter retrieval algorithms.

AB NASA's Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO) encourages and promotes new and innovative science technologies to improve how the Earth is observed from space. Through their Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), an uncooled multispectral thermal instrument was fabricated and flight-tested to demonstrate its potential utility to support future spaceborne missions. While uncooled systems offer the attractive advantage of elimi-nating the need for large and expensive cryocoolers, they naturally introduce challenges that must be overcome to achieve the fidelity observed in image data acquired by existing cooled spaceborne instruments. In this work, the Multi-band Uncooled Radiometer Instrument (MURI) system, designed and built by Leonardo DRS, is fabricated using custom microbolometer detector arrays also developed by Leonardo DRS. Potential is-sues associated with thermal imaging using microbolometers from a spaceborne platform are discussed and innovative engineering solutions to overcome these issues are highlighted. Details of three airborne campaigns designed to assess the fidelity of MURI image data, using Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor's (TIRS) radio-metric & geometric requirements as a baseline, are presented. Results of these campaigns show that the as-built MURI system significantly outperforms these requirements, as compared to ground-based reference measure-ments. Sustainable Land Imaging (SLI) requirements indicate that a five-band instrument is desirable to improve future Landsat science while maintaining continuity with previous thermal instruments. Considering its multi-band design, temperature/emissivity separation (TES) is applied to MURI flight data and compared to ground-based spectrometer measurements for several materials. Results of this study indicate that MURI's TES perfor-mance is in-line with existing spaceborne systems. When considered in conjunction with its radiometric fidelity, the MURI uncooled system represents an intriguing option for future space-based missions.

AB Global soil moisture mapping at high spatial and temporal resolution is important for various meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural applications. Recent research shows that the land surface reflection in the forward direction of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals at L-band can convey high-resolution land surface information, including surface soil moisture. However, these signals are often affected by complex land surface characteristics and the bistatic nature of the GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between the signals and surface soil moisture. In this work, a machine learning (ML) approach is used to map quasi-global soil moisture using bistatic reflectance observations acquired from the recently launched Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. Specifically, several land surface parameters are obtained from remote sensing products and integrated with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced soil moisture retrievals to facilitate daily quasi-global CYGNSS soil moisture mapping at 9 km. Based on cross-validation against SMAP data, the ML algorithm is shown to be suitable for retrieving soil moisture from CYGNSS. Median values of unbiased root-mean-square-difference for the quasi-global coverage or regions with vegetation water content less than 5 kg/m(2) are 0.0395 cm3/cm(3 )and 0.0320 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. Likewise, via independent evaluation against more than 100 in-situ sites, the algorithm is shown to have an unbiased root-mean-square-error of 0.0543 cm(3)/cm(3). CYGNSS-based retrievals contain similar spatial variability as SMAP across different seasons. Moreover, through a robust triple collocation technique, the accuracy of CYGNSS soil moisture is relatively high over moderately vegetated regions with correlations ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. Based on these validation results, we argue that derived CYGNSS soil moisture estimates can supplement current global soil moisture databases and provide more frequent retrievals at 9 km.

AB The 17 year record of daily sea surface wind observed from the QuikSCAT and ASCAT satellite scatterometers from 2000 to 2016 is used to study quick shifting wind jet events over the South China Sea (SCS) in summer. The wind jet typically undergoes a counter-clockwise rotation from eastward to northward in about 8 days and then back to eastward in roughly 4 days. Generally, the entire cycle takes between 4 and 21 days. Such events happen 2-6 times every summer and, in total, have occurred 72 times over the last 18 years. Model simulations demonstrate that the wind stress curl associated with quick wind shifts deform the double gyre in the SCS, with a conspicuous weakening of the northern gyre and a northwestward movement of the center of the southern gyre. In addition, a quick shift of the wind jet leads to both negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the SCS that lag about one day because of the surface latent heat flux, and positive SST anomalies around the eastward current because of decreased cold advection.

AB Remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) with high spatial and temporal resolution is frequently required to understand the regional hydrological processes, particularly in agricultural areas with complex planting structures. Most of the existing spatio-temporal fusion models lacked the fusion of ET because they ignored the physiological characteristics of the vegetation moisture condition. Therefore, we propose a classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (CSAFM) for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET in an irrigated agricultural area with a complex planting structure. This model combines the unmixing-based and weight-based fusion approaches to produce ET maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It uses the mainstream weight based fusion algorism-the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM)-in the fusion step. However, in contrast to the existing reflectance-based fusion algorithms, the CSAFM considers the effects of soil moisture and crop category on evapotranspiration rates. It replaces the unmixing window with an irregular hydrological response unit (HRU) containing homogeneous meteorological and irrigation conditions, and then unmixing the mixed pixels using a planting structure map. Moreover, an ET correction method was proposed in CSAFM to restore the spatial heterogeneity. The performance of CSAFM was compared to that of two mainstream fusion models using Landsat-ET and MODIS-ET based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL): the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (FSDAF). The models were validated with ground-based ET monitored by eddy covariance observed ET and Landsat inverted ET. It was found that the CSAFM model (mean MAE: 0.40 mm/day) beat the ESTARFM model (mean MAE: 0.49 mm/day) and the FSDAF (mean MAE: 0.53 mm/day) in accurately fusion ET and reproduce the details of complex surface landscapes. Additionally, CSAFM (RMSE: 0.66-1.10 mm/day) is less sensitive to the update frequency of input data in the crop growing season than ESTARFM (RMSE: 0.79-1.36 mm/day) and FSDAF (RMSE: 0.79-1.17 mm/day), indicating its suitability in areas with limited input dataset. Overall, the proposed CSAFM model can greatly improve the ET fusion accuracy in irrigated agricultural areas.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band (1.4 GHz) provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate global surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (via the vegetation optical depth, VOD), which are essential to monitor the Earth water and carbon cycles. Currently, only two space-borne L-band radiometer missions are operating: the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit since 2009 and 2015, respectively. This study presents a new mono-angle retrieval algorithm (called SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX, hereafter SMAP-IB) of SM and L-band VOD (L-VOD) from the dual-channel SMAP radiometric observations. The retrievals are based on the L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model which is the forward model of SMOS-IC and of the official SMOS retrieval algorithms. The SMAP-IB product aims at providing good performances for both SM and L-VOD while remaining independent of auxiliary data: neither modelled SM data nor optical vegetation indices are used as input in the algorithm. Intercomparison with other SM and L-VOD products (i.e., MT-DCA, SMOS-IC, and the new versions of DCA and SCA-V extracted from SMAP passive Level 3 product) suggested that SMAP-IB performed well for both SM and L-VOD. In particular, SMAP-IB SM retrievals presented the higher scores (R = 0.74) in capturing the temporal trends of in-situ observations from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) during April 2015-March 2019, followed by MT-DCA (R = 0.71). While the lowest ubRMSD value was obtained by the new version of SMAP DCA (0.056 m3/m3), SMAP-IB SM retrievals presented best scores for R, ubRMSD (- 0.058 m3/m3) and bias (0.002 m3/m3) when considering only products independent of optical vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI). L-VOD retrievals from SMAP-IB, MT-DCA, and SMOS-IC were well correlated (spatially) with aboveground biomass and tree height, with spatial R values of -0.88 and - 0.90, respectively. All three L-VOD products exhibited a smooth non-linear density distribution with biomass and a good linear relationship with tree height, especially at high biomass levels, while the L-VOD datasets incorporating optical information in the algorithms (i.e., SCA-V and DCA) showed obvious saturation effects. It is expected that this new algorithm can facilitate the fusion of both SM and L-VOD retrievals from SMOS and SMAP to obtain long-term and continuous L-band earth observation products.

AB Monitoring agricultural systems becomes increasingly important in the context of global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and the rising demand for agricultural products. High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and nondrought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping.

AB Spatially explicit knowledge on grassland extent and management is critical to understand and monitor the impact of grassland use intensity on ecosystem services and biodiversity. While regional studies allow detailed insights into land use and ecosystem service interactions, information on a national scale can aid biodiversity assessments. However, for most European countries this information is not yet widely available. We used an analysis-ready-data cube that contains dense time series of co-registered Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, covering the extent of Germany. We propose an algorithm that detects mowing events in the time series based on residuals from an assumed undisturbed phenology, as an indicator of grassland use intensity. A self-adaptive ruleset enabled to account for regional variations in land surface phenology and non-stationary time series on a pixelbasis. We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions.

AB Comparing the performance of different satellite sensors in global land cover change (LCC) monitoring is necessary to assess their potential and limitations for more accurate and operational LCC estimations. This paper aims to examine and compare the performance in LCC monitoring using three satellite sensors: PROBA-V, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI. We utilized a unique set of global reference data containing four years of records (2015-2018) at 29,263 land cover change/no-change 100 x 100-m sites. The LCC monitoring was conducted using the BFAST(s)-Random Forest (BRF) change detection framework involving 15 global timeseries vegetation indices and three BFAST models. Due to the different spectral characteristics and data availability of the sensors, we designed 30 comparison scenarios to extensively evaluate their performance. The overall results were: 1) for global general LCC monitoring, Landsat 8 OLI slightly outperformed Sentinel-2, and PROBA-V performed the worst. The performance among the three sensors differed consistently despite different data availability and spectral observation regions. Sentinel-2 was more competitive with Landsat 8 when the red-edge 1 band was included; 2) Landsat 8 was more accurate in forest, herbaceous vegetation, and water monitoring. Sentinel-2 performed particularly well in wetland monitoring. In addition, we further observed: 3) missing data in time series decreased the accuracy in all sensors, but had little influence on the relative performance across sensors; 4) combining sensors would not necessarily improve the accuracy because the complementary effects enhanced the accuracy only when there was a large amount of data missing for all sensors; 5) the BRF framework maintained the performance gap among sensors, but obtained a higher and more balanced accuracy overall when compared with using BFAST methods alone, by involving ensemble learning with an embedded sample-balancing strategy; 6) among the random forest variables, the 'magnitude' proved to be the most important contributor, and the NDVI had the most consistently good performance across sensors when compared against other vegetation indices. All sensors using BRF still had some errors in change detection, with a tendency to underestimate the global LCC. A potential reason for this is the complexity of the diverse change/no-change characteristics at the global extent and the fact that smaller, more subtle LCCs might not be well detected. These limitations could be addressed by taking advantage of ensemble learning approaches with a combination of multiple independent region/thematic-adapted LCC monitoring models and using the original Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) in the future.

AB Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) has been used as a novel proxy of photosynthetic activity, which carries information about plant physiological state from the remote sensing observations. It is of great interest and potential to use SIF to detect forest stresses, but the approach requires accurate modeling of the SIF emission within stressed forests. However, the existing radiative transfer approaches of SIF generally ignore the within crown heterogeneity caused by pests. To account for within-canopy scattering with both high accuracy and efficiency, FluorESRT was proposed as a new model for simulating the SIF of forests with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage, which was the synergy of the SIF radiative transfer and the Stochastic Radiative Transfer (SRT) model for forest with vertical distribution of damage. The performance of FluorESRT for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases were well validated not only by the one-dimensional (1D) model SCOPE but also by the three-dimensional (3D) model DART. As an analytically simple approach, FluorESRT can evaluate the sensitivity of canopy SIF and apparent reflectance to the level of pest damage. The impact of structural properties of damaged foliage on canopy fluorescence, as well as the response of hyperspectral signals on the pest damage was analyzed. According to our study, hyperspectral vegetation indices with the consideration of SIF showed higher sensitivity to pest damage in the early stage when the response of broad band vegetation indices was hardly detectable. The results indicated that the potential of FluorESRT to simulate SIF and hyperspectral apparent reflectance should play a critical role in early monitoring of pest damage.

AB Constructing multi-source satellite-derived water quality (WQ) products in inland and nearshore coastal waters from the past, present, and future missions is a long-standing challenge. Despite inherent differences in sensors' spectral capability, spatial sampling, and radiometric performance, research efforts focused on formulating, implementing, and validating universal WQ algorithms continue to evolve. This research extends a recently developed machine-learning (ML) model, i.e., Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Pahlevan et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021), to the inverse problem of simultaneously retrieving WQ indicators, including chlorophyll-a (Chla), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and the absorption by Colored Dissolved Organic Matter at 440 nm (acdom(440)), across a wide array of aquatic ecosystems. We use a database of in situ measurements to train and optimize MDN models developed for the relevant spectral measurements (400-800 nm) of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions, respectively. Our two performance assessment approaches, namely hold-out and leaveone-out, suggest significant, albeit varying degrees of improvements with respect to second-best algorithms, depending on the sensor and WQ indicator (e.g., 68%, 75%, 117% improvements based on the hold-out method for Chla, TSS, and acdom(440), respectively from MSI-like spectra). Using these two assessment methods, we provide theoretical upper and lower bounds on model performance when evaluating similar and/or out-ofsample datasets. To evaluate multi-mission product consistency across broad spatial scales, map products are demonstrated for three near-concurrent OLI, MSI, and OLCI acquisitions. Overall, estimated TSS and acdom(440) from these three missions are consistent within the uncertainty of the model, but Chla maps from MSI and OLCI achieve greater accuracy than those from OLI. By applying two different atmospheric correction processors to OLI and MSI images, we also conduct matchup analyses to quantify the sensitivity of the MDN model and best -practice algorithms to uncertainties in reflectance products. Our model is less or equally sensitive to these un-certainties compared to other algorithms. Recognizing their uncertainties, MDN models can be applied as a global algorithm to enable harmonized retrievals of Chla, TSS, and acdom(440) in various aquatic ecosystems from multi-source satellite imagery. Local and/or regional ML models tuned with an apt data distribution (e.g., a subset of our dataset) should nevertheless be expected to outperform our global model.

AB This paper aims at exploiting the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for the detection of forest disturbances due to fires. The study focuses on the forested part of Angola that was largely affected by fires during summer 2019. The data collected in the area by the NASA Cyclone GNSS (CyGNSS) constellation have been downloaded and processed. As reference data for developing and testing the retrieval algorithms, the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) decadal burned areas maps have been considered. After evaluating the sensitivity of the GNSS-R observables, namely Signal to Noise Ratio and Equivalent Reflectivity, to the forest disturbances, some retrieval algorithms based on different machine learning techniques have been implemented, tested, and compared with a simple approach based on the temporal gradient of the GNSS-R observables. In details, classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) have been implemented for discriminating burned/not burned pixels of the images and regressors based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), RF and Support Vector Regressors (SVR) have been implemented for estimating the fraction of burned areas within a pixel. All these algorithms allowed a satisfactory identification of the burned areas with respect to the reference data, enabling the generation of maps every ten days. These results represent the first observations of forest disturbances due to fires using spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry.

AB Spatiotemporal image fusion is a potential way to resolve the constraint between the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite images and has been developed rapidly in recent years. However, two key challenges related to fusion accuracy remain: a) reducing the uncertainty of image fusion caused by sensor differences and b) addressing strong temporal changes. To solve the above two issues, this paper presents the newly proposed Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF) method. In RASDF, the effects of four kinds of sensor differences on fusion are analyzed systematically. A reliability index is therefore proposed to describe the spatial distribution of the reliability in input data for image fusion. An optimization strategy based on the spatial distribution of the reliability quantified by the index is developed to improve the robustness of the fusion. In addition, an adaptive global unmixing model and an adaptive local unmixing model are constructed and utilized collaboratively to enhance the ability to retrieve strong temporal changes. The performance and robustness of RASDF were compared with six representative fusion methods for both real and simulated datasets covering both homogeneous and heterogeneous sites. Experimental results indicated that RASDF achieves a better performance and provides a more reliable image fusion solution in terms of reducing the impact of sensor differences on image fusion and retrieving strong temporal changes.

AB Quantifying fuel load over large areas is essential to support integrated fire management initiatives in fire-prone regions to preserve carbon stock, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.

AB We present the "QAA-RGB", a semianalytical algorithm that retrieves total absorption, particle backscattering, as well as the diffuse attenuation coefficient and the Secchi disk depth, from eighteen metre and decametre satellite sensors, including present and heritage Landsat's data, Sentinel 2 at 10 m and an array of commercial satellites such as PlanetScope, Pleiades and Worldview. The QAA-RGB is a minimal version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA), and therefore keeps its robustness and general validity across different water types. It ingests remote-sensing reflectance at only three bands, centred on red, green and blue wavelengths. Retrievals of non-water absorption at 555 nm (a(nw)(555)) are satisfactory, with a standard deviation of sigma similar to 50% up to a(nw)(555) < 2 m(-1), based on in situ datasets. Careful calibration results in unbiased retrievals across all sensors. Validation to independent in situ data is also provided. The QAA-RGB has been implemented in the ACOLITE generic processor, and is openly accessible to the community. Consistency of near-coincident observations from different satellite sensors is demonstrated.

TI Importance of the legacy effect for assessing spatiotemporal

   products in the Sierra Nevada

AB Carbon uptake and tree growth are important factors for assessing productivity and long-term carbon storage. Measurements of radial stem growth are mainly performed at the individual tree scale and can be used to infer ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP). However, these measurements are spatially limited, and remote sensing provides a promising tool to track vegetation function and productivity across spatial scales, making it a viable technique for assessing variation in interannual tree growth and carbon storage. In this study we examined the correspondence between in-situ annual tree-ring width across four dominant evergreen species in the Sierra Nevada and a wide range of remotely sensed products linked to carbon uptake including NPP, gross primary productivity (GPP), net photosynthesis (PSN), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), near infrared reflectance of vegetation index (NIRV), and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) from MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) as well as downscaled solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) products, using a 14 year dataset (2000-2014) across 62 forest sites. We show that variation of annual tree-ring width was best captured by the annual sum of MODIS GPP, with a legacy effect (5-month backwards shift). Across all forest sites, MODIS GPP with a 5-month legacy effect showed moderate correspondence with tree-ring width (r = 0.60). Within each individual site, however, the interannual correspondence between MODIS GPP with a legacy effect and tree growth was stronger (median r = 0.70 vs 0.14 without a legacy effect). The importance of legacy effects in explaining tree growth variation within sites indicates that tree growth each year is influenced by carbon uptake during the latter part of the previous growing season. Additional local environmental factors also explained annual variation in tree-ring width, including (in descending order of importance) local tree density, latitude, slope, DBH, elevation and aspect.

AB In addition to providing water for nearly 2 billion people, snow drives resource selection by wildlife and influences the behavior and demography of many species. Because snow cover is highly spatially and temporally variable, mapping its extent using currently available satellite data remains a challenge. At present, there are no sensors acquiring daily data of Earth's entire surface at fine spatial resolutions (< 30 m) in wavelengths required for snow cover retrieval, namely: visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. Fine scale observations at 30 m from Landsat are available at 16-day intervals since 1982 and at 8-day intervals since 1999. However, over this duration, snow can accumulate, ablate, or both, making the Landsat data ineffective for many applications. Conversely, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospherically corrected daily reflectance data, have a coarse spatial resolution of 463 m and thus, are not ideal for snow cover mapping either. This spatial and temporal resolution tradeoff limits the use of these data for a wide range of snow cover applications and indicates a pressing need for data fusion. To address this need, we use a physically-based, spectralmixture-analysis approach for mapping fractional snow cover (fSCA) and a two-stage random forest algorithm to produce daily 30 m fSCA. We test our algorithm in the US Sierra Nevada and find MODIS fSCA is the most important predictor. We cross validate using 170 Landsat scenes and while snow cover varies immensely in time we find little variation in errors between seasons, a small bias of 0.01, and an overall accuracy of 0.97 with slightly higher precision than recall. This technique for accurate, daily, high-resolution snow cover retrievals could be applied more broadly for analyses of regional energy budget, validating snow cover in global and regional models, and for quantifying changes in the availability of biotic resources in ecosystems.

AB Monitoring spatio-temporal changes of aerosols is necessary to better understand atmospheric processes. Here, the vertical distribution of aerosols and how it has changed from 2006 to 2017 is studied using time series data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. Aerosol centroid altitude, a variable representing the aerosol vertical extent, is estimated using the aerosol flags of the Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product of CALIOP. The case study includes four overpasses, with various aerosol types and densities, covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and India regions characterized by frequent dust storms and smoke emissions, respectively, and Europe, a pioneer in establishing air quality policies. The values of aerosol centroid altitude are examined to determine the effects of climate (space) and season (time) on aerosol vertical distribution. For this purpose, 10-year mean values of aerosol centroid altitude were calculated over climate regions extracted from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) climate map as well as over each season, and the resultant values were then statistically analyzed. The results indicate that environmental heat, steam from climate or season, leads to aerosols increasing in altitude. The time series was imported in a version of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, so-called BFAST01, allowing the magnitude of gradual changes along with the time and type of the major abrupt change to be determined. The strongest positive trends in aerosol centroid altitude were recorded in the desert regions. Positive trends were also observed in the midlatitudes steppes and the North Sea. India was another region with a relatively positive trend which could be mainly caused by the increasing anthropogenic activities and smoke emission. The strongest negative trend detected in Europe is a result of strict environmental regulation policies and efforts for air quality improvement. The results show that a small fraction of granules (12 out of 4036) mainly in the northern part of overpass A, over Europe, the mid part of overpasses B and C, over the Middle East, and southern part of overpass D, over India, experienced structural changes. The reversal changes type 8 (50% of the abrupt changes) and interruption type 6 (33%) are the dominant types, mostly occurred around 2014 and 2012, respectively. Changing environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and anthropogenic activities are the main drivers of these changes. The study demonstrates the applicability of BFAST01 and the usability of CALIOP VFM time series data to monitor the vertical structure of the atmosphere.

AB The Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCarb), to be launched in 2023, will be capable of measuring solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and add to the current space-based record which started in 1995. GeoCarb will be unique as it will be the first geostationary satellite capable of sensing SIF over the American continents. Consequently, SIF measurements from GeoCarb can be performed much more flexibly compared to polar-orbiting platforms. With its scan mirror assembly, the instrument can point to any location on the Earth disc. This will allow measurements to be collected at various times of day, and measurement locations can be revisited several times within a day. In expectation of the launch, we conduct an extensive, SIF-focused simulation study and explore the capability and limitations of the instrument and its particular sampling approach. Using cloud information from real measurements, as well as other observation- and model-based data, we produce over four million atmospheric simulations of GeoCarb measurements that the instrument would see throughout a full day. We then apply dedicated SIF retrieval algorithms on the simulated spectra and investigate the results along with cloud-screening performance and emergent retrieval biases and subsequent bias correction. Finally, we make comparisons with currently operating instruments where appropriate and show future science users of GeoCarb SIF what a typical day of measurements will yield.

AB Plant nitrogen (N) use is an essential component of the N cycle in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems, and important processes include plant N uptake and reallocation during the growing season. While the availability of N to deciduous tundra plants in part relies on their internal reallocation of N from leaves to stems and roots during autumn senescence, the species-specific importance of reallocation timing and its community-wide implications on landscape- and regional-scales remains not well known. Here, we quantified leaf N contents and C:N ratios of four widespread shrub species in West Greenland from June through October and compared plot observations to landscape scale based on a new Sentinel-2-derived index. Our Sentinel-2 index captures overall N reallocation trends well across time and space at the plot level (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.001). Using this novel approach is therefore relevant for upscaling of current and future changes in plant C:N dynamics. Using satellite data, we estimate the leaf N mass reallocated during senescence equaled about 0.8 g N m(-2) from leaves to stems and roots. We conclude that (1) in-situ data from the entire growing season is critical to quantify timing and contrasting strategies of N allocation at species level, (2) key species such as Salix glauca are capable of halving their leaf N content during senescence, (3) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite data is a strong candidate for quantifying these plant functional dynamics in space and time. Our study has implications for research on competition among Arctic plants, litter decomposition and consequently carbon accumulation in tundra soils from a climate change perspective. Further, it captures plant functional dynamics during critical parts of the growing season, including autumn senescence which is generally more complex than capturing spring greenup. Lastly, our new index has important implications for remotely mapping temporal and spatial variation in substrate quality for both wild and domesticated herbivores, as it is a first step towards a tool to assess the tundra vegetation and fodder quality for cold region animal husbandry.

DT Article
ID OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTENSIFICATION; VARIABILITY;
   WATER; COEFFICIENT; ECOSYSTEM
AB Long-term changes in the marine ecosystems of the Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are predicted due to anthropogenic climate change. In particular, global ocean acidification is having a profound effect on the coastal waters of the EBUS, affecting the entire trophic chain, net primary production (NPP) and related economic activities such as fisheries. Another predicted change related to human activity is that of upwelling dynamics with expected long-term changes in upwelling winds as proposed by Bakun (1990), Bakun et al. (2015) and Rykaczewski et al. (2015). Although these predicted long-term changes may emerge only later in the 21st century, this has fueled many studies using historical data. Long-term increase in upwelling winds has thus been a much debated topic, showing that there is considerable uncertainty depending on the EBUS considered, the effect of natural climate fluctuations, the choice of wind dataset, the time period considered, and the methodologies and significance tests applied. Therefore, there is an immediate interest in being able to monitor upwelling using verified and self-consistent wind data sets. This work focused on a sensitivity study of the estimated trends in upwelling winds in the California Current Upwelling System (CCUS), for the most recent period 1996-2018, using the two state-of-the-art satellite wind analyses and two atmospheric model re-analyses. Embedded into the strong modulation by natural climate fluctuations on interannual and decadal time scales, we do see an increase in upwelling-favorable winds in the core of the CCUS, with a local increase of more than 25% in seasonal upwelling transport for the period considered. In this central upwelling zone, a good agreement on stronger equatorward winds for the winter and spring seasons is found between the different datasets, although with different significance levels. Conversely, conflicting results are found in the southernmost part of the CCUS between the satellite analyses and the model reanalyses. Systematic, time-dependent differences are found between the wind products, highlighting the need to further investigate the poorly documented temporal stability of these widely used wind long-term climatology products. The observed spatial structuring of the estimated wind trends is consistent with the trend analysis of water chlorophyll-a, partial pressure of CO2, and basity (pH) analysis products. This result is consistent with changes being important for modulating the carbonate system within the CCUS.

AB Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows promise for monitoring the productivity of global agricultural systems. SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to largescale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April-July and April-August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for crosssectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts. The benefits of SIF for crop monitoring should be continually evaluated as the frequency and quality of SIF measurements continue to improve.

AB McArthur's foliage height diversity (FHD) has been the gold standard in the determination of structural complexity of forests characterized by LiDAR vertical height profiles. It is based on Shannon's entropy index, which was originally designed to describe evenness in abundances among qualitative typologies, and thus the calculation of FHD involves subjective layering steps which are essentially unnatural to describe a continuous variable (X) such as height. In this contribution we aim to provide a mathematical framework for determining maximum entropy in 3D remote sensing datasets based on the Gini Coefficient of theoretical continuous distributions, intended to replace FHD as entropy measure in vertical profiles of LiDAR heights (1D, X), with extensions to variables expressing dimensions of higher order (2D or 3D, Z proportional to X2 or X3). Then we apply this framework to Boreal forests in Finland to describe landscape heterogeneity with the intention to improve the modelling of forest aboveground biomass (AGB), hypothesizing that LiDAR models of AGB should essentially be different in areas of differing structural characteristics. We carried out a pre-stratification of LiDAR data collected in 2012 using simple rules applied to the L-skewness (Lskew) and L-coefficient of variation of LiDAR echo heights (Lcv; equivalent to the Gini coefficient, GCH), determining a new threshold at GCH = 0.33 as a consequence of the newly developed mathematical proofs. We observed only moderate improvements in terms of model accuracies: RMSDs reduced from 41.7% to 38.9 or 37.0%. More remarkably, we identified critical differences in the metrics selected at each stratum, which is useful to understand what predictor variables are more important for estimating AGB at each area of a forest. We observed that higher LiDAR height percentiles are more relevant at open canopies and heterogeneous forests, whereas closed canopies in homogeneous forests obtain most accurate predictions from a combination of cover metrics and percentiles around the median. Without stratification, the overall model would neglect explained variability in the structural types of lower occurrence, and predictions from a model influenced by structural types of higher occurrence would be biased at those areas. These results are thus useful in terms of improving our understanding on the relationships underlying LiDAR-AGB models.

AB Data from four discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) acquisitions and three different sensor types across seven experimentally varied loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations were used to test published and novel methodologies in quantifying forest structural attributes within stands, including height to live crown (HTLC; i.e. the lowest vertical canopy extent) of the canopy and the contributions to total plot-level leaf area from understory and overstory canopy vegetation. These ALS data were compared to in situ field measurements to develop ALS-based predictive models of these attributes. The correlation between field- and ALS-modeled HTLC data was strong, with an R-2 of 0.79 (p < 0.001). We assessed the ability of eight lidar light penetration indices to estimate effective leaf area index (eLAI) in the field. The best predictor of total (sum of understory and overstory) eLAI produced an R-2 of 0.88 (p < 0.001). The independent contributions of overstory and understory components could also be accurately predicted by ALS-derived canopy-only eLAI metrics (R-2 = 0.71; p < 0.001) and understory-only metrics (R-2 = 0.49; p < 0.001). Two new indices, calculated as the sum of return intensity for each foliar layer and correcting for transmission losses, were developed specifically for the vertical strata related to the understory (BLunder) or overstory (BLover). The estimates from BLover were equivalent to the best-performing indices for predicting canopy-only eLAI and the corresponding BLunder was superior to other indices for understory eLAI. The broad spatial and temporal extents of the data, as well as the inclusion of pine plantations with differing stand ages, planting densities, understory control, and thinning treatments, suggest the relationships generated from these methods are robust to site and seasonal variability. The results produced from the analysis of multiple acquisitions implies that the methods presented here are transferable across location, time and sensor design, without implementation-specific calibration, at least for structurally similar loblolly pine plantations.

AB In the past two decades, the data volume of remote sensing imagery in the polar regions has increased dramatically. The calving fronts of many Greenland glaciers have been undergoing substantial variations, and a comprehensive front dataset is necessary for better understanding such frontal dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for an automated approach to identifying glaciological features such as calving fronts. In 2019, three deep-learning-based methods were applied to calving front delineation, but were restricted to a specific area or dataset. Here, we develop a more generalized method that can be applied to a major outlet glacier or remote sensing datasets that are not included in the training. We integrate seven remote sensing datasets into a single deep learning network. The core datasets include optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar images (Envisat, ALOS-1 TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) taken over Jakobshavn Isbme, Kangerlussuaq, and Helheim, spanning from 2002 to 2019. We evaluate four neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabv3+ with ResNet, DRN, and MobileNet as the backbones) and three histogram modification strategies (e.g., histogram normalization, linear stretching, and no histogram modification). We find that the combination of histogram normalization and DRN-DeepLabv3+ has the lowest test error, at 86 m. These promising results show that our method has a high generalization ability on various glaciers and data types.

AB Soil moisture deficiency is a major factor in determining crop yields in water-limited agricultural production regions. Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt - Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL - to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean ? phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5-8%. These results demonstrate that remotely sensed ET at high spatiotemporal resolution can convey valuable water stress information for forecasting crop yields across the Corn Belt if interannual phenological variability is considered.

AB This paper describes a quasi-physical method (the Q-method) for determining the sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The Q-method is a coefficient-based technique developed for processing the multiband infrared (IR) data of the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite. We applied the Q-method to the split-window data from the Second generation Global Imager (SGLI) onboard the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite. A comparison of the determined SGLI SSTs and buoy data shows a bias with a robust standard deviation of-0.097 K and 0.28 K in the daytime and-0.18 K and 0.28 K at night, respectively. Meanwhile, high biases of nearly-0.5 K were calculated for SSTs at and around 305 K. A residuals analysis suggests that the high negative bias is caused by insufficient information on the atmospheric correction brought by split-window data. This paper discusses the physical and mathematical background of the Q-method and compares it with another coefficient based physical scheme.

AB The vegetation optical depth (VOD), a vegetation index retrieved from passive or active microwave remote sensing systems, is related to the intensity of microwave extinction effects within the vegetation canopy layer. This index is only marginally impacted by effects from atmosphere, clouds and sun illumination, and thus increasingly used for ecological applications at large scales. Newly released VOD products show different abilities in monitoring vegetation features, depending on the algorithm used and the satellite frequency. VOD is increasingly sensitive to the upper vegetation layer as the frequency increases (from L-, C- to X-band), offering different capacities to monitor seasonal changes of the leafy and/or woody vegetation components, vegetation water status and aboveground biomass. This study evaluated nine recently developed/reprocessed VOD products from the AMSR2, SMOS and SMAP space-borne instruments for monitoring structural vegetation features related to phenology, height and aboveground biomass.
   For monitoring the seasonality of green vegetation (herbaceous and woody foliage), we found that X-VOD products, particularly from the LPDR-retrieval algorithm, outperformed the other VOD products in regions that are not densely vegetated, where they showed higher temporal correlation values with optical vegetation indices (VIs). However, LPDR X-VOD time series failed to detect changes in VOD after rainfall events whereas most other VOD products could do so, and overall daily variations are less pronounced in LPDR X-VOD. Results show that the reprocessed VODCA C- and X-VOD have almost comparable performance and VODCA C-VOD correlates better with VIs than other C-VOD products. Low frequency L-VOD, particularly the new version (V2) of SMOS-IC, show a higher temporal correlation with VIs, similar to C-VOD, in medium-densely vegetated biomes such as savannas (R similar to 0.70) than for other short vegetation types. Because the L-VOD indices are more sensitive to the non-green vegetation components (trunks and branches) than higher frequency products, they are well-correlated with aboveground biomass: (R similar to 0.91) across space between predicted and observed values for both SMOS-IC V2 and SMAP MT-DCA. However, when compared with forest canopy height, results at L-band are not systematically better than C- and X-VOD products. This revealed specific VOD retrieval issues for some ecosystems, e.g., boreal regions. It is expected that these findings can contribute to algorithm refinements, product enhancements and further developing the use of VOD for monitoring above-ground vegetation biomass, vegetation dynamics and phenology.

AB Knowledge of cloud geometrical thickness (H) is of importance for the study of radiative balance and cloud microphysics. However, the retrieval of H remains challenging, especially for passive instruments. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical algorithm for retrieving H of single-layer liquid cloud based on oxygen A-band hyperspectral measurements from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). In this algorithm, a high-order correction is introduced to the approximation formula to accurately calculate oxygen A-band hyperspectral cloud reflectance. The algorithm can retrieve H in real time as it does not require the use of the time-consuming radiative transfer model for radiation calculation during each retrieval. In addition, the algorithm currently requires cloud optical depth, cloud top height, and aerosol properties measured by other instruments as input. In idealized simulations using ten thousand A-band spectra spanning a range of cloud cases, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the retrieval is approximately 2.0 hPa (for low clouds, 1 hPa is about 10 m). We also retrieve H based on millions of real OCO-2 observations and compare the retrieval results with the cloud product from CloudSat/CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations). After abnormal samples are removed, the correlation coefficient is 0.716, the average bias is -15.6 hPa, and the RMSE is 27.4 hPa. The statistical results show that the absolute bias increases systematically with the reference cloud geometrical thickness, which may be caused by the unrealistic vertical homogeneous cloud assumption. The similar phenomenon was also found in comparison with OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX, a joint retrieval product based on OCO-2, CALIPSO, and accurate radiative transfer model. The fast algorithm shows a similar distribution of retrieved cloud bottom pressure and a smaller bias on cloud geometrical thickness retrieval compared to the OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX products.

AB Forested environments are subject to large and high intensity unplanned fire events, owing to, among other factors, the high quantity and complex structure of fuel in these environments. Compiling accurate and spatially comprehensive fuel information is necessary to inform various aspects of land management in forested environments. Remote sensing may offer distinct advantages for this in comparison to traditional site-based approaches. We conducted a literature review of the past 10 years of research in the remote sensing of fire fuel in forested environments, with a focus on emerging methods of fuel estimation, and the fuel attributes estimated. We position our review of remote sensing research in relation to the fuel attributes that influence fire behaviour, as suggested by contemporary physics-based fire behaviour knowledge, and a summary of fuel inputs to widely applied forest fire behaviour models. We find a disconnect between recent remote sensing research and fuel characterisations relevant to contemporary fire behaviour knowledge. Specifically, we find a tendency in remote sensing research towards estimation of forest overstorey fuel attributes, and a relative lack of research that estimates more obscured, though highly relevant, fuel components such as understorey, surface, and bark fuel. We also find a tendency for recent remote sensing research to conceptualise fire fuel by existing fire behaviour models, with particular emphasis on matching pre-existing fuel model classifications. A case is made for remotely sensed forest fuel estimation grounded in current knowledge of fire behaviour processes and the fuel attributes known to influence these processes. Shortcomings in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes are partly due to inherent limitations of current technologies, and we discuss recent and expected advancements in remote sensing research and technology that may drive significant future advancement in forest fuel estimation. Further, we suggest that recognition of interactions between fuel attributes and measurable biophysical forest properties can assist in addressing present limitations in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes. Such process-based methods would be more spatially and temporally applicable, encourage new techniques for estimating fuel attributes using remote sensing data, and may encourage the development of fire behaviour and risk prediction systems that are more suited to remote sensing.

AB Mast seeding in conifers is characterized by the spatially synchronous and temporally variable production of seed cone crops. Large mast seeding events (known as "mast years") can be a visually stunning and ecologically important phenomenon, supporting trophic interactions and survival of seed predators as well as forest regeneration. Documenting patterns in mast seeding is generally labor-intensive, requiring repeated visual cone counts at consistent and widespread locations over long periods to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of cone production. Our goal in this work was to evaluate the correspondence of multispectral vegetation indexes (VIs) from Landsat with ground-based observations of mast seeding in white spruce (Picea glauca) forests of the Kluane region, Yukon, Canada. Given the visual characteristics of mast seeding in white spruce, we tested: 1) whether photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs can identify senescence of spruce cones in late summer and autumn during mast years, and 2) if moisture-oriented VIs can distinguish the significant drying of seed cones from the surrounding spruce canopy vegetation during that senescence and after seeds are released. We hypothesized that the slope of late season decline in VIs in spruce forests would be related to masting (Le., greater decline in VI during mast years). Using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM), we compared more than 100 site-year combinations of mast/non-mast observations to develop VI-based regressions. We found some success identifying mast years with moisture-oriented VIs, while models using the photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs were not supported, given the data. However, we found that models containing multiple VIs from both categories were more successful than any single-VI model, accurately predicting four of sixteen mast events in site observations. We provide compelling evidence that mast-seeding patterns may be detectable using moisture-oriented Landsat observations over large coniferous forest areas. Additional work is warranted to distinguish the signal for mast events from confounding disturbance-related effects and to differentiate variation in VI signals attributable to masting productivity in contrast to effects of climatological variability on reflectance.

AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on 31st January 2015, with the aim of providing global soil moisture maps at 9 km spatial resolution by combining L-band radar and radiometer observations. However, after the SMAP radar became inoperable, NASA decided to utilize the Sentinel 1A/1B C-band SAR data in its place. The new version of baseline brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for SMAP is tested using L-band airborne data to evaluate the cap-abilities of the C-band Sentinel-1A SAR relative to L-band radar data in downscaling the SMAP Tb for achieving high resolution brightness temperature. In this study, the downscaling algorithm used L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) collected from the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx5) in south-eastern Australia to downscale 36 km L-band SMAP radiometer Tb pixels to 3 km and 9 km. The downscaling results were then compared with the published results using Sentinel-1A C-band backscatter, and evaluated against airborne 1 km resolution L-band passive microwave brightness temperature collected from SMAPEx-5. The results show that for vertical polarization the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of downscaled Tb when compared with reference airborne Tb across 4 days at 9 km resolution were 4.9 K for L band and 6.0 K for C-band, and increased to 9.3 K for L-band and 9.6 K for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Moreover, the correlation coefficient (R) of downscaled and reference Tb across the 4 days was 0.92 for L-band and 0.88 for C-band at 9 km, decreasing to 0.75 for L-band and 0.72 for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Accordingly, the RMSE increased and the correlation coefficient decreased when using C-band radar data in place of that at L-band. However, overall there is expected to be only a slight decrease in performance of the downscaling algorithm by using the Sentinel 1A data in place of the SMAP radar.

AB After 1991, major events, such as the collapse of socialism and the transition to market economies, caused land use change across the former USSR and affected forests in particular. However, major land use changes may have occurred already during Soviet rule, but those are largely unknown and difficult to map for large areas because 30-m Landsat data is not available prior to the 1980s. Our goal was to analyze the rates and determinants of forest cover change from 1967 to 2015 along the Latvian-Russian border, and to develop an object-based image analysis approach to compare forest cover based on declassified Corona spy satellite images from 1967 with that derived from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images from 1989/1990 and 2014/2015. We applied Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry to orthorectify and mosaic the scanned Corona images, and extracted forest cover from Corona and Landsat mosaics using object-based image analysis in eCognition and expert classification. In a sensitivity analysis, we tested how the scale parameters for the segmentation affected the accuracy of the change maps. We analyzed forest cover and forest patterns for our full study area of 22,209 km(2), and applied propensity score matching approach to identify three Latvian-Russian pairs of 15 x 15 km cells, which we compared. We attained overall classification accuracies of 92% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for the forest/non-forest change maps of 1967-1989, and 91% (Latvia) and 93% (Russia) for 1989-2015, and our results were robust in regards to the segmentation scale parameter. Sample-based forest cover gain from 1967 to 1989 differed notably between the two countries (18.5% in Latvia and 23.6% in Russia), but was generally much higher prior to 1989 than from 1989 to 2015 (8.7% in Latvia and 9.7% in Russia). Furthermore, we found rapid de-fragmentation of forest cover, where forest core area increased, and proportions of isolated patches and forest corridors decreased, and this was particularly pronounced in Russia. Our findings highlight the need to study Soviet-time land cover and land use change, because rural population declines and major policy decisions such as the collectivization of agricultural production, merging of farmlands and agricultural mechanization led already during Soviet rule to widespread abandonment and afforestation of remote farmlands. After 1991, government subsidies for farming declined rapidly in both countries, but in Latvia, new financial aid from the EU became available after 2001. In contrast, remoteness, lower population density, and less of a legacy of intensive cultivation resulted in higher rates of forest gain in Russia. Including Corona imagery in our object-based image analysis workflow allowed us to examine half a century of forest cover changes, and that resulted in surprising findings, most notably that forest area gains on abandoned farm fields were already widespread during the Soviet era and not just a post-socialist land use change trend as had been previously reported.

AB Spatio-temporal fusion is a technique used to produce images with both fine spatial and temporal resolution. Generally, the principle of existing spatio-temporal fusion methods can be characterized by a unified framework of prediction based on two parts: (i) the known fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images), and (ii) the fine spatial resolution increment predicted from the available coarse spatial resolution increment (i.e., a downscaling process), that is, the difference between the coarse spatial resolution images (e.g., MODIS images) acquired at the known and prediction times. Owing to seasonal changes and land cover changes, there always exist large differences between images acquired at different times, resulting in a large increment and, further, great uncertainty in downscaling. In this paper, a virtual image pair-based spatio-temporal fusion (VIPSTF) approach was proposed to deal with this problem. VIPSTF is based on the concept of a virtual image pair (VIP), which is produced based on the available, known MODIS-Landsat image pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that compared to the known image pairs, the VIP is closer to the data at the prediction time. The VIP can capture more fine spatial resolution information directly from known images and reduce the challenge in downscaling. VIPSTF is a flexible framework suitable for existing spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods, and two versions VIPSTF-SW and VIPSTF-SU are, thus, developed. Experimental results on a heterogeneous site and a site experiencing land cover type changes show that both spatial weighting- and spatial unmixing-based methods can be enhanced by VIPSTF, and the advantage is particularly noticeable when the observed image pairs are temporally far from the prediction time. Moreover, VIPSTF is free of the need for image pair selection and robust to the use of multiple image pairs. VIPSTF is also computationally faster than the original methods when using multiple image pairs. The concept of VIP provides a new insight to enhance spatio-temporal fusion by making fuller use of the observed image pairs and reducing the uncertainty of estimating the fine spatial resolution increment.

AB Mountainous regions are changing rapidly across the world due to both land-use change and climate change. Given the importance of mountainous regions for ecosystem services and endemic biodiversity, monitoring these changes is essential. Satellite data provide a great resource to map land-cover change in mountainous regions, however mapping is especially challenging there because topographic complexity affects reflectance. The socalled 'topographic effect' has been successfully corrected for in case studies of small areas, but a comparison of large-area classifications and land-cover change analyses with and without topographic correction is missing. Here, we performed a long-term land-cover change assessment for a large mountainous region, i.e., the Caucasus Mountains with topographic correction. Our two goals were 1) to examine the effect of topographic correction on land-cover classification for a large mountainous region, and 2) to assess land-cover changes since 1987 across the Caucasus based on the full Landsat archive. Both the complex topography and the history of land-use changes, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, make the Caucasus Mountains an ideal study area to understand topographic effects on large-area land-cover mapping for the last three decades. First, we compared a non-topographically-corrected Landsat classification for 2015 with a classification that was topographically-corrected with an enhanced C-correction for the same year and assessed the accuracy of both. Second, we derived topographically-corrected Landsat classifications for six dates to assess changes in cropland and forest from 1987 to 2015, based on class probabilities and post-classification comparisons. In regard to our first goal, topographic correction improved the overall accuracy of the classification only by 2% (from 79 to 81%), but disagreement rates were as high as 100% in mountainous regions, especially among forest types. In regard to our second goal, we found that cropland loss was the most prevalent change process since 1987. Cropland loss was particularly widespread in Georgia and Armenia until 2000, and in Azerbaijan until 2005. The North Caucasus (the Russian Federation) had more stable cropland over time, most likely due to different land reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the prevalence of flat landscapes and very fertile soils, which make cultivation easier than in the South Caucasus. Rates of forest change throughout the Caucasus Mountains were surprisingly low, with forest loss and forest gain being roughly equal. Forest loss was most likely related to both illegal logging and natural disturbance, whereas forest gain was most likely due to cropland abandonment and less grazing pressure. Our results highlight both the importance and the feasibility of topographic correction for accurate large-area land-cover classifications in steep terrain.

AB The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) small baseline subset (SBAS) technique can be applied to land with varying deformation magnitudes ranging from mm/yr to tens of cm/yr. SBAS defines a network of interferograms that is limited by temporal and spatial baseline thresholds that are often applied arbitrarily, or in apparently subjective ways in the literature. We use simulated SAR data to assess (1) the influence of residual noise and SBAS network configuration on InSAR-derived deformation rates, and (2) how the number of interferograms and data gaps in the time series may further impact the estimated rates. This leads us to an approach for defining a SBAS network based on geodetic reliability theory represented by the redundancy number (r-number). Simulated InSAR datasets are generated with three subsidence signals of linear rates plus sinusoidal annual amplitudes of -2 mm/yr plus 2 mm, -20 mm/yr plus 5 mm and -100 mm/yr plus 10 mm, contaminated by Gaussian residual noise bounded within [-2; +2] mm, [-5; +5] mm and [-10; +10] mm, corresponding to standard deviations of approximately 0.5 mm, 1.5 mm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The influence of data gaps is investigated through simulations with percentages of missing data ranging from 5% to 50% that are selected (1) randomly across the 4-year time series, and (2) for three-month windows to represent the northern winter season where snow cover may cause decorrelation. These simulations show that small deformation rates are most adversely affected by residual noise. In some extreme cases, the recovered trends can be contrary to the signal (i.e., indicating uplift when there is simulated subsidence). We demonstrate through simulations that the r-number can be used to pre-determine the reliability of SBAS network design, indicating the r-values between similar to 0.8 and similar to 0.9 are optimal. r-numbers less than similar to 0.3 can deliver erroneous rates in the presence of noise commensurate with the magnitude of deformation. Finally, the influence of data gaps is not as significant compared to other factors such as a change in the number of interferograms used, although the blocks of "winter" gaps in the SBAS network show a larger effect on the rates than gaps at random intervals across the simulated time series.

AB The impacts of climate change and extreme weather events (e.g. frost-, heat-, drought-, and heavy rainfall events) on the continuous phenological development over the entire seasonal cycle remained poorly understood. Previous studies mainly focused on modeling key phenological transition dates (e.g. discrete timing of spring bud-break and fall senescence) based on aggregated climate variables (e.g. mean temperature, growing-degree days). We developed and evaluated a Bayesian Hierarchical Space-Time model for Land Surface Phenology (BHST-LSP) to synthesize remotely sensed vegetation greenness with climate covariates at a daily temporal scale from 1981 to 2014 across the entire conterminous United States. The BHST-LSP model incorporated both temporal and spatial information and exhibited high predictive power in simulating daily phenological development with an overall out-of-sample R-2 of 0.80 +/- 0.17 and 0.72 +/- 0.20 for spring and fall phenology, respectively. The overall out-of-sample normalized root mean square errors were 9.3% +/- 6.1% and 9.9% +/- 5.2% between the observed and predicted vegetation greenness for spring and fall phenology, respectively. We found that a fast increase of temperature can accelerate the speed of spring green-up while a slow decrease of temperature can lead to a decelerated fall brown-down. Increasing accumulated precipitation can benefit daily phenological development over an entire growing season, while extreme rainfall events can have the opposite effects. More frequent frost events could slow spring leaf expansion and accelerate fall leaf senescence. Impacts of extreme heat events were complex and depended on water availability. Cropland in the Midwest as well as evergreen needleleaf forest along the coastal regions showed relatively strong resistance to drought events compared to other land cover types. The BHST-LSP model can be used to forecast vegetation phenology given future climate projection, thus providing valuable information for adopting climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.

AB Sugarcane is a major crop for sugar and ethanol production and its area has increased substantially in tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades. Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society, economy and the environment. To date, no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the field scale over large regions. In this study, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10-m spatial resolution by analyzing time-series Landsat-7/8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images (LC/ S2/S1) during August 31, 2017 - July 1, 2019 in Guangxi province, China, which accounts for 65% of sugarcane production of China. First, we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018. Second, we delineated the cropping intensity (single, double and triple cropping in a year) for all cropland pixels in 2018. Third, we identified sugarcane fields in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics. The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer, user and overall accuracies of 88%, 96% and 96%, respectively. According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018, there was a total of 8940 km(2) sugarcane in Guangxi, which was similar to 1% higher than the estimate from the Guangxi Agricultural Statistics Report. Finally, we identified green-up dates of those sugarcane fields in 2019, which could be used to support the sugarcane planting and management activities. Our study demonstrates the potential of the pixel- and phenology-based sugarcane mapping tool (both the algorithms and the LC/S2/S1 time series images) in identifying croplands, cropping intensity and sugarcane fields in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, fragmented crop fields and frequent cloudy weather. The resultant annual maps from this study could be used to assist farms and sugarcane mills for sustainable sugarcane production and environment.

AB Synchronous observations with similar illumination-observation and meteorological conditions are critical components of cross-calibration analysis. This study outlines data quality control criteria for obtaining the stable synchronous data needed for developing and evaluating a cross-calibration algorithm. With image data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) and Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI II), we developed a cross-calibration algorithm using 35 image pairs of four ocean gyres, and we evaluated the data using 11 image pairs of the global ocean. We found that our new algorithm provided well-calibrated MERSI II reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were greater than 0.89, and the mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) varied from 1.13% to 8.37% in the visible bands, which was significantly superior to an algorithm developed from a data set constrained by existing data quality controls. When the satellite data were preprocessed with the new cross-calibration algorithm, the MERSI II instrument provided inter-mission remote sensing reflectance for the North Pacific Gyre that was consistent with the VIIRS instrument. Furthermore, we derived consistent estimates of remote sensing reflectance and backscattering coefficients (b(b)) from VIIRS and the cross-calibrated MERSI II reflectance data for four typically turbid coastal waters. The VIIRS bb coastal images had special distribution patterns, such as tongue-shaped plumes and mesoscale eddies, which accurately reappeared in the MERSI II images. The inter-mission MAPD values varied from 16%-24% for the coastal waters. This uncertainty level was much lower than the bb data quantified from the original MERSI II data with no cross-calibration. Our results suggest that our data quality control criteria provide good quality synchronous data for cross-calibration analysis. MERSI II could provide good ocean color products for oceanic communications after cross-calibration, even though the radiance calibration for the original MERSI II reflectance data are imperfect.

AB Urban land use is often characterized based on the presence of built-up land, while the land use intensity of different locations is ignored. This narrow focus is at least partially due to a lack of data on the vertical dimension of urban land. The potential of Earth observation data to fill this gap has already been shown, but this has not yet been applied at large spatial scales. This study aims to map urban 3D building structure, i.e. building footprint, height, and volume, for Europe, the US, and China using random forest models. Our models perform well, as indicated by R-2 values of 0.90 for building footprint, 0.81 for building height, and 0.88 for building volume, for all three case regions combined. In our multidimensional input variables, we find that built-up density derived from the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) is the most important variable for estimating building footprint, while backscatter intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the most important variable for estimating building height. A combination of the two is essential to estimate building volume. Our analysis further highlights the heterogeneity of 3D building structure across space. Specifically, buildings in China tend to be taller on average (10.35 m) compared to Europe (7.37 m) and the US (6.69 m). At the same time, the building volume per capita in China is lowest, with 302.3 m(3) per capita, while Europe and the US show estimates of 404.6 m(3) and 565.4 m(3), respectively. The results of this study (3D building structure data for Europe, the US, and China) are publicly available, and can be used for further analysis of urban environment, spatial planning, and land use projections.

AB Applications of digital agricultural services often require either farmers or their advisers to provide digital records of their field boundaries. Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records, which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images. We formulated this task as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, the model's performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve. Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, our model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the same model generalised well across resolutions (10 m to 30 m), sensors (Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8), space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images acquired across the season is paramount to reducing the temporal variations of accuracy. Our convolutional neural network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of individual crop fields at scale.

AB The past two decades have been prolific in production of global or near-global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from satellite data. The most recent addition to the family of global DEMs is the TanDEM-X DEM with resolution of 0.4?arc sec. DEMs are essential for a wide range of environmental applications, many of which are related to mountains including studies on natural hazards, forestry or glacier mass changes. However, synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for acquisition of TanDEM-X DEM is especially challenging over steep and irregular mountain surfaces due to shadowing and foreshortening effects. In this study, we assessed the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM in European mountains. We compared it with both a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the height error of TanDEM-X DEM expressed as absolute deviation at the 90% quantile is consistent with the 10?m mission specification benchmark. We further concentrated on the absolute height error with respect to environmental characteristics (i.e. forested and non-forested areas, slope, and aspect). The comparison of TanDEM-X DEM with a reference DTM showed a positive vertical offset; however, the mean error differed greatly between forested and non-forested areas. When compared to reference DSM, our results showed a slight underestimation. We observed the highest underestimation in deciduous forests, followed by coniferous forests and non-forested areas. A significant decrease in accuracy was observed with increasing slope, especially for slopes above 10 degrees. In mountains where the imagery was acquired only in one orbit direction (i.e. ascending for Northern hemisphere), the largest TanDEM-X DEM error when compared to DSM was recorded for the west-facing slopes (i.e. slopes facing the sensor); however, the association with terrain orientation diminished in mountains, the imagery of which was acquired from both the ascending and descending orbit. Finally, we evaluated the effect of data acquisition characteristics provided with TanDEM-X DEM as auxiliary data. Our results show that two coverages might not be sufficient in mountain environment. Additional acquisitions, especially those with different acquisition geometry, improved the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM and eliminated areas of inconsistency. We discourage from using the Height Error Map (HEM) to estimate the error magnitude. On the other hand, auxiliary data (COM, COV) provide valuable information that should be always used in pre-analyses to identify possible problematic areas.

AB Efficient water use assessment and irrigation management is critical for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, especially under changing climate conditions. Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies. Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.

AB Optical properties of clouds and heavy aerosol retrieved from satellite measurements are the most important elements for calculating surface solar radiation (SSR). The Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) satellite measurements receive high spatial, temporal and spectral signals, which provides an opportunity to estimate cloud, aerosol and SSR accurately.
   In this study, we developed the AHI official cloud property product (version 1.0) for JAXA P-Tree system. A look-up table (LUT) method was used to calculate high-temporal (10 min) and high-spatial (5 km) SSR from AHI cloud properties. First, the LUT of the SSR estimation was optimized through a radiative transfer model to account for solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), aerosol optical thickness and surface albedo. Following this, COT and CER were retrieved from the AHI data, with ice cloud parameters being retrieved from an extended Voronoi ice crystal scattering database and water cloud parameters being retrieved from the MieLorenz scattering model. The retrieved COT and CER for water clouds were compared well with MODIS collection 6 cloud property products, with correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. The COT of ice cloud also shows good consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. Finally, the SSR was calculated based on the SSR LUT and the retrieved cloud optical parameters. The estimated SSR was validated at 122 radiation stations from several observing networks covering the disk region of Himawari-8. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) at CMA (China Meteorological Administration) stations was 101.86 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 31.42 Wm(-2) for daily SSR; RMSE at non-CMA stations was 119.07 Wm(-2) for instantaneous SSR, 81.10 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 26.58 Wm(-2) for daily SSR. Compared with the SSR estimated from conventional geostationary satellites, the accuracy of the SSR obtained in this study was significantly improved.

AB Reliable satellite monitoring of agriculture is often difficult because surface variations occur rapidly compared to the cloud-free satellite observation frequency. Harmonic time series models, i.e., superimposed sequences of sines and cosines, have an established provenance for fitting satellite vegetation index time series to coarse resolution satellite data, but their application to medium resolution Landsat data for crop monitoring has been limited. Non-linear harmonic models have been shown to perform well over agricultural sites using single-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series, but have not been explored with Landsat data. The 2017 availability of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over the United States provides the opportunity to investigate the utility of temporally rich Landsat data for 30m pixel-level crop monitoring. In this paper, the capability of 5- and 7-parameter linear harmonic models and a 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model applied to a year of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD is investigated. The analysis is undertaken over six sites, each defined by a 5000x5000 30m pixel ARD tile, that together include the major conterminous United States (CONUS) crops identified by inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The model fits are evaluated as the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the fitted and the observed Landsat data. Considering locations with at least 21 annual Landsat observations, the 7-parameter linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.052 to 0.072) and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.054 to 0.074) are shown to be able to fit annual Landsat NDVI time series for most CONUS crops, whereas the 5-parameter linear harmonic model cannot (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.072 to 0.099). If there are between 15 and 20 annual Landsat observations, the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model is recommended for fitting annual NDVI crop time series, and if there are >= 21 observations, then either the 5-parameter non-linear or the 7-parameter linear model can be used. The 7-parameter model had marginally smaller mean NDVI RMSD values but larger standard deviations than the 5-parameter non-linear model, likely due to the relative robustness of the non-linear model to over-fitting and oscillations. None of the models could reliably fit crops with multiple stages, such as alfalfa, that are insufficiently sampled using combined Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ time series. Given the utility of the growing season peak NDVI for crop yield applications, the date and magnitude of the model fitted peak NDVI are compared to quantify model reporting differences. The differences between the 7-parameter linear and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic models are not large. For each ARD tile, the mean absolute differences in the estimated peak NDVI days varied from < 2 days in the northern ARD tiles, which had short growing seasons and similar crops, to less than a week for the other tiles except for nearly 10 days for the California tile that had longer growing seasons and more diverse crops including crops with multiple stages. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research.

TI Evaluation of ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3.0, ALOS AW3D30 and TanDEM-X DEMs for

AB We present an analysis for Peru of the vertical accuracy and derived geomorphological parameters of three, freely available Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with 30-m grid sizes and one commercially available 12-m DEM: ASTER GDEM2, SRTMv3.0 (hereafter called SRTM3), ALOS World 3D (AW3D30) and 12-m TanDEM-X. Their elevation values were compared against values measured with a dual-frequency Trimble 5800 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver with two antennas in static relative positioning. A total of 139 ground control points (GCPs) with elevations of up to 4334 m above sea level (asl). were obtained from four topographically contrasting regions along the flat, arid coast, the semi-dry Andes and the Amazon rainforest. The combined results of the four areas showed that the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.907 m, SRTM3 5.113 m and AW3D30 6.246 m. For the two areas where TanDEM-X was investigated, a RMSE of 1.666 m was obtained. When considering each area individually, of the three 30-m DEMs, SRTM3 performed best in all areas, while ASTER GDEM2 was always performing worst. The standard deviation (SD) of the residuals of ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 varied much more between the four study areas than the SD of SRTM3 and TanDEM-X. It was possible to establish linear correlations with R-2 > 0.95 between the GNSS-measured and DEM-derived elevation values for all areas and all DEMs, which can be used to correct ASTER GDEM2 and AW3D30 for Peru. No relationship was found between absolute elevation and residuals. Slope angle of > 15 degrees, however, correlated to much higher residuals for SRTM3 and AW3D30, whereas a constant increase in residual correlated to a constant increase in slope angle for TanDEM-X. In general, the highest residuals corresponded to the highest slope classes. A comparison of absolute elevation values and slope angles of selected areas between ASTER GDEM2 and SRTM3, as well as between AW3D30 and SRTM3, showed in all cases more deviation from true values in areas with steeper slopes. This effect seems independent of vegetation. The presence of buildings however, severely affected performance of ASTER GDEM2. For some areas, AW3D30 suffered from mismatch between adjacent scenes and horizontal and oblique stripping. An analysis of drainage networks showed that all three 30-m DEMs were capable of producing a similar number of Strahler orders, total number of channels, minimum and maximum channel length and accumulative channel length. All DEMs produced accurate networks in the upper reaches of the catchments, but suffered in flat areas such as wide fluvial valleys and sink-filled areas. ASTER GDEM2 in particular produced parallel river channels and unnatural short cuts. Our results agreed well with those of other studies elsewhere around the world and showed that i) the vertical error is much less than those officially reported for all DEMs; ii) slope is the most determinant factor in DEM accuracy. We conclude that SRTM3 delivers the most stable performance in almost all tests and is therefore the DEM of choice for landscape analysis in Peru. TanDEM-X 12 m performed very well in our elevation accuracy test and could become a worthy successor to SRTM3.

AB The scarcity of water and the growing global food demand has fevered the debate on how to increase agricultural production without further depleting water resources. Crop water productivity (CWP) is a performance indicator to monitor and evaluate water use efficiency in agriculture. Often in remote sensing datasets of CWP and its components, i.e. crop yield or above ground biomass production (AGBP) and evapotranspiration (ETa), the end-users and developers are different actors. The accuracy of the datasets should therefore be clear to both users and developers. We assess the accuracy of remotely sensed CWP against the accuracy of estimated in-situ CWP. First, the accuracy of CWP based on in-situ methods, which are assumed to be the user's benchmark for CWP accuracy, is reviewed. Then, the accuracy of current remote sensing products is described to determine if the accuracy benchmark, as set by in-situ methods, can be met with current algorithms. The percentage error of CWP from in-situ methods ranges from 7% to 67%, depending on method and scale. The error of CWP from remote sensing ranges from 7% to 22%, based on the highest reported performing remote sensing products. However, when considering the entire breadth of reported crop yield and ETa, accuracy, the achievable errors propagate to CWP ranges of 74% to 108%. Although the remote sensing CWP appears comparable to the accuracy of in-situ methods in many cases, users should determine whether it is suitable for their specific application of CWP.

AB In this work, we analysed the satellite-based responses of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the waters of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Cuba to hurricanes that crossed the EEZ between 1998 and 2016 as well as the environmental drivers governing the post-storm responses. We considered two spatial scales to capture the spatially heterogeneous nature of the effects of hurricanes. A first more fine-grained one where we considered 120 km radius disks centered at every consecutive hurricane position within the EEZ (scale 1) and a second more coarse grained one enclosing the entire EEZ (scale 2). We conclude that the hurricanes induced a weak cooling since 75 and 85% of the SST anomalies at scale 1 and 2, respectively, were smaller than -1 degrees C. The sea surface cooling was mainly caused by wind-driven processes. The maximum chl-a responses were recorded in the first and second post-storm weeks, with 60% ranging between -0.01 and 0.04 mg m(-3) at scale 1, and between -0.07 and 0.02 mg m(-3) at scale 2. During those post-storm weeks SST and chl-a anomalies were 18 and 44% higher at scale 1 than at scale 2, respectively. We argue that the transport of chl-a from the deep chlorophyll maximum and/or the rich coastal waters are the dominant mechanisms determining the post-storm chl-a response in the EEZ. We also found that the magnitude of the Island Mass Effect (i.e., increase of chl-a concentration in waters surrounding islands) after the passage of the hurricanes was 89% higher in the EEZ than before its passage.

AB Improving flood modeling accuracy is crucial for real-time flood monitoring and early warning systems. Knowing the sources, patterns and driving factors of model uncertainty aids the development of more accurate flood predictions. This study investigates the consistency of two global flood inundation products, i.e., the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite based fractional water (Fw) cover and the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS) modeled flood inundation. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) as the indicator of the SMAP-GFMS model consistency, this research documents the spatial and temporal patterns of the correlations between the two flood products, and investigates factors affecting these relationships, including climate, land cover, hydrology and terrain distributions. Results reveal that globally, 64% locations have moderate to strong SMAP-GFMS correlation (r >= 0.4). Locations that are dry and have low biomass and high seasonal flood variability tend to have high correlation; for example, 47% locations with r >= 0.4 occur in tropical and arid climate zones, and 43% locations with r >= 0.4 are observed in Barren, Evergreen Broadleaf Forest, Grasslands, Open Shrubland and Savannahs. Also, larger rivers have higher correlation, and in each Strahler stream order there are 60% to 65% locations having r >= 0.4. Larger watersheds show higher SMAP-GFMS consistency in particular watersheds between 1000 and 40,000 km(2). Regions with greater urban infrastructure tend to have lower correlation, while locations with lower elevations and relatively flat topography have higher SMAP-GFMS consistency. This study indicates that GFMS and SMAP provide complementary information on surface water storage variations influencing precipitation driven runoff and flooding, which may enable enhanced global flood predictions.

AB Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.

AB The recent development of imaging geodesy, an advanced technique with a high spatial resolution and large-scale coverage, has enabled researchers to obtain multiple high-quality surface displacement estimates at low labor-cost, thereby improving the capability to monitor and manage geological disasters. The different sources (e.g., radar, optical and LiDAR sensors) and analysis approaches (e.g., differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar, DInSAR; multiple-aperture InSAR; pixel offset tracking; and iterative closest point, ICP) in imaging geodesy used to derive displacement estimates have unique benefits and drawbacks. However, the inherent differences among these data sources and methods in the construction of three-dimensional (3D) deformation maps, particularly in the near field, remain poorly understood and require further discussion. In this study, we acquired three pairs of ALOS-2 stripmap mode images, two pairs of Sentinel-1 TOPS mode images and pre- and post-event LiDAR data for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake to explore the 3D near-field displacements using various imaging geodesy techniques with different types of image information, i.e., SAR phase data, SAR amplitude data and LiDAR point cloud data. Our results show that each image type is independently capable of producing a high-quality 3D deformation map for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake with an on-fault accuracy of <43 cm determined from field work measurement, and an off-fault accuracy of <14 cm determined from GNSS observations. The major contributors to the uncertainty in the 3D deformation estimates from the SAR phase, SAR amplitude, and LiDAR data methods are the effective Doppler bandwidth, pixel resolution and topographic roughness, respectively. In the near-field deformation region, more secondary fault ruptures were revealed by SAR amplitude and LiDAR information than by the SAR phase information, thereby overcoming the sensitivity of the SAR phase signal to incoherence. Finally, an integrated complete 3D map was generated to constrain the coseismic rupture behavior of the Kumamoto earthquake sequence associated with the Futagawa and Hinagu faults. Our slip model suggests the main slip rupture a length of 32 km and terminated near the rim of the Aso caldera; additionally, the slip pattern delineated by three asperities that was dominated by right-lateral strike-slip with a minor normal slip component at a depth of 7 km. Furthermore, the main rupture triggered two secondary faults with right-lateral strike-slip and normal slip. Our source model yields a geodetic moment of 5.77 X 10(19) N.m, which corresponds to Mw 7.11.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll a Fluorescence (SIF), which is distributed over a relatively broad (similar to 200 nm) spectral range, is a signal intricately connected to the efficiency of photosynthesis and is now observable from space. Variants of the Fraunhofer Line Depth/Discriminator (FLD) method are used as the basis of retrieval algorithms for estimating SIF from space. Although typically unobserved directly, recent advances in FLD-based algorithms now facilitate the prediction (by model inversion) of the canopy emitted fluorescence spectrum from the discrete-feature FLD retrievals.
   Here we present first canopy scale measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence spectra emitted from Scots pine at two times of year, and also from a lingonberry dominated understory. We used a high power mul-tispectral Light Emitting Diode (LED) array to illuminate the respective canopies at night and measured under standardised conditions using a field spectrometer mounted in the nadir position above the canopy. We refer to the technique, which facilitates the in situ upscaling of a commonly measured leaf scale quantity to the canopy, as nocturnal LED-Induced chlorophyll a Fluorescence (LEDIF).
   The shape of the LEDIF spectra was dependant on the colour of the excitation light and also on the dominant species. Because we measured pine at two different times of year we were also able to show an increase in the canopy scale apparent quantum yield of fluorescence which was consistent with leaf-level increase in fluorescence yield recorded with a monitoring PAM fluorometer.
   The automation of the LEDIF technique could be used to estimate seasonal changes in canopy fluorescence spectra and yield from fixed or mobile platforms and provide a window into functional traits across species and architectures. LEDIF could also be used to evaluate FLD and inversion-based retrievals of canopy spectra, as well as different irradiance normalisation schemes typically applied to SIF data to account for the dependence of SIF on ambient light conditions.

AB The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most commonly used vegetation indices for monitoring ecosystem dynamics and modeling biosphere processes. However, global NDVI products are usually provided with relatively coarse spatial resolutions that lack important spatial details. Producing NDVI time-series data with high spatiotemporal resolution is indispensable for monitoring land surfaces and ecosystem changes, especially in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas. The Improved Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (IFSDAF) method was developed in this study to fill this need. In accord with the distinctive characteristics of NDVIs with large data variance and high spatial autocorrelation compared with raw reflectance bands, the IFSDAF method first produces a time-dependent increment with linear unmixing and a space-dependent increment via thin plate spline interpolation. It then makes a final prediction by optimal integration of these two increments with the constrained least squares method. Moreover, the IFSDAF was developed with the capacity to use all available finer-scaled images, including those partly contaminated by clouds. NDVI images with coarse spatial resolution (MODIS) and fine spatial resolution (Landsat and Sentinel) in areas with great spatial heterogeneity and significant land cover changes were used to test the performance of the IFSDAF method. The root mean square error and relative root mean square error of predicted relative to observed results were 0.0884 and 22.12%, respectively, in heterogeneous areas, and 0.0546 and 25.77%, respectively, in areas of land-cover change. These promising results demonstrated the strength and robustness of the IFSDAF method in providing reliable NDVI datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution to support research on land surface processes. The efficiency of the proposed IFSDAF method can be greatly improved by using only the space-dependent increment. This simplification will make IFSDAF a feasible method for monitoring global vegetation.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a reliable source of accurate information for forest stand inventory attributes including height, cover, basal area, and volume. The commonly applied area-based approach (ABA) allows the derivation of wall-to-wall geospatial coverages representing each of the modeled attributes at a grid-cell level, with spatial resolutions typically between 20 and 30 m. The ABA predictive models are developed using stratified inventory data from field plots, the requirement for which can increase the overall cost of the ALS-based inventory. Parsimonious use of ground plots is a key means to control variable costs in the operational implementation of the ABA. In this paper, we demonstrate how the prediction accuracy of Lorey's height (HL, m), quadratic mean diameter (QMD, cm), and gross volume (V, m(3)) vary when existing ABA models are transferred to different areas or are applied to point cloud data with different characteristics than those on which the original model was developed. Specifically, we consider three scenarios of model transferability: (i) same point cloud characteristics, different areas; (ii) different point cloud characteristics, same areas; and (iii) different point cloud characteristics, different areas. We generated area-based models using three modeling approaches: linear regression (OLS), random forests (RF), and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) imputation. Results indicated that the prediction accuracy of area-based models varied by attribute and by modeling approach. We found that when the models were transferred their prediction accuracy decreased, with an average increase in relative bias up to 22.04%, and increase in relative RMSE up to 29.31%. Prediction accuracies for HL were higher than those of QMD or V when models were transferred, and had the lowest average increase in relative bias and relative RMSE of < 5% in the majority of cases. Likewise OLS models for HL had greater prediction accuracies when models were transferred compared to RF and kNN models, especially when the point cloud characteristics were similar. Conversely, we found that for QMD and V, RF models were found to be the most transferable in cases when models were applied to different areas with similar and different point cloud characteristics. While there is potential for cost savings by transferring models and reducing data acquisition costs, our results show the degree of transferability depends more on the attribute being modelled or the modeling approach applied, and less on the characteristics of the point cloud data.

AB An absorption-based approach was used to determine surface particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations in both inland and coastal waters. The improved performance of this approach was based on the specification of local POC absorption characteristics based on dominant POC sources; phytoplankton or detritus based. This specification was made using a new POC-Index (PI), developed and tested across a range of POC (300-10,000 mg/m(3)) conditions in temporally and spatially heterogeneous inland and coastal waterbodies. The POC model was based on remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) in four wavebands: R-rs(751), R-rs(488) and R-rs(R/G), where R is the red band [R-rs(672)] for detritus dominated waters and G is the green band [R-rs(555)] in the phytoplankton dominated waters. The model provided a high R-2 (0.74) and relatively low r(RMSE) (42.0%, N = 136, p < 0.01). Validation with independent datasets from Chaohu Lake and the Yangtze River Estuary produced a larger positive bias (R-2 = 0.59, r(RMSE) = 83%, delta = 634 mg/m(3), S = 0.63, I = 1439 mg/m(3)); nevertheless, the bias was reduced when tuned with local data (R-2 = 0.80, r(RMSE) = 45%, delta = 72 mg/m(3), S = 0.81, I = 327 mg/m(3)). Additionally, HydroLight simulations presented an independent correlation between PI and CDOM conditions and reasonable POC estimates from the new approach developed in this study. The approach was tested using data from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in a range of optically complex conditions to quantify carbon dynamics. We indicate the advantages and challenges of using this approach in ecosystems where multiple organic carbon sources are present.

AB Leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)), which is responsible for light harvesting for photosynthesis, is an important parameter for carbon cycle modeling and agriculture monitoring at regional and global scales. Since the spectral signals of chlorophyll content and leaf area are highly coupled, it is required to remove the effect of the LAI on the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) from satellite data. In this paper, an approach for the retrieval of Chl(Leaf) was proposed. A 2-dimensional matrix-based relationship between Chl(Leaf) and two VIs was established using simulated datasets from the PROSAIL model. The matrix was formed by dividing the two-VI space into m x n cells and assigning the Chl(Leaf) value to each cell. Based on the matrix, the Chl(Leaf) can be retrieved using the two VIs from observations. Three matrices of different VI pairs for retrieving Chl(Leaf) were tested using the PROSAIL simulated data. The results show that the matrix formed with two new VIs, RERI[705] and RERI[783], works best. The results from the matrices of two VIs are better than those from individual VIs as well as from VI ratios. The matrices were successfully used to retrieve the Chl(Leaf) of winter wheat from Sentinel-2 images. The Chl(Leaf) estimations using the RERI[705]-RERI[783] matrix achieves an accuracy of R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 10.4 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE = 11.9%. The estimations using the TCARI-OSAVI and the R-740/R-705-R-865/R-665 matrices are also in good agreement with the measured Chl(Leaf) (R-2 > 0.48, RMSE < 13.1 mu g/cm(2), and NRMSE < 15.1%). The matrix-based VI combination approach has the potential for the operational retrieval of Chl(Leaf) from multispectral satellite data.

AB We compared the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for forest variable prediction in the boreal forest of Southern Finland. We defined twelve modelling setups to train multivariable prediction models with either multilayer perceptron (MLP) or regression tree models with the brute force forward selection method. The reference data consisted of 739 circular field plots that had been collected by the Finnish Forest Centre concurrently with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions. The input data were divided into training, validation and test sets of equal sizes for 100 iterations in each modelling setup. The predicted forest variables were stem volume (V), stem diameter (D), tree height (H) and basal area (G), and their species-wise components for pine (Pine), spruce (Spr) and broadleaved (BL) trees. We recorded the performance figures and the best predictive image bands for each modelling setup.
   The best average performance over the 100 modelling iterations was obtained using all Sentinel-2 bands. The plot-level relative root mean square errors (RMSE%) of the field observed mean were 38.4% for average stem diameter, 42.5% for stem basal area/ha, 30.4% for average tree height, and 59.3% for growing stock volume/ha with variables including all tree species. The corresponding best figures with all Landsat 8 bands were RMSE % = 44.6%, 50.2%, 36.6% and 72.2%, respectively. The Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 also when using near-equivalent image bands and Sentinel-2 data down-sampled to 30 m pixel resolution. The relative systematic error (bias%) did not show any significant differences between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data: the average of the absolute value of bias% was 0.8% for Sentinel-2 and 1.2% for Landsat 8. The best predictive Sentinel-2 image band was the red-edge 1 (B05_RE1), when variable totals including all species were estimated. The short-wave infrared bands (B11_SWIR1 & B12_SWIR2) and the visible green band (B03_Green) were also among the best predictors. The median number of predictors in the best performing models was 4-6 for the Sentinel-2 and 4-5 for the Landsat 8 models, respectively.
   We conclude that Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data can be recommended as the principal Earth observation data source in forest resources assessment.

AB Remotely sensed data can help to identify both suitable habitat for individual species, and environmental conditions that foster species richness, which is important when predicting how biodiversity will respond to global change. The question is how to summarize remotely sensed data so that they are most relevant for biodiversity analyses, and the Dynamic Habitat Indices are three metrics designed for this. Our goals here were to a) derive, for the first time, the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) globally, and b) use these to evaluate three hypotheses (available energy, environmental stress, and environmental stability) that attempt to explain global variation in species richness of amphibians, birds, and mammals. The three DHIs summarize three key measures of vegetative productivity: a) annual cumulative productivity, which we used to evaluate the available energy hypothesis that more energy is associate with higher species richness; b) minimum productivity throughout the year, which we used to evaluate the environmental stress hypothesis that higher minima cause higher species richness, and c) seasonality, expressed as the annual coefficient of variation in productivity, which we used to evaluate the environmental stability hypothesis that less intra-annual variability causes higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs globally at 1-km resolution from MODIS vegetation products (NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and GPP), based on the median of the good observations of all years from the entire MODIS record for each of the 23 or 46 possible dates (8- vs. 16-day composites) during the year, and calculated species richness for three taxa (amphibians, birds, and mammals) at 110-km resolution from species range maps from the IUCN Red List. We found marked global patterns of the DHIs, and strong support for all three hypotheses. The three DHIs for a given vegetation product were well correlated (Spearman rank correlations ranging from -0.6 (cumulative vs. variation DHIs) to -0.93 (variation vs. minimum DHI)). Similarly, DHI components derived from different MODIS vegetation products were well correlated (0.8-0.9), and correlations of the DHIs with temperature and precipitation were moderate and strong respectively. All three DHIs were well correlated with species richness, showing in ranked order positive correlations for cumulative DHI based on GPP (Spearman rank correlations of 0.75, 0.63, and 0.67 for amphibians, resident birds, and mammals respectively) and minimum DHI (0.73, 0.83, and 0.62), and negative for variation DHI (-0.69, -0.83, and -0.59). Multiple linear models of all three DHIs explained 67%, 65%, and 61% of the variability in species richness of amphibians, resident birds, and mammals, respectively. The DHIs, which are closely related to well-established ecological hypotheses of biodiversity, can predict species richness well, and are promising for application in biodiversity science and conservation.

AB Cloud detection and screening constitute critically important first steps required to derive many satellite data products. Traditional threshold-based cloud mask algorithms require a complicated design process and fine tuning for each sensor, and they have difficulties over areas partially covered with snow/ice. Exploiting advances in machine learning techniques and radiative transfer modeling of coupled environmental systems, we have developed a new, threshold-free cloud mask algorithm based on a neural network classifier driven by extensive radiative transfer simulations. Statistical validation results obtained by using collocated CALIOP and MODIS data show that its performance is consistent over different ecosystems and significantly better than the MODIS Cloud Mask (MOD35 C6) during the winter seasons over snow-covered areas in the mid-latitudes. Simulations using a reduced number of satellite channels also show satisfactory results, indicating its flexibility to be configured for different sensors. Compared to threshold-based methods and previous machine -learning approaches, this new cloud mask (i) does not rely on thresholds, (ii) needs fewer satellite channels, (iii) has superior performance during winter seasons in mid-latitude areas, and (iv) can easily be applied to different sensors.

AB Remote mapping of bathymetry can play a key role in gaining spatial and temporal insight into fluvial processes, ranging from hydraulics and morphodynamics to habitat conditions. This research introduces Multiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA), which combines previously developed depth predictors along with additional predictors derived from the intensity component of the HSI color space transformation. MODPA empirically selects a set of optimal predictors among all candidates utilizing partial least squares (PIS), stepwise, or principal component (PC) regression models. The primary focus of this study was on shallow (< 1 m deep) and clearly flowing streams where substrate variability could have a pronounced effect on depth retrieval. Spectroscopic experiments were performed under controlled conditions in a hydraulic laboratory to examine the robustness of bathymetry models with respect to changes in bottom type. Further, simulations from radiative transfer modeling were used to extend the analysis by isolating the effect of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and by investigating the performance of bathymetry models in optically complex and deeper streams. The bathymetry of the Sarca River, a shallow river in the Italian Alps, was mapped using a WorldView-2 (WV-2) image, for which we evaluated the atmospheric compensation (AComp) product. Results indicated the greater robustness of multiple-predictor models particularly MODPA rather than single-predictor models, such as Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA), with respect to heterogeneity of bottom types, IOPs, and atmospheric effects. The HSI intensity component enhanced the accuracy of depth retrieval, particularly in optically-complex waters and also for low spectral resolution imagery (e.g., GeoEye). Further, the enhanced spectral resolution of WV-2 imagery improved bathymetry retrieval compared to 4-band GeoEye data.

AB Reconstruction and evolution of two-dimensional spectra of surface waves in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from airborne sun-glitter imagery. As the proposed method is based on a linear transfer function deduced from the shape of the sunglitter brightness, the absolute wavenumber elevation spectrum does not require any additional assumption or information about sky brightness, wind or wave energy. The detailed description of the airborne image processing method is given. As demonstrated, retrieved spectra agree well with nearby NDBC buoy data, both for spectrum shape, level and energy angular distribution. The 180-degree wave direction ambiguity, inherent to image-derived spectra, is eliminated by using cross-correlation analysis between two consecutive images. A case study corresponding to the spectral evolution with increasing distance from shore in slanting fetch conditions is then considered. Energy level and peak position transformation are consistent with established approximations and laws of wind-sea development. The technical requirements (flight altitude, image resolution, view angles, etc) and applicability of the suggested methodology are also discussed. These results demonstrate the potential efficiency of high resolution sea state monitoring from drones or light aircrafts using sunglitter imagery.

AB The increased frequency and intensity of insect-induced forest disturbances necessitates effective methods to precisely monitor and map the degree of disaster. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging is an effective technology for surveying and monitoring forest health. In this article, a novel framework that utilizes a UAV-based hyperspectral image is proposed to identify the degree of damage caused by Dendrolirnus tabulaeformis Tsai et Liu (D.tabulaeformis) in Jianping county of Liaoning province, China. First, data reduction of the hyperspectral image is achieved by comparing three waveband selection algorithms: principal components analysis (PCA), the successive projection algorithm (SPA), and the instability index between classes (ISIC). On this basis, a joint algorithm, ISIC-SPA, which demonstrates the best waveband selection efficiency and good cross-validation accuracy, is proposed. ISIC-SPA is used to select only three sensitive wavebands from 125 original wavebands with a root mean square error of 0.1535. Then, according to analysis of the three sensitive wavebands' reflectance and the corresponding defoliation rate, the piecewise index (PI, B(710 + 738 - 522)) was constructed and the threshold of PI was found to divide the defoliation level. Finally, a piecewise partial least squares regression model was established to quantitatively estimate the defoliation using the optimal wavebands to identify and demarcate the damage level to individual trees. The assessment accuracy of damage caused by D.tabulaeformis at the tree level reached 95.23% using the ISIC-SPA-P-PLSR framework.

AB The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available.
   First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored.
   Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales.
   Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2s greatest strengths.

AB Artificial light at night (ALAN) provides a unique footprint of human activities and settlements. However, the adverse effects of ALAN on human health and ecosystems have not been well understood. Because of a lack of high resolution data, studies of ALAN in China have been confined to coarse resolution, and fine-scale details are missing. The fine details of ALAN are pertinent, because the highly dense population in Chinese cities has created a distinctive urban lighting pattern. In this paper, we introduced a new generation of high spatial resolution and multi-spectral night-time light imagery from the satellite JL1-3B. We examined its effectiveness for monitoring the spatial pattern and discriminating the types of artificial light based on a case study of Hangzhou, China. Specifically, local Moran's I analysis was applied to identify artificial light hotspots. Then, we analyzed the relationship between artificial light brightness and land uses at the parcel-level, which were generated from GF-2 imagery and open social datasets. Third, a machine learning based method was proposed to discriminate the type of lighting sources - between high pressure sodium lamps (HPS) and light-emitting diode lamps (LED) - by incorporating their spectral information and morphology feature. The result shows a complicated heterogeneity of illumination characteristics across different land uses, where main roads, commercial and institutional areas were brightly lit while residential area, industrial area and agricultural land were dark at night. It further shows that the proposed method was effective at separating light emitted by HPS and LED, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 83.86% and 0.67, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of JL1-3B and its superiority over previous night-time light data in detecting details of lighting objects and the nightscape pattern, and suggests that JL1-3B and alike could open up new opportunities for the advancement of night-time remote sensing.

AB Global-scale surface soil moisture products are currently available from multiple remote sensing platforms. Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites. However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain. Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented. Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis. In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series. This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation. Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP (with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76) over SMOS (0.66) and ASCAT (0.63) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies. SMAP is also the best-performing product over the majority of applicable land pixels (52%), although SMOS and ASCAT each shows advantage in distinct geographic regions.

AB Temperate and semiarid grasslands comprise 80% of the land area on the Mongolian Plateau and environs, which includes Mongolia (MG), and the province of Inner Mongolia (IM), China. Substantial land cover/use change in the last few decades, driven by a combination of post-liberalization socioeconomic changes and extreme climatic events, has degraded these water-limited grassland's structure and function. Hence, a precise estimation of canopy cover (CC, %) and aboveground biomass (AGB, g m(-2)) is needed. In this study, we analyzed > 1000 field observations with sampling during June, July and August (JJA) in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2016 in IM and 2010-2012 and 2014-2016 in MG. The field sampling was stratified by the dominant vegetation types on the plateau, including the meadow steppe, the typical steppe, and the desert steppe. Here we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived surface reflectance and vegetation indices optimized for low cover conditions to develop and test predictive models of CC and AGB using observed samples as training and validation data through rule-based regression tree models. We then used the predictive models to estimate spatially-explicit CC and AGB for the plateau over the last decade (2000-2016). Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of our predictive models in up-scaling ground observations to the regional scale across steppe types. Our results showed that model R-2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.74 (13.1%) and 0.62 (85.9 gm(-2)), respectively. The validation R-2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.67 (14.4%) and 0.68 (76.9 gm(-2)), respectively. The mean +/- SD for CC and AGB were 24.9 +/- 23.4% and 155.2 +/- 115.2 g m(-2), respectively. We also found that our scaled up estimates were significantly related to inter-annual climatic variability and anthropogenic drivers especially distance to urban/built-up areas and livestock density. In addition to their direct use in quantifying the spatiotemporal changes in the terrestrial carbon budget, results from these predictive models can help decision makers and rangeland managers plan sustainable livestock practices in the future.

   INFORMATION
AB Soil thermal inertia (P), a property that controls the temporal variation of near-surface temperature, has been used to estimate surface water content (theta) in remote sensing studies. The accuracy of theta estimates, however, is affected by surface soil porosity (n). We hypothesize that n can be derived using a simple linear n-P relationship of a dry surface soil layer, and that accounting for n improves the accuracy of theta estimation using a P(theta) model. The P of a surface layer was measured by using the heat pulse method during a drying period, and the feasibility of estimating theta with a P(theta) model that included n was explored. The approach was also tested with published P values derived from meteorological data and MODIS data against in situ theta measurements at two field sites in Arizona, USA. The results on a partially vegetated shrubland indicated that by using the P-derived n, the P(theta) model provided more accurate theta estimates than by using the literature n values. Discrepancies between modeled theta and in situ theta measurements were observed at small theta values, which were caused in part by the fact that the modeled theta represented soil layers a few millimeters thick, while the in situ measurements represented theta at the 5 cm depth. The new n-P function has potential for estimating surface theta accurately using multi-scale P data on bare soils or on sparsely vegetated lands.

AB Global food production in the developing world occurs within sub-hectare fields that are difficult to identify with moderate resolution satellite imagery. Knowledge about the distribution of these fields is critical in food security programs. We developed a semi-automated image segmentation approach using wall-to-wall sub-meter imagery with high-performance computing to map crop area (CA) throughout Tigray, Ethiopia that encompasses over 41,000 km(2). Multiple processing streams were tested to minimize mapping error while applying five unique smoothing kernels to capture differences in land surface texture associated to CA. Typically, very-small fields (mean < 2 ha) have a smooth image roughness compared to natural scrub/shrub woody vegetation at the similar to 1 m scale and these features can be segmented in panchromatic imagery with multi-level histogram thresholding. Multi-temporal very-high resolution (VHR) panchromatic imagery with multi-spectral VHR are sufficient in extracting critical CA information needed in food security programs. A 2011 to 2015 CA map was produced, using over 3000 WorldView-1 panchromatic images wall-to-wall in 1/2 degrees mosaics for Tigray, Ethiopia. CA was evaluated with nearly 3000 WorldView-2 2 m multispectral 250 x 250 m image subsets by seven expert interpretations, and with in-situ global positioning system photography. CA estimates ranged from 32 to 41% in sub regions of Tigray with median maximum per bin commission and omission errors of 11% and 1% respectively, with most of the error occurring in bins < 15%. This empirical, simple, and low direct cost approach via U.S. government license agreement to access commercial VHR data, could be a viable big-data high-performance computing methodology to extract wall-to-wall CA for other regions of the world that have very-small agriculture fields with similar image texture.

AB Satellite sensing in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain has been the backbone of land surface monitoring and characterization for more than four decades. However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3-4 m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of > 130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by > 32 days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet's CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations. Realization of this unprecedented Earth observing capacity has far reaching implications for the monitoring and characterization of terrestrial systems at the precision scale.

AB Fine-scale architectural tree models serve as an effective representation of three-dimensional plant material distributions. They can help to quantify wood volume and biomass, to estimate leaf area distributions on a detailed scale, and can be exploited for physically based modelling approaches. If architectural tree models can be derived for multiple acquisition dates, they permit the detailed investigation of phenological effects. Although promising approaches for the generation of architectural tree/forest models from terrestrial LiDAR data are available, they are often non-trivial and their application to forest plots is often difficult. This is restricting the flexibility of these reconstruction approaches especially for multi-temporal analyses. In this paper, forest models of two Larix decidua forest plots are reconstructed by making use of terrestrial LiDAR data and digital hemispherical photographs (DHP). Recent modelling strategies are enhanced and developed further in order to improve the robustness and usability of the architectural tree model reconstruction process.
   Raw point cloud data are directly used as input to solve both tree delineation and tree reconstruction in a single processing pipeline. This includes terrain filtering, intensity filtering, and trunk extraction. These steps are followed by a hierarchical and iterative multi-tree branch and twig reconstruction. Based on multi-temporal DHPs, various foliage states are documented. These DHPs and the reconstructed branching architectures are used to flexibly generate and update multi-temporal 3D models of foliage. In order to quantify the modelling performance with respect to various forest characteristics, a test setup based on simulated forest and acquisition geometries is build up. It can be shown, that typical sources of error in the tree reconstruction process are minimized by the proposed approach. It is possible to estimate wood volume distributions, trunk tapering and leaf area distributions with an error of only 10-14%. Except for strongly overlapping tree crowns, the overall accuracy of the single tree delineation in interlinked tree crowns is higher than 80%. Considering these error margins, we apply the modelling strategy to two forest plots and derive architectural models for three dates during the growing season. Using DHPs as reference data, it can be shown, that the estimated gap fraction values derived from the generated models show an error of only 10-15%.

AB Land cover mapping via image classification is sometimes realized through object-based image analysis. Objects are typically constructed by partitioning imagery into spatially contiguous groups of pixels through image segmentation and used as the basic spatial unit of analysis. As it is typically desirable to know the accuracy with which the objects have been delimited prior to undertaking the classification, numerous methods have been used for accuracy assessment. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of image segmentation accuracy assessment in land cover mapping applications. First the literature published in three major remote sensing journals during 2014-2015 is reviewed to provide an overview of the field. This revealed that qualitative assessment based on visual interpretation was a widely-used method, but a range of quantitative approaches is available. In particular, the empirical discrepancy or supervised methods that use reference data for assessment are thoroughly reviewed as they were the most frequently used approach in the literature surveyed. Supervised methods are grouped into two main categories, geometric and non-geometric, and are translated here to a common notation which enables them to be coherently and unambiguously described. Some key considerations on method selection for land cover mapping applications are provided, and some research needs are discussed.

AB The abundance and distribution of plastic debris in natural waters is largely unknown due to limited comprehensive monitoring. Here, optical properties of dry and wet marine-harvested plastic debris were quantified to explore the feasibility of plastic debris optical remote sensing in the natural environment. We measured the spectral reflectance of microplastics (< 5 mm) from the North Atlantic Ocean, macroplastics (> 5 mm) washed ashore along the USA west coast and virgin plastic pellets over a wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. Compared to the spectral variability of multi-colored dry macroplastics, the measured dry marine-harvested microplastic reflectance spectra could be represented as a single bulk average spectrum with notable absorption features at similar to 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. The wet marine-harvested microplastics had similar spectral features to the dry microplastics but the magnitude was lower over the measured spectrum. When spectrally matched to the reference library of typical dry virgin pellets, the mean dry marine-harvested microplastics reflectance had moderate similarities to low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate. This composition was consistent with the subset sampled with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and what has been reported globally. The absorption features at 1215 and 1732 nm were observable through an intervening atmosphere and used to map the distributions of synthetic hydrocarbons at a landfill and on man-made structures from airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, indicating the potential to remotely sense dry washed ashore and land-origin plastics. These same absorption features were identifiable on wet marine-harvested microplastics, but the ability to conduct remote sensing of microplastics at the ocean surface layer will require more detailed radiative transfer analysis and development of high signal-to-noise sensors. The spectral measurements presented here provide a foundation for such advances towards remote detection of plastics from various platforms.

AB The landscape freeze/thaw (FT) state plays an important role in local, regional and global weather and climate, but is difficult to monitor. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provides hemispheric estimates of landscape FT state at a spatial resolution of approximately 362 km(2). Previous validation studies of SMAP and other satellite FT products have compared satellite retrievals with point estimates obtained from in situ measurements of air and/or soil temperature. Differences between the two are attributed to errors in the satellite retrieval. However, significant differences can occur between satellite and in-situ estimates solely due to differences in scale between the measurements; these differences can be viewed as 'representativeness errors' in the in-situ product, caused by using a point estimate to represent a large-scale spatial average. Most previous validation studies of landscape FT state have neglected representativeness errors entirely, resulting in conservative estimates of satellite retrieval skill. In this study, we use a variant of triple collocation called 'categorical triple collocation' - a technique that uses model, satellite and in-situ estimates to obtain relative performance rankings of all three products, without neglecting representativeness errors - to validate the SMAP landscape FT product. Performance rankings are obtained for nine sites at northern latitudes. We also investigate differences between using air or soil temperatures to estimate FT state, and between using morning (6 AM) or evening (6 PM) estimates. Overall, at most sites, the SMAP product or in-situ FT measurement is ranked first, and the model FT product is ranked last (although rankings vary across sites). These results suggest SMAP is adding value to model simulations, providing higher-accuracy estimates of landscape FT states compared to models and, in some cases, even in-situ estimates, when representativeness errors are properly accounted for in the validation analysis.

AB Launched in January 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory was designed to provide frequent global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every two to three days using a radar and a radiometer operating at L-band frequencies. Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones.
   Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017.
   This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid. This is made possible by first applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna temperature (T-A) data in the original SMAP Level 1B Brightness Temperature Product to take advantage of the overlapped radiometer footprints on orbit. The resulting interpolated TA data then go through various correction/calibration procedures to become the SMAP Level 1C Enhanced Brightness Temperature Product (L1C_TB_E). The L1C_TB_E product, posted on a 9 km grid, is then used as the primary input to the current operational SMAP baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm to produce L2_SM_P_E as the final output. Images of the new product reveal enhanced visual features that are not apparent in the standard product. Based on in situ data from core validation sites and sparse networks representing different seasons and biomes all over the world, comparisons between L2_SM_P_E and in situ data were performed for the duration of April 1, 2015-October 30, 2016. It was found that the performance of the enhanced 9 km L2_SM_P_E is equivalent to that of the standard 36 km L2_SM_P, attaining a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and a correlation coefficient above 0.800. This assessment also affirmed that the Single Channel Algorithm using the V-polarized T-B channel (SCA-V) delivered the best retrieval performance among the various algorithms implemented for L2_SM_P_E, a result similar to a previous assessment for L2_SM_P.

AB The use of digital soil mapping, with the help of spectroscopic data, provides a non-destructive and cost-efficient alternative to soil property laboratory measurements. Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/ SWIR, 400-2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging is one of the most promising tools for topsoil property mapping. The aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of soil property prediction results to coarsening image spectral resolution. This may offer an analysis of the potential of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors, e.g., HYPerspectral X IMagery (HYPXIM) or Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), and existing multispectral sensors, e.g., SENTINEL-2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) or LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), for soil properties mapping. This study used VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data acquired by the AISA-DUAL sensor (initial spectral and spatial resolutions of approximately 5 nm and 5 m, respectively) over a 300 km(2) Mediterranean rural region. Ten spectral configurations were built and divided in the following two groups: i) six spectral configurations corresponding to simulated sensors with regular spectral resolution from 5 nm to 200 nm (i.e., the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) remains constant throughout the considered spectral domain; this includes the simulation of the forthcoming HYPXIM and EnMAP hyperspectral satellites) and ii) four spectral configurations corresponding to existing multispectral sensors with irregular spectral resolution (i.e., the FWHM differs from spectral sampling interval; Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), SENTINEL-2 MSI, LANDSAT-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and LANDSAT-8 OLI). The soil property studied in this paper is the clay content, defined as the percentage of granulometric fraction finer than 2 mu m by weight of the soil, which will be estimated using the partial least squares regression method. Our results showed that i) spectral configurations with regular spectral resolutions from 5 to 100 nm provided similar and good clay content prediction performances (R-val(2) > 0.7 and RPIQ > 3) and allowed clay mapping with correct short-scale variations, ii) the spectral configuration with a regular spectral resolution of 200 nm provided unsatisfactory clay content prediction performance (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.01 and RPIQ similar or equal to 1.65) and iii) the ASTER sensor was the only existing multispectral sensor that provided both correct performance of clay content estimation (R-val(2) similar or equal to 0.8 and RPIQ similar or equal to 3.72) and correct clay mapping. Therefore, clay mapping by the ASTER multispectral data should be pursued while awaiting the launch of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors (e.g., HYPXIM and EnMAP), which will be good candidates for future large clay mapping campaigns over bare soils.

AB Global-scale surface soil moisture (SSM) products retrieved from active and passive microwave remote sensing provide an effective method for monitoring near-real-time SSM content with nearly daily temporal resolution. In the present study, we first inter-compared global-scale error patterns and combined the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SSM products using a triple collocation (TC) analysis and the maximized Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method from April 2015 to December 2016. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and global in situ observations were utilized to investigate and to compare the quality of satellite-based SSM products.
   The average R-values of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 when they compared with in situ networks, respectively. The ubRMSD values were (0.0411, 0.0625, and 0.0708) m(3) m(-3); and the bias values were (-0.0460, 0.0010, and 0.0418) m(3) m(-3) for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2, respectively. The highest average R-values from SMAP against the in situ results are very encouraging; only SMAP showed higher R-values than GLDAS in several in situ networks with low ubRMSD (0.0438 m(3) m(-3)). Overall, SMAP showed a dry bias (-0.0460 m(3) m(-3)) and AMSR2 had a wet bias (0.0418 m(3) m(-3)); while ASCAT showed the least bias (0.0010 m(3) m(-3)) among all the products.
   Each product was evaluated using TC metrics with respect to the different ranges of vegetation optical depth (VOD). Under vegetation scarce conditions (VOD < 0.10), such as desert and semi-desert regions, all products have difficulty obtaining SSM information. In regions with moderately vegetated areas (0.10 < VOD < 0.40), SMAP showed the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Over highly vegetated regions (VOD > 0.40) ASCAT showed comparatively better performance than did the other products.
   Using the maximized R method, SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 products were combined one by one using the GLDAS dataset for reference SSM values. When the satellite products were combined, R-values of the combined products were improved or degraded depending on the VOD ranges produced, when compared with the results from the original products alone.
   The results of this study provide an overview of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 reliability and the performance of their combined products on a global scale. This study is the first to show the advantages of the recently available SMAP dataset for effective merging of different satellite products and of their application to various hydro meteorological problems.

AB A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2-3 day repeat frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.

AB Accurate and quantitative description of spatial pattern of urban greenspace and its change over time is crucial for understanding ecosystem service provision and urban sustainability. Patches are the basic management and planning units in urban landscapes, and urban designers and planners and natural resource managers frequently seek tools to understand changes at the patch level. High spatial resolution imagery has been increasingly used to measure fine-scale changes of percent cover of urban greenspace. However, few studies have investigated the dynamics of urban greenspace at the patch level, to quantify the process of growth, shrinking, or disappearance of patches. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify and characterize urban greenspace change at the patch level, by implementing object-based image analysis. We used2.5 m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data captured in 2005 and 2009, and tested the new approach in Beijing, China. With this approach, we identify different types of change in patches of urban greenspace, such as expansion and shrinking, newly created, and totally lost, in addition to gain and loss information. The results show: 1) 9.25% of the total area (6179 ha) was generated from expansion of extant patches, while 5.36% (3582 ha) was lost due to shrinking of patches; 2) 0.91% (607 ha) of urban greenspace was totally removed, and 1.23% (821 ha) was newly created; and 3) Urban greenspace with different ranges of patch size, from 0.01 to 1000 ha, all experienced large changes, with a tendency for small-sized patches (< 1 ha) to be totally removed. This new approach provides an effective tool for better understanding changes of urban greenspace, and results from this study provide important insights for planners and managers to devise target-specific measures and plans to more effectively protect urban green space.

AB Melt ponds play a significant role in the summer decay of sea ice due to the fact that their albedo is significantly lower than surrounding snow and sea ice surface. Despite its requirement for thermodynamic sea ice modeling, measurement of melt pond areal coverage using satellite remote sensing has proven difficult due to significant spatiotemporal variability in the timing and evolution of melt ponds. Less than optimal results from prior studies employing a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) towards the determination of melt pond areal coverage from satellite remote sensing data provided the incentive for a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach. The MESMA was performed on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using endmember spectra obtained from atmospherically corrected coincident high resolution imagery, surface observations and modeling. Results were validated against a high resolution Quickbird image acquired coincident to the MODIS image. The validation indicates that the best MESMA results provide consistent estimates of melt pond coverage for regions with high pond coverage (within 5% melt pond coverage) but overestimate pond fraction for regions with low pond coverage (by 10% or more). This may be due to deficiencies in the representation of sea ice surfaces within the endmember library used, oversimplified modeling of the ice surface and shortcomings in the validation process. However, it is assumed that with further refinement, the MESMA technique could allow for reliable estimates of the areal coverage of sea ice melt ponds using low resolution (large spatial coverage) optical satellite imagery under a wide variety of spatiotemporal pond evolution and fraction conditions.

AB The major global biogeophysical products obtained from remote sensing are usually composites of 8 or 16 days, and are almost always retrieved from a single sensor. Subsequently, the applications of these products are limited in cases requiring higher temporal frequency. With the increasing number of freely available moderate resolution remote sensing datasets, multi-sensor synergy to increase temporal sampling is warranted. However, radiometric consistency of multi-sensor data is not as good as expected; therefore, first the constituency should be evaluated. A new cross-calibration approach of reflective bands for moderate resolution remotely sensed data is proposed in this paper. The new approach uses a time series of MODIS data from both Terra and Aqua to retrieve both the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) simultaneously over an invariant desert target. The MODIS retrieved BRDF and AOD are then used to cross calibrate the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) and visible and infra-red radiometer (VIRR) onboard FengYun3-A and B satellites (FY3A/B) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) onboard NOAA-16, 17, and 18. The cross-calibration method is validated in two ways: 1) by comparing with the vicarious calibration; and 2) the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance before and after calibration, which show that the calibration error of this new approach is consistent within 5%. Compared with most cross -calibration methods, our new method is generic and better consider on BRDF models; furthermore, the well-built BRDF of the calibration site and simultaneously retrieved AOD make the method fully automatic and cost effective for the calibration of most moderate resolution remote sensors, especially Chinese sensors.

AB This paper presents stratospheric aerosol climate records developed in the framework of the Aerosol_cci project, one of the 14 parallel projects from the ESA Climate Change Initiative. These data records were processed from a stratospheric aerosol dataset derived from the GOMOS experiment, using an inversion algorithm optimized for aerosol retrieval, called AerGOM. They provide a suite of aerosol parameters, such as the aerosol extinction coefficient at different wavelengths in the UV-visible range.The extinction record includes the total extinction as well as separate fields for liquid sulfate aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Several additional fields (PSC flag, etc.) are also provided. The resulting stratospheric aerosol dataset, which spans the whole duration of the GOMOS mission (2002-2012), was validated using different reference datasets (lidar and balloon profiles). In the present paper, the emphasis is put on the extinction records. After a thorough analysis of the original AerGOM dataset, we describe the methodology used to construct the gridded CCI-GOMOS dataset and the resulting improvements on both the AerGOM algorithm and the binning procedure, in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, coverage and data quality.
   The extinction datasets were validated using lidar profiles from three ground-based stations (Mauna Loa, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Dumont d'Urville). The median difference of the CCI-GOMOS (Level 3) extinction and ground-based lidar profiles is between similar to 15% and similar to 45% in the 16-21 km altitude range, depending on the considered site and aerosol type.
   The CCI-GOMOS dataset was subsequently used, together with a MIPAS SO2 time series, to update a volcanic eruption inventory published previously, thus providing a more comprehensive list of eruptions for the ENVISAT period (2002-2012). The number of quantified eruptions increases from 102 to 230 in the updated inventory. This new inventory was used to simulate the evolution of the global radiative forcing by application of the EMAC chemistry-climate model. Results of this simulation improve the agreement between modelled global radiative forcing of stratospheric aerosols at about 100 hPa compared to values estimated from observations. Medium eruptions like the ones of Soufriere Hills/Rabaul (2006), Sarychev (2009) and Nabro (2011) cause a forcing change from about -0.1 W/m(2) to -0.2 W/m(2). (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Massive amounts of remotely sensed data are being generated at an unprecedented rate, offering new opportunities for data-driven scientific discovery in the Earth sciences and related domains. However, due to the sheer volume of remotely sensed data and the lack of effective data analytics tools, most data remain in the dark, with little to no quality assurance and limited access to high-level analytical tools. Anomaly detection, which aims to find scenarios that differ from the norm, is of particular importance when analyzing remotely sensed data. However, most previous work has focused on identifying individual anomalies, and required prior knowledge of the ground truth for supervised learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that requires no prior knowledge and is capable of detecting anomalous events, which we define as groups of outlier objects differing contextually from their spatial and temporal neighbors. Such contextual anomalies can be useful in discovering both hidden quality issues in the data and real natural events of significance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via Web-based tools developed for visualizing and analyzing such contextual anomalies, using two types of data. The techniques and tools developed in this project are generally usable for a diverse set of satellite products and will be made publicly available with the support of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

AB Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.

AB South America has the largest tropical rainforests and the richest biodiversity in the world. It is challenging to map tropical forests and their spatio-temporal changes because forests are facing fragmentation from human activities (e.g., logging, deforestation), drought, and fire, as well as persistent clouds. Here we present a robust approach to map forests in South America during 2007-2010 and analyze the consistency and uncertainty among eight major forest maps in South America. Greenness-relevant MOD13Q1 NDVI and structure/biomassrelevant ALOS PALSAR time series data recorded 2007 through 2010 were coupled to identify and map forests at 50-m spatial resolution. Both area and spatial comparison were conducted to analyze the consistency and uncertainty of these eight forest maps. Annual 50-m PALSAR/MODIS forest maps were generated during 2007-2010 and the total forest area in South America was about 8.63 x 10(6) km(2) in 2010. Large differences in total forest area (8.2 x 10(6) km(2)-12.7 x 10(6) km(2)) existed among these forest products, especially in the forest edges, semi-humid tropical, and subtropical regions. Forest products generated under a similar forest definition had similar or even larger variation than those generated with contrasting forest definitions. We also find out that one needs to consider leaf area index as an adjusting factor and use much higher threshold values in the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) datasets to estimate forest cover areas. Analyses of PALSAR/MODIS forest maps in 2008/2009 showed a relatively small rate of loss (3.2 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)) in net forest cover, similar to that of FAO FRA (3.3 x 10(4) km(2) year(-1)), but much higher annual rates of forest loss and gain. The rate of forest loss (0.195 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)) was higher than that of Global Forest Watch (0.081 x 10(6) km(2) year(-1)). PALSAR/MODIS forest maps showed that more deforestation occurred in the unfragmented forest areas. Caution should be used when using the different forest maps to analyze forest loss and make policies regarding forest ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. The integration of PALSAR and MODIS images during 2007-2010 provides annual maps of forests in South America with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty.

TI Propensity for erosion and deposition in a deltaic wetland complex:
   Implications for river management and coastal restoration
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID WATER INDEX NDWI; SEA-LEVEL RISE; MISSISSIPPI DELTA; LOUISIANA;
   SALINITY; ACCURACY; KATRINA; FLOOD
AB The Mississippi River Delta is one of the most rapidly changing area on Earth, with large areas experiencing land loss and smaller areas experiencing loss. While some of the drivers of these changes are well known (high rates of relative sea level rise, reduced sediment inputs, canal dredging), debate exists about other drivers. One area that has received substantial attention is the role of, "river diversions," areas where sediments and water are diverted from the Mississippi River into degrading wetlands with the hope of reinitiating deltaic land building processes. Some authors have argued that diversions lead to reduced shear strengths of wetland soils that make them more vulnerable to storm driven erosion, while other authors have argued that sediments from river diversions will develop stable land. This study examined this controversy in the Cubits Gap Subdelta, an analogue for a large (>1420 m(3) s(-1)) river diversion by testing the hypothesis that areas of land gain, and/or resilience to erosion occurred in areas that actively received river sediments and as a result had mineral rich soils with high shear strength. To accomplish this, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was developed for Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDWI was calculated from (Blue - SWIR) / (Blue + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength, and yielded land/water boundary maps with 30 m resolution. Results indicate that land gain occurred predominantly in the riverside section of this subdelta where sediments were imported from Mississippi River crevasses and/or dredging. Land loss typically occurred in the distal regions of the subdelta, which had lower levels of sediment supply and greater wave exposure. Sediment geotechnical analyses revealed land loss pixels generally correlated sediments with to high organic contents (9.0 +/- 1.9%), water contents (54.8 +/- 3.7%) and salinity (6.5 +/- 2.0 PSU), with low shear strengths (5.7 +/- 0.8 kN m(-2)) and low bulk density (0.6 +/- 0.8 g cm(-3)), whereas land gain pixels generally correlate with low organic content (3.9 +/- 0.6%), water content (38.1 +/- 4.2%) high shear strength (10.9 +/- 4.1 kN m(-2)) and bulk density (1.00 +/- 0.1 g cm(-3)). This study suggests plans to restore the region by partially diverting the flow of the Mississippi River will be most successful if they carry high loads of sediment, and that concerns about the integrity of fresh marsh may be unwarranted if those marshes are sediment rich.

AB Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been used to assess population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The emerging high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), provides a valuable opportunity to characterize local-scale PM2.5 at 1-km resolution. However, non-random missing AOD due to cloud/snow cover or high surface reflectance makes this task challenging. Previous studies filled the data gap by spatially interpolating neighboring PM2.5 measurements or predictions. This strategy ignored the effect of cloud cover on aerosol loadings and has been shown to exhibit poor performance when monitoring stations are sparse or when there is seasonal large-scale missingness. Using the Yangtze River Delta of China as an example, we present a Multiple Imputation (MI) method that combines the MAIAC high-resolution satellite retrievals with chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to fill missing AOD. A two-stage statistical model driven by gap-filled AOD, meteorology and land use information was then fitted to estimate daily ground PM2.5 concentrations in 2013 and 2014 at 1 km resolution with complete coverage in space and time. The daily MI models have an average R-2 of 0.77, with an inter-quartile range of 0.71 to 0.82 across days. The overall model 10-fold cross-validation R-2 (root mean square error) were 0.81 (25 mu g/m(3)) and 0.73 (18 mu g/m(3)) for year 2013 and 2014, respectively. Predictions with only observational AOD or only imputed AOD showed similar accuracy. Comparing with previous gap-filling methods, our MI method presented in this study performed better with higher coverage, higher accuracy, and the ability to fill missing PM2 (5) predictions without ground PM2.5 measurements. This method can provide reliable PM2 (5) predictions with complete coverage that can reduce bias in exposure assessment in air pollution and health studies.

AB We demonstrate a new active fire (AF) detection and characterisation approach for use with the VIIRS spaceborne sensor. This includes for the first-time joint exploitation of both 375 m I-Band and 750 m M-Band data to provide both AF detections and FRP (fire radiative power) retrievals over the full range of fire and FRP magnitudes. We demonstrate the value of our VIIRS-IM 'synergy' product in an area of eastern China dominated by numerous small agricultural residue burns, which contribute significantly to regional air quality problems but which are often difficult to identify via standard (e.g. MODIS 500 m resolution) burned area mapping. We show that the highly 'fire sensitive' VIIRS I-Band data enables detection of the 'small' active fires (FRP <= 1 MW), but this sensitivity can lead to false alarms, often associated with manmade structures. We help avoid these via use of 30 m resolution global land cover data and an OpenStreetMap mask. Comparisons to near-simultaneous Aqua-MODIS AF detections, and the existing VIIRS I-Band AF global product, highlight our VIIRS algorithm's ability to more reliably detect the lowest FRP pixels, associated with the type of agricultural burning dominating eastern China. Our algorithm delivers typically 5 to 10x more AF pixels than does simultaneous-collected MODIS AF data (notwithstanding differences in spatial resolution), and importantly with a AF detection sensitivity that remains much more constant across the swath due to VIIRS' unique pixel aggregation scheme. The VIIRS I4-Band saturates over higher FRP fires, but by combining use of 1- and M-Band data our algorithm generates reliable FRP records for all fires regardless of FRP magnitude. Using the VIIRS-IM methodology we find regionally summed FRP's up to 4x higher than are recorded by MODIS over the same fire season, highlighting the significance of the formally undetected low FRP active fires and indicating that current MODIS FRP-based emissions inventories for areas dominated by agricultural burning may be underestimating in a similar way to burned-area based approaches. FRP generation from VIIRS that takes into account both low- and high-FRP fires via use of both the I- and M-Band data should therefore enable significant improvements in global fire emissions estimation, particularly for regions where smaller types of fire are especially dominant.

AB The MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument on board European Space Agency (ESA) Envisat made measurements from 2002 to 2012. Although MERIS was limited in spectral coverage, accurate Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) from MERIS data are retrieved by using appropriate additional information. We introduce a new AOT retrieval algorithm for MERIS over land surfaces, referred to as eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER). XBAER is similar to the "dark-target" (DT) retrieval algorithm used for Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in that it uses a lookup table (LUT) to match to satellite-observed reflectance and derive the AOT. Instead of a global parameterization of surface spectral reflectance, XBAER uses a set of spectral coefficients to prescribe surface properties. In this manner, XBAER is not limited to dark surfaces (vegetation) and retrieves AOT over bright surface (desert, semiarid, and urban areas). Preliminary validation of the MERIS-derived AOT and the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements yield good agreement, the resulting regression equation is y = (0.92x +/- 0.07) + (0.05 +/- 0.01) and Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0.78. Global monthly means of AOT have been compared from XBAER, MODIS and other satellite derived datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB RGB pseudo composite imagery is a robust and fast processing technique for satellite observations to provide near real-time synthesized weather information to forecasters. The technique consists of superposing three images resulting from a linear combination of multi-spectral observations and corresponding them to red, green and blue. A new algorithm for the detection of snow during daytime has recently been developed for the Suomi-NPP VIIRS instruments. The algorithmuses five VIIRS bands including that centered at 2.25 mu m to enhance snow detection and that centered at 1.24 mu m to highlight the temporal variability of the snow cover. Furthermore, this paper shows the capability of the algorithm to detect snow under thin cloud conditions. This product is already provided in near real-time to forecasters of the French national weather service, Meteo-France. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The standing stock of phytoplankton carbon is a fundamental property of oceanic ecosystems, and of critical importance to the development of Earth System models for assessing global carbon pools and cycles. Some methods to estimate phytoplankton carbon at large scales from ocean colour data rely on the parameterisation of carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio, which is known to depend on factors such as the phytoplankton community structure, whereas other methods are based on the estimation of total particulate organic carbon (POC), and rely on the assumption that a known fraction of POC is made up of phytoplankton carbon. The carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio is also used in marine ecosystem models to convert between carbon and chlorophyll, a common requirement. In this paper we present a novel bio-optical algorithm to estimate the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio, and the standing stocks of phytoplankton carbon partitioned into various size classes, from ocean colour. The approach combines empirical allometric relationships of phytoplankton size structure with an absorption-based algorithm for estimating phytoplankton size spectra developed earlier. Applying the new algorithm to satellite ocean colour data from September 1997 to December 2013, the spatio-temporal variations of carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and phytoplankton carbon across various size classes are computed on a global scale. The average annual stock of phytoplankton carbon, integrated over the oceanic mixed-layer depth, is estimated to be similar to 0.26 gigatonnes, with the size-partitioned stocks of 0.14 gigatonnes for picoplankton, 0.08 gigatonnes for nanoplankton and 0.04 gigatonnes for microplankton. The root-mean-square error and the bias in the satellite-derived estimates of picoplankton carbon, when compared with corresponding in situ data, are found to be 36.23 mgC m(-3) and 13.53 mgC m(-3), respectively, on individual pixels. The regional uncertainties in the estimates of phytoplankton carbon are calculated to be less than the relative uncertainties in other satellite derived products, for most parts of the global ocean, and can amplify only for certain oceanographic regions. Although the new estimates of phytoplankton are of the same order of magnitude as those based on existing models, our study suggests that a consensus is yet to be built on the accurate sizes of the phytoplankton carbon pools; improved satellite chlorophyll products, and better estimates of inherent optical properties would be essential pre-requisites to minimising the uncertainties.

AB This paper focuses on the relationship between remotely-sensed urban site characteristics (USCs) and land surface temperature (LST). Particular emphasis is put on an extensive comparison of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) USCs as potential indicators of the surface urban heat island (UHI) effect and as potential predictors for thermal sharpening applications. Both widely-used as well as more recently proposed metrics of the urban remote sensing literature are investigated within a single experiment. While some of these USCs have already been used earlier, others have never been analyzed before in the context of urban temperature studies. In addition to the comparison of 2D and 3D USC5, the spatio-temporal dependencies of their relation to LST are examined. To this end, the experimental setup of this work includes two study areas, 26 USC5, and 16 LST scenes covering four seasons. Use is made of a comprehensive database compiled for the cities of Berlin and Cologne, Germany. After data preparation, very high resolution (VHR) multi-spectral and height data are employed to map fine-scale urban land cover (LC). The resulting LC maps are then used in conjunction with the height information to compute 2D and 3D USCs. Subsequently, multi-temporal LST images are retrieved from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes. The spatio-temporal investigation of the USC-LST connection constitutes the final stage of the workflow and is achieved in the framework of a dedicated correlation analysis. The results of this study highlight that the linkage between USCs and LST sensed at small scan angles is not stronger when 3D parameters are considered. Even though they may offer more holistic representations of the urban landscape, 3D USCs are consistently outperformed by some of the most widely-used 2D metrics. The analysis of spatial dependencies reveals that the USC-LST interplay does not only differ between, but also within the two test sites. This is due to their distinct geographies, with urban form and compactness, green spaces and street trees, and the structural composition of LC elements being some of the determining factors. The examination of temporal dependencies yielded that the association between USCs and LST is fairly stable over time but can be subject to larger inter- and intra-season variations for different reasons, including the season of acquisition, vegetation phonology, and meteorological conditions. Since previous research was based on the analysis of a single study area, a limited number of (mainly 2D) USCs, and/or only a few LST scenes acquired in specific seasons, it is concluded that the findings of this study provide researchers and practitioners with a more complete picture of the USC-LST relationship.

AB Land surface freeze/thaw (F/T) dynamics impact the surface energy balance, carbon fluxes, and hydrologic processes. Recent and on-going L-Band (approximate to 1.4 GHz) spaceborne missions have the potential to provide enhanced information on F/T state over large geographic regions with rapid revisit time. However, the low spatial resolution of these spaceborne observations (approximate to 145 km) makes it difficult to isolate the primary contributions to the Fir signal, including the soil, snow, and vegetation states. A ground-based L-Band radiometer measurement campaign was conducted in Saskatchewan, Canada during the winter of 2014-2015 to evaluate brightness temperature sensitivity to F/T processes, snow, liquid water in snow and assess theoretical retrievals of soil permittivity (epsilon(G)), and snow density from experimental data. The ground-based radiometer was run in multiple configurations. First, temporally continuous measurements were conducted through the winter over an agricultural field, with a comprehensive network of reference snow and soil observations characterizing the F/T state of the soils within or adjacent to the radiometer footprint. Secondly, weekly multi-angular L-Band measurements were made at an undisturbed site of naturally accumulating snow cover, over a site that was kept snow free, and a site with artificially compacted snow. Results from the assessment of the land surface F/T retrieval algorithm showed that L-Band measurements are sensitive to the near surface F/T state of the soil, with the highest level of agreement found between the near surface (2.5 cm) F/T reference measurements of soil temperature and epsilon(G) (accuracies of 91.1% and 92.9%, respectively). Several mid-winter melt events with air temperatures (T-air) above 0 degrees, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees C, illustrated that liquid water within the snow dramatically increase the T-B,T- resulting in false retrievals of soil thaw events using existing L-Band F/T retrieval algorithms. However, Tair was also shown to have a high commission errors compared to radiometer observations in detecting snow melt, because of the delay between T-air > 0 degrees C and the onset of melt resulting in a measurable wet snow signal at L-Band. The retrieval of snow density (rho(s)), of the bottom 10 cm of the snowpack tended to underestimate high rho(s) (>400 kg m(-3)), and agreed well for lower rho(s) (<400 kg m(-3)). The paper gives important information on different contributions to the L-Band F/T signal in a prairie environment, which will help improving satellite-based F/T retrieval algorithms.

AB Slow-moving landslides are widespread in many landscapes with significant impacts on the topographic relief, sediment transfer and human settlements. Their area-wide mapping and monitoring in mountainous terrain, however, is still challenging. The growing archives of optical remote sensing images offer great potential for the operational detection and monitoring of surface motion in such areas. This study proposes a multiple pairwise image correlation (MPIC) technique to obtain a series of redundant horizontal displacement fields, and different multi-temporal indicators for a more accurate detection and quantification of surface displacement. The technique is developed and tested on a series of monoscopic and stereoscopic Pleiades satellite images at a test site in the South French Alps. Empirical tests confirm that MPIC significantly increased detection accuracy (F- measure = 0.85) and that the measurement error can be reduced by averaging velocities from all pair combinations covering a given time-step (i.e. when stereo-pairs are available for at least one date). The derived inventory and displacement fields of 169 slow-moving landslides show a positive relationship between the landslide size and velocities, as well as a seasonal acceleration of the largest landslides in response to an increase in effective precipitation. The processing technique can be adapted to better exploit increasingly available time-series from a variety of optical satellites for the detection and monitoring of landslide displacement.

AB A model to simulate radiative transfer (RT) of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) of three-dimensional (3-D) canopy, FluorWPS (Fluorescence model with Weighted Photon Spread method), was proposed and evaluated. The inclusion of fluorescence excitation was implemented with the 'weight reduction' and 'photon spread' concepts based on Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique. The radiative transfer of SIF in a 3-D canopy was simulated in a physically-based and rigorous way so that various contributions from the radiative process can be accurately quantified. The physical mechanism behind the spectral and angular distributions of canopy SIF was analyzed based on FluorWPS. SIF anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the vegetative surface and it can be significantly influenced by the canopy structure. The performance of the model was evaluated with field measurements and systematically compared with an established RT model of canopy SIF. Especially the detailed comparison with the RT model for four canopy scenes demonstrates that FluorWPS is capable of faithfully reproducing the spectral and angular distributions of SIF, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) being higher than 0.92 and lower than 0.066 W . m(-2). sr(-1) . mu m(-1), respectively, for the red peak, and higher than 0.92 and lower than 0.16 W . m(-2). sr(-1) . mu m(-1) for the far-red peak. The independent nature of the model's canopy realization from the radiative processes is promising for its wide applications for scientific investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Daguangbao mega-landslide (China), induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (M-w = 7.9), with an area of approximately 8 km(2), is one of the largest landslides in the world. Experts predicted that the potential risk and instability of the landslide might remain for many decades, or even longer. Monitoring the activity of such a large landslide is hence critical. Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode from the Sentinel-1 satellite provides us with up-to-date high-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images over a wide ground coverage (250 x 250 km), enabling full exploitation of various InSAR applications. However, the TOPS mode introduces azimuth -dependent Doppler variations to radar signals, which requires an additional processing step especially for SAR interferometry. Sentinel-1 TOPS data have been widely applied to earthquakes, but the performance of TOPS data-based time series analysis requires further exploitation. In this study, Sentinel-1 TOPS data were employed to investigate landslide post-seismic activities for the first time. To deal with the azimuth-dependent Doppler variations, a processing chain of TOPS time series interferometry approach was developed. Since the Daguangbao landslide is as a result of the collapse of a whole mountain caused by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, the existing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs, e.g. SRTM and ASTER) exhibit height differences of up to approximately 500 m. Tandem-X images acquired after the earthquake were used to generate a high resolution post-seismic DEM. The high gradient topographic errors of the SRTM DEM (i.e. the differences between the pre-seismic SRTM and the actual post-seismic elevation), together with low coherence in mountainous areas make it difficult to derive a precise DEM using the traditional InSAR processing procedure. A re-flattening iterative method was hence developed to generate a precise TanDEM-X DEM in this study. The volume of the coseismic Daguangbao landslide was estimated to be of 1.189 +/- 0.110 x 109 m(3) by comparing the postseismic Tandem-X DEM with the preseismic SRTM DEM, which is consistent with the engineering geological survey result. The time-series results from Sentinel-1 show that some sectors of the Daguangbao landslide are still active (and displaying four sliding zones) and exhibiting a maximum displacement rate of 8 cm/year, even eight years after the Wenchuan earthquake. The good performance of TOPS in this time series analysis indicates that up-to-date high-quality TOPS data with spatiotemporal baselines offer significant potential in terms of future InSAR applications.

AB A regularized canopy reflectance model (REGFLEC) is applied over a dryland irrigated agricultural system in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of retrieving leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Ch11). To improve the robustness of the retrieved properties, REGFLEC was modified to 1) correct for aerosol and adjacency effects, 2) consider foliar dust effects on modeled canopy reflectances, 3) include spectral information in the red-edge wavelength region, and 4) exploit empirical LAI estimates in the model inversion. Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chl(1) to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7.9 mu g cm(-2) (16%), based upon in situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize over the course of a growing season. LAI and Chl1 compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary LAI inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique. As a result, LAI was reproduced with good accuracy, with an overall MAD of 0.42 m(2) ITI-2 (12.5%). Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60% after correction for such adjacency effects. In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence. By implementing these model refinements, REGFLEC demonstrated its utility for within-field characterization of vegetation conditions over the challenging landscapes typical of dryland agricultural regions, offering a means through which improvements can be made in the management of these globally important systems.

AB This article describes a Bayesian approach for ensuring the continuity of remote sensing records (1982-2014) by back-prediction of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using historical Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. First, a historical 8 km snow data was generated using MODIS snow Quality Assurance field and North American Regional Reanalysis snow depth and air temperature outputs. Second, the relationships between coarsened 8 km MODIS and AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were modeled pixel by pixel using spatial autocorrelation. Then the NDVI was back-predicted to 1982 from historical AVHRR observations and snow data. The back-predicted NDVI was validated against those data held-out from MODIS in 2001 and 2002 from four distinct biogeographic state regions (California, Kansas, Minnesota and Mississippi) in the continental United States. The results show consistency of the derived NDVI from two sensors, with a Root Mean Square Error within 0.05 over most land cover classes. This validation results suggest potential application of this approach for generating consistent long term multi-sensor NDVI data records for ecology and global climate change studies.

AB Area and spatial distribution information of paddy rice are important for understanding of food security, water use, greenhouse gas emission, and disease transmission. Due to climatic warming and increasing food demand, paddy rice has been expanding rapidly in high latitude areas in the last decade, particularly in northeastern (NE) Asia. Current knowledge about paddy rice fields in these cold regions is limited. The phenology- and pixel-based paddy rice mapping (PPPM) algorithm, which identifies the flooding signals in the rice transplanting phase, has been effectively applied in tropical areas, but has not been tested at large scale of cold regions yet. Despite the effects from more snow/ice, paddy rice mapping in high latitude areas is assumed to be more encouraging due to less clouds, lower cropping intensity, and more observations from Landsat sidelaps. Moreover, the enhanced temporal and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to acquire phenology information and map paddy rice. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual paddy rice mapping in NE Asia which was dominated by single cropping system, including Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and NE China. The cloud computing approach was used to process all the available Landsat 8 imagery in 2014 (143 path/rows, similar to 3290 scenes) with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results indicated that the Landsat 8, GEE, and improved PPPM algorithm can effectively support the yearly mapping of paddy rice in NE Asia. The resultant paddy rice map has a high accuracy with the producer (user) accuracy of 73% (92%), based on the validation using very high resolution images and intensive field photos. Geographic characteristics of paddy rice distribution were analyzed from aspects of country, elevation, latitude, and climate. The resultant 30-m paddy rice map is expected to provide unprecedented details about the area, spatial distribution, and landscape pattern of paddy rice fields in NE Asia, which will contribute to food security assessment, water resource management, estimation of greenhouse gas emissions, and disease control.

AB Two satellite-based methods to estimate daily averaged photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at the ocean surface are evaluated at high northern latitudes. The first method employs a precomputed Look-Up-Table (LUT) generated from radiative transfer simulations. The LUT associates spectral irradiance reaching the surface to a given set of input parameters, namely solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness, cloud fraction, ozone concentration, and surface albedo. The second method, as implemented by NASA's Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) in the standard Ocean Color data processing chain, expresses the energy budget of the atmosphere-surface-ocean system via a simple radiative transfer model. The performance of these methods is evaluated using an extensive in situ PAR dataset collected in the Arctic Ocean between 1998 and 2014, with daily values ranging from 0.08 to 61.07 Em(-2) d(-1). A methodology is developed to compare in situ measurements and satellite products of different spatial and temporal resolution. Agreement is generally good between satellite-derived estimates and ship-based data and between methods. Specifically, both methods yield a small positive bias of 6% and 2% and a relative uncertainty larger than that observed at low latitude, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 33% and 20% for the LUT and OPBG methods, respectively. This is attributed to the peculiar environmental conditions encountered in the Arctic, namely low solar elevation, changing surface albedo due to sea ice, and persistent cloudiness. The RMSE difference among methods is due to the high temporal resolution (3 h) of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) LUT input not fully compensating for its low spatial resolution (280 km grid cells). The LUT method has the major advantage of providing PAR estimates in all conditions, including ice-covered regions, while the OBPG method is currently limited to open waters and a solar zenith angle lower than 83 degrees. Consequently, the OBPG method may not account for as much as 38% of PAR reaching the Arctic ocean surface annually. Both methods have the potential to provide useful PAR estimates just below the ice, by including information about ice transmittance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in many of the world's mountainous regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.

AB Characterization of tropical forest trees has been limited to field-based techniques focused on measurement of diameter of the cylindrical part of the bole, with large uncertainty in measuring large trees with irregular shapes, and other size attributes such as total tree height and the crown size. Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1 ha, 2.25 ha, 4 ha, and 6.25 ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from 16.9% at 1 ha for the worst model to 5.0% at 6.25 ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales (similar to 4 ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.

AB Sherman Island, the westernmost island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, plays a crucial role in maintaining the water flux between saline ocean water from the San Francisco Bay to its west and the rest of the Delta to its east. Land elevation below mean sea level and continuous subsidence over the past century has made this island a high priority area for investigations of subsidence and restoration in the Delta. This study reports the results of successful application of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data and technique to measure subsidence in the Delta, which is a coherence-challenged non-urban area. We carried out a time series interferometric analysis of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band (23.8 cm) data, collected from July 2009-August 2014, to assess both the spatial and temporal variation of subsidence on Sherman Island. We report both large-scale (island-wide) subsidence trends and small-scale (levee/ farm scale) subsidence features in Sherman Island. Assuming the subsidence is linear during the five years of UAVSAR data acquisition, subsidence rates across the island range from 0-5 cm/yr, with an average of 1.3 +/- 0.2 cm/yr. We estimate our systematic uncertainty to be 03 cm/yr. Overall, the central region in the island has subsided at a faster rate than the rest of the island. We find our results to be consistent with previous measurements of subsidence rates at electric transmission line towers scattered throughout the island. The results of this study provide insights into several factors influencing subsidence, including soil type, water table depth, land use, land elevation and the location and time of levee repairs. Subsidence monitoring on Sherman Island is essential for maintaining a reliable water supply for the state of California and for protecting the Delta ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The SMOS brightness temperature (T-B) collected on the East Antarctic Plateau revealed spatial signatures at L-band that have never before been observed when only higher-frequency passive microwave observations were available, and this has opened up a new field of research. Because of the much greater penetration depth, modeling the microwave ice sheet emission requires taldng into account not only snow conditions on the surface, but should also include glaciological information. Even if the penetration depth of the L-band is not well known due to the uncertainty on the imaginary part of the ice permittivity, it is likely to be of the order of several hundreds of meters, which means that the temperature of the ice over a depth of nearly 1000 m influences the emission. Over such a depth, the temperature is related to both the surface conditions and to the ice sheet thickness, which in turn depends on the bedrock topography and on other glaciological variables. The present paper aims to provide a thorough theoretical explanation of the observed T-B spatial variation close to the Brewster angle at vertical polarization, in order to limit the effect of surface and vertical density variability in the firn. In order to provide reliable inputs to the microwave emission models used for simulating T-B data, an in-depth analysis of the temperature profiles was performed by means of glaciological models. The comparison between simulated and observed data over three transects totalling 2000 km in East Antarctica pointed out that, whereas the emission models are capable of explaining the T-B spatial variations of several kelvins (0.7 and 2.9 K), they are unable to predict its absolute value correctly. This study also shows that the main limiting factor in simulating low-frequency microwave data is the uncertainty in the currently available imaginary part of the ice permittivity.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched in November 2009, is the European Space Agency's (ESA) second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission. The scientific objectives of the SMOS mission directly respond to the need for global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, two key variables used in predictive hydrological, oceanographic and atmospheric models. SMOS observations also provide information on vegetation, in particular plant available water and water content in a canopy, drought index and flood risks, surface ocean winds in storms, freeze/thaw state and sea ice and its effect on ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and dynamics affecting large-scale processes of the Earth's climate system.
   Significant progress has been made over the course of the now 6-year life time of the SMOS mission in improving the ESA provided level 1 brightness temperature and level 2 soil moisture and sea surface salinity data products. The main emphasis of this paper is to review the status of the mission and provide an overview and performance assessment of SMOS data products, in particular with a view towards operational applications, and using SMOS products in data assimilation.
   SMOS is in excellent technical condition with no limiting factors for operations beyond 2017. The instrument performance fulfils the requirements. The radio-frequency interference (RFI) contamination originates from man-made emitters on ground, operating in the protected L-band and adding signal to the natural radiation emitted by the Earth. RFI has been detected worldwide and has been significantly reduced in Europe and the Americas but remains a constraint in Asia and the Middle East. The mission's scientific objectives have been reached over land and are approaching the mission objectives over ocean.
   This review paper aims to provide an introduction and synthesis to the papers published in this RSE special issue on SMOS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is perturbed by Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) that jeopardizes part of its scientific retrieval in certain areas of the world. Areas affected by RFI might experience data loss or underestimation of soil moisture and ocean salinity retrieval values. To alleviate this situation, the SMOS team has put several strategies into place that help improve the RFI situation, filter the SMOS data from RFI perturbed measurements and bring awareness to the RFI problem.

AB Mapping of settlement areas from space is entering a new era. With the recently developed Global Urban Footprint (based on radar data from TanDEM-X) and the Global Human Settlement Layer (based on optical data), two new initiatives that promise to map complex settlement patterns at global scales and unprecedented spatial resolutions are about to enter the scientific and map user community. However, comparative studies on these layers' strengths and weaknesses, especially in terms of their potential added value with regard to existing lower resolution maps, as well as their assessed accuracy are still absent. In this regard, we introduce a multi scale cross-comparison framework that uses the best existing urban maps as a benchmark. To paint a complete picture, we simultaneously address several components of map accuracy including relative inter-map agreement, absolute accuracies and pattern-based classification differences. This framework is applied to present regionally representative results from two Central European test sites. In this, we find that the new base maps bring decisive advancements in preserving the small-scale complexity of global human settlement patterns beyond urban core areas. Relative inter-map comparison exposes low density settlement regions traditionally under-represented by lower resolution maps that are now recognized. Absolute metrics such as the Kappa coefficient of agreement (K) show that accuracies of the new high resolution layers ((K) over bar = 0.56-0.58) nearly double those of existing products. Beyond, they feature substantial consistency between urban ((K) over bar = 0.46-0.50) and rural landscapes ((K) over bar = 0.41-0.45). Results from pattern-based exploration further reveal significant correlation of accuracies with physical pattern variations such as settlement density and mark a clear shift of accuracies from large to medium and small patch sizes. This differentiated view on classification accuracies shows that the new generation of urban maps constitutes a significantly enhanced spatial representation of large-scale settlement patterns.

AB Urbanization-induced phenological shifts may provide evidence on how vegetation will respond to global warming. However, the effects of urbanization on vegetation phenology are poorly understood in urban environments. Using MODIS data between 2007 and 2013, we investigated the trends of the phenological metrics (i.e., start, end, and length of growing season: SOS, EOS and GSL) of individual cities and across cities relative to rural areas for China's 32 major cities. We found that the effects of urbanization on phenology decayed exponentially toward rural areas, and were closely related to the land surface temperature (LST) for more than half of the cities. The phenological sensitivity to temperature were 9-11 days SOS advance and 6-10 days EOS delay per 1 degrees C increase of LST. On average across all cities, the growing season started 11.9 days earlier and ended 5.4 days later in urban zones compared to rural counterparts. The urbanization effects increased with increasing latitudes, following the pattern of urban heat island effects in general. Our study suggests the value of urban environments in studying the phenological responses to future global change. However, the urbanization impacts are complex and need more direct observations, experimental manipulations, and cross boundary inter-comparison studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Permafrost extent (PE) and active layer thickness (ALT) are important for assessing high northern latitude (HNL) ecological and hydrological processes, and potential land-atmosphere carbon and climate feedbacks. We developed a new approach to infer PE from satellite microwave remote sensing of daily landscape freeze-thaw (FT) status. Our results document, for the first time, the use of satellite microwave FT observations for monitoring permafrost extent and condition. The FT observations define near-surface thermal status used to determine permafrost extent and stability over a 30-year (1980-2009) satellite record. The PE results showed similar performance against independent inventory and process model (CHANGE) estimates, but with larger differences over heterogeneous permafrost subzones. A consistent decline in the ensemble mean of permafrost areas (-0.33 million km(2) decade(-1); p < 0.05) coincides with regional warming (0.4 degrees C decade(-1); p < 0.01), while more than 40% (9.6 million km(2)) of permafrost areas are vulnerable to degradation based on the 30-year PE record. ALT estimates determined from satellite (MODIS) and ERA-Interim temperatures, and CHANGE simulations, compared favorably with independent field observations and indicate deepening ALT trends consistent with widespread permafrost degradation under recent climate change.

AB Surface albedo is a key parameter in the energy balance of glaciers and ice sheets because it controls the short-wave radiation budget, which is often the dominant term of a glacier's surface energy balance. Monitoring surface albedo is a key application of remote sensing and achieving consistency between instruments is crucial to accurate assessment of changing albedo. Here we take advantage of a high resolution (5 m) airborne multispectral dataset that was collected over Langjokull, Iceland in 2007, and compare it with near contemporaneous ETM+ and MODIS imagery. All three radiance datasets are converted to reflectance by applying commonly used atmospheric correction schemes: 6S and FLAASH. These are used to derive broadband albedos. We first assess the similarity of albedo values produced by different atmospheric correction schemes for the same instrument, then contrast results from different instruments. In this way we are able to evaluate the consistency of the available atmospheric correction algorithms and to consider the impacts of different spatial resolutions. We observe that FLAASH leads to the derivation of surface albedos greater than when 6S is used. Albedo is shown to be highly variable at small spatial scales. This leads to consistent differences associated with specific facies types between different resolution instruments, in part attributable to different surface bi-directional reflectance distribution functions. Uncertainties, however, still exist in this analysis as no correction for variable bi-directional reflectance distribution functions could be implemented for the ETM+ and airborne datasets.

AB Focusing on a Mediterranean Natura 2000 site in Italy, the effectiveness of the cross correlation analysis (CCA) technique for quantifying change in the area of semi-natural grasslands at different spatial resolutions (grain) was evaluated. In a fine scale analysis (2 m), inputs to the CCA were a) a semi-natural grasslands layer extracted from an existing validated land cover/land use (LC/LU) map (1:5000, time and b) a more recent single date very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 image (time T-2), with T-2 > T-1. The changes identified through the CCA were compared against those detected by applying a traditional post-classification comparison (PCC) technique to the same reference T-1 map and an updated T-2 map obtained by a knowledge driven classification of four multi-seasonal Worldview-2 input images. Specific changes observed were those associated with agricultural intensification and fires. The study concluded that prior knowledge (spectral class signatures, awareness of local agricultural practices and pressures) was needed for the selection of the most appropriate image (in terms of seasonality) to be acquired at T-2. CCA was also applied to the comparison of the existing T-1 map with recent high resolution (HR) Landsat 8 OLS images. The areas of change detected at VHR and HR were broadly similar with larger error values in HR change images. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB More than 80% of the world's temperate deserts are located in Central Asia. Knowledge of the desert biomass distribution and its dynamic related to the climate controls are vital for the development of adaptation strategies to meet the challenge of climate changes in the 21st century. However, due to the lack of field observations and the difficulties in retrieving vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) of sparsely vegetated lands across large areas from satellite imagery, the amount of desert biomass and its spatiotemporal patterns in Central Asia are still unclear. Based on 168 field observations and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, we developed the VFC and biomass maps of the temperate deserts in Central Asia for the early 2000s (2000-2004) and early 2010s (2010-2014) and investigated the relationship between climate drivers and biomass distribution in the first decade of the 21st century. Our results showed the mean VFC (+/- SE) and biomass density (+/- SE) of the temperate desert, which covers an area of 3.6 x 10(6) km(2) in Central Asia, were 19 +/- 14% and 280 +/- 190 g m(-2) respectively. The total desert biomass amounted to 1.00 Gt, about 36% of which was contributed by the temperate semi-shrub and dwarf semi-shrub. Precipitation, aridity, and growing season temperature were the major control factors on the biomass. Following the precipitation gradient, the western Central Asia had higher biomass density than the east, and relatively high biomass density was found on the windward slopes of the mountains. Large areas in the western Central Asia desert lost biomass due to the prolonged drought since the late 1990s. The differences in climate sensitivities among that desert vegetation types were noteworthy, indicating the future climate change may trigger vegetation succession. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Several lake ice phenology studies from satellite data have been undertaken. However, the availability of long-term lake freeze-thaw-cycles, required to understand this proxy for climate variability and change, is scarce for European lakes. Long time series from space observations are limited to few satellite sensors. Data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used in account of their unique potential as they offer each day global coverage from the early 1980s expectedly until 2022. An automatic two-step extraction was developed, which makes use of near-infrared reflectance values and thermal infrared derived lake surface water temperatures to extract lake ice phenology dates. In contrast to other studies utilizing thermal infrared, the thresholds are derived from the data itself, making it unnecessary to define arbitrary or lake specific thresholds. Two lakes in the Baltic region and a steppe lake on the Austrian-Hungarian border were selected. The later one was used to test the applicability of the approach to another climatic region for the time period 1990 to 2012. A comparison of the extracted event dates with in situ data provided good agreements of about 10 d mean absolute error. The two-step extraction was found to be applicable for European lakes in different climate regions and could fill existing data gaps in future applications. The extension of the time series to the full AVHRR record length (early 1980 until today) with adequate length for trend estimations would be of interest to assess climate variability and change. Furthermore, the two-step extraction itself is not sensor-specific and could be applied to other sensors with equivalent near-and thermal infrared spectral bands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study looked to investigate the basic properties and species classification performance of waveform (WF) features in LiDAR data for the main tree species in Finland. We conducted experimental research using four LiDAR datasets and individual Scots pine, Norway spruce, and silver/downy birch trees. The classification performance and the importance of features were evaluated for dominant/co-dominant trees (N = 9930), and compared to a subset of trees (N = 3630) that had well separable crowns. We used data obtained from two discrete-return (DR) Leica ALS60 sensors, in which the first echo triggers the recording of a WF sequence. Using experience with simulated WF data, we defined a set of informative and technically simple WF features. Quadratic discriminant analysis was applied to classify tree species and also to discover the most important WF features. The WF features outperformed the DR intensity data (0.57-0.75 vs. 0.74-0.86 in Cohen's kappa). The total backscattered energy (E) of single returning WF sequences was the most important feature. Early summer data outperformed late summer data, and we observed differences in the noise characteristics of individual sensors. We performed analyses of the best-performing mean WF features, using linear mixed-effects modeling. The non-quantified variation in tree structure explained 13-65% of within-species feature variance, while dataset-species interaction (i.e. the dependence of species effect on LiDAR dataset), tree height, age, site type, and scan zenith angle accounted for only 2-25%. The residual variance of each feature was 13-84% and depended on the number of pulses. This dependence was weakest for E, implying good performance at low pulse densities. Further analysis showed how intra-species variations in crown and branch morphology and vigor were logically linked with WF features. We conclude that improvements in species classification may be obtained by a stratification according to tree height and by acquiring data during early summer. The inherent between-tree and within-species variation in geometric-optical properties sets an upper limit for classification performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB From in situ measured woody cover we develop a phenology driven model to estimate the canopy cover of woody species in the Sahelian drylands at 1 km scale. The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - VEGETATION (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual FAPAR dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel. Both multi-year field data and satellite metrics are averaged to produce a steady map. Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r(2)/RMSE (in % woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/32 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of diylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.

AB Studies of land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes often require remote sensing data with high acquisition frequency and high spatial resolution. However, no single sensor meets this requirement. This study presents a new spatiotemporal data fusion method, the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method, to generate synthesized frequent high spatial resolution images through blending two types of data, i.e., frequent coarse spatial resolution data, such as that from MODIS, and less frequent high spatial resolution data such as that from Landsat. The proposed method is based on spectral unmixing analysis and a thin plate spline interpolator. Compared with existing spatiotemporal data fusion methods, it has the following strengths: (1) it needs minimum input data; (2) it is suitable for heteregeneous landscapes; and (3) it can predict both gradual change and land cover type change. Simulated data and real satellite images were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Its performance was compared with two very popular methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based data fusion (UBDF) method. Results show that the new method creates more accurate fused images and keeps more spatial detail than STARFM and UBDF. More importantly, it closely captures reflectance changes caused by land cover conversions, which is a big issue with current spatiotemporal data fusion methods. Because the proposed method uses simple principles and needs only one fine-resolution image as input, it has the potential to increase the availability of high-resolution time-series data that can support studies of rapid land surface dynamics.

AB The accurate quantification of carbon fluxes at continental spatial scale is important for future policy decisions in the context of global climate change. However, many elements contribute to the uncertainty of such estimate. In this study, the uncertainties of eight days gross primary production (GPP) predicted by Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were analysed at the site, ecosystem and European spatial scales. At the site level, the uncertainties caused by the missing of key drivers were evaluated. The most accurate predictions of eight days GPP were obtained when all available drivers were used (Pearson's correlation coefficient, rho similar to 0.84; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) similar to 1.8 g C m(-2) d(-1)). However, when predictions were based on only remotely sensed data the accuracy was close to the optimum (rho similar to 0.8; RMSE similar to 1.9 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and to a commonly used light use efficiency model (MOD17) with parameters optimised for the applied study sites (the MOD17 +, rho similar to 0.79; RMSE similar to 2.04 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Remotely sensed data were key drivers for the accurate prediction of GPP in ecosystems with high variability of green biomass over the phenological cycle (e.g., deciduous broad-leaved forests) or highly affected by the human management (e.g. croplands). In contrast, in the ecosystems with low variability of greenness (e.g., evergreen broad-leaved forests), the predictions were poor when meteorological information were not used. At a European spatial scale, when modelled grids of meteorological, land cover and fPAR data were used as inputs, the propagation of their uncertainty, not accounted in the models training, had significant effects on the uncertainty of the mean annual GPP. At this scale, the effects of meteorological uncertainty were higher than the misclassification error. These findings suggested that a strategy based on satellite-measured data could be a favourable improvement for the spatial upscaling of GPP, because avoiding the propagation of the uncertainties of the modelled grids.

These variables are necessary for understanding and predicting ocean productivity, carbon fluxes, underwater light propagation, water quality, and for assessing marine photochemical processes. The Cariaco Basin, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, is the site of the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series project. Since 1995, CARIACO has collected bio-optical (hyperspectral inherent and apparent optical properties IOPs and AOPs, respectively), biogeochemical and ecological observations to characterize local ecosystem variations in response to regional and global changes in climate. We examine phytoplankton taxonomic and pigment time series data collected by this program between 2006 and 2012 to understand how seasonal changes in these parameters relate to biooptical data (i.e., absorption spectra). TChla and accessory pigments varied seasonally in response to changes in the phytoplankton community composition, with higher concentrations of microphytoplankton (>20 mu m; 45%) during upwelling (December-April) than during the rainy season (16%; May/June-October/November). Picophytoplankton (<2 mu m) dominated during the rainy season (66%). The absorption properties also exhibited seasonal variations. Diagnostic pigments could not be identified in a quantitative way using derivative analysis of phytoplankton absorption, likely because of overlapping of absorption spectra among the pigments present. The POC:TChla ratio at CARIACO was variable and dependent on bulk carbon (not necessarily related to phytoplankton) and the functional groups present at any given time, underscoring the fact that using a fixed ratio of POC:Chla in biogeochemical models can lead to large uncertainties in carbon budgets from coastal zones. Low POC:TChla was associated with microphytoplanIcton size class (diatoms), while picophytoplankton (cyanobacteria) exhibited higher ratios. These results contribute to furthering our understanding of coastal phytoplankton dynamics and how they relate to optical signatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In seasonally snow-covered environments, snow significantly impacts upon vegetative phenology. As such, there is a need to derive land surface phenological descriptors that are free of the influence of snow-cover. The presence of on-ground snow-cover influences the phenological descriptors produced using some remotely sensed vegetation indices. This study proposes a method that uses both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) to obtain dates for the start and end of the growing season. The method operates in the phase-spaces (sometimes referred to as feature- or band-spaces) created by the intersection of the NDVI-NDII data-space of individual pixels and can be used to derive descriptors for the start and end of the growing period as well as period corresponding with the end of green-up. This paper describes the origins and rationale for the method, which was applied to a MODIS image time-series of Australia's alpine bioregion for 2000-mid-2001. The results were validated against descriptors derived using the method of Delbart et al. (2005). For the start of the growing period, the validation indicated there was moderate correlation (r = 0.51, p <= 0.001) between the descriptors. Noise in the NDII time-series used resulted in little, or no, correlation for the end of the growing period (r = -0.13, p <= 0.001), and the correlation for the end of the green-up period was somewhat limited (r = 0.24, p <= 0.001). In contrast to traditional NDVI threshold methods, the phase-space algorithm proposed here provided for a clear set of definitions that correspond with biophysical phenomena of the land surface, such as the offset and on-set of seasonal snow-cover.

AB Mapping and characterizing surface sediment of desert environments in terms of surface texture and grain sizes provide important information on the geomorphology and depositional history to assess their potential for economic development. Accurate maps of surface sediment are often not available at the desired scales using conventional field surveys. Optical and radar remote sensors are increasingly used as an alternative method for rapid delineation and classification of surface sediments. However, each sensor provides different levels of information and accuracy. In this research work, six datasets (ALOS/AVNIR-2, ASTER, AVNIR-2/PALSAR, ASTER/PALSAR, quad polarized ALOS/PALSAR and quad polarized Radarsat-2) were prepared to run unsupervised and supervised classifications to compare their accuracy for mapping surface sediment in the non-vegetated El-Gallaba Plain of the Western Desert of Egypt, particularly in terms of grain size and surface roughness. The accuracy level of all classification outputs, as well as the official geologic map, in comparison with the reference field information is empirically evaluated using the standard accuracy assessment method (confusion matrices). The best overall accuracy and dataset is the supervised classification using the complex coherence matrix [T-3] of the full polarimetric Radarsat-2 which is 96.43% with Kappa coefficient of 0.929. Therefore, the zonal statistics method is applied between the final supervised classification map with its five classes and the generated Entropy (H), Alpha (alpha degrees), Anisotropy (A) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to extract information regarding the polarimetric response as well as the elevation of each sediment class. In addition, the polarization signatures of these five classes are extracted in order to examine their scattering mechanism and to distinguish the differences between them in terms of differences in their surface roughness and grain sizes. In addition, the low frequency ALOS/PALSAR data reveal a set of linear features that are hidden under windblown sand and are not visible in the field or in other datasets. These hidden lineament features were confirmed in the field by a ground penetrating radar survey using 100 MHz shielded GSSI antenna. The GPR profiles show very clear discontinuities in the subsurface layers, which are covered by a thin sand sheet Furthermore, the complicated depositional history of these surface sediments is proposed based on field work and remote sensing analyses. Consequently, the results show that El-Gallaba Plain has high potential for agricultural production using its groundwater resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Active and passive microwave remote sensing techniques provide an effective way to observe soil moisture contents. We validated Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor products using estimations from nine different stations located in the Korean peninsula, in northeast Asia from May 1 to September 30, 2010. The results of the surface soil moisture (SSM) products showed a reasonable agreement with the average correlation coefficient (R) values of 039, 0.42, and 0.53 for the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - National Aeronautics and Space Administration (VUA-NASA) AMSR-E, and ASCAT SSM datasets, respectively. The root zone soil moisture (RZSM) products, derived using the NSIDC soil water index (SWI), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) AMSR-E, and the ASCAT SWI datasets showed relatively high R values of 0.47, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively, with in situ soil moisture at a depth of 20 cm. In particular, AMSR-E USDA RZSM data show best agreements with in-situ data at 20 cm, among the four depths (10, 20, 30, and 50 cm). In this study, the ASCAT SSM and SWI were rescaled based on the porosity and the effective saturation according to soil texture. Renormalized soil moisture products using three renormalization methods: the linear regression correction (REG), average-standard deviation (mu - sigma), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) provided an improvement in biases and RMSEs, with SSM (SWI) RMSEs of 0.04 (0.02), 0.05 (0.03), and 0.05 (0.03) m(3)/m(3) for REG mu - sigma, and CDF matching, respectively. A Taylor diagram was used to assess the accuracy of four satellite soil moisture products with in situ data on a plot. Based on these results, ASCAT soil moisture products were potentially proven to be more appropriate than AMSR-E products in northeast Asia. Remotely sensed soil moisture datasets from passive (AMSR-E) and active (ASCAT) sensors are beneficial to operational hydrological investigations and water management activities.

AB In this paper, the land deformation in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia has been mapped using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series analysis with the ALOS L-band SAR data. Land subsidence in the basin resulting from mining activities has already been known over the past few decades. There has been ongoing concern that irrigation and off-shore oil and natural gas extraction has significantly lowered groundwater levels on-shore, and that this may lead to further subsidence. Therefore it is important to map the land surface change in the basin in order to understand the actual impact of these activities. The total area of Gippsland Basin is approximately 46,000 km(2), where approximately one-third of the basin is located onshore. Because of the large area of the basin, ALOS PALSAR data from 4 different paths were used to map the land displacement over the basin. The InSAR result suggests that the land displacement at 98% of the measurement points in the basin was between -10 mm/year and 10 mm/year. The InSAR result has been compared to the ground survey data in several areas, collected with GPS and total station surveys. The comparison of results suggested that the InSAR measurement and the ground survey measurement agree with each other in general. The standard deviation of difference between the InSAR results and the ground survey data is approximately 4 mm/year near the coastal area and 15 mm/year near the mining sites. Several rapidly deforming areas have been identified at the mining sites and the surrounding areas. Deformation rate at up to -82.9 mm/year is observed in these areas. The deformation at the mining sites and the surrounding areas are expected to be resulted from mining activities and associated mine dewatering. Moreover, several minor displacement zones have been observed and investigated in the area between the Loy Yang Mines and the Gippsland coast as well as the area between Yanakie and Wilsons Promontory.

AB Multiplatform observations of ocean biogeochemical data were used to elucidate meridional differences in the factors that limit phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and the mechanisms that trigger the seasonal winter or spring phytoplankton bloom in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO). During the winter, Chl-a north (south) of 30 degrees N is limited by light (nutrients). During the spring and fall, Chl-a in much of the area east of the Japan/Kuril Islands and/or north of 40 degrees N (south of 35 degrees N) is limited by light (nutrients). During the summer, nutrients limit Chl-a over much of the NWPO, except in the areas east of the Japan/Kuril Islands and north of 45 degrees N. In the area south of around 31 N, phytoplanIcton biomass is nutrient limited throughout the year, and the seasonal bloom emerges in the winter, begins in the fall which is associated with mixed layer deepening. Between 31 degrees N and 40 degrees N, the spring bloom onset is mainly associated with a cessation of mixed layer deepening. In much of the area north of 40 degrees N, including the Oyashio area, the onset of the spring bloom is consistent with Sverdrup's critical depth hypothesis. The spatial extents of the light- and nutrient-limited areas and the areas associated with a single bloom onset mechanism are by no means constant. They are expected to undergo meridional shifts as a result of large-scale climatic changes and global warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a widely used technique to address the curse of dimensionality when high-dimensional remotely sensed data, such as multi-temporal or hyperspectral imagery, are analyzed. Nonlinear DR algorithms, also referred to as manifold learning algorithms, have been successfully applied to hyperspectral data and provide improved performance compared with linear DR algorithms. However, DR algorithms cannot handle missing data that are common in multi-temporal imagery. In this paper, the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) nonlinear DR algorithm was refined for application to multi-temporal satellite data with large proportions of missing data. Refined LE algorithms were applied to 52-week Landsat time series for three study areas in Texas, Kansas and South Dakota that have different amounts of missing data and land cover complexity. A series of random forest classifications were conducted on the refined LE DR bands using varying proportions of training data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL); these classification results were compared with conventional metrics-based random forest classifications. Experimental results show that compared with the metrics approach, higher per-class and overall classification accuracies were obtained using the refined LE DR bands of multispectral reflectance time series, and the number of training samples required to achieve a given degree of classification accuracy was also reduced. The approach of applying the refined LE to multispectral reflectance time series is promising in that it is automated and provides dimensionality-reduced data with desirable classification properties. The implications of this research and possibilities for future algorithm development and application are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB It is well established that a natural surface exhibits anisotropic reflectance properties that depend on the characteristics of the surface. Spectral measurements of the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) at ground level provide us a method to capture the directional characteristics of the observed surface. Various spectroradiometers with different field of views (FOVs) were used under different mounting conditions to measure crop reflectance. The impact and uncertainty of sensor FOV and distance from the target have rarely been considered. The issue can be compounded with the characteristic reflectance of heterogeneous row crops. Because of the difficulty of accurately obtaining field measurements of crop reflectance under natural environments, a method of computer simulation was proposed to study the impact of sensor FOV and distance on field measured BRFs. A Monte Carlo model was built to combine the photon spread method and the weight reduction concept to develop the weighted photon spread (WPS) model to simulate radiation transfer in architecturally realistic canopies. Comparisons of the Monte Carlo model with both field BRF measurements and the RAMI Online Model Checker (ROMC) showed good agreement. BRFs were then simulated for a range of sensor FOV and distance combinations and compared with the reference values (distance at infinity) for two typical row canopy scenes. Sensors with a finite FOV and distance from the target approximate the reflectance anisotropy and yield average values over FOV. Moreover, the perspective projection of the sensor causes a proportional distortion in the sensor FOV from the ideal directional observations. Though such factors inducing the measurement error exist, it was found that the BRF can be obtained with a tolerable bias on ground level with a proper combination of sensor FOV and distance, except for the hotspot direction and the directions around it Recommendations for the choice of sensor FOV and distance are also made to reduce the bias from the real angular signatures in field BRF measurement for row crops.

AB Hot extremes have been shown to be induced by antecedent surface moisture deficits in several regions. While most previous studies on this topic relied on modeling results or precipitation-based surface moisture information (particularly the standardized precipitation index, SPI), we use here a new merged remote sensing soil moisture product that combines active and passive microwave sensors to investigate the relation between the number of hot days (NHD) and preceding soil moisture deficits. Along with analyses of temporal variabilities of surface vs. root-zone soil moisture, this sheds light on the role of different soil depths for soil moisture-temperature coupling. The global patterns of soil moisture-NHD correlations from remote sensing data and from SPI as used in previous studies are comparable. Nonetheless, the strength of the relationship appears underestimated with remote sensing-based soil moisture compared to SPI-based estimates, particularly in regions of strong soil moisture-temperature coupling. This is mainly due to the fact that the temporal hydrological variability is less pronounced in the remote sensing data than in the SPI estimates in these regions, and large dry/wet anomalies appear underestimated. Comparing temporal variabilities of surface and root-zone soil moisture in in-situ observations reveals a drop of surface-layer variability below that of root-zone when dry conditions are considered. This feature is a plausible explanation for the observed weaker relationship of remote sensing-based soil moisture (representing the surface layer) with NHD as it leads to a gradual decoupling of the surface layer from temperature under dry conditions, while root-zone soil moisture sustains more of its temporal variability.

AB The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) has adopted as a water quality standard that chlorophyll a concentration should not exceed 40 mu g/L in sounds, estuaries and other slow-moving waters. In 1996, nutrient load reductions were placed into North Carolina (NC) law to reduce the extent and duration of algal blooms in the Neuse and Tar River estuaries (Session Law 1995, Section 572). The chlorophyll a criterion was used as the endpoint to manage total nitrogen concentrations, and compliance would be achieved if chl a exceedances occurred in fewer than 10% of the samples collected in a specified area and time (known as the 10/40 criterion).
   In 2009, discussions were held between the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (NCDENR) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the practicality of using satellite-derived chl a concentrations to monitor water quality, enforce water quality-related environmental regulations, and understand the environmental impacts of the watershed land-use practices on coastal waters.
   In this study, the MERIS chlorophyll a data product was used to conduct a retrospective analysis of the NC standard for water quality and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for total nitrogen in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River estuaries from 2006 to 2009. From daily MERIS images, compliance and chlorophyll exceedances in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River estuaries were assessed at daily and aggregated to annual time scales. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB With more than 30 years of imagery, the Landsat database offers potential insights into changes in the global cryosphere. In this study, a Landsat-based sub-pixel fractional snow covered area retrieval model based on spectral unmixing is applied and validated over a southern Andes study region. An application analyzing minimum annual snow/ice covered areas is presented as an example of the utility of the existence of such a model and the Landsat database. The model was validated using high-resolution imagery aggregated to the nominal Landsat resolution, showing good correlation for both fresh snow and ice/old snow presence. Using annual minimum snow/ice retrievals from Landsat 5 and 7, the presence of trends in each snow/ice-covered pixel area was assessed for the 1986-2013 historical period, and three metrics were examined: pixels with significant negative trends, total area loss, and areas with any absolute negative change. Significant negative (area reduction) trends in most of the glacier fronts were found, with a loss of approximately 15% of the original 241 km(2) glacierized/snow area between 1986 and 2011. Trends in fractional values were compared with those derived from traditional binary classification of snow and significant discrepancies were observed. Even though the binary classification identified a greater total areal loss (33 vs. 23 km(2)) when comparing scenes from the beginning and the end of the study period, the fractional algorithm identified a larger number of pixels with significant negative trends between 1986 and 2013 (42.3 vs. 10.5 km(2)). The binary algorithm resulted in consistent overestimations of ice and snow area and does not offer the ability for identifying subpixel changes. The method could enable future monitoring of Andean and other glaciers and snow cover at a sub-pixel scale over large scales, and with Landsat 8 in orbit a continuous stream of more than 30 years of data is already available.

AB The use of Penman-Monteith (PM) equation in thermal remote sensing based surface energy balance modeling is not prevalent due to the unavailability of any direct method to integrate thermal data into the PM equation and due to the lack of physical models expressing the surface (or stomatal) and boundary layer conductances (g(S) and g(B)) as a function of surface temperature. Here we demonstrate a new method that physically integrates the radiometric surface temperature (T-S) into the PM equation for estimating the terrestrial surface energy balance fluxes (sensible heat, H and latent heat, lambda E). The method combines satellite T-S data with standard energy balance closure models in order to derive a hybrid closure that does not require the specification of surface to atmosphere conductance terms. We call this the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC), which is formed by the simultaneous solution of four state equations. Taking advantage of the psychrometric relationship between temperature and vapor pressure, the present method also estimates the near surface moisture availability (M) from T-S, air temperature (T-A) and relative humidity (R-H), thereby being capable of decomposing lambda E into evaporation (lambda E-E) and transpiration (lambda E-T). STIC is driven with T-S, T-A, R-H, net radiation (R-N), and ground heat flux (G). T-S measurements from both MODIS Terra (MOD11A2) and Aqua (MYD11A2) were used in conjunction with FLUXNET R-N, G, T-A, R-H, lambda E and H measurements corresponding to the MODIS equatorial crossing time. The performance of STIC has been evaluated in comparison to the eddy covariance measurements of lambda E and H at 30 sites that cover a broad range of biomes and climates. We found a RMSE of 37.79 (11%) (with MODIS Terra T-S) and 44.27 W m(-2) (15%) (with MODIS Aqua T-S) in lambda E estimates, while the RMSE was 37.74(9%) (with Terra) and 44.72 W m(-2) (8%) (with Aqua) in H. STIC could efficiently capture the lambda E dynamics during the dry down period in the semi-arid landscapes where lambda E is strongly governed by the subsurface soil moisture and where the majority of other lambda E models generally show poor results. Sensitivity analysis revealed a high sensitivity of both the fluxes to the uncertainties in T-S. A realistic response and modest relationship was also found when partitioned lambda E components (lambda E-E and lambda E-T) were compared to the observed soil moisture and rainfall. This is the first study to report the physical integration of T-S into the PM equation and finding analytical solution of the physical (g(B)) and physiological conductances (g(S)). The performance of STIC over diverse biomes and climates points to its potential to benefit future NASA and NOAA missions having thermal sensors, such as HyspIRI, GeoSTAR and GOES-R for mapping multi-scale lambda E and drought.

AB Accurate mapping of urban impervious surfaces is important but challenging due to the diversity of urban land covers. This study presents an effort to synergistically combine optical and SAR data to improve the mapping of impervious surfaces. Three pairs of optical and SAR images, Landsat ETM + and ENVISAT ASAR, SPOT-5 and ENVISAR ASAR, and SPOT-5 and TerraSAR-X, were selected in three study areas to validate the effectiveness of the methods in this study. The potential of Random Forest (RF) was evaluated with parameter optimization for combining the optical and SAR images. Experiment results demonstrate some interesting findings. Firstly, the built-in out-of-bag (OOB) error is insufficient for accuracy assessment, and an assessment with additional reference data is required for combining optical and SAR images using RF. Secondly, the optimal number of variables (m) for splitting the decision tree nodes in RF should be some different from the principles reported previously, and an empirical relationship was given for determining the parameter m. Thirdly, the optimal number of decision trees (T) in RF is not sensitive to the resolutions and sensor types of optical and SAR images, and the optimal T in this study is 20. Fourthly, the combined use of optical and SAR images by using RF is effective to improve the land cover classification and impervious surface estimation, by reducing the confusions between bright impervious surface and bare soil and dark impervious surface and bare soil, as well as shaded area and water surface. Even though the easily-confused land classes tend to be different in different resolutions of images, the effectiveness of combining optical and SAR images is consistent. This improvement is more significant when combing lower resolution optical and SAR images. The conclusions of this study could serve as an important reference for further applications of optical and SAR images, and as a potential reference for the applications of RF to the fusion of other multi-source remote sensing data.

AB Near-surface signatures of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) related to submerged bed forms displayed in visible band data gathered by space-borne imaging sensors are described. Detailed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data of vertical current velocity component, echo intensity, modulation of SSC and related oceanographic and meteorological observations in a tidal inlet of the North Sea have been analyzed. To understand the associated hydrodynamics of the optical imaging mechanism theoretical considerations based on the Navier Stokes and sediment continuity equations have been carried out. As a first approximation these theoretical results explain signatures of enhanced SSC of in situ measurements and analyzed space-borne images. Strong currents flowing over steep bottom topography are able to stir up the sediments to form both a general continuum of SSC and localized pulses of higher SSC in the vicinity of the causative bed feature itself. The "strain rate" equivalent to the current gradient is an important parameter describing near water surface oceanographic and meteorological phenomena in the visible and microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum observed by shore- and ship-based as well as air- and space-borne remote sensing systems. Significant disagreements between theoretical results of the "strain rate" generated by the surface current and in situ observations at the crests of submerged ridges and sand waves were identified. Possible explanations could be: first, the current velocity may not be barotropic near the crests of such bed forms and second, mass conservation may not only be maintained through an acceleration or deceleration of the flow. This implies that active up- and downwelling effects of the three-dimensional current field can also play a significant role for hydrodynamic interaction between current and underwater bed forms.

AB The effects of layers in the atmosphere with anomalously low moisture content on the accuracy of the sea-surface temperature (SST) derived from measurements of infrared radiometers on earth observation satellites are quantified using measurements taken from research cruises and numerical simulations. Radiosonde data from areas of the oceans that are seasonally affected by intrusions of dry air masses of continental origin were used with the Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM) to simulate brightness temperatures measured in MODIS bands 31 and 32 (at wavelengths of similar to 11 mu m and similar to 12 mu m). The radiosonde datasets contained profiles with and without a dry layer, representing the baseline (no dry layer aloft) and the anomalous conditions (dry layer present). MODIS SST retrieval algorithm versions 5 and 6 were applied to the simulated brightness temperatures to obtain the SST and the retrieval errors were examined. Whereas the average errors for the baseline 'no dry layer' conditions range between 029 and 0.72 K, in the case of very deep dry layers the errors can be >1 K. Simulations were also performed for atmospheric profiles that were created from the measured profiles by 'drying' layers at various altitudes. It was found that the retrieval errors 1) depend on the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, 2) change in a systematic way dependent on the presence and characteristics of a dry layer, 3) dry layers in the lower troposphere make the SST retrieval errors more positive, and dry layers in the upper troposphere tend to introduce SST retrieval errors that are more negative.

AB Soil moisture from ERA-Land, a revised version of the land surface components of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), is used to monitor at a global scale the consistency of a new microwave based multi-satellite surface soil moisture date set (SM-MW) over multi-decadal time period (1980-2010). ERA-Land results from Land Surface Model simulations forced by high quality atmospheric forcing data. It was shown to adequately capture the temporal dynamic of soil moisture. ERA-land's large scale nature, frozen configuration, global availability and ability to accurately represent soil moisture variability make it suitable to complement typical validation approaches of soil moisture from remote sensing based on ground measurements. Considering locations that have significant correlations for each 3-year sub periods within 1980-2010, averaged soil moisture correlations of SM-MW with ERA-Land (at 95% Confidence Interval) are increasing steadily from 1986 to 2010 (from 0.52 +/- 0.10, to 0.66 +/- 0.04). The lower correlations mirror the periods where only passive microwave from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image (SSM/I Ku band at 19.3 GHz) sensor was used, highlighting the importance of multi-sensor capabilities. Overall SM-MW is relatively stable over time with respect to ERA-Land. Good agreement is obtained in semi-arid areas, whilst the tropics and high latitudes (and altitudes) present lower correlations values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on the application of fire severity studies describing the immediate post-fire spectral responses of fire affected vegetation and substrates, to remotely sensed mapping of fire affected tropical savanna vegetation in northern Australia. Hyperspectral data were collected from a helicopter coincident with accurately located sites where detailed ground sampling was undertaken based on adaptation of standard methods such as the GeoCBI. Ground sampling revealed the importance of models that characterise both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation including scorched foliage. The proportion of charred material was not significantly correlated with fire severity categories. Models were assessed particularly in relation to spectral bands of the MODIS sensor given its high observation frequency and global application in fire detection and mapping studies. Significant and inverse fire severity relationships were observed with the near infrared and two short wave infrared bands, demonstrating support for a model like the widely used differenced normalised burn ratio (Delta NBR). However, model assessment using Akaike's Information Criteria suggests the most parsimonious model is the pre- and post-fire difference in MODIS channel 6 (1628-1652 nm). The resultant models have direct application in fire severity mapping products for fire-prone tropical savanna vegetation in northern Australia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Disturbance Index (DI) proposed by Healey et al. (2005) has been used successfully to locate and monitor disturbances by various researchers and in many locations. Here, a modification of the DI is presented that adapts it to local conditions by weighting each of its input components to maximize the difference between disturbed and undisturbed forest canopy. The weights reduce the effects of background variation while emphasizing the variation caused by disturbance. The weighted DI was applied to the severe insect defoliation of 2006 in the Apostle Island National Lakeshore with promising results. A supervised maximum likelihood thematic map based on the unweighted DI was 59% accurate and one based on the weighted DI was 62%. A classification with only two classes, defoliated and not defoliated, was also more accurate when based upon the weighted DI (77% verses 69%). In nearly all instances, the user's and producer's accuracies were significantly higher for the weighted DI image, suggesting that weighting the DI to fit local conditions is a superior approach, at least for small-area studies.

AB Passive microwave (PM) remote sensing measurements are routinely utilized to estimate snow depth and water equivalent (SWE). Both vegetation and physical snowpack variables including snowpack grain size, snow depth, and stratigraphy influence the observed brightness temperature. The natural heterogeneity of snowpack and vegetation states within the microwave footprint occurs at spatial scales shorter than PM observation scales. In this study, we analyze the relationship between PM brightness temperature measurements and the heterogeneity of snowpack and vegetation. Specifically, we explore the question of whether PM observations are sensitive to changes in snow depth even given sub-pixel variability in snow and vegetation. To examine this question, densely sampled, spatially distributed in situ snow properties from multiple study areas made during the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) are employed in a forward modeling scheme to study the effect of highly variable snow and vegetation properties on the observed PM measurement.
   In all test cases, this study finds that there exists sensitivity of microwave brightness temperature (T-b) to total snow depth contained within the measurement footprint, regardless of the heterogeneous nature of snow pack properties. Across three study areas, T-b decreases by 23-35 K as depth increased up to the signal saturation depth, which ranged from 70 to 120 cm. With regard to vegetation sensitivity, forest fractions (F) as little as 0.2 can modify the PM measurement by up to 10 K, and F greater than 0.6 mask virtually all of the microwave signal attributable to snow. Finally, with respect to the measurement scale, our results indicate that the scale at which the PM measurement is made does not affect the sensitivity of the T-b to mean snow depth, to the scale (1 km) examined herein.

AB The absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (a(PHY)(gimel)), non-algal particles (NAP) (a(NAP)(gimel)) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (a(CDOM)(gimel)) were investigated and parameterized in the southeastern Bering Sea during July 2008. The absorption coefficients were well structured with respect to hydrographic and biogeochemical characteristics of the shelf. The highest values of a(PHY)(443) were observed offshore and the lowest values of a(PHY)(443) were found in the coastal domain, a low productivity region associated with limited macronutrients. Values of a(DG)(gimel) a(CDOM)(gimel) + a(NAP)(gimel)) revealed an east west gradient pattern with higher values in the coastal domain, and lower values in the outer domain. Lower chlorophyll specific a(PHY)(gimel) (a*(PHY)(gimel)) observed relative to middle and lower latitude waters indicated a change in pigment composition and/or package effect, which was consistent with phytoplankton community structure. a(CDOM)(gimel) was the dominant light absorbing coefficient at all wavelengths examined except at 676 nm. Modeling of remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs(gimel)) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(gimel)) from inherent optical properties revealed the strong influence of a(CDOM)(gimel) on R-rs(gimel) and K-d(gimel). Good optical closure was achieved between modeled and radiometer measured R-rs(gimel) and K-d(gimel) with average percent difference of less than 25% and 19% respectively, except at red wavelengths. The a(CDOM)(gimel) accounted for > 50% of K-d(gimel) which was vertically variable. Chlorophyll-a calculated by the NASA standard chlorophyll-a algorithm (OC4.v6) was overestimated due to higher a(CDOM)(gimel) and underestimated due to lower a*(PHY)(X) at low and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a, respectively.

AB Auxiliary information provided by airborne laser scanners (ALS) is expected to increase the accuracy of biomass estimation in large-scale forest surveys. Because acquisition of "wall-to-wall" ALS data over large areas is not economically feasible, a systematic sampling approach using ALS as a strip sampling tool was used to supplement a conventional field-based inventory in a large-scale biomass survey in Hedmark County (HC), Norway. However, the complexities of these surveys render prohibitive the analytical determination of the properties of the resulting estimators and of the estimators of their sampling variances. To overcome the problem, the statistical properties of the estimators were empirically investigated in this paper using simulated sampling from an artificial population. Through this approach, estimators with desirable properties can be identified and used for inference in real applications. By combining biomass estimates from Norwegian National Forest Inventory plots in HC ALS measurements and Landsat 5 TM imagery, an artificial population at the scale of HC was created. Using this artificial population as "ground-truth", we demonstrate how simulated sampling can be used for assessing the statistical properties of regression estimators and of their variance estimators under two-phase post-stratified systematic sampling (SYS) and simple random sampling without replacement (SRSwoR) designs, considering design- and model-dependent inferential frameworks. The results were assessed using a purely ground-based systematic design with a Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator as benchmark. The real overall precision of the ALS-aided systematic survey was nearly five times overestimated when using the design-based variance estimators developed for SRSwoR, while under model-dependent inference the overestimation of the real standard errors was around 40%. Compared to ground-based inventory, the estimated standard errors of the systematic ALS survey doubled while in reality the standard errors were 55% lower. Using successive differences variance estimators greatly improved the precision of the systematic ALS-aided survey and produced valid 95% confidence intervals under the design-based inference. The most satisfactory results for the ALS-aided survey in terms of analytical variances occurred under design-based inference with successive difference variance estimator, closely followed by the model-dependent estimators. Using simulations, the cost efficiency of the ground based and ALS-aided surveys was assessed by evaluating accuracy against inventory cost for various sampling intensities. The results indicated that the ALS-aided surveys can be a cost-efficient alternative to traditional field inventories. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake caused catastrophic damage to coastal areas in northeastern Japan. It is quite difficult to obtain an immediate assessment of large-scale natural disasters by ground survey. Microwave remote sensing by airborne or spaceborne sensors is a suitable tool for monitoring near-real-time damage over large areas. However, it is not always possible to acquire datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions for the precise detection of large areas of damage; therefore, this study focuses on the application of fully polarimetric scattering observations for deduction of information about damaged areas. Earthquake-induced changes in the radar backscattering mechanism are investigated by polarimetric scattering mechanism indicators. In addition, a change detection technique using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) based thresholding approach is applied to various polarimetric features. Furthermore, a new polarimetric information fusion method based on the contextual Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed. The mapping accuracy for tsunami-swept urban areas can be improved by about 50% with significant reduction of false- and missed-alarm rates compared with the single-polarization SAR approach.

AB Improving regional estimates of actual evapotranspiration (lambda E) in water-limited regions located at climatic transition zones is critical. This study assesses an lambda E model (PT-JPL model) based on downscaling potential evapotranspiration according to multiple stresses at daily time-scale in two of these regions using MSG-SEVIRI (surface temperature and albedo) and MODIS products (NDVI, LAI and f(PAR)). An open woody savanna in the Sahel (Mali) and a Mediterranean grassland (Spain) were selected as test sites with Eddy Covariance data used for evaluation. The PT-JPL model was modified to run at a daily time step and the outputs from eight algorithms differing in the input variables and also in the formulation of the biophysical constraints (stresses) were compared with the lambda E from the Eddy Covariance. Model outputs were also compared with other modeling studies at similar global chyland ecosystems.
   The novelty of this paper is the computation of a key model parameter, the soil moisture constraint, relying on the concept of apparent thermal inertia (f(SM-ATI)) computed with surface temperature and albedo observations. Our results showed that f(SM-ATI) from both in-situ and satellite data produced satisfactory results for lambda E at the Sahelian savanna, comparable to parameterizations using field-measured Soil Water Content (SWC) with r(2) greater than 0.80. In the Mediterranean grasslands however, with much lower daily lambda E values, model results were not as good as in the Sahel (r(2)= 0.57-0.31) but still better than reported values from more complex models applied at the site such as the Two Source Model (TSM) or the Penman-Monteith Leuning model (PML).
   PT-JPL-daily model with a soil moisture constraint based on apparent thermal inertia, f(SM-ATI) offers great potential for regionalization as no field-calibrations are required and water vapor deficit estimates, required in the original version, are not necessary, being air temperature and the available energy (Rn-G) the only input variables required, apart from routinely available satellite products.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter highly responsive to surface energy fluxes and has become valuable to many disciplines. Prior to the advent of satellites, it was difficult to obtain LSTs over extensive areas. Even today, as a result of the resolution tradeoffs involved in using satellite data, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to acquire satellite LSTs with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This low resolution results in a thermal mixture effect, where the resolution cells are larger than the thermal elements. The disaggregation of remotely sensed land surface temperature (DLST), a research field that focuses on decomposing pixel-based temperatures, has been critical in related fields such as the surface flux downscaling, forest fire detection, and urban heat island monitoring and it is now growing rapidly as one of the thriving subbranches of thermal remote sensing. Various methods have been independently proposed for DLST in recent decades. However, this field is suffering a disorderly development. We thus critically investigate the interdisciplinary literature on DIST and identify the terms used to denote DLST in different disciplines. Two subtopics of DIST, thermal sharpening (TSP) and temperature unmixing (TUM), are identified as a dual pair of DLST because of their parallel areas of interest. Previous studieS are classified into different categories in chronological and taxonomic order. We formulate definitions of TSP, TUM, and DLST, and we then examine how TSP and TUM are connected to related fields in remote sensing. Based on the literature, we present the key issues related to DLST, the recommended DLST methods in different applications, and the caveats that must be considered in future work, including (1) four predetermined assumptions (i.e., additivity, separability, connectivity, and convertibility), (2) the utilization of diurnal thermal observations, and (3) the complication of aggregation. This overview will provide a generalization of TSP and TUM, promote the understanding of DLST, and guide future research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The synergistic use of active and passive remote sensing (i.e., data fusion) demonstrates the ability of spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for achieving the accuracy requirements of a global forest biomass mapping mission (+20 Mg ha(-1) or 20%, the greater of the two, for at least 80% of grid cells). A data fusion approach also provides a means to extend 3D information from discrete spaceborne LiDAR measurements of forest structure across scales much larger than that of the LiDAR footprint. For estimating biomass, these measurements mix a number of errors including those associated with LiDAR footprint sampling over regional-global extents. A general framework for mapping above ground live forest biomass density (AGB) with a data fusion approach is presented and verified using data from NASA field campaigns near Howland, ME, USA, to assess AGB and LiDAR sampling errors across a regionally representative landscape. We combined SAR and Landsat-derived optical (passive optical) image data to identify contiguous areas (>0.5 ha) that are relatively homogenous in remote sensing metrics (forest patches). We used this image-derived data with simulated spaceborne LiDAR derived from orbit and cloud cover simulations and airborne data from NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) to compute AGB and estimate LiDAR sampling error for forest patches and 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km grid cells. At both the patch and grid scales, we evaluated differences in AGB estimation and sampling error from the combined use of LiDAR with both SAR and passive optical and with either SAR or passive optical alone. First, this data fusion approach demonstrates that incorporating forest patches into the AGB mapping framework can provide sub-grid forest information for coarser grid-level AGB reporting. Second, a data fusion approach for estimating AGB using simulated spaceborne LiDAR with SAR and passive optical image combinations reduced forest AGB sampling errors 12%-38% from those where LiDAR is used with SAR or passive optical alone. In absolute terms, sampling errors were reduced from 14-40 Mg ha(-1) to 11-28 Mg ha(-1) across all grid scales and prediction methods, where minimum sampling errors were 11, 15, 18, and 22 Mg ha(-1) for 1 km, 500 m, 250 m, and 100 m grid scales, respectively. Third, spaceborne global scale accuracy requirements were achieved whereby at least 80% of the grid cells at 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km grid levels met AGB accuracy requirements using a combination of passive optical and SAR along with machine learning methods to predict vegetation structure metrics for forested areas without LiDAR samples. Finally, using either passive optical or SAR, accuracy requirements were met at the 500 m and 250 m grid level, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

   ATTENUATION
AB In early summer, a well-defined front forms at the southern boundary of Irish Sea between thermally stratified and tidally mixed waters. The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS) was used to predict the location of this front, and data from the MODIS Aqua sensor was used to derive a five-year time series of red-waveband remote sensing reflectance (R(rs)667) and sea surface temperature (SST) for two representative areas on either side of the frontal region. Pronounced annual cycles in R(rs)667 and SST were observed at both locations, with summer minima in R(rs)667 being roughly coincident with SST maxima. Previous studies have shown that R(rs)667 in the Irish Sea is mainly determined by near-surface concentrations of suspended mineral particles. The annual cycles in reflectance therefore indicate that vertical mixing of the water column in winter supplies fine particles to the surface layer which settle out in calmer summer conditions. While the temporal resolution achievable by remote sensing in a single year was limited by the high incidence of cloud cover, monthly averaged data for the whole five-year period revealed differences of the order of one month in the timing of the reflectance cycle on the mixed and stratified sides of the front. This difference produced transient patterns of reflectance in early summer (and occasionally in autumn) in which sharp contrasts coincided with the location of the tidal front predicted by the POLCOMS model. We conclude that optical remote sensing in shelf seas can provide information not only on changing concentrations of optically significant materials, but also on the location and timing of dynamical processes such as seasonal front formation, and note that such information is of potential value for tuning and validating numerical models of shelf sea ecosystems.

AB In this work, satellite maps of the urban heat island of Milan are produced using satellite-based infrared sensor data. For this aim, we developed suitable algorithms employing satellite brightness temperatures for the direct air temperature estimation 2 m above the surface (canopy layer), showing accuracies below 2 K. The air temperatures measured by ground-based weather stations were properly matched with brightness temperatures observed by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. In total, 931 daytime and nighttime scenes taken between 2007 and 2010 were processed. Analysis of the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) maps during summer months reveals an average heat island effect of 3-4 K during nighttime (with some peaks around 5 K) and a weak CLHI intensity during daytime. In addition, the satellite maps reveal a well defined island shape across the city center from June to September confirming that, in Milan, urban heating is not an occasional phenomenon. Furthermore, this study shows the utility of space missions to monitor the metropolis heat islands if they are able to provide nighttime observations when CLHI peaks are generally significant.

AB Surface reflectance time series measured from space borne instruments, such as the MODIS sensor, show an apparent high-frequency noise that limits their information content. A major contributor to this noise is the directional effect as the target reflectance varies with the observation geometry. The operational MODIS processing inverts the parameters of a BRDF model which are provided in the so-called MCD43C2 product with a frequency of (8 days)(-1). Recently, Vermote et al. (2009) suggested an alternative BRDF inversion method. A major assumption is that the BRDF model shape (i.e. the BRDF normalized by its overall amplitude) varies little throughout the year so that the two model parameters are linear functions of the NDVI. Consequently, a given target BRDF shape is described by four parameters (slope and intercept for the two NDVI-dependent parameters) rather than 2 parameters that change for each 8 days period. This method imposes additional constrain for the surface BRDF inversion.
   In this paper, we evaluate the performance of these two approaches for the correction of surface reflectance time series. We work at the 0.05 degrees (approximate to 5 km) resolution of the CMG grid and analyze a representative set of + 100 targets selected on the basis of the location of AERONET sites. The performance is quantified by the high-frequency noise in the corrected time series. We demonstrate that the performances of the two approaches are very similar. This result demonstrates that a simple four-parameter NDVI-scaled model performs as well as a more complex model with many more degrees of freedom. Besides, the four-parameter model, which is inverted on a given year, can be applied to the measurements of other years with a similar level of performance. Finally, a single "averaged" model can be applied to any target with a performance that is only slightly reduced compared to what is achieved with a model derived through a full inversion of the multi-temporal data.
   The proposed four-parameter BRDF model permits the reduction of noise in the reflectance time series by a factor of the order of three in the red and four in the near infrared. After correction, the reflectance time series are very clean, with an apparent noise that is approximate to 0.005 in the red band and 0.01 in the near infrared. The quality of the BRDF correction makes it possible to use the individual reflectance time-series at high temporal resolution, rather than indices based on their ratio, and thus retain more information about the vegetation dynamics.

AB During the past decade, procedures for forest biomass quantification from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data have been improved at a rapid pace. The scope of these methods ranges from simple regression between LiDAR-derived height metrics and biomass to methods including automated tree crown delineation, stochastic simulation, and machine learning approaches. This study compared the effectiveness of four modeling techniques-linear mixed-effects (LME) regression, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR). and Cubist-for estimating biomass in moderately dense forest (40-60% canopy closure) at both tree and plot levels. Tree crowns were delineated to provide model estimates of individual tree biomass.and investigate the effects of delineation accuracy on biomass modeling. We used our previously developed method (COTH) to delineate tree crowns. Results indicate that biomass estimation accuracy improves when modeled at the plot level and that SVR produced the most accurate biomass model (671 kg RMSE per 380 m(2) plot when forest plots were modeled as a collection of trees). All models provided similar results when estimating biomass at the individual tree level (505, 506, 457, and 502 kg RMSE per tree). We assessed the effect of crown delineation accuracy on biomass estimation by repeating the modeling procedures with manually delineated crowns as inputs. Results indicated that manually delineated crowns did not always produce superior biomass models and that the relationship between crown delineation accuracy and biomass estimation accuracy is complex and needs to be further investigated.

AB This paper demonstrates a simulation approach for testing the sensitivity of linear and non-parametric trend analysis methods applied to remotely sensed vegetation index data for the detection of land degradation. The intensity, rate and timing of reductions in seasonally-summed NDVI are systematically varied on sample data to simulate land degradation, after which the trend analysis was applied and its sensitivity evaluated. The study was based on a widely-used, 1 km(2) AVHRR data set for a test area in southern Africa. The trends were the most negative and significant when the degradation was introduced rapidly (over a period of 2-5 years) and in the middle of a 16-year time series. The seasonally-summed NDVI needs to be reduced by 30-40% before a significant negative linear slope or Kendall's correlation coefficient was apparent, given an underlying positive trend caused by rainfall. The seasonally-summed data were reordered to remove this underlying positive trend, before simulating degradation again. With no underlying positive trend present, degradation of 20% resulted in significant negative trends. Since areas widely agreed to be degraded show only 10-20% reductions compared to non-degraded areas, this raises doubts over the ability of trend analyses to detect degradation in a timely way in the presence of underling environmental trends. Residual Trends Analysis (RESTREND) was applied in an attempt to correct for variability and trends in rainfall. However, a simulated degradation intensity >= 20% caused the otherwise strong relationship between NDVI and rainfall to break down, making the RESTREND an unreliable indicator of land degradation. The results of such analyses will vary between different environments and need to be tested for sample areas across regions. Although the paper does not claim to solve the challenge of detecting land degradation amidst rainfall variability, it introduces a method of assessing the sensitivity of land degradation monitoring using remote sensing data.

AB The political breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 provides a rare case of drastic changes in social and economic conditions, and as such a great opportunity to investigate the impacts of socioeconomic changes on the rates and patterns of forest harvest and regrowth. Our goal was to characterize forest-cover changes in the temperate zone of European Russia between 1985 and 2010 in 5-year increments using a stratified random sample of 12 Landsat footprints. We used Support Vector. Machines and post-classification comparison to monitor forest area, disturbance and reforestation. Where image availability was sub-optimal, we tested whether winter images help to improve classification accuracy. Our approach yielded accurate mono-temporal maps (on average > 95% overall accuracy), and change maps (on average 93.5%). The additional use of winter imagery improved classification accuracy by about 2%. Our results suggest that Russia's temperate forests underwent substantial changes during the observed period. Overall, forested areas increased by 4.5%, but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest area between 1990 and 1995 (- 1%) was followed by an increase in overall forest area in recent years (+ 1.4%, 2005-2010), possibly caused in part by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands. Disturbances varied greatly among administrative regions, suggesting that differences in socioeconomic conditions strongly influence disturbance rates. While portions of Russia's temperate forests experienced high disturbance rates, overall forest area is expanding. Our use of a stratified random sample of Landsat footprints, and of summer and winter images, allowed us to characterize forest dynamics across a large region over a long time period, emphasizing the value of winter imagery in the free Landsat archives, especially for study areas where data availability is limited.

AB Temperature/emissivity estimation from remotely measured radiances generally assumes that scene elements represented by pixels in fact have a single emissivity spectrum and are isothermal. Thus, estimated temperatures and emissivities are the effective values that would be found if these simplified assumptions were met. In reality, the physical scene is neither homogeneous nor isothermal, and the effective values are not strictly representative of it. How much in error are they? In order to estimate this, a radiosity model used for predicting effective emissivity spectra and radiant temperatures for rough surfaces has been developed. Here we compare the computer model results to analytic model results in order to verify that the computer model is working properly. We validate the model against spectra measured in the field using a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer and a centimeter-scale DTM of the test scene acquired using a tripod-based LiDAR. The discrepancies between analytical and modeled values are less than 0.01%. Modeled emissivity spectra deviate from the measured by no more than 0.015 emissivity units. Modeled kinetic temperature on average deviates from measured by less than 1 K over the course of a day. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel method for estimating the surface horizontal velocity on ice shelves using laser altimetry data from the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003-2009). The method matches undulations measured at crossover points between successive campaigns. Elevation measurements are first relocated into a time-varying (moving) coordinate system using an initial velocity (e.g., from VELMAP), and then crossover height differences are minimized with an adjustment vector. Errors in geolocation of the ICESat tracks result in some error in the adjustment vectors, but these are small relative to the velocity adjustment for fast-moving ice shelves. We use the algorithm to estimate changes in the ice velocity of Ross Ice Shelf between an earlier mapping (from VELMAP) and the ICESat period. The new velocity field is compared with velocities from in situ measurements and satellite radar interferometry. The slowdown of 98 +/- 34 m yr(-1) (similar to 23%) is observed in the ice shelf downstream of Whillans Ice Stream, and the deceleration rate is 3.1 +/- 1.1 m yr(-2) during last three decades. The method can be expanded to the simultaneous mapping of ice horizontal velocity, ice thickness change, and surface deformation for Antarctic ice shelves as well as a more accurate mapping using future ICESat-2 measurements.

AB Forest understory communities are important components in forest ecosystems providing wildlife habitat and influencing nutrient cycling, fuel loadings, fire behavior and tree species composition over time. One of the most widely utilized understory component metrics is understory vegetation cover, often used as a measure of vegetation abundance. To date. understory vegetation cover estimation and prediction has proven to be inherently difficult using traditional explanatory variables such as: leaf area index, basal area, slope, and aspect. We introduce airborne lidar-derived metrics into the modeling framework for understory vegetation cover. A new airborne lidar metric, understory lidar cover density, created by filtering understory lidar points using intensity values increased traditional explanatory power from non-lidar understory vegetation cover estimation models (non-lidar R-2-values: 0.2-0.45 vs. lidar R-2-values: 0.7-0.8). Beta regression, a relatively new modeling technique for this type of data, was compared with a traditional weighted linear regression model using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Both models provided similar understory vegetation cover accuracies (+/- 22%) and biases (similar to 0%) using 40.5 m(2) circular plots (n=154). The method presented in this paper provides the ability to accurately obtain census understory vegetation cover information at fine spatial resolutions over a broad range of stand conditions for the interior ponderosa pine forest type. Additional model enhancement and the extension of the method into other forest types warrant further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On active glacial floodplains, streams sourced from upwelling groundwater are characterised by significantly higher biodiversity than surface-fed streams. However the ecological significance of these habitats at a landscape scale has not yet been determined. A remote-sensing model was developed to identify the frequency and distribution of groundwater upwellings in remote Arctic and alpine areas, using freely available satellite imagery. Field research has established that groundwater upwellings provide stable environments (reduced variability in flow and temperature regimes, and reduced channel slope and bed movement), with high water tables, supporting vegetation growth on otherwise barren glacial floodplains. Upwellings are therefore associated with characteristic isolated patches of dense vegetation. The model uses this characteristic profiling of groundwater upwellings in a four-step process; 1) removing temporal variance from the images; 2) identifying and isolating glacial floodplains from the satellite data, 3) removing snow and ice 4) identifying vegetation density (associated with sites of groundwater upwelling) within the floodplains. The model was calibrated in Denali National Park, and validated in Wrangell St. Elias National Park; the extent of groundwater-fed areas was calculated and compared between sites for the first time. Model accuracy during calibration was 94%, and was marginally lower during validation (88%). The high accuracy of the model supports the wider applicability of site-specific relationships determined thus far. In each region, groundwater upwellings contributed to similar to 40% of the total riverine habitat within glacial floodplains; in combination with their high biodiversity this suggests they are ecologically significant. This model facilitates study site location, and represents a significant development in macroscale studies of groundwater upwellings in glacierised catchments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Validation is an important task in the development of satellite remote sensing products. Strategies for validation vary depending on the nature of the products. The validation process of the flood and standing water product (FSW) for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - R series (GOES-R) is presented in this paper. A major challenge in the validation of the FSW product is the lack of ground truth flood maps and similar reference products from other satellite systems and other sources. To overcome this limitation, a two-level validation scheme for the FSW product is developed using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy. In the first level, gauging station data collected by the US. Geological Survey (USGS) are employed as ground truth flood point information on local scales to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for flood detection. Gauging station data collected during 34 flood cases that occurred in 2010 and 2011 in the continental US were validated and assessed according to the rate of correct detection. Results showed that 79.71% of flooding stations were accurately detected from the MODIS 1 km images by the proposed FSW algorithm. In the second level of the validation. FSW detection results using the proposed algorithm were compared to the reference flood maps, which were generated by a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification followed by human interpretation and editing. Flood detection accuracies for three major flood events occurred in Asia and Australia in 2010 were evaluated. Confusion matrices were employed as the accuracy measurement for the second level of the validation. Commission errors for the three flood cases were 6.75%, 13.45% and 21.45%, respectively. Omission errors of flood pixels varied between 9.58% and 19.61%. The validation results suggest that the employed FSW algorithm is capable of producing flood and standing water maps in an operational environment, and it meets the required accuracy and execution time of the product.

AB We provide a comprehensive overview of water constituent retrieval algorithms and underlying definitions and models for optically deep and complex (i.e. case 2) waters using earth observation data. The performance of constituent retrieval algorithms is assessed based on matchup validation experiments published between January 2006 and May 2011. Validation practices range from singular vicarious calibration experiments to comparisons using extensive in situ time series. Band arithmetic and spectral inversion algorithms for all water types are classified using a method based scheme that supports the interpretation of algorithm validity ranges. Based on these ranges we discuss groups of similar algorithms in view of their strengths and weaknesses. Such quantitative literature analysis reveals clear application boundaries. With regard to chlorophyll retrieval, validation of blue-green band ratios in coastal waters is limited to oligotrophic, predominantly ocean waters, while red-NIR ratios apply only at more than 10 mg/m(3). Spectral inversion techniques although not validated to the same extent - are necessary to cover all other conditions. Suspended matter retrieval is the least critical, as long as the wavelengths used in empirical models are increased with concentrations. The retrieval of dissolved organic matter however remains relatively inaccurate and inconsistent, with large differences in the accuracy of comparable methods in similar validation experiments. We conclude that substantial progress has been made in understanding and improving retrieval of constituents in optically deep and complex waters, enabling specific solutions to almost any type of optically complex water. Further validation and intercomparison of spectral inversion procedures are however needed to learn if solutions with a larger validity range are feasible. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Different sources of atmospheric water vapor and temperature profiles were used with a radiative transfer model for retrieving land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared remote sensing data with the so-called single channel (SC) method. Retrieved LSTs were compared to concurrent ground measurements over homogeneous rice fields to assess the accuracy of the atmospheric profiles. These included radiosonde balloons launched at the test site near-concurrently to satellite overpasses, re-analysis profiles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and satellite sounder products from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; MOD07 product). SC LSTs were computed for Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER). MODIS, and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR). Results show that radiosonde profiles provided the best agreement between ground-measured and satellite-derived LSTs, with root mean square difference (RMSD) better than 1.0 K and biases within +/- 0.5 K for most of the cases. As an alternative to radiosonde profiles. NCEP and MOD07 data yielded reasonable results with RMSDs around 1.0 K, although LSTs derived from MOD07 profiles showed a slight overestimation (0.5 to 1.0 K) of the ground LSTs. AIRS profiles usually underestimated the ground LSTs by 1 to 2 K, probably due to the large temporal gap (2-3 h) with the other satellite measurements. We propose a test to assess the suitability of atmospheric profiles applicable to sensors with bands at 11 and 12 mu m in the split-window. So this test plus the SC method may be called split-window SC algorithm, being significantly different from the simple SC method. It implies the calculation of the difference between the LST derived from both bands (T-ig-T-jg), which should be close to zero if the atmospheric profile is accurate and the surface emissivity is well known. A small range of T-ig-T-jg values around zero can be set for which the LST derived at 11 mu m is accurate. Using only the profiles passing the test, LSTs derived from MODIS band 31 agreed with the ground data with a mean bias of -0.1 K (ground minus satellite) and RMSD of 0.6 K, while AATSR band at 11 mu m yielded a -0.1 K bias and RMSD = 0.5 K.

AB Gap jet characteristics were analyzed in the lee of the Philippine Archipelago during the 2004-2009 winter monsoon seasons (November-March) using wind fields derived from ENVISAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Jet characteristics were derived for the Philippine Island gap jets and compared to those from theoretical literature and experimental studies. It was found that 18 of 31 jets characterized from 13 SAR images followed the defined power laws, or classic case, and were similar to the defined scale equations. The remaining 13 jets did not follow the classic case and resulted from jet interaction with islands, adjacent jets, and variable atmospheric conditions. These non-classic jets were grouped based upon similarities and referred to as decreasing, increasing, and reverse classic cases. Distinct deviations from the classic case included downstream increases in velocity and decreases in jet width. It was found that the orientation of the wind field relative to topography significantly impacted jet classification, and thereby made it difficult to characterize jets by region. For all 31 jets, the initial jet width dictated the distance at which a jet became self-similar, wherein a larger initial jet width required a greater distance for self-similarity.

AB The remote detection of water stress in a citrus orchard was investigated using leaf-level measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and Photochemical Reflectance Index (Pm) data, seasonal time-series of crown temperature and PRI, and high-resolution airborne imagery. The work was conducted in an orchard where a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) experiment generated a gradient in water stress levels. Stomatal conductance (Gs) and water potential (Psi) were measured over the season on each treatment block The airborne data consisted on thermal and hyperspectral imagery acquired at the time of maximum stress differences among treatments, prior to the re-watering phase, using a miniaturized thermal camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The hyperspectral imagery was acquired at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400-885 nm spectral range at 6.4 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution and 1.85 nm sampling interval, enabling the identification of pure crowns for extracting radiance and reflectance hyperspectral spectra from each tree. The FluorMOD model was used to investigate the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence by applying the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle using three spectral bands (FLD3), which demonstrated that fluorescence retrieval was feasible with the configuration of the UAV micro-hyperspectral instrument flown over the orchard. Results demonstrated the link between seasonal PRI and crown temperature acquired from instrumented trees and field measurements of stomatal conductance and water potential. The sensitivity of PRI and Tc-Ta time-series to water stress levels demonstrated a time delay of PRI vs Tc-Ta during the recovery phase after re-watering started. At the time of the maximum stress difference among treatment blocks, the airborne imagery acquired from the UAV platform demonstrated that the crown temperature yielded the best coefficient of determination for Gs (r(2) = 0.78; p<0.05) and Psi (r(2) = 0.34; p<0.001). Among the narrow-band indices calculated, the PRI515 index (reference band=515 nm) obtained better results than PRI570, with r(2) = 0.59 (p<0.01) for Gs, and r(2) = 0.38 (p<0.001) for Psi. The BGl1 index calculated from the blue (R-400) and green (R-550) bands resulted on the highest significance levels (p<0.001) for both Gs (r(2) = 0.62) and Psi (r(2) = 0.49). Out of the structural indices assessed, RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI showed greater sensitivity for Gs (r(2) = 0.6: p <0.01) and Psi (p <0.001) than NDVI. Chlorophyll fluorescence calculated from the micro-hyperspectral imagery with the FLD3 method tracked stress levels, obtaining r(2) = 0.67 (p<0.05) with stomatal conductance, and r(2) = 0.66 (p<0.001) with water potential. The work presented in this manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of thermal, narrow-band indices and fluorescence retrievals obtained from a micro-hyperspectral imager and a light-weight thermal camera on board small UAV platforms for stress detection in a heterogeneous tree canopy where very high resolution is required.

AB One objective of the sea surface temperature (SST) component of the Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security (GMES) MERSEA project was to define the combined use of all SST products in an optimal interpolation scheme. Most SST products are now available in a common format but show regional differences between datasets that must be removed before use. We have defined a simple method using the SST derived from the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard the European Space Agency (ESA) ENVISAT platform as a common reference for all SST products. This method is based on an analysis of the differences between a given dataset and the AATSR SST over the 10 preceding days and over a 5 degrees regular grid. These space-time characteristics have been defined empirically in a preliminary experiment. The efficiency of the method has been evaluated on a daily basis for a two year period (2007-2008) based on two SST products from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT): the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) derived SST over the Atlantic and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST derived at fine scale over the North-East Atlantic. They have been compared to the AATSR and buoy SSTs and to the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) AVHRR global SST product. The SEVIRI SST bias, which was reduced from -0.40 K to -0.02 K for the 0-20 N latitude band by this approach provides a good example of the performance of the method. Reductions in the bias are also demonstrated for the North Atlantic, where cloudiness related problems were expected. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large inland water bodies constituting lakes, reservoirs and inland-seas are excellent proxy indicators for climate change. Using thermal infrared satellite data, a recent study found that a global set of inland water bodies showed significant warming in seasonal nighttime lake Surface Water Temperatures (LSWTs) between 1985 and 2009. Split-window land surface temperature (LST) retrievals are typically tuned for a broad range of land surface emissivities and global atmospheric conditions, and are not optimized for inland water body surfaces, whereas split-window sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are only tuned for a single emissivity (water), but over ocean atmospheres. Over inland water bodies, these two approaches can lead to region dependent errors in LSWTs, spurious trends, and inconsistencies between sensors in the long-term temperature record of inland water bodies. To address this issue, the primary goal of this paper was to develop a methodology for deriving a set of optimized split-window coefficients, individually tuned for the regional atmospheric conditions of 169 globally distributed, saline and freshwater inland water bodies from multiple satellite sensors including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua; Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) including ATSR-1, ATSR-2, AATSR; and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR-3). The new Inland Water-body Surface Temperature (IWbST) v1.0 algorithm was applied to Terra MODIS and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data and validated with in situ water temperature data from sites with widely contrasting atmospheric conditions: Lake Tahoe in California/Nevada, a high-elevation cool and dry site, and the Salton Sea in California, a low-elevation warm and humid site. Analysis showed improved accuracy in LSWTs in terms of bias and RMSE when compared to the standard MODIS LST and AATSR SST products. For example, the IWbST RMSE at Salton Sea was reduced by 0.4 K when compared to the operational MODIS product. For the AATSR data, the IWbST RMSE was reduced by 036 K at Tahoe and 0.29 K at Salton Sea when compared to results obtained using the operational AATSR split-window coefficients. The IWbST improvements are significant in relation to the current accuracy of water temperature retrievals from space (<0.5 K), and will enable the derivation of long-term, accurate LSWFs consistently across multiple sensors for climate studies.

AB Changes in the structural state of forests of the semi-arid U.S.A., such as an increase in tree density, are widely believed to be leading to an ecological crisis, but accurate methods of quantifying forest density and configuration are lacking at landscape scales. An individual tree canopy (ITC) method based on aerial LiDAR has been developed to assess forest structure by estimating the density and spatial configuration of trees in four different height classes. The method has been tested against field measured forest inventory data from two geographically distinct forests with independent LiDAR acquisitions. The results show two distinct patterns: accurate, unbiased density estimates for trees taller than 20 m, and underestimation of density in trees less than 20 m tall. The underestimation of smaller trees is suggested to be a limitation of LiDAR remote sensing. Ecological applications of the method are demonstrated through landscape metrics analysis of density and configuration rasters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A high resolution urban thermal sharpener (HUTS) was developed that increases the resolution of thermal infrared (TIR) data to that of visible and near infrared (VNIR) data by fitting the relationship between radiometric surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo (a). HUTS was applied to TIR data aggregated to 90 m to represent a satellite acquired dataset and validated against the measured 10 m data from an aircraft over San Juan, Puerto Rico. HUTS sharpening reduced the root mean square error of surface temperature at the high resolution by 17% compared to no sharpening and outperformed other sharpening methods. HUTS is proposed as a useful tool to study urban meteorology and climatology at the microscale using ASTER satellite data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forage quality within an African savanna depends upon limiting nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and nutrients that constrain the intake rates (non-digestible fibre) of herbivores. These forage quality nutrients are particularly crucial in the dry season when concentrations of limiting nutrients decline and non-digestible fibres increase. Using artificial neural networks we test the ability of a new imaging spectrometer (CAO Alpha sensor), both alone and in combination with ancillary data, to map quantities of grass forage nutrients in the early dry season within an African savanna. Respectively 65%, 57% and 41%, of the variance in fibre, phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were explained. We found that all grass forage nutrients show response to fire and soil. Principal component analysis, not only reduced image dimensionality, but was a useful method for removing cross-track illumination effects in the CAO imagery. To further improve the mapping of forage nutrients in the dry season we suggest that spectra within the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region, or additional relevant ancillary data, are required.

AB The southwestern area of Spain, by its geographical and climatological conditions, is a key location for the characterization of atmospheric aerosol properties. The present study is aimed at evaluating the reliability of satellite-based aerosol climatologies, as inferred from level 2 standard aerosol products such as the Terra-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer) MODO4 aerosol product, with an application over this region during the period 2000-2008.
   This evaluation is carried out by means of comparison with ground-based data from the AERONET station of El Arenosillo (Spain, 37.1N, 6.7W), which has been providing continuous data since 2000. The focus of this paper is the climatology of two aerosol optical parameters: the aerosol optical depth (ADD) and the Angstrom exponent.
   AERONET ground-based measurements give an annual mean value of 0.16 +/- 0.12 and a median of 0.12 for the AOD, and a mean value of 1.20 +/- 0.47 for the Angstrom exponent The seasonal pattern is characterized by two maxima, the most important maximum occurs in summer months, and the other one in late-winter/early-spring. Lowest values appear in fall and winter, however, a local minimum is observed in July which is only detected with the long-term data series.
   The mean climatological AOD based on AERONET exhibits complex seasonal patterns (i.e. with multiple local extrema), which are not always captured by MODIS-based climatology. MODIS only reproduces low values of the AOD in winter and high values in summer, as well as the local minimum of July which is sharper when using over-land retrievals. The time series of the AOD retrieved from MODIS both over land and ocean are in relatively good agreement with the ground-based measurements, with a monthly overestimation of about 30% on average, and higher differences in spring. Seasonal patterns from MODIS are better reproduced over land than over ocean. The agreement between daily AERONET and MODIS, as assessed by linear regression, gives correlation coefficients above 80% and an intercept bias below 0.03. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been applied on a combination of monthly GRACE satellite solutions computed from official providers (CSR, JPL and GFZ), to separate useful geophysical signals from important striping undulations. We pre-filtered the raw GRACE Level-2 solutions using Gaussian filters of 300, 400, 500-km of radius to verify the non-Gaussianity condition which is necessary to apply the ICA. This linear inverse approach ensures to separate components of the observed gravity field which are statistically independent. The most energetic component found by ICA corresponds mainly to the contribution of continental water mass change. Series of ICA-estimated global maps of continental water storage have been produced over 08/2002-07/2009. Our ICA estimates were compared with the solutions obtained using other post-processing of GRACE Level-2 data, such as destriping and Gaussian filtering, at global and basin scales. Besides, they have been validated with in situ measurements in the Murray-Darling Basin. Our computed ICA grids are consistent with the different approaches. Moreover, the ICA-derived time series of water masses showed less north-south spurious gravity signals and improved filtering of unrealistic hydrological features at the basin-scale compared with solutions obtained using other filtering methods.

AB Enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper troposphere (UT) is shown by nearly collocated Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements near and down-wind from the known wildfire region of SE Australia from December 12th-19th, 2006. Enhanced ultraviolet (UV) aerosol index (Al) derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (ON) measurements correlates with these high CO concentrations. The Hybrid Single Particle Langrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model back trajectories trace selected air parcels, where TES observes enhanced CO in the upper and lower troposphere, to the SE Australia fire region as their initial location. Simultaneously, they show a lack of vertical advection along their tracks. TES retrieved CO vertical profiles in the higher and lower southern latitudes are examined together with the averaging kernels and show that TES CO retrievals are most sensitive at approximately 300-400 hPa. The enhanced CO observed by TES in the upper (215 hPa) and lower (681 hPa) troposphere are, therefore, influenced by mid-tropospheric CO. CEOS-Chem model simulations with an 8-day emission inventory, as the wildfire source over Australia, are sampled to the TES/MLS observation times and locations. These simulations only show CO enhancements in the lower troposphere near and down-wind from the wildfire region of SE Australia with drastic underestimates of UT CO plumes. Although CloudSat along-track ice-water content curtains are examined to see whether possible vertical convection events can explain the high UT CO values, sparse observations of collocated Aura CO and CloudSat along-track ice-water content measurements for the single event precludes any conclusive correlation. Vertical convection that uplifts the fire-induced CO (i.e., most notably referred to as pyro-cumulonimbus (pyroCb)) may provide an explanation for the incongruence between these simulations and the TES/MLS observations of enhanced CO in the UT.

AB A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes phenological change amidst background variation. The majority of phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST, Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes. This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series. Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series. Longterm phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not necessarily limited to NDVI. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can successfully detect phase variations related to the water level changes in wetlands and produce spatially detailed high-resolution maps of water level changes. Despite the vast details, the usefulness of the wetland InSAR observations is rather limited, because hydrologists and water resources managers need information on absolute water level values and not on relative water level changes. We present an InSAR technique called Small Temporal Baseline Subset (STBAS) for monitoring absolute water level time series using radar interferograms acquired successively over wetlands. The method uses stage (water level) observation for calibrating the relative InSAR observations and tying them to the stage's vertical datum. We tested the STBAS technique with two-year long Radarsat-1 data acquired during 2006-2008 over the Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA1) in the Everglades wetlands, south Florida (USA). The InSAR-derived water level data were calibrated using 13 stage stations located in the study area to generate 28 successive high spatial resolution maps (50 m pixel resolution) of absolute water levels. We evaluate the quality of the STBAS technique using a root mean square error (RMSE) criterion of the difference between InSAR observations and stage measurements. The average RMSE is 6.6 cm, which provides an uncertainty estimation of the STBAS technique to monitor absolute water levels. About half of the uncertainties are attributed to the accuracy of the InSAR technique to detect relative water levels. The other half reflects uncertainties derived from tying the relative levels to the stage stations' datum. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The growth of mass populations of toxin-producing cyanobacteria is a serious concern for the ecological status of inland waterbodies and for human and animal health. In this study we examined the performance of four semi-analytical algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and phycocyanin (C-PC) from data acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI-2) and the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) Eagle sensor. The retrieval accuracies of the semi-analytical models were compared to those returned by optimally calibrated empirical band-ratio algorithms. The best-performing algorithm for the retrieval of Chl a was an empirical band-ratio model based on a quadratic function of the ratio of reflectance at 710 and 670 nm (R-2 = 0.832; RMSE =29.8%). However, this model only provided a marginally better retrieval than the best semi-analytical algorithm. The best-performing model for the retrieval of C-PC was a semi-analytical nested band-ratio model (R-2 = 0.984; RMSE = 3.98 mg m(-3)). The concentrations of C-PC retrieved using the semi-analytical model were correlated with cyanobacterial cell numbers (R-2 = 0.380) and the particulate and total (particulate plus dissolved) pools of microcystins (R-2 = 0.858 and 0.896 respectively). Importantly, both the empirical and semi-analytical algorithms were able to retrieve the concentration of C-PC at cyanobacterial cell concentrations below current warning thresholds for cyanobacteria in waterbodies. This demonstrates the potential of remote sensing to contribute to early-warning detection and monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms for human health protection at regional and global scales.

AB Accurate estimation of shortwave net radiation (S-n) at a high spatial resolution is critical for regional and global land surface models. Current surface radiation budget products have fine temporal resolutions, but only coarse spatial resolutions that are not suitable for land applications. A hybrid algorithm was developed in this study to estimate S-n from MODIS data under both clear and cloudy sky conditions without requiring coarser resolution ancillary data. This algorithm was validated using ground measurements at seven sites of the SURFace RADiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) in the United States. Instantaneous S-n estimated by this method was also compared with GEWEX/SRB and ISCCP data, and other methods. The results indicate that our algorithm can produce S-n at 1-km resolution with improved accuracy and is easily implemented to generate operational global products. Daily integrated S-n is estimated at 1-km resolution using instantaneous S-n. These finer spatial resolution datasets capture the specific sequence of the redistribution of the available energy at the Earth's surface. Therefore, they support recent high resolution land surface models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB National parks in western Canada experience midland fire events at differing frequencies, intensities, and burn seventies These episodic disturbances have varying implications for various biotic and abiotic processes and patterns To predict burn severity, the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm, derived from Landsat imagery, has been used extensively throughout the midland fire community. In Canada, few accuracy assessments have been undertaken to compare the accuracy of the dNBR algorithm to its relative form (RdNBR). To investigate the accuracies of these two algorithms in Canada's National Parks, we hypothesized that RdNBR would outperform dNBR in two specific applications based on former research by Miller and Thode (2007) The first was the capacity of the RdNBR to produce more accurate results than dNBR over a wide range of fires and secondly in pre-fire landscapes with low canopy closure and high heterogeneity. To investigate these questions, dNBR and RdNBR indices were extracted from Landsat imagery and compared to the measurements of the Composite Burn Index (Key & Benson, 2006). Following this, best fit models were developed and statistically tested at the individual, regional, overall, and vegetative levels We then developed confusion matrices to assess the relative strength and weakness of each model. As an additional means of comparing model accuracy, we tested Hall et al 's (2008) non-linear model in estimating burn severity for the study's western boreal region and individual fires The results indicate that across all fires, the RdNBR-derived model did not estimate burn severity more accurately than dNBR (65.2% versus 70.2% classification accuracy, respectively) nor in the heterogeneous and low canopy cover landscapes. In addition, we conclude that RdNBR is no more effective than dNBR at the regional, individual, and fine-scale vegetation levels. The Hall et al. (2008) model was found to estimate burn severity in the western boreal region with a higher overall kappa than both the dNBR and RdNBR study models The results herein support the continued research and pursuit of developing regional remote sensing derived models in western Canada.

AB The simulation of gross primary production (GPP) at various spatial and temporal scales remains a major challenge for quantifying the global carbon cycle. We developed a light use efficiency model, called EC-LUE, driven by only four variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, and the Bowen ratio of sensible to latent heat flux. The EC-LUE model may have the most potential to adequately address the spatial and temporal dynamics of GPP because its parameters (i.e., the potential light use efficiency and optimal plant growth temperature) are invariant across the various land cover types. However, the application of the previous EC-LUE model was hampered by poor prediction of Bowen ratio at the large spatial scale. In this study, we substituted the Bowen ratio with the ratio of evapotranspiration (ET) to net radiation, and revised the RS-PM (Remote Sensing-Penman Monteith) model for quantifying ET. Fifty-four eddy covariance towers, including various ecosystem types, were selected to calibrate and validate the revised RS-PM and EC-LUE models. The revised RS-PM model explained 82% and 68% of the observed variations of ET for all the calibration and validation sites, respectively. Using estimated ET as input, the EC-LUE model performed well in calibration and validation sites, explaining 75% and 61% of the observed GPP variation for calibration and validation sites respectively. Global patterns of ET and GPP at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.6 degrees longitude during the years 2000 2003 were determined using the global MERRA dataset (Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The global estimates of ET and GPP agreed well with the other global models from the literature, with the highest ET and GPP over tropical forests and the lowest values in dry and high latitude areas. However, comparisons with observed GPP at eddy flux towers showed significant underestimation of ET and GPP due to lower net radiation of MERRA dataset. Applying a procedure to correct the systematic errors of global meteorological data would improve global estimates of GPP and ET. The revised RS-PM and EC-LUE models will provide the alternative approaches making it possible to map ET and GPP over large areas because (1) the model parameters are invariant across various land cover types and (2) all driving forces of the models may be derived from remote sensing data or existing climate observation networks.

AB With the constant proliferation of computational power, our ability to develop hybrid classifiers has improved. Hybrid classifiers integrate results from multiple algorithms and often improve classification accuracy. In this paper, a hybrid classification framework was used to evaluate two research hypotheses: i) can manipulated results from prior classifiers ("intermediate inputs" (IIs)) improve classification accuracy in subsequent classification steps. and ii) is there an optimal dataset proportion for creation and usage of intermediate inputs. These additional intermediate inputs were based on spatial and texture statistics calculated on a partially classified image. The implementation of intermediate inputs on an impervious surface classification task using a 2001 Landsat ETM+ image from central New York was demonstrated. The results suggested that there was an average accuracy improvement of 3.6% (maximum 6.6%) by using intermediate inputs. These improvements were proved statistically significant by a Z-test and tended to increase as classification difficulty increased. The experiments in this paper also showed that there was an optimal point that balanced the number of pixels and pixel classification accuracy from prior steps used to produce intermediate inputs. Additionally, some traditional problems such as separation of impervious surfaces and soil were successfully tackled through intermediate inputs. The concept of the intermediate inputs may easily apply to other sensors and/or ground features. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional methods for aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction of remote sensing data over water surfaces are based on the assumption of zero water reflectance in the near-infrared. Another type of approach which is becoming very popular in atmospheric correction over water is based on the simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric and water parameters through the inversion of coupled atmospheric and bio-optical water models. Both types of approaches may lead to substantial errors over optically-complex water bodies, such as case 11 waters, in which a wide range of temporal and spatial variations in the concentration of water constituents is expected. This causes the water reflectance in the near-infrared to be non-negligible, and that the water reflectance response under extreme values of the water constituents cannot be described by the assumed bio-optical models. As an alternative to these methods. the SCAPE-M atmospheric processor is proposed in this paper for the automatic atmospheric correction of ENVISAT/MERIS data over inland waters. A-priori assumptions on the water composition and its spectral response are avoided by SCAPE-M by calculating reflectance of close-to-land water pixels through spatial extension of atmospheric parameters derived over neighboring land pixels. This approach is supported by the results obtained from the validation of SCAPE-M over a number of European inland water validation sites which is presented in this work. MERIS-derived aerosol optical thickness, water reflectance and water pigments are compared to in-situ data acquired concurrently to MERIS images in 20 validation match-ups. SCAPE-M has also been compared to specific processors designed for the retrieval of take water constituents from MERIS data. The performance of SCAPE-M to reproduce ground-based measurements under a range of water types and the ability of MERIS data to monitor chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin pigments using semiempirical algorithms after SCAPE-M processing are discussed. It has been found that SCAPE-M is able to provide high accurate water reflectance over turbid waters, outperforming models based on site-specific bio-optical models, although problems of SCAPE-M to cope with clear waters in some cases have also been identified.

AB A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes (> 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01-0.07 sigma) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1-0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land subsidence and eustacy concurred to make the relative sea level in Venice (Italy) 23 cm higher over the last century. In order to protect the city and its lagoon environment from increased flooding, a series of mobile barriers are under construction at the three inlets of Lido, Malamocco, and Chioggia connecting the Adriatic Sea to the inner water body. Since 2003 work has been proceeding with the reinforcement and extension of the existing jetties and the construction of breakwaters, harbors, and a small island within the Lido inlet. We detected significant local settlements of a few centimeters between March 2008 and January 2009 at the three inlets induced by the construction works through an interferometric analysis of 30 satellite radar images acquired by the new German TerraSAR-X mission. On a more regional scale we observe that the city of Venice and the other major urban settlements on the lagoon littorals are not impacted by subsidence during this period. The very high spatial resolution of 3 m and the short repeat-time interval of I I days of TerraSAR-X enable the investigation of displacements with an unprecedented observed level of details, opening new perspectives to geodynamic's research and civil engineering sectors for the monitoring of large infrastructures with potential vulnerability to terrain motion.

AB The studies of impervious surfaces are important because they are related to many environmental problems, such as water quality, stream health, and the urban heat island effect. Previous studies have discussed that the self-organizing map (SOM) can provide a promising alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for image classification at both per-pixel and sub-pixel level. However, the performances of SOM and MLP have not been compared in the estimation and mapping of urban impervious surfaces. In mid-latitude areas, plant phenology has a significant influence on remote sensing of the environment. When the neural networks approaches are applied, how satellite images acquired in different seasons impact impervious surface estimation of various urban surfaces (such as commercial, residential, and suburban/rural areas) remains to be answered. In this paper, an SOM and an MLP neural network were applied to three ASTER images acquired on April 5, 2004, June 16, 2001, and October 3, 2000, respectively, which covered Marion County, Indiana, United States. Six impervious surface maps were yielded, and an accuracy assessment was performed. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2) were calculated to indicate the accuracy of impervious surface maps. The results indicated that the SOM can generate a slightly better estimation of impervious surfaces than the MLP. Moreover, the results from three test areas showed that, in the residential areas, more accurate results were yielded by the SOM, which indicates that the SOM was more effective in coping with the mixed pixels than the MLP. because the residential area prevailed with mixed pixels. Results obtained from the commercial area possessed very high RMSE values due to the prevalence of shade, which indicates that both algorithms cannot handle the shade problem well. The lowest RMSE value was obtained from the rural area due to containing of less mixed pixels and shade. This research supports previous observations that the SOM can provide a promising alternative to the MLP neural network. This study also found that the impact of different map sizes on the impervious surface estimation is significant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lidar provides enhanced abilities to remotely map leaf area index (LAI) with improved accuracies. We aim to further explore the capability of discrete-return lidar for estimating LAI over a pine-dominated forest in East Texas, with a secondary goal to compare the lidar-derived LAI map and the GLOBCARBON moderate-resolution satellite LAI product. Specific problems we addressed include (1) evaluating the effects of analysts and algorithms on in-situ LAI estimates from hemispherical photographs (hemiphoto), (2) examining the effectiveness of various lidar metrics, including laser penetration, canopy height and foliage density metrics, to predict LAI, (3) assessing the utility of integrating Quickbird multispectral imagery with lidar for improving the LAI estimate accuracy, and (4) developing a scheme to co-register the lidar and satellite LAI maps and evaluating the consistency between them. Results show that the use of different analysts or algorithms in analyzing hemiphotos caused an average uncertainty of 0.35 in in-situ LAI, and that several laser penetration metrics in logarithm models were more effective than other lidar metrics, with the best one explaining 84% of the variation in the in-situ LAI (RMSE = 0.29 LAI). The selection of plot size and height threshold in calculating laser penetration metrics greatly affected the effectiveness of these metrics. The combined use of NDVI and lidar metrics did not significantly improve estimation over the use of lidar alone. We also found that mis-registration could induce a large artificial discrepancy into the pixelwise comparison between the coarse-resolution satellite and fine-resolution lidar-derived LAI maps. By compensating for a systematic sub-pixel shift error, the correlation between two maps increased from 0.08 to 0.85 for pines (n = 24 pixels). However, the absolute differences between the two LAI maps still remained large due to the inaccuracy in accounting for clumping effects. Overall, our findings imply that lidar offers a superior tool for mapping LAI at local to regional scales as compared to optical remote sensing, accuracies of lidar-estimate LAI are affected not only by the choice of models but also by the absolute accuracy of in-situ reference LAI used for model calibration, and lidar-derived LAI maps can serve as reliable references for validating moderate-resolution satellite LAI products over large areas.

AB Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire, insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect. fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R(2)=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.

AB Important environmental parameters in arctic periglacial landscapes (i.e. permafrost temperature, active-layer depth, soil moisture, precipitation. vegetation cover) will very likely change in a warming climate. The thawing of permafrost, especially. might cause massive landscape changes due to thermokarst and an enhanced release of greenhouse gasses from the large amounts of carbon stored in frozen deposits, resulting in positive climate-warming feedback. For the identification, mapping, and quantification of such changes on various scales up to the entire circum-Arctic, remote sensing and spatial data analysis are essential tools. In this study an extensive field-work dataset including spectral surface properties, vegetation, soils, and geomorphology was acquired in the largest Arctic delta formed by a single river, the Siberian Lena River Delta. A portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec Pro FR (R)) was used for spectral surveys of terrain surfaces, and optical satellite data (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), CHRIS-Proba) were used for the characterization, manual mapping, and automatic classification of typical periglacial land-cover units in the Lena Delta. Qualitative data from soils, vegetation, soil moisture. and relief units were correlated with the field-spectral data and catalogued for a wide variety of surface types. The wide range of micro- and mesoscale variations of periglacial surface features in the delta results in distinctive spectral characteristics for different land-cover units. The three main delta terraces could also be spectrally separated and characterized. The present dataset provides a basis for further spectral data acquisitions in the Lena Delta and for comparisons with periglacial surfaces from other regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Large areas of the world's coastal marine environments remain poorly characterized because they have not been mapped with sufficient accuracy and at spatial resolutions high enough to support a wide range of societal needs. Expediting the rate of seafloor mapping requires the collection of multi-use datasets that concurrently address hydrographic charting needs and support decision-making in ecosystem-based management. While active optical and acoustic sensors have previously been compared for the purpose of hydrographic charting, few studies have evaluated the performance and cost effectiveness of these systems for providing benthic habitat maps. Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water (<50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = >0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 x 5 km spatial scale (r = -0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 x 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6% less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems (<50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data.

AB Remote sensing is a powerful tool for characterizing, estimating or modelling species diversity. Differences in environmental properties of different habitats should lead to differences of spectral responses, which can be detected by satellite imagery. Hence, spectral distance may be related to species diversity. Based on previous studies, Krishnaswamy et al. [Krishnaswamy, J., Bawa, K, S., Ganeshaiah, K. N.. & Kiran, M. C. (2009). Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance Surrogate. Remote Sensing of Environment.] used spectral distance to estimate species diversity. Since a noisy scatterplot of species versus spectral diversity is expected, the commonly used Ordinary Least Square regression may fail to detect trends which occur across other quantiles than the mean. Krishnaswamy et al. [Krishnaswamy, J., Bawa, K. S., Ganeshaiah, K. N., & Kiran, M. C. (2009). Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance surrogate. Remote Sensing of Environment.] proposed a quantile-quantile plot method as an alternative to conventional regression based approaches which are inappropriate for dependent pair-wise dissimilarity or similarity data. By this commentary I demonstrate the utility of a quantile regression technique to complement the Krishnaswamy et al. (Krishnaswamy, J., Bawa, K. S., Ganeshaiah, K. N., & Kiran, M. C. (2009). Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance Surrogate.

AB This study suggests a method for improving spatial consistency in the estimation of forest stand data. Traditional nearest neighbor imputation can preserve between-variable consistency within a unit, but not between geographically nearby units. The lack of spatial consistency may cause problems when data are used for purposes of forestry planning or scenario analysis. In spatially consistent nearest neighbor imputation, adjacent units are considered in the estimation. The first step of the method is a k-Nearest Neighbor imputation. Secondly, based on the initial imputation an optimization algorithm, Simulated Annealing, is applied in order to reach certain spatial variation targets. The proposed method was tested in a case study where tree stem volume data were imputed to each unit (pixel) of forest stands, using satellite digital numbers as carrier data. The spatial variation measures used were between-pixel correlation and short-range variance. In addition. accuracy of the estimated stand level mean volume was used as a target in order to avoid drifts in mean volume during the optimization. The method was successful in three out of four stands where it resulted in imputations corresponding exactly to the target spatial variation measures. In the fourth stand it was not possible to find an exact solution. However, in this case the two spatial variation targets were reached whereas the mean stem volume was slightly overestimated (stem volume of 375 m(3) ha(-1) rather than 336 m(3) ha(-1)).

AB Multispectral satellite data have become a common tool used in the mapping of wildland fire effects. Fire severity, defined as the degree to which a site has been altered, is often the variable mapped. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) used in an absolute difference change detection protocol (dNBR), has become the remote sensing method of choice for US Federal land management agencies to map fire severity due to wildland fire. However, absolute differenced vegetation indices are correlated to the pre-fire chlorophyll content of the vegetation occurring within the fire perimeter. Normalizing dNBR to produce a relativized dNBR (RdNBR) removes the biasing effect of the pre-fire condition. Employing RdNBR hypothetically allows creating categorical classifications using the same thresholds for fires occurring in similar vegetation types without acquiring additional calibration field data on each fire. In this paper we tested this hypothesis by developing thresholds on random training datasets, and then comparing accuracies for (1) fires that occurred within the same geographic region as the training dataset and in similar vegetation, and (2) fires from a different geographic region that is climatically and floristically similar to the training dataset region but supports more complex vegetation structure. We additionally compared map accuracies for three measures of fire severity: the composite burn index (CBI), percent change in tree canopy cover, and percent change in tree basal area. User's and producer's accuracies were highest for the most severe categories, ranging from 70.7% to 89.1%. Accuracies of the moderate fire severity category for measures describing effects only to trees (percent change in canopy cover and basal area) indicated that the classifications were generally not much better than random. Accuracies of the moderate category for the CBI classifications were somewhat better, averaging in the 50%-60% range. These results underscore the difficulty in isolating fire effects to individual vegetation strata when fire effects are mixed. We conclude that the models presented here and in Miller and Thode ([Miller, J.D. & Thode, A.E., (2007). Quantifying burn severity in a heterogeneous landscape with a relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Remote Sensing of Environment, 109, 66-80.]) can produce fire severity classifications (using either CBI, or percent change in canopy cover or basal area) that are of similar accuracy in fires not used in the original calibration process, at least in conifer dominated vegetation types in Mediterranean-climate California.

AB Four LiDAR-based models of canopy fractional cover (FCLiDAR) have been tested against hemispherical photography fractional cover measurements (FCHP) and compared across five ecozones, eight forest species and multiple LiDAR survey configurations. The four models compared are based on: i) a canopy-to-total first returns ratio (FCLiDAR(FR)) method; ii) a canopy-to-total returns ratio (FCLiDAR(RR)); iii) an intensity return ratio (FCLiDAR(IR)): and iv) a Beer's Law modified (two-way transmission loss) intensity return ratio (FCLiDAR(BL)). It is found that for the entire dataset, the FCLiDAR(RR) model demonstrates the lowest overall predictive capability of overhead FC (annulus rings 1-4) (r(2)=0.70), with a slight improvement for the FCLiDAR(FR) model (r(2)=0.74). The intensity-based FCLiDAR(IR) model displays the best results (r(2)=0.78). However, the FCLiDAR(BL) model is considered generally more useful (r(2)=0.75) because the associated line of best fit passes through the origin, has a slope near unity and produces a mean estimate of FCHP within 5%. Therefore, FCLiDAR(BL) requires the least calibration across a broad range of forest cover types. The FCLiDAR(FR) and FCLiDAR(RR) models. on the other hand, were found to be sensitive to variations in both canopy height and sensor pulse repetition frequency (or pulse power); i.e. changing the repetition frequency led to a systematic shift of up to 11% in the mean FCLiDAR(RR) estimates while it had no effect on the intensity-based FCLiDAR(IR) or FCLiDAR(BL) models. While the intensity-based models were generally more robust, all four models displayed at least some sensitivity to variations in canopy structural class, suggesting that some calibration of FCLiDAR might be necessary regardless of the model used. Short (<2 m tall) or open canopy forest plots posed the greatest challenge to accurate FC estimation regardless of the model used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

AB It has been suggested that attempts to use remote sensing to map the spatial and structural patterns of individual tree species abundances in heterogeneous forests, such as those found in northeastern North America, may benefit from the integration of hyperspectral or multi-spectral information with other active sensor data such as lidar. Towards this end, we describe the integrated and individual capabilities of waveform lidar and hyperspectral data to estimate three common forest measurements - basal area (BA), above-ground biomass (AGBM) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) - in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. The use of this data to discriminate distribution and abundance patterns of five common and often, dominant tree species was also explored. Waveform lidar imagery was acquired in July 2003 over the 1000 ha. Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) using NASA's airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). High spectral resolution imagery was likewise acquired in August 2003 using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Field data (2001-2003) from over 400 US Forest Service Northern Research Station (USFS NRS) plots were used to determine actual site conditions.
   Results suggest that the integrated data sets of hyperspectral and waveform lidar provide improved outcomes over use of either data set alone in evaluating common forest metrics. Across all forest conditions, 8-9% more of the variation in AGBM, BA, and QMSD was explained by use of the integrated sensor data in comparison to either AVIRIS or LVIS metrics applied singly, with estimated error 5-8% lower for these variables. Notably, in an analysis using integrated data limited to unmanaged forest tracts, AGBM coefficients of determination improved by 25% or more, while corresponding error levels decreased by over 25%. When data were restricted based on the presence of individual tree species within plots, AVIRIS data alone best predicted species-specific patterns of abundance as determined by species fraction of biomass. Nonetheless, use of LVIS and AVIRIS data - in tandem - produced complementary maps of estimated abundance and structure for individual tree species, providing a promising adjunct to traditional forest inventory and conservation biology planning efforts.

AB Spectral absorption properties of particulate and dissolved matter were determined for Lake Erie waters in order to investigate the natural variability of the absorption coefficients required as inputs to optical models for converting satellite observations of water colour into water quality information. Particulate absorption measured using the quantitative filter technique yielded absorption spectra containing a fraction that could not be attributed to phytoplankton pigments, living heterotrophs, mineral sediments, or organic detritus but were indicative of additional absorption by a fraction of dissolved organic matter present in colloidal and/or particle-bound form. Erroneously high phytoplankton absorption coefficients, measured at short wavelengths using the filter technique suggested that this particle-bound DOM is removed along with phytoplankton pigments. during bleaching by sodium hypochlorite and as such is mistakenly incorporated into the phytoplankton absorption signal. Observations suggest that the selective sorption of fractions of DOM onto suspended particles may be responsible for significant variability in the absorption coefficients. of particulate and dissolved matter and may be an important contributor to the total spectral absorption signals in Lake Erie waters. This reservoir of coloured organic matter, which to date has not been seriously considered in the optical properties of coastal and inland waters, may produce significant uncertainties in the parameterization of optical models and the interpretation of in situ and remotely sensed aquatic colour signals.

AB We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America.

AB Fires constitute one major ecological disturbance which influences the natural cycle of vegetation succession and the structure and function of ecosystems. There is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena are completely understood and thus the capacity to handle scale is beneficial to methodological frameworks for analyzing and monitoring ecosystems. Although satellite imagery has been widely applied for the assessment of fire related topics, there are few studies that consider fire at several spatial scales simultaneously. This research explores the relationships between fire occurrence and several families of environmental factors at different spatial observation scales by means of classification and regression tree models. Predictors accounting for vegetation status (estimated by spectral indices derived from Landsat imagery), fire history, topography, accessibility and vegetation types were included in the models of fire occurrence probability. We defined four scales of analysis by identifying four meaningful thresholds related to fire sizes in the study site. Sampling methodology was based on random points and the power-law distribution describing the local fire regime. The observation scale drastically affected tree size, and therefore the achieved level of detail, and the most explanatory variables in the trees. As a general trend, trees considering all the variables showed a spectral index ruling the most explicative split. According to the comparison of the four pre-determined analysis scales, we propose the existence of three eventual organization levels: landscape patch or ecosystem level, local level and the basic level, the most heterogeneous and complex scale. Rules with three levels of complexity and applicability for management were defined in the tree models: (i) the repeated critical thresholds (predictor values across which fire characteristics change rapidly), (ii) the meaningful final probability classes and (iii) the trees themselves.

AB Models estimating surface energy fluxes over partial canopy cover with thermal remote sensing must account for significant differences between the radiometric temperatures and turbulent exchange rates associated with the soil and canopy components of the thermal pixel scene. Recent progress in separating soil and canopy temperatures from dual angle composite radiometric temperature measurements has encouraged the development of two-source (soil and canopy) approaches to estimating surface energy fluxes given observations of component soil and canopy temperatures. A Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance (STSEB) model has been developed using a "patch" treatment of the surface flux sources, which does not allow interaction between the soil and vegetation canopy components. A simple algorithm to predict the net radiation partitioning between the soil and vegetation is introduced as part of the STSEB patch modelling scheme. The feasibility of the STSEB approach under a full range in fractional vegetation cover conditions is explored using data collected over a maize (corn) crop in Beltsville Maryland, USA during the 2004 summer growing season. Measurements of soil and canopy component temperatures as well as the effective composite temperature were collected over the course of the growing season from crop emergence to cob development. Comparison with tower flux measurements yielded root-mean-square-difference values between 15 and 50 W m(-2) for the retrieval of the net radiation, soil, sensible and latent heat fluxes. A detailed sensitivity analysis of the STSEB approach to typical uncertainties in the required inputs was also conducted indicating greatest model sensitivity to soil and canopy temperature uncertainties with relative errors reaching similar to 30% in latent heat flux estimates. With algorithms proposed to infer component temperatures from bi-angular satellite observations, the STSEB model has the capability of being applied operationally. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Improved and up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) data sets that classify specific crop types and associated land use practices are needed over intensively cropped regions such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, to support science and policy applications focused on understanding the role and response of the agricultural sector to environmental change issues. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) holds considerable promise for detailed, large-area crop-related LULC mapping in this region given its global coverage, unique combination of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, and the cost-free status of its data. The objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of time-series MODIS 250 in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for large-area crop-related LULC mapping over the U.S. Central Great Plains. A hierarchical crop mapping protocol, which applied a decision tree classifier to multi-temporal NDVI data collected over the growing season, was tested for the state of Kansas. The hierarchical classification approach produced a series of four crop-related LULC maps that progressively classified: 1) crop/non-crop, 2) general crop types (alfalfa, summer crops, winter wheat, and fallow), 3) specific summer crop types (corn, sorghum, and soybeans), and 4) irrigated/non-irrigated crops. A series of quantitative and qualitative assessments were made at the state and sub-state levels to evaluate the overall map quality and highlight areas of misclassification for each map.
   The series of MODIS NDVI-derived crop maps generally had classification accuracies greater than 80%. Overall accuracies ranged from 94% for the general crop map to 84% for the summer crop map. The state-level crop patterns classified in the maps were consistent with the general cropping patterns across Kansas. The classified crop areas were usually within 1-5% of the USDA reported crop area for most classes. Sub-state comparisons found the areal discrepancies for most classes to be relatively minor throughout the state. In eastern Kansas, some small cropland areas could not be resolved at MODIS' 250 in resolution and led to an underclassification of cropland in the crop/non-crop map, which was propagated to the subsequent crop classifications. Notable regional areal differences in crop area were also found for a few selected crop classes and locations that were related to climate factors (i.e., omission of marginal, dryland cropped areas and the underclassification of irrigated crops in western Kansas), localized precipitation patterns (overclassification of irrigated crops in northeast Kansas), and specific cropping practices (double cropping in southeast Kansas).

AB In this study, we examined the characteristics of soil moisture dynamics of wet and dry fields across hierarchical spatial scales within the region of Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) hydrology campaign in Iowa. The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR)-based remotely sensed surface (similar to 0-5 cm) soil moisture at 800 m x 800 m resolution was used in this study. Wavelet-based multiresolution technique decomposed the soil moisture into large-scale mean soil moisture fields and fluctuations in horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions at hierarchical spatial resolutions. Results suggested linearity in the log-log dependency of the variance of soil moisture up to a resolution of 6400 m x 6400 m on PSR sampling dates during SMEX02. The wet fields (with high soil moisture) show almost similar variance for all the resolutions signifying the strong spatial correlation. Analysis of the dry fields (with low soil moisture) indicated a log-log linearity of moments with various scales, and the slopes of these relationships exhibit a concave functional form with the order of moments, typically representing a multiscaling process. The scaling exponent of soil moisture during dry-down suggests a transition from simple scaling (in wet fields) to multiscaling (in dry fields) behavior. The fluctuation components of multiresolution analysis in the horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions for dry and wet fields exhibited self-similarity. Another important finding of this study is the increase of subpixel soil moisture variability with increasing resolution, especially for the wet fields. These findings will help develop appropriate up-and down-scaling schemes of remotely sensed soil moisture data for various hydrologic and environmental modeling applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB This research investigates the appropriate scale for watershed averaged and site specific soil moisture retrieval from high resolution radar imagery. The first approach involved filtering backscatter for input to a retrieval model that was compared against field measures of soil moisture. The second approach involved spatially averaging raw and filtered imagery in an image-based statistical technique to determine the best scale for site-specific soil moisture retrieval. Field soil moisture was measured at 1225 m(2) sites in three watersheds commensurate with 7 m resolution Radarsat image acquisition. Analysis of speckle reducing block median filters indicated that 5 x 5 filter level was the optimum for watershed averaged estimates of soil moisture. However, median filtering alone did not provide acceptable accuracy for soil moisture retrieval on a site-specific basis. Therefore, spatial averaging of unfiltered and median filtered power values was used to generate backscatter estimates with known confidence for soil moisture retrieval. This combined approach of filtering and averaging was demonstrated at watersheds located in Arizona (AZ), Oklahoma (OK) and Georgia (GA). The optimum ground resolution for AZ, OK and GA study areas was 162 m, 310 m, and 1131 m respectively obtained with unfiltered imagery. This statistical approach does not rely on ground verification of soil moisture for validation and only requires a satellite image and average roughness parameters of the site. When applied at other locations, the resulting optimum ground resolution will depend on the spatial distribution of land surface features that affect radar backscatter. This work offers insight into the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval, and an operational approach to determine the optimal spatial resolution for the required application accuracy.

AB Variability in northern hemisphere (NH) spring and summer snow extent is strongly influenced by snow cover duration (SCD) across the Canadian Arctic. In order to assess the accuracy with which satellite-derived snow extent datasets capture the dynamic melt period (1 April-31 July), SCD datasets derived from the weekly NOAA snow chart record (1979-2004), daily IMS product (2000-2004), passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures (1979-2004), and Ku-band QuikSCAT scatterometer data (2000-2004) were assessed against in situ measurements across the Canadian Arctic (north of 60 degrees). The higher resolution IMS and QSCAT datasets showed the best ability to capture spatial variability in spring SCD over the Canadian Arctic, followed by the NOAA and PMW datasets. The poorer performance of the PMW was anticipated because of documented difficulties monitoring snow cover over forested and mountainous terrain. Both the IMS and the NOAA datasets exhibited positive biases of similar to 22-26 days which can be related to elevation effects and frequent cloud cover. The NOAA dataset was unable to capture interannual variability in spring snow cover over the central Canadian Arctic tundra region (66-74 degrees N, 80-120 degrees W) while the PMW was able to capture a significant fraction of the observed variability. This fact, combined with anomalous snow-cover temperature responses in the NOAA data further reinforces the conclusions of Wang et al. [Wang, L., Sharp, M., Brown, R., Derksen, C., & Rivard, B., (2005a). Evaluation of spring snow covered area depletion in the Canadian Arctic from NOAA snow charts. Remote Sensing of Environment, 95, 453-463] that considerable care be taken when using NOAA data during the summer months (June-August) where NH snow cover variability is controlled by relatively small regions with frequent cloud cover. QuikSCAT data were able to provide comparable results to IMS over the 2000-2004 period, indicating that Ku-band scatterometer measurements can make an important contribution to monitoring terrestrial snow extent during spring melt.

AB Spatial and temporal distributions of snow grain size, mass fraction of snow impurity, and snow surface temperature around the northern polar region were retrieved together with snow and sea ice cover extents from radiance data observed by the Global Imager (GLI), an optical sensor onboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II). The sensor acquired global radiance data from April 2 to October 24 in 2003. Two grain sizes, one for the shallow (0-20 cm) layer and the other for the top surface (0-2 cm) layer, were retrieved using channels with different light penetration depths. Snow and sea ice related products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for comparison. Retrieved seasonal variations of snow and sea ice cover extents were consistent with the MODIS and AMSR products. GLI derived snow surface temperatures were also correlated with the MODIS surface temperatures and exhibited latitudinal dependence over the northern hemisphere. Retrieved snow impurities were considered to be partly inaccurate over the Arctic sea ice in April and over inland areas of the continents possibly due to thin snow and/or dense vegetation. However, the snow cover around the northern Canadian Arctic tundra and Archipelago regions and the Greenland ice sheet in April to June was found to be very clean with a soot-equivalent impurity fraction of around 0.05 ppmw or less. Thus, these areas can be used as reference sites for monitoring pollution levels of the Arctic snow cover. Retrieved snow grain radii in the shallow layer seemed erroneous over thin snow covers, but indicated drastic spatial and seasonal evolution of the snow cover over the northern hemisphere with radius ranging from 50 mu m to over 1000 mu m synchronized with variations in surface temperature.

AB Spectral-based image endmember extraction methods hinge on the ability to discriminate between pixels based on spectral characteristics alone. Endmembers with distinct spectral features (high spectral contrast) are easy to select, whereas those with minimal unique spectral information (low spectral contrast) are more problematic. Spectral contrast, however, is dependent on the endmember assemblage, such that as the assemblage changes so does the "relative" spectral contrast of each endmember to all other endmembers. It is then possible for an endmember to have low spectral contrast with respect to the full image, but have high spectral contrast within a subset of the image. The spatial-spectral endmember extraction tool (SSEE) works by analyzing a scene in parts (subsets), such that we increase the spectral contrast of low contrast endmembers, thus improving the potential for these endmembers to be selected. The SSEE method comprises three main steps: 1) application of singular value decomposition (SVD) to determine a set of basis vectors that describe most of the spectral variance for subsets of the image; 2) projection of the full image data set onto the locally defined basis vectors to determine a set of candidate endmember pixels; and, 3) imposing spatial constraints for averaging spectrally similar endmembers, allowing for separation of endmembers that are spectrally similar, but spatially independent. The SSEE method is applied to two real hyperspectral data sets to demonstrate the effects of imposing spatial constraints on the selection of endmembers. The results show that the SSEE method is an effective approach to extracting image endmembers. Specific improvements include the extraction of physically meaningful, low contrast endmembers that occupy unique image regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The urban heat island phenomenon occurs as a result of the mixed effects of anthropogenic heat discharge, increased use of artificial impervious surface materials, and decreased vegetation cover. These factors modify the heat balance at the land surface and eventually raise the atmospheric temperature. It is important to quantify the surface heat balance in order to estimate the contributions of these factors. The present authors propose the use of storage heat flux to represent the heat flux between the land surface and the inside of the canopy for the heat balance analysis based on satellite remote sensing data. Surface heat fluxes were estimated around the city of Nagoya, Japan using Terra ASTER data and meteorological data. Seasonal and day-night differences in heat balance were compared using ASTER data acquired in the daytime on July 10, 2000, and January 2, 2004 and in the nighttime on September 26, 2003. In the central business and commercial districts, the storage heat flux was higher than those in the surrounding residential areas. In particular, in winter, the storage heat flux in the central urban area was 240 to 290 W m(-2), which was much larger than the storage heat fluxes in residential areas, which ranged from 180 to 220 W m(-2). Moreover, the negative storage heat flux in the central urban area was greater at night. This tendency implies that the urban surface stores heat during the daytime and discharges it at night. Extremely large negative storage heat flux occurred primarily in the industrial areas for both daytime and nighttime as a result of the enormous energy consumption by factories. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Near-surface soil moisture is a critical component of land surface energy and water balance studies encompassing a wide range of disciplines. However, the processes of infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration in the vadose zone of the soil are not easy to quantify or predict because of the difficulty in accurately representing soil texture and hydraulic properties in land surface models. This study approaches the problem of parameterizing soil properties from a unique perspective based on components originally developed for operational estimation of soil moisture for mobility assessments. Estimates of near-surface soil moisture derived from passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing were acquired on six dates during the Monsoon '90 experiment in southeastern Arizona, and used to calibrate hydraulic properties in an offline land surface model and infer information on the soil conditions of the region. Specifically, a robust parameter estimation tool (PEST) was used to calibrate the Noah land surface model and run at very high spatial resolution across the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Errors in simulated versus observed soil moisture were minimized by adjusting the soil texture, which in turn controls the hydraulic properties through the use of pedotransfer functions. By estimating within a continuous range of widely applicable soil properties such as sand, silt, and clay percentages rather than applying rigid soil texture classes, lookup tables, or large parameter sets as in previous studies, the physical accuracy and consistency of the resulting soils could then be assessed. In addition, the sensitivity of this calibration method to the number and timing of microwave retrievals is determined in relation to the temporal patterns in precipitation and soil drying. The resultant soil properties were applied to an extended time period demonstrating the improvement in simulated soil moisture over that using default or county-level soil parameters. The methodology is also applied to an independent case at Walnut Gulch using a new soil moisture product from active (C-band) radar imagery with much lower spatial and temporal resolution. Overall, results demonstrate the potential to gain physically meaningful soil information using simple parameter estimation with few but appropriately timed remote sensing retrievals.

AB A new index was proposed to estimate soil and vegetation moisture based on NIR (858 nm) and SWIR (1240 and 1640 nm) MODIS bands. The Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SAST) parameteiizes the general shape of the MR-SWIR part of the spectrum. We expand on the novel approach used to develop SASI by proposing another index, the Angle at NIR (ANIR). We use laboratory and simulation datasets to validate the ability of SASI to estimate soil and vegetation moisture, and evaluate the advantage for using both SASI and ANIR as land-cover discrimination tools. Our results demonstrate that SASI is a good indicator of soil and vegetation moisture. ANIR shows promise in discriminating dry plant matter from soil and quantifying the amount of dry matter irrespective of changes in soil moisture or green vegetation. When SASI is combined with ANIR, discrimination between soil, dry plant matter, and low to high amounts of green vegetation is significantly improved. Angle indexes are an exciting new way to engineer indexes that contain valuable environmental information not accessible from other indexes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.

AB Performances of the recently proposed RAT (Robust AVHRR Techniques) approach in detecting and monitoring eruptive ash clouds by satellite have been assessed. The Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy) eruption of 2002, producing intense ash emissions has been used as a study case. Potentialities and limitations of two different RAT configuration schemes (i.e. two and three channel based) have been investigated, both in terms of reliability (i.e. accurate detection) and sensitivity (detailed ash cloud properties description) and tested for several days after the eruption onset, also in different observational conditions. The main outcomes of this assessment study are: i) the more complete, three-channel scheme seems to offer accurate ash detection and discrimination from meteorological clouds with a high level of reliability, better than traditional satellite schemes; ii) on the other hand, the simplified RAT configuration performs well in ash cloud monitoring and tracking, providing a better description of cloud characteristics and properties (e.g. size, shape, direction, etc.). Consequently, a specific protocol has been suggested and experimented, with both the two configuration schemes applied in cascade; it provides a first, accurate and reliable ash detection and discrimination and, after-wards, a more detailed description of the previously identified eruptive cloud, also in terms of its internal structure and density. Preliminary, qualitative validations of the derived ash cloud 'structure', performed by comparison with some independent satellite observations, have also been briefly presented.

AB Classification of terrestrial materials using remotely sensed imagery is becoming an increasingly popular method to assess natural systems. This study uses predictions derived from remotely sensed hyperspectral images to determine minimum target detection thresholds and to statistically constrain classification accuracies. Minimum detection thresholds are determined using an iterative regression breakpoint technique, and accuracy is delineated by quantifying the variance above the correlation breakpoint. Assessing confidence and determining detection limits generates a greater understanding of the classification process and adds significant utility to the classified product. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Crop residues left on agricultural lands after harvest play an important role in controlling and protecting soil against water and wind erosion. One challenge of remote sensing is to differentiate crop residues from bare soil and crop cover, especially when the residues have been weathered and/or when the crop cover phenology is more advanced. Several techniques for mapping and estimating crop residues exist in the literature. However, these methods are time consuming and not suited for quantitative evaluation. They have the disadvantage of being less rigorous and accurate because they do not consider the spectral mixture of different materials in the same pixel. In this study, the potential of hyperspectral (Probe-1) and multispectral high spatial resolution (IKONOS) data were compared for estimating and mapping crop residues on agricultural lands using the constrained linear spectral mixture analysis approach. Image data were spectrally and radiometrically calibrated, atmospherically corrected, as well as geometrically rectified. Pure spectral signatures of residues, bare soil and crop cover were manually extracted from image data based on prior knowledge of the fields. Percent (fraction) cover for each sampling point was extracted using unmixing and validated against ground reference measurements. The best results were achieved for the crop cover (index of agreement (D)=0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.09) adjusted for the impurity of the endmembers canola, pea and wheat, followed by the wheat residues (D=0.76 and RMSE=0.12). Considering only the wheat residues in fields with a canola crop, D increases to 0.86. The soil fractions were generally underestimated with D=0.72, and no significant improvements could be made after adjusting for the shadow effect. The estimations from the IKONOS data were poorer for the same cover types (residues: D=0.40 and RMSE=0.24; crop: D=0.51 and RMSE=0.38; soil: D=0.58 and RMSE=0.29). Relative to the IKONOS data, the better performance of the hyperspectral data is mainly due to the improved spectral band characteristics, especially in the SWIR, which is sensitive to the residues (lignin and cellulose absorption features), soil and crop cover.

AB Effective integration of optical remote sensing with flux measurements across multiple scales is essential for understanding global patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water vapor. SpecNet (Spectral Network) is an international network of cooperating investigators and sites linking optical measurements with flux sampling for the purpose of improving our understanding of the controls on these fluxes. An additional goal is to characterize disturbance impacts on surface-atmosphere fluxes. To reach these goals, key SpecNet objectives include the exploration of scaling issues, development of novel sampling tools, standardization and intercomparison of sampling methods, development of models and statistical methods that relate optical sampling to fluxes, exploration of component fluxes, validation of satellite products, and development of an informatics approach that integrates disparate data sources across scales. Examples of these themes are summarized in this review. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents the results of an extended analysis of image data sets acquired during the tandem-orbit configuration in 1999 for the purposes of radiometric cross-calibration of the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors. Earlier work focused on the tandem pair for the Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada (RVPN) site to tie down the Landsat-5 TM calibration based on the more accurate Landsat-7 ETM+ calibration. This paper describes new results based on as many as eight tandem image pairs. The additional tandem images are of primarily vegetated areas for which little or no ground reference data were available. Increasing the number of tandem pairs yielded results for the Landsat 5 TM gain coefficients within approximately +/- 1% of the RVPN-based results in spectral bands 1, 2, 3 and 7, and within -2% and -4% of the RVPN-based results for spectral bands 4 and 5, respectively.

AB To date, simulating land surface hydrological processes over large areas at spatial resolutions higher than 1 km remains technically unfeasible, because of limitations of data availability and computational resources. Several studies have demonstrated, however, that gridding the land surface into coarse homogeneous pixels may cause important biases on ecosystem model estimations of water budget components at local, regional and global scales. These biases result from the overlook of sub-pixel variability of land surface characteristics. This study suggests a simple algorithm that uses sub-pixel information on the spatial variability of vegetation and soil cover, and surface topography to correct evapotranspiration (ET) estimates, made at coarse spatial resolutions where the land surface is considered as homogeneous within each pixel. The algorithm operates in such a way that the ET rates as obtained from calculations made at coarse spatial resolutions are multiplied by separate simple functions that attempt to reproduce the effects of sub-pixel variability of land cover, leaf area index, soil texture, and topography on ET. Its application to a remote sensing process-based model estimates made at a 1-km resolution over a watershed located in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest improved estimates of average ET as well as its temporal and spatial variability.

AB Long-term ecological changes within densely populated landscapes account for a growing share of global environmental change. Measuring the causes and consequences of these changes remains a challenge because of their fine spatial scale and complexity. Here, we measure long-term ecological changes, circa 1950 to 2002, within six 1 km(2) sites in densely populated rural China and in urban and suburban Baltimore, Maryland, USA using a standardized procedure for fine-scale feature-based ecological mapping from high spatial resolution (<= 1 in) imagery. The median size of ecologically distinct landscape features (ecotopes) mapped by this procedure was just 520 m(2), though size, count and perimeter of features varied considerably both within and between sites. Land management and vegetation cover changed substantially, over 28% to 87% of site areas, but most of this change occurred in small patches with area < 4000 m(2). Landscape complexity also increased over time by the fragmentation of landscapes into a larger number of smaller features with an increasing diversity of ecotope classes. Detailed analysis of fine-scale landscape transformations helped identify the causes and consequences of ecologically significant changes within and across sites, including unexpected increases in perennial vegetation cover and the linkage of impervious surface area with population density. These and other results demonstrate the general utility of anthropogenic ecotope mapping as a tool for cross-site comparison and sampled regional estimates of long-term ecological changes within densely populated landscapes.

AB Plants are arguably among the most investigated remote sensing targets. Due to their economical and environmental importance, several models to simulate radiation transport and absorption by foliar tissues have been proposed in remote sensing and related fields. The main goal of this research is to present alternative modeling strategies for the investigation of these phenomena. These solutions consist in algorithmic models specifically designed to simulate the interaction of radiation with bifacial and unifacial plant leaves. Their flexible formulations based on standard Monte Carlo techniques make their implementation straightforward and allow their use in investigations involving different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. In this paper, they are examined in the context of infrared applications. This choice is motivated by the simulation challenges posed by the processes that relate biophysical characteristics to optical properties of plant leaves in this domain. The accuracy and predictability of the proposed models have been evaluated through comparisons between modeled results and measured data. The results of these evaluations illustrate the applicability of the proposed models to investigations involving the predictive simulation of foliar spectral signatures. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the present study, the suitability of optical ASTER satellite data (with 9 spectral bands) for estimating the biomass of boreal forest stands in mineral soils was tested. The remote sensing data were analysed and tested together with standwise forest inventory data. Stand volume estimates were converted to aboveground tree biomass using biomass expansion factors, and the aboveground biomass of understory vegetation was predicted according to the stand age. Non-linear regression analysis and neural networks were applied to develop models for predicting biomass according to standwise ASTER reflectance. All ASTER bands appeared to be sensitive to tree biomass, in particular the green band 1. The relative estimation errors (RMSE,) of the total aboveground biomass of the forest stands were 44.7% and 41.0% using multiple regression analysis and neural networks, respectively. Although the estimation errors remained large, the predictions were relatively accurate in comparison to previous studies. Furthermore, the predictions obtained here were significantly close to the municipality-level mean values provided by the National Forest Inventory of Finland. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB We propose a new spectral index, the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI), for enhanced detection of forest canopy damage caused by selective logging activities and associated forest fires. The NDFI synthesizes information from several component fraction images derived from spectral mixture models. Interpretation of the NDFI data is facilitated by 4 contextual classification algorithm (CCA) that enables accurate mapping of logging and fire-derived canopy damages. The CCA utilizes detected log landings, which are the spatial signature of selective logging, as starting locations for searching the NDFI image for canopy damage. This process separates canopy changes due to logging and associated forest fires from those caused by other natural disturbances. These methods were tested in the Sinop region, in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. Forest transect inventories, conducted along a gradient of degraded forests, were used to evaluated the performance of the NDFI. The NDFI was more sensitive to canopy damage than any individual fraction and is shown to have the potential for further sub-classification of degradation levels in forest environments. Map accuracy of forest canopy damage using the CCA classifier, assessed with aerial videography images, was 94%. The proposed NDFI-CCA classifier approach can be fully automated and, therefore, holds great promise as a forest monitoring tool in tropical forests. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urban development has expanded rapidly in the Tampa Bay area of west-central Florida over the past century. A major effect associated with this population trend is transformation of the landscape from natural cover types to increasingly impervious urban land. This research utilizes an innovative approach for mapping urban extent and its changes through determining impervious surfaces from Landsat satellite remote sensing data. By 2002, areas with subpixel impervious surface greater than 10% accounted for approximately 1800 km(2), or 27 percent of the total watershed area. The impervious surface area increases approximately three-fold from 1991 to 2002. The resulting imperviousness data are used with a defined suite of geospatial data sets to simulate historical urban development and predict future urban and suburban extent, density, and growth patterns using SLEUTH model. Also examined is the increasingly important influence that urbanization and its associated imperviousness extent have on the individual drainage basins of the Tampa Bay watershed.

AB Consistent and accurate measurements of forest structure at the landscape scale are required by forest ecologists and managers for a variety of applications. Lidar remote sensing has proven to be a valuable tool for measuring these attributes in many ecosystems, including tropical, boreal, and mid-latitude forests. However, there have been few studies in montane forests. Here, we examine the ability of a large footprint lidar system to retrieve forest structural attributes in the highly variable terrain and canopy conditions of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. Specifically, we examined the impact of slope, elevation, aspect, canopy cover, crown shape, and the spatial arrangement of canopy-forming trees on the accuracy of a large footprint lidar system in retrieving canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass. We found good agreement between field and lidar measurements of height, cover, and biomass at the footprint level, and canopy height and biomass at the stand level. Differences between field and lidar measurements are mainly attributable to the spatial configuration of canopy elements and are less sensitive to topography, crown shape, or canopy cover. The accuracy of canopy cover retrieval was highly sensitive to estimates of ground cover reflectivity and to ground sampling density. The accuracy of biomass retrieval was also good, and comparable to previous efforts in other biomes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All lights reserved.

ID IKONOS IMAGERY; DAMAGE
AB The on-going mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached historic proportions. There is an operational need for efficient and cost-effective methods to identify red attack trees in these areas. In this paper, we examine the use of an unsupervised clustering 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery for the detection of mountain pine beetle red attack at sites with low and medium levels of attack. Independent validation data were collected from aerial photography and were used to determine the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery. Concentric buffers, in 1-m increments to a maximum of 4 in, were applied to red attack pixels to characterize attribute accuracy as a function of positional accuracy. When a one-pixel buffer (4 in) is applied, the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery was 71% (low attack) and 92% (medium attack). Analysis of red attack trees that were omitted in the analysis of the multispectral IKONOS image indicated that detection of red attack was most effective for larger tree crowns (diameter > 1.5 in) that were less than I I in from other red attack trees. These results demonstrate that the unsupervised classification of mountain pine beetle red attack using multispectral IKONOS imagery is an operationally viable approach.

ID LIDAR; BIOMASS; AREA
AB In the past decade, lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a powerful tool for remotely sensing forest canopy and stand structure, including the estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon storage. Numerous papers have documented the use of lidar measurements to predict important aspects of forest stand structure, including aboveground biomass. Other papers have documented the ability to transform lidar measurements to approximate common field measures, such as cover, stand height, and vertical distributions of foliage density and light transmittance. However, only a small number of existing works have thoroughly examined relationships between comprehensive assemblages of forest canopy and forest stand structure indices. In this work, canonical correlation analysis of coincident lidar and field datasets in western Oregon and Washington is used to define seven statistically significant pairs of canonical variables, each defining an axis of variation that stand and canopy structure have in common. The first major axis relates mean stand height, and related variables, to aboveground biomass. The second relates canopy cover and volume to leaf area index and stem density. The third relates canopy height variability to mean stem diameter and the basal area of deciduous species. Of the four remaining axes, three are related to contrasts between mature and old-growth stands. Canonical correlation analysis provides a method for ranking the importance of these effects, and for placing both canopy and stand structure indices within the overall covariance structure of the two datasets. In this sense, and for the study area involved, the first three factors (mean height, cover or leaf index area, height variability) represent the same kind of enhancement of lidar data that the tasseled cap indices [Crist, C.P., R.C. Cicone, 1984. A physically-based transformation of thematic mapper data-the TM tasseled cap. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 22, 256-263.] represent for optical remote sensing.

ID ACCURACY
AB Worldwide, rivers and streams are negatively impacted by sedimentation. However, there are few broad scale techniques for quantifying the sources of sediment, i.e. upland vs. river bank erosion. This research was designed, to evaluate the use of airborne LIDAR for characterizing sediment and phosphorus contributions from river bank erosion. The evaluation was done on the main stem of the Blue Earth River in southern Minnesota. Detailed topographic data were collected on an annual basis in April 2001 and 2002 over a 56 km length of the river with a helicopter mounted Topeye laser system. The raw database included X, Y, Z coordinates of laser returns sampled from the river 2 valley with a density of 1-3.3 elevations per m(2). Uniform 1 m bare earth digital elevation models were constructed by stripping vegetation laser returns and interpolation. The two models were differenced to determine volume change over time, which was then converted to mass wasting by multiplying volume change with bulk density. Mass wasting rates were further converted to sediment load based on percentage of transportable material in the bank strata. The average difference between LIDAR measured elevations and RTK GPS surveyed elevations on 5 highway bridge surfaces was 2.5 and 8.8 cm for the 2001 and 2002 scans, respectively. The elevation errors were quasi-normally distributed with standard deviation of 6.7 and 6.1 cm for 2001 and 2002, respectively. No elevation or planimetric corrections were made to the laser data before calculating mass wasting rates because it was not possible to determine the source of error or if it was uniform within and between scans. The mass wasting estimate from the LIDAR surveys varied from 23% to 56% of the sediment mass transported past the downstream gauging station depending on the range of textural material that was entrained once in the river. These estimates are in the range of values reported in the literature. Total P contribution due to bank erosion from the river reach was estimated to be 201 t/yr. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Simulations of the different components of the spectral radiation budget of structurally simple leaf and shoot canopies with varying canopy leaf area index (LAI) were performed. The aims were (1) to test a proposed parameterization of the budget using two spectrally invariant canopy structural parameters (p and p(t)) governing canopy absorption and transmittance, respectively, and (2) to incorporate the effect of within-shoot scattering in the parameterization for shoot canopies. Results showed that canopy spectral absorption and scattering were well described by a single parameter, the canopy p value or 'recollision probability', which was closely related to LAI, The relationship between p and LAI was however different in leaf and shoot canopy: e.g., at the same LAI the recollision probability was larger in the shoot canopy. It was shown that the p value of the shoot canopy could be decomposed into the p value of an individual shoot (p(sh)) and the p value of the leaf canopy with the same effective LAI (LAI(e)). The canopy p value allows calculation of canopy absorption and scattering at any given wavelength from the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient at the same wavelength. To calculate canopy reflectance, separation of the downward and upward scattered parts is needed in addition. The proposed parameter p(t) worked rather well in the leaf canopy at moderate values of LAI, but not in the coniferous shoot canopy nor at high values of LAI. However, the simulated fraction of upward scattered radiation increased in a straightforward manner with LAI, and was not particularly sensitive to the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient. Judged by this 'smooth' behavior, the existence of another kind of simple parameterization for this separation remains an interesting possibility. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and up-to-date global land cover data sets are necessary for various global change research studies including climate change, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem assessment, and environmental modeling. In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the information in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.

AB The St. Austell granite of Cornwall, UK contains internationally important deposits of kaolin (china clay), the formation of which resulted from the alteration of a composite pluton of mineralogically and texturally different primary granite units. To assess the applicability of hyperspectral remote sensing in the St. Austell china clay region, one line of airborne HyMap(R) hyperspectral data was acquired. These data were processed to correct for atmospheric and illumination effects by calibration from radiance to reflectance data, so that mineral abundance maps could be produced. Minerals associated with the primary granite and its subsequent kaolinisation were identified by image processing and used as mapping endmembers. These minerals include kaolinite, kaolinite with smectite, montmorillonite, muscovite, lepidolite (a lithium mica) and topaz.
   Hyperspectral data analysis allowed for the identification of the different primary granite units. The spectrally observed compositional differences of the biotite and topaz granite units of the region allowed for fingerprinting of the source of mined waste material as originating from specific pits. The majority of waste tips in the region originate from the nearest china clay workings. However, waste material used in the construction of a mica dam and also as backfill in a disused pit is successfully identified to have been transported across a mapped granite boundary for storage.
   The effect of mining and mineral processing on the abundance and spatial distribution of minerals in the region is also evident. Waste tips are classified as containing the greatest abundance of mica. This distribution results from the separation of kaolinite during the mineral processing stages. Kaolinite in lower abundance, however, is also identified within these waste areas and is the result of a less than 100% recovery by mining and processing. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring crop condition and yields at regional scales using imagery from operational satellites remains a challenge because of the problem in scaling local yield simulations to the regional scales. NOAA AVHRR satellite imagery has been traditionally used to monitor vegetation changes that are used indirectly to assess crop condition and yields. Additionally, the I-km spatial resolution of NOAA AVHRR is not adequate for monitoring crops at the field level. Imagery from the new MODIS sensor onboard the NASA Terra satellite offers an excellent opportunity for daily coverage at 250-m resolution, which is adequate to monitor field sizes are larger than 25 ha. A field study was conducted in the predominantly corn and soybean area of Iowa to evaluate the applicability of the 8-day MODIS composite imagery in operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate the models. The MODIS data was used in a radiative transfer model to estimate LAI through the season. LAI was integrated into a climate-based crop simulation model to scale from local simulation of crop development and responses to a regional scale. Simulations of corn and soybean yields at a 1.6 X 1.6-km(2) grid scale were comparable to county yields reported by the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Weekly changes in soil moisture for the top I-m profile were also simulated as part of the crop model as one of the critical parameters influencing crop condition and yields. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Wildland fires burn large areas of the earth's land surface annually, causing significant environmental damage and danger to human health. In order to mitigate the effects, and to better manage the incidence of such fires, fire behaviour models are used to predict, among other things, the likelihood of ignition, the rate of spread, and the intensity and duration of burning. A key input parameter to these models is the amount of water in the vegetation, described as the fuel moisture content (FMC). A number of studies have shown that vegetation indices (VI) calculated from red and NIR reflectances may be used to map spatial and temporal variation in FMC ill a range of fire-prone environments, with varying degrees of success. Strong empirical relationships may be established between VI and FMC over grasslands, yet over shrublands and forests, the relationships are weaker. If FMC is to be estimated with greater accuracy and consistency than is currently achieved, it is necessary to fully understand the relative contribution that spatial and temporal variation in the various biophysical and geometrical variables make to reflectance variability at the leaf and canopy level.
   This paper uses a modelling approach to investigate the sensitivity of reflectance data at leaf and canopy level to variation in the biophysical variables that are used to compute FMC. At the leaf level, the results show that the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in leaf water and dry matter content, used to compute FMC, is greatest in the SWIR and NIR, respectively. Variation in FMC has no effect ill the visible wavelengths. At the canopy level, the results show that the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in leaf water and dry matter content is heavily dependent upon the type of model used and the range of variation over which the variables are tested. In the longer wavelengths of the SWIR, the competing influence of variable leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover, and solar zenith angle is shown to be greater than that at the shorter wavelengths of the SWIR and NIR. Empirical relationships between the normalised difference water index (NDWI) and FMC are shown to be weaker than that with canopy water content. However, when the range of the variables under study is more limited, useful empirical relationships between FMC and remotely sensed VI may be established. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY; QUALITY; SEA
AB In this paper we proposed a composite depth of penetration (DOP) approach to excluding bottom reflectance in mapping water quality parameters from Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data in the shallow coastal zone of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. Three DOPs were calculated from TM1, TM2 and TM3, in conjunction with bathymetric data, at an accuracy ranging from +/-5% to +/-23%. These depths were used to segment the image into four DOP zones. Sixteen in situ water samples were collected concurrently with the recording of the satellite image. These samples were used to establish regression models for total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration and Secchi depth with respect to a particular DOP zone. Containing identical bands and their transformations for both parameters, the models are linear for TSS concentration, logarithmic for Secchi depth. Based on these models, TSS concentration and Secchi depth were mapped from the satellite image in respective DOP zones. Their mapped patterns are consistent with the in situ observed ones. Spatially, overestimation and underestimation of the parameters are restricted to localised areas but related to the absolute value of the parameters. The mapping was accomplished more accurately using multiple DOP zones than using a single zone in shallower areas. The composite DOP approach enables the mapping to be extended to areas as shallow as <3 m. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The eddy covariance technique provides valuable information on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, ecosystem respiration, and gross primary production (GPP) at a variety of CO2 eddy flux tower sites. In this paper, we develop a new, satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to estimate the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of evergreen needleleaf forests. The VPM model uses two improved vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)). We used multi-year (1998-2001) images from the VEGETATION sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite and CO2 flux data from a CO2 eddy flux tower site in Howland, Maine, USA. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM model agreed well with observed GPP in 1998-2001 at the Howland Forest. These results demonstrate the potential of the satellite-driven VPM model for scaling-up GPP of forests at the CO2 flux tower sites, a key component for the study of the carbon cycle at regional and global scales.

AB The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument is designed to provide global imagery at nine discrete viewing angles and four visible/near-infrared spectral bands. The MISR standard products include green leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). These parameters are being routinely processed from MISR data at the Langley Atmospheric Sciences Data Center (ASDC) since October 2002. This paper describes the research basis for transitioning the MISR LAI/FPAR product from beta to provisional status. The quality and spatial coverage of MISR land surface reflectances that are input to the algorithm determine the quality and spatial coverage of the LAI and FPAR products. Therefore, considerable efforts have been expended to analyze the performance of the algorithm as a function of uncertainties of MISR surface reflectances and to establish the convergence property of the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm, namely, that the reliability and accuracy of the retrievals increase with increased input information content and accuracy. An additional objective of the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm is classification of global vegetation into biome types-information that is usually an input to remote sensing algorithms that use single-angle observations. An upper limit of uncertainties of MISR surface reflectances that allows discrimination between biomes, minimizes the impact of biome misidentification on LAI retrievals, and maximizes the spatial coverage of retrievals was estimated. Algorithm performance evaluated on a limited set of MISR data from Africa suggests valid LAI retrievals and correct biome identification in about 20% of the pixels, on an average, given the current level of uncertainties in the MISR surface reflectance data. The other 80% of the LAI values are retrieved using incorrect information about the type of biome. However, the use of multi-angle data minimizes the impact of biome misidentification on LAI retrievals; that is, with a probability of about 70%, uncertainties in LAI retrievals due to biome misclassification do not exceed uncertainties in the observations. We also discuss in depth the parameters that characterize LAI/FPAR product quality-such as quality assessment (QA) that is available to the users along with the product. The analysis of the MISR LAI/FPAR product presented here demonstrates the physical basis of the radiative transfer algorithm used in the retrievals and, importantly, that the reliability and accuracy of the retrievals increase with increased input information content and accuracy. Further improvements in the quality of MISR surface reflectances are therefore expected to lead to LAI and FPAR retrievals of increasing quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SATELLITE IMAGERY
AB Automatic land cover classification from satellite images is an important topic in many remote sensing applications. In this paper, we consider three different statistical approaches to tackle this problem: two of them, namely the well-known maximum likelihood classification (ML) and the support vector machine (SVM), are noncontextual methods. The third one, iterated conditional modes (ICM), exploits spatial context by using a Markov random field. We apply these methods to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data from Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands. Due to the size and the strong relief of the island, ground truth data could be collected only sparsely by examination of test areas for previously defined land cover classes.
   We show that after application of an unsupervised clustering method to identify subclasses, all classification algorithms give satisfactory results (with statistical overall accuracy of about 90%) if the model parameters are selected appropriately. Although being superior to ML theoretically, both SVM and ICM have to be used carefully: ICM is able to improve ML, but when applied for too many iterations, spatially small sample areas are smoothed away, leading to statistically slightly worse classification results. SVM yields better statistical results than ML, but when investigated visually, the classification result is not completely satisfying. This is due to the fact that no a priori information on the frequency of occurrence of a class was used in this context, which helps ML to limit the unlikely classes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leaf-off individual trees in a deciduous forest in the eastern USA are detected and analysed in small footprint, high sampling density lidar data. The data were acquired February 1, 2001, using a SAAB TopEye laser profiling system, with a sampling density of approximately 12 returns per square meter. The sparse and complex configuration of the branches of the leaf-off forest provides sufficient returns to allow the detection of the trees as individual objects and to analyse their vertical structures. Initially, for the detection of the individual trees only, the lidar data are first inserted in a 21) digital image, with the height as the pixel value or brightness level. The empty pixels are interpolated, and height outliers are removed. Gaussian smoothing at different scales is performed to create a three-dimensional scale-space structure. Blob signatures based on second-order image derivatives are calculated, and then normalised so they can be compared at different scale-levels. The grey-level blobs with the strongest normalised signatures are selected within the scale-space structure. The support regions of the blobs are marked one-at-a-time in the segmentation result image with higher priority for stronger blobs. The segmentation results of six individual hectare plots are assessed by a computerised, objective method that makes use of a ground reference data set of the individual tree crowns. For analysis of individual trees, a subset of the original laser returns is selected within each tree crown region of the canopy reference map. Indices based on moments of the first four orders, maximum value and number of canopy and ground returns, are estimated. The indices are derived separately for height and laser reflectance of branches for the two echoes. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are detected for numerous indices for three major native species groups: oaks (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tuliperifera). Tree species classification results of different indices suggest a moderate to high degree of accuracy using single or multiple variables. Furthermore, the maximum tree height is compared to ground reference tree height for 48 sample trees and a 1.1-m standard error (R-2 = 68% (adj.)) within the test-site is observed.

AB Growth of the surface temperature urban heat island (UHI) of Houston, TX is determined by comparing two sets of heat island measurements taken 12 years apart. Individual heat island characteristics are calculated from radiative temperature maps obtained using the split-window infrared channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar-orbiting satellites. Eighty-two nighttime scenes taken between 1985 and 1987 are compared to 125 nighttime scenes taken between 1999 and 2001. Analysis of the UHI characteristics from these two intervals reveals a mean growth in magnitude of 0.8 K, or 35%. The growth of the mean area of the UHI is found to range between 170 and 650 km(2), or from 38% to 88%, depending on the method of analysis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Biomass quantification of Andean wetland forages using ERS satellite SAR
   data for optimizing livestock management

AB Spatio-temporal information on the biomass of totora reeds and bofedal water-saturated Andean grasslands, which are a critical forage resource for smallholders in Bolivia's Altiplano, is needed to promote their protection and improve livestock management. Satellite radar data appear well adapted to map biomass and to monitor biomass changes in this environment for two reasons: (a) the C-band (5.3 GHz) radar data is particularly sensitive to vegetation biomass when the canopy is over an underlying water surface or a water-saturated soil; this is through the dominant scattering mechanisms involving vegetation-water surface interaction; (b) the cloud cover during the growing period which corresponds to the rainy season. This paper assesses the potential of ERS satellite radar data for retrieving biomass information, which is spatially highly variable owing to the numerous small, nonuniform areas of totora harvesting and bofedal grazing. Ground data, including vegetation humid and dry biomass, were collected over 18 months during satellite descending passes at 12 sites located between the Eastern Cordillera and Titicaca Lake, representing three vegetation units: shoreline and inland totoras, and Puna bofedales.
   ERS-SAR data were analysed as a function of plant biomass at homogeneous totora and bofedal areas. Because of the small size of these areas (typically 20 x 30 m), the SAR data need to be processed using an advanced multitemporal filter which improves radiometric resolution without significant reduction of the spatial resolution. The radar backscattering coefficient (sigmadegrees in dB) measured by ERS was found to be sensitive at both per site and per vegetation unit levels to humid and dry biomass of totora reeds and bofedal grasslands. The sensitivity of the signal to biomass variation is high for dry biomass ranges less than 1 kg/m(2) for totora, and less than 2 kg/m(2) for bofedal. The corresponding biomass maps provided by inversion of SAR data are valuable information for livestock management for three critical periods: after the calving season (October-November), when animal pressure is most significant; toward the end of the rainy season (March-April), as an indicator of coming trends to promote the adoption of measures aimed at preventing shortages during the winter season; in the middle of the winter dry season (June-July), to adjust animal charge.

AB It has been found that, at the certain solar and sensor-viewing geometry and for certain atmosphere conditions, discontinuity lines appear in the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) retrieved atmospheric and ocean color products. Such discontinuity lines, which do not happen very often, are apparently artifacts from the atmospheric correction scheme that uses the lookup tables to process SeaWiFS data. In this paper, a brief description of the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm, in particular, the technique that is used in retrieving the aerosol models and aerosol radiance contributions in the visible wavelengths, is provided. Results from some specific simulations that explain the causes of the discontinuity lines in the derived products are presented. We show that these discontinuities appearing in the derived SeaWiFS products are the result of the atmospheric correction due to aerosol model effects. To remove the discontinuities, a simple modification to the current atmospheric correction algorithm is proposed and tested with both simulated and real SeaWiFS data. The modification has been implemented in the SeaWiFS fourth data reprocessing in August 2002. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of the distribution of vegetation on the landscape can be used to investigate ecosystem functioning. The sizes and movements of animal populations can be linked to resources provided by different plant species. This paper demonstrates the application of imaging spectroscopy to the study of vegetation in Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone) using spectral feature analysis of data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). AVIRIS data, acquired on August 7, 1996, were calibrated to surface reflectance using a radiative transfer model and field reflectance measurements of a ground calibration site. A spectral library of canopy reflectance signatures was created by averaging pixels of the calibrated AVIRIS data over areas of known forest and nonforest vegetation cover types in Yellowstone. Using continuum removal and least squares fitting algorithms in the US Geological Survey's Tetracorder expert system, the distributions of these vegetation types were determined by comparing the absorption features of vegetation in the spectral library with the spectra from the AVIRIS data. The 0.68 mum chlorophyll absorption feature and leaf water absorption features, centered near 0.98 and 1.20 mum, were analyzed. Nonforest cover types of sagebrush, grasslands, willows, sedges, and other wetland vegetation were mapped in the Lamar Valley of Yellowstone. Conifer cover types of lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, Douglas fir, and mixed Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir forests were spectrally discriminated and their distributions mapped in the AVIRIS images. In the Mount Washburn area of Yellowstone, a comparison of the AVIRIS map of forest cover types to a map derived from air photos resulted in an overall agreement of 74.1% (kappa statistic = 0.62).

AB The continuous fields Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover products are 500-m sub-pixel representations of basic vegetation characteristics including tree, herbaceous and bare ground cover. Our previous approach to deriving continuous fields used a linear mixture model based on spectral endmembers of forest, grassland and bare ground training. We present here a new approach for estimating percent tree cover employing continuous training data over the whole range of tree cover. The continuous training data set is derived by aggregating high-resolution tree cover to coarse scales and is used with multi-temporal metrics based on a full year of coarse resolution satellite data. A regression tree algorithm is used to predict the dependent variable of tree cover based on signatures from the multi-temporal metrics. The automated algorithm was tested globally using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, as a full year of MODIS data has not yet been collected. A root mean square error (rmse) of 9.06% tree cover was found from the global training data set. Preliminary MODIS products are also presented, including a 250-m map of the lower 48 United States and 500-m maps of tree cover and leaf type for North America. Results show that the new approach used with MODIS data offers an improved characterization of land cover. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the launch of NASA's Terra satellite and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operational Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo products are now being made available to the scientific community. The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (MBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results. These early beta and provisional products auger well for the routine production of stable MODIS-derived BRDF parameters, nadir reflectances, and albedos for use by the global observation and modeling communities.

AB The Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (O&SI SAF) project includes the development of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) retrieval algorithms for infrared radiometers. The algorithm definition stage presented in this paper includes three steps: building of representative simulated brightness temperature databases, definition and analysis of formalisms on simulated brightness temperatures, and tests of these formalisms on a Matchup Database (MDB). A cloud-free, latitude equally distributed simulation database has been built to determine SST algorithms, which were further checked on a NOAA-14 latitude equally distributed validation database build from the Pathfinder MDBs. The tests showed that the presence of clouds in the training database increases the bias, while an underrepresentation of low-latitude profiles in the training database increases the standard deviation. The use of a cloud-free, latitude equally distributed training database reduced both the standard deviation in the algorithms and the bias consistently over the whole range of latitudes. The effect of the instrumental noise has been assessed and algorithms using noisy simulated data have been tested: they appear much more useful at daytime than at nighttime. Indications suggest that such noise algorithms should be more adaptive in atypical situations and that they should perform better than noise-free algorithms in the presence of cloud contamination or aerosols. The systematic procedure allowed us to test a large number of different algorithms. We determined that the best possible theoretical accuracy that may be obtained with NOAA-14 derived SSTs against buoy measurements on a global scale is 0.4 K. The successive steps that were performed in this study (cloud-free training database, algorithm determination, and noise scheme) allowed us to obtain retrievals with a 0.57 K standard deviation at both daytime and nighttime. These performances appears to be comparable or better than those obtained with algorithms directly derived by regression against in situ measurements. This proves that simulation-based SST retrievals are feasible and accurate when sufficient care is taken in the constitution of the training database. The effect of maritime aerosols has also been assessed and was found to be generally of little consequences for SST retrievals: a positive bias found to be lower than 0.08 K and no effect on the standard deviation. This bias is overestimated when maritime aerosols are used in the training of the algorithms using radiative transfer models. Current SST products (North Atlantic Regional and high latitudes) based on NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 data and routine validations against drifting buoys are available at (http://www.meteorologie.eu.org/safo).

AB In order to correctly interpret the surface information with remotely sensed data, the extinction effects of the atmosphere must be appropriately removed. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) serves as an important parameter in describing this effect. Several factors, such as the satellite observation geometry, terrain geometry, temporal variation of canopy, and so forth, produce errors in the AOD estimation. This study strives to avoid such errors by introducing an "optimal distance number" into the structure function method that has been developed previously in estimating the AOD. The results of our experiment measured by a ground-based sunphotometer showed that the average errors of the estimated AOD values was reduced from 40% to 11% after the "optimal distance number" was used, indicating a significant improvement.

AB Studies over the past 25 years have shown that measurements of surface reflectance and temperature (termed optical remote sensing) are useful for monitoring crop and soil conditions. Far less attention has been given to the use of radar imagery, even though synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have the advantages of cloud penetration, all-weather coverage, high spatial resolution, day/night acquisitions, and signal independence of the solar illumination angle. In this study, we obtained coincident optical and SAR images of an agricultural area to investigate the use of SAR imagery for farm management. The optical and SAR data were normalized to indices ranging from 0 to 1 based on the meteorological conditions and sun/sensor geometry for each date to allow temporal analysis. Using optical images to interpret the response of SAR backscatter (sigmadegrees) to soil and plant conditions, we found that SAR sigmadegrees was sensitive to variations in field tillage, surface soil moisture, vegetation density, and plant litter. In an investigation of the relation between SAR sigmadegrees and soil surface roughness, the optical data were used for two purposes: (1) to filter the SAR images to eliminate fields with substantial vegetation cover and/or high surface soil moisture conditions, and (2) to evaluate the results of the investigation. For dry, bare soil fields, there was a significant correlation (r(2) = .67) between normalized SAR sigmadegrees and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, due to the sensitivity of both measurements to surface roughness. Recognizing the limitations of optical remote sensing data due to cloud interference and atmospheric attenuation, the findings of this study encourage further studies of SAR imagery for crop and soil assessment.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Editorial Material
ID ERUPTION; CLOUDS
AB Prata et al. [Remote Sens. Environ. (2001)] state that our analysis [Remote Sens. Environ. 72 (2000) 191] "suffers from a fundamental flaw in its methodology and numerous errors in fact and interpretation." We assert that Prata et al. [Remote Sens. Environ. (2001)] are incorrect. Our original analysis, augmented herein, shows that from an aviation safety perspective, their T-4-T-5 volcanic ash detection algorithm does not meet the requirements of the aviation industry. For arbitrary satellite scenes, their algorithm: (1) underdetects airborne volcanic ash; (2) yields numerous false alarms; and (3) does not satisfy the 5 min warning imperative mandated by the aviation industry. Independent evidence and unique in situ validation data from the NASA DC-8 encounter with volcanic products from the recent Hekla eruption further support our original analysis and conclusions. Factors affecting the usefulness of their algorithm within the context of aviation safety include, but are not limited to, ambient atmospheric water vapor, ground and juvenile water in the magma as well as its chemical composition, cloud cover, atmospheric ice crystals, and the general applicability of the theoretical assumptions underlying their T-4-T-5 volcanic ash detection algorithm. The new analyses presented herein, as well as those of Simpson et al. [Remote Sens. Environ. 72 (2000) 191], show that new approaches are needed to address the complex problem of accurate and rapid detection of airborne volcanic ash. 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, high-spatial, low-temporal scale visible remote sensing data were used to calibrate an ecosystem model (EM) for semiarid perennial grasslands. The model was driven by daily meteorological data and simulated plant growth and water budget on the same time step. The model was coupled with a canopy reflectance model to yield the time course of shortwave radiometric profiles. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+) images from 10 consecutive years were used to refine the model on a spatially distributed basis. A calibration procedure, which minimized the difference between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) simulated from the coupled model and measured by the TM and ETM+ sensors, yielded the spatial distribution of an unknown parameter and initial condition. Accuracy of model products, such as daily aboveground biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and soil water content, was assessed by comparing them with field measurements. The promising results suggest that this approach could provide spatially distributed information about both vegetation and soil conditions for day-to-day grassland management.

AB Land surface broadband albedo is a critical variable for many scientific applications. High-resolution narrowband satellite observations contain important information that enables us to map land surface albedo globally, and validate the coarse-resolution albedo products from the broadband sensors using ground "point/plot" measurements. However, the conversions from narrowband to broadband albedos of a general surface type have not been well established Most studies compute total shortwave albedo based on either the empirical relations between surface total shortwave albedo measurements and satellite observations or radiative transfer simulations with the limited number of surface reflectance spectra because of the computational constraints. As a result, many conversion formulae for the same sensors are quite different. In this study, we applied an approach that decouples surface reflectance spectra from the real-time radiative transfer simulations so that many different surface reflectance spectra and the atmospheric conditions can be effectively incorporated. The conversion formulae. based on extensive radiative transfer simulations, are provided in this paper for calculating the total shortwave albedo, total-, direct-, and diffuse-visible, and near-infrared broadband albedos for several narrowband sensors, including ASTER, AVHRR, ETM+/TM: GOES, MODIS, MISR, POLDER, and VEGETATION. Some of these formulae were compared with the published formulae of the same sensors and further validations using Extensive ground measurements will be discussed in the companion paper.

TI Anisotropic reflectance of snow observed from space over the arctic and
   its effect on solar energy balance
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SEA-ICE; ANTARCTIC SNOW; CALIBRATION; SURFACE
AB Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images of arctic snow reflectance, observed from different satellite passes with the closest pass times on the same day, show different patterns that are related to the sun-satellite geometry. The variation of snow reflectance with view angle can be large or small, depending on the view geometry. Thus, the snow reflectances of a common target, observed from different viewing angles, can be very different and hard to compare. Unfortunately, none represent the actual physical snow albedo, and the error in the converted broadband top of atmosphere (TOA) albedo could easily be larger than 10%, which implies a great effect on the solar radiation balance at TOA. For an accurate estimate of the solar energy budget from satellite observations, and anisotropic correction is required not only for those reflectance images with obvious angular variation, but also for seemingly "isotropic" scenes because this latter case might incorrectly estimate the albedo under general conditions. Two methods, on based on a radiative transfer model and the other on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) experimental data, have been applied to AVHRR data to implement and anisotropic correction. The results show that both methods can remove the systematic variation of snow reflectance with view angle and can significantly reduce the large observed differences in reflectances from different satellite observations of a common snow target. The radiative transfer model-based method, however, unlike the NOAA experimental method, corrects the reflectances in the two AVHRR channels separately, has higher angular resolution than the NOAA experimental method, and can account for variations in snow condition (e.g., grain size). Moreover, the model-based anisotropic correction shows superior self-consistency compared to that produced by NOAA's experimental-based method. Finally, the model-based method provides a sound theoretical basis for anisotropic correction of satellite images of arctic snow reflectance. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

TI Structure analysis and classification of boreal forests using airborne

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; MULTIANGLE; SOUTHERN; AREA
AB A new approach Is presented for deriving vegetation canopy structural characteristics from hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. The methodology is based on the relationship between spectral variability of BRDF effects and canopy geometry Tests with data acquired with the Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) over Canadian boreal forests during the BOREAS campaign show that vegetation structural characteristics can be derived from the spectral variability of BRDF effects. In addition, the incorporation of both BRDF effects and hyperspectral resolution data substantially improve the classification accuracy. Best classification results are obtained when hyperspectral resolution and BRDF data are combined, but the improvement is not consistent for all classes. For example, adding BRDF information to hyperspectral data increases the overall classification accuracy for a sirs-class fen site from 37.8% to 44.7%. The addition, however reduces the accuracy for the jack pine class from 43.6% to 28.8%. These new findings provide evidence for improved capabilities for applications of MISR and MODIS data. The spectral resolution of MODIS is expected to be sufficient to derive canopy structural information based on the spectral variability of BRDF effects, and for MISR a significant improvement of classification accuracies can be anticipated from the combination of nadir reflectance and off-nadir data.

ID SATELLITE IMAGE DATA
AB Data cumulation ir a digital image processing technique in which several scenes of the same area, taken under similar viewing-conditions; are ca combined into a single image of enhanced spatial and radiometric resolution, This is effected by the reduction of aliasing in the along-scan and along-track sampling of scenes, and by the reduction of noise content in the combined scene, The technique hinges on two key steps: accurate image coregistration to a precision significantly better than I pixel; and cumulation of multiple image data grids (derived from the individual images) into a single image. We report here on the development and initial results of the application of data cumulation using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images of the polar ice sheets. The process can improve the real spatial resolution of AVHRR data in the along-scan direction from 1000 m to 650 m,and in the along-track direction from 1400 m to 700 m, justifying a decrease in pixel size to about 500 nz. The technique is demonstrated in art image of a portion of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. (C) Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Mislocations in the acquisition of field measurements may affect estimates of functional relations between field variables and their remotely sensed radiometric responses. Under such field errors least squares (LS) estimators perform poorly because they present significant systematic biases. New statistics have been developed to achieve better estimates of parameters of the functional model when such errors occur. An example used thematic mapper data and field measurements from a forest inventory. Bias and consistency of new statistics are analyzed with extensive simulations, showing their higher reliability compared with LS statistics. Finally, the effects of non-spatially and spatially related field errors are compared. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB AVIRUS (Advanced Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) bands were simulated from laboratory spectra to test their performance in analyzing soil properties from a semiarid region. Multivariate analysis, specifically principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis, ns well as band depth analysis were applied to study the effect of organic matter iron content, and texture in a set of samples from two valleys in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, California. Results showed that total iron and organic matter content were the main factors affecting spectral shape, although sand content significantly affected the spectral contrast of the absorption features. It was shown as well that the elimination of the atmospheric water bands from, the analysis did not strongly affect the retrieval of spectral information related to these properties.

AB Before being used in scientific investigations and policy decisions, thematic maps constructed from remotely sensed data should be subjected to a statistically rigorous accuracy assessment. The three basic components of an accuracy assessment are: 1) the sampling design used to select the reference sample; 2) the response design used to obtain the reference land-cover classification for each sampling unit; and 3) the estimation and analysis procedures. We discuss options available for each of these components. A statistically rigorous assessment requires both a probability sampling design and statistically consistent estimators of accuracy parameters, along with a response design determined in accordance with features of the mapping and classification process such as the land-cover classification scheme, minimum mapping unit, and spatial scale of the mapping.

AB Vector radiative transfer (VRT) nt the DMSP SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) channels (from 19 to 85 GHz) Sor multilayer of discrete scatterers as a model of snowpack/vegetation canopy is developed. Using the physical optics approximation, the scattering, extinction coefficients, and phase function of VRT equation for vegetation canopy are derived. The dense medium VRT is applied to the snow layer. Numerical results of two coupled VRT equations simulate scattering and emission signature from snowpack/vegetation canopy at SSM/I channels. Numerical results are applied to simulation and analysis of the SSM/I observations over China's northeast forest and Tibet Naqu pasture areas. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Plant response to iron deficiency has been extensively studied, but little is known concerning the effects of iron deficiency-induced modifications in leaf spectral properties. Spectral changes in corn and sunflower plants grown in nutrient solutions containing five iron rates from mg L(-1) 0 to 4 mg L(-1) were therefore investigated. In both corn and sunflower, iron deficiency decreased leaf dry weight, area, iron concentration, decreased leaf dry weight, area, iron concentration, chlorophyll a and b concentrations, and absorptance, increased reflectance and transmittance, and shifted the red edge position of reflectance curves towards shorter wavelengths. Leaf iron concentration was well correlated with leaf chlorophyll a (r = 0.92) and b (r = 0.93) concentrations across crop species. Reflectance was a nonlinear inverse function, and absorptance was a nonlinear inverse function, and absorptance was a nonlinear increasing function of leaf iron concentration and leaf chlorophyll a concentration. Corn was more sensitive to iron deficiency than sunflower and corn required higher iron concentration than sunflower for optimal growth. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

TI Detection of solar-excited chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf
   photosynthetic capacity using a Fraunhofer Line Radiometer
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A Fraunhofer, Line Radiometer (FLR) measured solar excited chlorophyll a fluorescence (F) as an indicator of photosynthetic capacity in leaves of Washingtonia robusta (palm) and Vitis vinifera (grape). Under clear skies, the FLR utilized the Fraunhofer line-depth principle (FLDP) to detect F within the O-2 absorption band centered at 687 nm wavelength. On 20 April, the morning after soils were treated with the photosystem II herbicide DCMU, F increased significantly (p = 0.05) in palm, while Leaf reflectance at 687 nm (R) did not change. By 21 April, leaf herbicide concentrations were lethal. Increased F and R in palm corresponded with net photosynthetic rates near zero. Photosynthesis in grape also decreased greatly, but F and R remained similar to the controls. Results for palm indicate that F could be measured while leaves remained exposed to full sunlight, and support earlier work to indicate a potential role for the FLDP in remotely sensing F and photosynthetic capacity.

AB Biophysical inversion oi remotely sensed data is con strained by the complexity of the remote sensing process. Variations in sensor response associated with solar and sensor geometries, surface directional reflectance, topography, atmospheric absorption and scattering, and sensor electrical-optical engineering interact in complex manners that are difficult to deconvolve and quantify in individual images or in time series of images. We have developed a model of the remote sensing process to allow systematic examination of these factors. The model is composed of three main components, including a ground scene model, an atmospheric model, and a sensor model, and may be used to simulate imagery produced by instruments such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. Using this model, we examine the effect of subpixel variance in leaf area index (LAI) on relationships among LAI, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). To do this, we use data from the first ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) to parameterize ground scene properties within the model. Our results demonstrate interactions between sensor spatial resolution and spatial autocorrelation In ground scenes that produce a variety of effects in the relationship between both LAI and FPAR and NDVI. Specifically, sensor regularization, nonlinearity in the relationship between LAI and NDVI, and scaling the NDVI all influence the range, variance, and uncertainty associated with estimates of LAI and FPAR inverted from simulated NDVI data. These results have important implications for parameterization of land surface process models using biophysical variables such as LAI and FPAR estimated from remotely sensed data.

AB During the MAC-VI campaign, bidirectional reflectance measurements were taken on a cotton crop in order to analyze the effects of sun and view geometries in the wavebands and in the viewing vertical plane of the SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) instrument. The bidirectional reflectance was measured using a CIMEL SPOT simulation radiometer fixed on a goniometric apparatus 2 m above the top of the crop. Data are presented in terms of bidirectional reflectance factors relative to nadir reflectance for 15 view angles (- 70 degrees to + 70 degrees) and for 12 solar zenith (73-26 degrees) angles. Results show major variations according to Sun position and backscattering or forward scattering observations. The relative reflectance factor of the cotton varies from 0.7 to 1.9 throughout one day. Measurements are compared to the output of a geometrical model where cotton rows are simulated by spheroidal cylinders sitting on an horizontal surface. The relative reflectance factor is calculated according to the global structure of the rows which is divided into illuminated and shaded facets viewed by the radiometer for each view and solar angle. The analysis of comparative results shows a good agreement between predicted and measured data in the three SPOT HRV wavebands.

AB Remotely sensed images derived from several sources were combined with in situ samples to estimate suspended sediments discharged from three rivers into Mayaguez Bay, Puerto Rico. Multispectral data were acquired using the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). CAMS data were used to produce spatial maps of suspended sediment concentrations in Mayaguez Bay during low to moderate discharge for 1990-1992. Images of band cover/land use during 1975 and 1985 were generated from a supervised density slicing technique applied to a mosaicked image of digitized aerial photos and from an unsupervised classification of the TM image. A geomorphic hydrologic model was used to simulate runoff and sediment yield from the drainage basin of the Guanajibo river; because land cover within the basin did not change significantly during 1975-1985, the hydrologic model provided estimates of sediment discharged by the Guanajibo river into the bay during this time period. Growth rates of the coral Montastrea annularis of Rodiguez reef were obtained from a previous study. Annual growth rates as determined from coral banding decreased significantly (r = 0.69) with increased sediment loading to the bay (tons/year). Evidence from remote sensing and hydrologic modeling suggests that sediment reaches the reef only during episodic, high-discharge events. During low to moderate discharge, sediments, both suspended within the river plume and resuspended sediments, are restricted to the near-shore regions by the prevailing circulation. Hence, a direct relationship between river runoff and coral growth rates was established in this study.

AB This article investigates the scatterometer radar cross-section distributions and wind stress spatial variability across a sea surface temperature (SST) front under different wind directions and synoptic scale atmospheric forcings. Shipboard meteorological measurements in concert with airborne K-u-band (14.0 Ghz) rotating scatterometer data show evidence of mesoscale circulation near the front during low ambient winds (4 m/s) blowing from the cold side of the SST front to the warm side. The mesoscale signature is characterized by a 25-35 degrees counterclockwise shift in the wind direction and a maximum of 4.9 dB increase in the backscattering cross section across the front. The mesoscale circulation is reduced when the wind direction reverses, and the ambient wind flow increases to 13.6 m/s. The maximum cross-section change across the front is reduced to 3.6 dB. The azimuthal characteristics of the scatterometer data are compared with the predictions of two scatterometer model functions. According to the models, the anisotropy of the short waves is inversely related to the wind speed, such that the short wave directional spreads tend to broaden as the wind speed increases. The scatterometer data, however, show greater short-wave anisotropy at the higher wind speeds. This measured difference could be caused by current velocity changes or by longwave directional changes across the front.

AB An approach to combining remote sensing spectral measurements with an ecosystem process model is presented. In this approach, the ecosystem model is not bound by the sole use of satellite data, but integrates the latter in an explicit formulation of the main processes of vegetation functioning. A close analysis of the relationships between processes described by the model and spectral measurements can therefore be carried out, and the capability of the model to be driven by remote sensing can also be investigated. This first article presents a regional ecosystem process model for Sahelian regions. The model describes a herbaceous layer composed of only annual species. The processes of the soil-plant-atmosphere system, such as water fluxes in the soil, evaporation, transpiration, photosynthesis, respiration, senescence, bitter production, and litter decomposition at the soil surface, are modeled. Moreover, structural parameters such as vegetation cover fraction, LAI, and canopy height, which are essential parameters for coupling with physical models of reflectivity, are also simulated. Comparison with aboveground biomass measured between 1976 and 1992 at a regional scale in two different regions of the Sahel, namely, Ferlo in Senegal and Gourma in Mall, shows that the model is able to simulate the temporal evolution of the aboveground biomass components.

ID MODEL; REFLECTANCE
AB Bidirectional gap fraction Po(z,OMEGA1,OMEGA2) is an important variable to be estimated for canopy reflectance calculations. In the recent years, models have been developed to describe bidirectional gap fraction, taking into account the finite size of the phytoelements. However, we lack from experimental data the means to evaluate such models. In this article, we present a method that enables direct measurement of bidirectional gap fraction. The method is based on digital analysis of upward-looking hemispherical photographs taken from inside the canopy. Measurements made on a maize canopy were compared to calculations with the model by Kuusk (1985). Agreement between calculated and experimental data was sufficiently good. However, experimental data show that some correlation between Po(z,OMEGA1) and Po(z,OMEGA2) subsists for a range of angle much wider than predicted by simulations.

ID CALIBRATION
AB Two regions at White Sands Missile Range with different surface reflectance characteristics were studied from November 1988 through December 1991. Continuous 6-min measurements of surface albedo on the alkali flats were used to produce a clear-sky surface climatology for the period. Based on the flats measurements, estimates for a dunes albedo were made using calibrated satellite data. In addition to the surface albedo history, sample bidirectional reflectance characteristics in terms of anisotropic factors for the alkali flats region are also presented. Results show that the flats region is non-Lambertian characterized by large anisotropic factors at high solar and viewing zenith angles. The flat's albedo is highly influenced by surface moisture conditions. Reflectance proper-ties of the dunes are complicated by dune shadows, surface irregularities, seasonal vegetative coverage, and soil moisture.

ID FIELD EXPERIMENT FIFE
AB The Biospheric Sciences Branch, within the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, has assembled two data sets for free dissemination to the remote sensing research community. One data set, referred to as the Retrospective Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) Data Collection, is a collection of bidirectional reflectance and supporting biophysical measurements of surfaces ranging in diversity from bare soil to heavily forested canopies. The other data collection, resulting from measurements made in association with the Forest Ecosystems Dynamics Multisensor Aircraft Campaign (FED MAC), contains data that are relevant to ecosystem process models, particularly those which have been modified to incorporate remotely sensed data. Both of these collections are being made available to the science community at large in order to facilitate model development, validation, and usage. These data collections are subsets which have been compiled and consolidated from individual researchers or from several large data set collections including: the First international Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE); FED MAC; the Superior National Forest Project (SNF); the Geologic Remote Sensing Field Experiment (GRSFE); and Agricultural Inventories through Space Applications of Remote Sensing (AgriStars). The complete, stand-alone FED MAC Data Collection contains atmospheric, vegetation, and soils data acquired during field measurement campaigns conducted at international Papers' Northern Experimental Forest located approximately 40 km north of Bangor, Maine. Reflectance measurements at the canopy, branch, and needle level are available, along with detailed canopy architectural measurements. Both the BRDF and FED MAC Data Collections are available on MS-DOS compatible 3.5-in. Floppy disks, along with detailed documentation of the instrumentation and methodology used to make the measurements, descriptions of the spatial and temporal coverage of thc data, quality assessment measures, and other description;e information required to use the data. A specialized MS-DOS software package has been developed to facilitate data archival and retrieval including graphing capability.

AB Previous studies indicate that cold filaments off northern California have sharp southern (s-type) and diffuse northern (d-type) thermal boundaries. In this study, 44 AVHRR satellite images taken from three coastal regions in the California Current System (northern, central, and Baja California) over a period of 10 years were used to examine the regional variation in surface frontal structure associated with cold filaments. The images were specifically chosen from months where past mean wind conditions indicated upwelling occurred because cold filaments appear to be more abundant during the upwelling season. The images also were chosen to provide independent realizations of filament structure. Distributions of average gradient magnitude as a function of gradient angle were used to provide a more compact representation of the frontal information contained in each image. An analysis of these distributions shows that the sharp/diffuse boundary structure associated with cold filaments observed in shipboard data dominates the total surface frontal structure found in satellite data for two of the three regions studied. The recurrent, ubiquitous patterns found in the satellite-determined frontal structure are discussed in terms of their potential effects on acoustic propagation and regional implications on ecological community structure in the California Current System.

ID THERMAL-INFRARED DATA; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; IR DATA; INERTIA
AB In the framework of the Netherlands Remote Sensing Program, a system for monitoring of actual evapotranspiration and biomass development on the basis of METEOSAT is developed. Because of its operational characteristics, the method is such that it requires minimal input other than the METEOSAT data and can run fully automatic on a microcomputer. In this article, the methodology, including: calibration, atmospheric correction, radiation and energy balance mapping, and biomass simulation is described. The method has been applied during a complete growing season to a part of West Africa, with Burkina Faso in the center. Processing results in the form of METEOSAT-derived evapotranspiration (MDE) and METEOSAT-derived herbaceous biomass (MDB) maps are presented. They are compared with NOAA-NDVI data and verified with rainfall and biomass ''ground truth.'' A new methodology -''triangular regression analysis'' - is introduced to assess the stochastic errors in the satellite and ground data. it is finally concluded that METEOSAT can provide precise estimates of areal evapotranspiration and biomass. In terms of areal biomass, the stochastic errors in MDB and NDVI are both small compared to the pixel sampling error in the biomass field data.

AB Real aperture, side looking X-band radars have been operated from the Soviet Cosmos-1500, -1602, -1766 and Ocean satellites since 1984. These radar systems observe a 475 km wide swath with 1-2 km horizontal spatial resolution. Wind velocities were inferred from sea surface radar scattering for speeds ranging from approximately 2 m/s to those of hurricane proportions. The wind speeds were within 10-20% of the measured in situ values, and the direction of the wind velocity inferred from the radar measurements agreed with in situ direction measurements within 20-50-degrees. Various atmospheric mesoscale eddies and tropical cyclones were thus located, and their strengths were inferred from sea surface reflectivity measurements. Rain cells were observed over both land and sea with these spaceborne radars. Algorithms to retrieve rainfall rates from spaceborne radar measurements were also developed. Spaceborne radars have been used to monitor various marine hazards. For example, information derived from those radars was used to plan rescue operations of distressed ships trapped in sea ice. Icebergs have also been monitored. Because oil films reduce the sea surface roughness and thereby alter the radar reflectivity, oil spills were also mapped. Tsunamis produced by underwater earthquakes were also observed from space by the radars on the Cosmos-1500 series of satellites. The Cosmos-1500 satellite series have provided all weather radar imagery of the earth's surface to a user community in, real time by means of a 137.4 MHz Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) channel. This feature enabled the radar information to be used in direct support of Soviet polar maritime activities.

AB The Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor's ability to monitor localized phenomena associated with anthropogenic pollution in coastal waters has been investigated with reference to experimental data collected on a test site in the Gulf of Naples. In situ measurements yielded the biooptical algorithms for chlorophyll and sediment retrieval as well as an optical model for the computation of the subsurface reflectance as a function of water composition, specific to the site. The algorithms' performance was assessed through a sensitivity analysis, taking into account the correlation among chlorophyll, sediment, and yellow substance contents, as well as the stratification characteristics of the water body. Sensitivity analysis techniques were similarly used to evaluate the performance in the coastal environment of three atmospheric correction models, which assume uniform aerosol load and composition, uniform aerosol composition, and varying aerosol load and composition, respectively. A comparison with sea-truth data collected for the Landsat overpass of 22 June 1988 showed a satisfactory correspondence between measured concentrations and concentrations retrieved from the TM data using the above atmospheric correction procedures and ''local'' biooptical algorithms. Consistent with the indications of the sensitivity analysis, the best agreement was obtained by the atmospheric model assuming varying aerosol load and composition.

AB A method has been developed, based on spectral mixture analysis, to estimate the concentration of suspended sediment in surface waters of the Amazon River wetlands from Landsat MSS and TM images. Endmembers were derived from laboratory reflectance measurements of water-sediment mixtures with a range of sediment concentrations. Using these reference spectra, we applied a linear mixture analysis to multispectral images after accounting for instrument and atmosphere gains and offsets. Sediment concentrations were estimated for individual pixels from the mixture analysis results based on a nonlinear calibration curve relating laboratory sediment concentrations and reflectance to endmember fractions. The uncertainty in the sediment concentrations derived from this analysis for three Amazon images is predicted to be within +/- 20 mg/L, and the concentrations fall within a range of concentrations of suspended sediment that were measured at several times and places in the field over the past 15 years. The emphasis of our work is to use the patterns of sediment concentrations to compute the approximate volumes of sediment that are transferred between the main channel and floodplain of the Amazon River. However, the methodology can be applied universally if the optical properties of water and sediment at the site are known, and it is, therefore, useful for the study of suspended sediment concentrations in surface waters of wetlands elsewhere.

AB High resolution multiple wavelength and polarization radar data of Kelso Dunes were acquired during the Mojave Field Experiment.  They offer the opportunity to develop criteria for the selection of optimal wavelengths and polarizations for imaging of dune areas.  The backscatter from unvegetated dune surfaces at all wavelengths (C-, L-, and P-band) with direct (HH, VV) polarization is largely controlled by dune topography and incidence angle.  These data (especially P-band) provide the best images of dune topography.  The best discrimination between active and inactive dunes is obtained by cross-polarized C-band data (CVH, CHV) as a result of multiple scattering from vegetation and small-scale topography (e.g., shadow dunes).

AB In recent years several regional and pan-Arctic ocean color algorithms, which consider the unique bio-optical properties of the Arctic Ocean, have been developed to accurately extract surface chlorophyll a (Chl a), a key input into net primary production (NPP) algorithms, from spectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). However, most satellite derived NPP (NPPSAT) algorithms used in the Arctic do not account for production at deep subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs), a prominent feature in the Arctic Ocean during the summer months, leading to underestimations of NPP during the post-bloom period. In this study, a shallow SCM was observed in early summer (June/July 2016) in Baffin Bay at the time of the sea ice edge bloom, raising the question to what extent this SCM contributes to Rrs and how it is captured in NPPSAT estimates. Radiative transfer simulations based on in situ data of inherent and apparent optical properties and Chl a concentration in the water column were used to examine the effects of heterogeneous vertical Chl a profiles of various strength and depth on spectral reflectance, algorithm-derived surface Chl aSAT and NPPSAT. NPPSAT estimates for varying Chl a profile shapes were then compared to NPPSAT estimates of reference simulations for homogenous Chl a profiles, and to measured NPP calculated using observed Chl a profiles. Results show a significant impact of shallow SCMs on Rrs with the depth of maximum Chl a < 30 m, causing an increase in Chl aSAT by 17 +/- 6% relative to a vertically homogenous ocean. Interestingly, SCMs significantly influencing Rrs were found down to the fifth light penetration depth. The increase in Chl aSAT reduced the difference between predicted and measured NPP estimates to -25 +/- 12% at stations with a shallow SCM. Furthermore, due to the significant contribution of these shallow SCM stations to regional NPP, regional predicted NPPSAT was only 16% lower than measured NPP. Our results demonstrate that the partial representation of a shallow and very productive SCM in Chl aSAT minimizes errors in satellite-based NPPSAT estimates of the Arctic spring bloom during the sea ice melt period.

AB Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for photosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation health and gross primary productivity. It is therefore important to develop methods that allow for its precise and reliable retrieval from radiance measurements with spectral resolutions that have been increasing over the past few years. Retrieval methods are catching up to the increasing complexity of the available datasets making use of their whole information extent (spectral, spatial and temporal) but the comparability of different SIF retrievals and consistency across scales is still limited. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without intro-ducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window. On our synthetic dataset, WAFER seems to outperform the SFM and works best in a spectral window only containing solar Fraunhofer lines where we achieve a relative retrieval error of 10% on average. Applied to the real dataset, the method returns reasonable diurnal cycles for SIF and can, due to the decoupling of reflectance and fluorescence retrieval, reveal interesting trends at times when vegetation canopies may experience a midday depression that remain largely unobserved with current methods.

AB Increasingly larger portions of the Greenland ice sheet are undergoing seasonal melting-refreeze cycles due to global climate warming. The cycle begins with the arrival of high temperatures and increased solar radiation in the spring and summer seasons generating meltwater on the ice sheet's surface. Meltwater percolates to deeper ice layers, either refreezing within the firn, creating longer-term meltwater pockets (firn aquifers), or generating peripheral runoff. Depending on the location and climate, the refreeze duration, the depth of infiltration, and meltwater persistence are temporally and spatially complex. Our recent study showed that multi-frequency passive microwave measurements in the 1.4 GHz to 36.5 GHz range effectively distinguished seasonal meltwater between the immediate surface and deeper firn layers at an experiment site in the accumulation zone of the southwestern Greenland ice sheet. Here, we further explored the vertically and horizontally polarized multifrequency melt response at the pan-Greenland scale. We employed 1.4 GHz brightness temperature (TB) measurements from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and 6.9, 10.7, 18.9, and 36.5 GHz TB measurements from the JAXA Global Change Observation Mission-Water Shizuku (GCOM-W) satellite. The results show that the frequency-dependent response was consistent across the ice sheet. The multi-frequency melt indications match with lasting seasonal subsurface meltwater with delayed refreezing compared to the surface. These results suggest persistent seasonal subsurface meltwater occurrences that are spatially and temporally significant but concealed from the high-frequency observations. Retrieving the meltwater evolution in snow and firn presents a complex problem; this work represents an initial step toward developing an ice-sheet-wide algorithm for more comprehensive retrieval of the meltwater profile.

AB Vegetation indices (VIs) have been used extensively for qualitative and quantitative remote sensing monitoring of vegetation vigor and growth dynamics. However, the saturation phenomenon of VIs (i.e., insignificant change at moderate to high vegetation densities) poses a known limitation to their ability to characterize surface vegetation over the dense canopy. Although the mechanisms underlying saturation are relatively straightforward and several VIs have been proposed to mitigate the saturation effect, the assessment of the saturation effect of VIs remains insufficient. Notably, no unified metric has been proposed to quantify the VI saturation phenomenon, limiting VI selection in practical applications. In this study, we proposed two indicators to describe the saturation phenomenon and utilized a well-validated three-dimensional (3D) canopy radiative transfer (RT) model largescale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS) to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of six forests scenes and assessed the variations in VIs in relation to leaf area index (LAI) values over different backgrounds, sun-sensor geometries, and spatial distribution types. The saturation characteristics of 36 VIs were evaluated in combination with simulation results and satellite observations from multiple sensors. The ranking of VI saturation from simulated and satellite results revealed a good agreement. Our results indicated that the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) performed best with the highest saturation point and can well characterize the surface vegetation condition until LAI reaches 4. Besides, we found that the saturation effect of VIs was influenced by soil brightness, sun-sensor geometry, and canopy structure. SR, modified simple ratio (MSR) and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI) were the most susceptible to these disturbing factors, although they had higher resistance to saturation. Modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI1), modified non-linear vegetation index (MNLI), triangular greenness index (TGI), and triangular vegetation index (TriVI) performed well overall, combining the ability to resist saturation and disturbance factors. Appropriate application of VIs can help better understand vegetation responses to climate change and accurately assess ecosystem status. Our results contribute to the understanding of the VI saturation effect and provide a combined model and satellite data experimental workflow in appropriate VI selection to accurately characterize vegetation.
