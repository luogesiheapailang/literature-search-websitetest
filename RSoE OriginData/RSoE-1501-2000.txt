AB Many studies have shown that solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has a good potential to predict gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation. What we measured by remote sensing or near-surface platforms is top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF (SIFtoc), which is not necessarily equal or proportional to total emitted SIF (SIFtot) from the entire canopy due to the (re)absorption and scattering effects. However, photosynthesis, the process that plants use to fix carbon from the atmosphere, occurs at the entire vertical canopy. Here, by using the recollision theory, we calculated SIFtot at 760 nm from the measured SIFtoc, hyperspectral reflectance (R), canopy interception (i) and leaf albedo (omega(l)). Among them, both SIFtoc and R can be obtained from concurrent TOC spectral measurements; i and omega(l) in the near-infrared region can be estimated from the open access datasets with a good accuracy. Our result confirms that the measured SIFtoc only accounts for a small fraction of SIFtot: the above-the-canopy sensor can only "see" on average 22.9% of SIFtot at Harvard Forest. SIFtot has the following advantages over SIFtoc in estimating GPP: (1) SIFtot improves the diurnal estimate of canopy GPP, especially capable to capture the midday depression of photosynthesis which may cause the large discrepancies between SIFtoc and GPP on a diurnal basis, (2) SIFtot produces a stronger correlation with GPP from plants with complex canopy structure or under sky conditions with more diffuse irradiance, and (3) the SIFtot-GPP relationship shows a stronger resilience to environmental stresses. The fluorescence escape ratio (f(esc)), the ratio between SIFtoc multiplied by pi and SIFtot, is mostly determined by the sun-canopy-sensor geometry and leaf inclination distribution. The effect of LAI and the leaf chlorophyll concentration on f(esc) is marginal at the 760 nm wavelength. Our results suggest that converting SIFtoc into SIFtot provides a better tool to understand and estimate GPP.

AB The Mississippi Delta in coastal Louisiana has some of the highest rates of land loss in the world. This land-loss crisis might become a global problem because most major deltas are expected to be vulnerable to land loss during the remainder of the 21st century and beyond. Despite this predicament, we do not understand how land loss in a deltaic environment proceeds in time and space. Here, we evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta (LMRD) region using spatial statistics and landscape metrics. We used nearly 4800 Landsat images to construct a series of three-year cloud-free composites from 1983 to 2016. From these data, we created a stability index (SI), which is a dimensionless measure of the number of land-to -water transitions that a land pixel makes before being considered lost. Our results indicate that on the LMRD, 75% of land loss is a single transition from land to water, while about 25% of land pixels have two or more transitions before being considered lost. Using a local indicator of spatial association, we show that pixels with similar SI tend to cluster together. Single transition clusters (low SI) form elongated shapes, they are densely packed, and they are predominantly, but not always, found on marsh edges. On the other hand, multi-transition clusters (high SI) form square-like shapes, they are more fragmented, and they are usually found in marsh interiors. Our analysis further shows that the land-loss area within the spatial patches with both high and low stability is strongly related to the density of land patches and their shape (R2 of 0.717 and 0.545 respectively). Our analysis suggests that land-loss pixels on the marsh edges undergo different temporal patterns of land loss compared to those in the marsh interior. We hypothesize that this arises because wave edge-erosion drives land loss on marsh edges, whereas subsidence-related flooding drives land loss in marsh interiors. The stability index provides a useful way to characterize the processes causing land loss.

AB Fire severity assessment is crucial for predicting ecosystem response and prioritizing post-fire forest management strategies. Although a variety of remote sensing approaches have been developed, more research is still needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fire severity mapping. This study proposes a unitemporal simulation approach based on the generation of synthetic spectral databases from linear spectral mixing. To fully exploit the potential of these training databases, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to build a classifier and regression model. The predictive models parameterized with the synthetic datasets were applied in a case study, the Sierra de Luna wildfire in Spain. Single date Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery of the immediate post-fire environment were used to develop the validation spectral datasets and a Pleiades orthoimage, providing the ground truth data. The four defined severity categories - unburned (UB), partial canopy unburned (PCU), canopy scorched (CS), and canopy consumed (CC) - demonstrated high accuracy in the bootstrapped (about 95%) and real validation sets (about 90%), with a slightly better performance observed when the Sentinel-2A dataset was used. Abundance of four ground covers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and ash) was also quantified with moderate (similar to 45% for NPV) or high accuracy (higher than 75% for the remaining covers). No specific pattern in the comparison of sensors was observed. Variable importance analysis highlighted the complementary behavior of the spectral bands, although the contrast between the near and shortwave infrared regions stood out above the rest. Comparison of procedures reinforced the usefulness of the approach, as RF image-derived models and the multiple endmember spectral unmixing technique (MESMA) showed lower accuracy. The capabilities for detailed mapping are reflected in the development of different types of cartography (classification maps and fraction cover maps). The approach holds great potential for fire severity assessment, and future research needs to extend the predictive modeling to other burned areas - also in different ecosystems - and analyze its competence and the possible adaptations needed.

TI First study of Sentinel-3 SLSTR active fire detection and FRP retrieval:
   Night-time algorithm enhancements and global intercomparison to MODIS
   and VIIRS AF products
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS; RADIATIVE ENERGY; SATELLITE
AB The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) now operates concurrently onboard the European Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites. Its observations are expected ultimately to become the main global source of active fire (AF) detections and fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals for the mid-morning and evening low earth orbit timeslots - data currently supplied by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra. Here we report for the first-time the significant adjustments made to the pre-launch Sentinel-3 AF detection and fire characterisation algorithm required to optimize its performance with real SLSTR data collected from the Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites. SLSTR possesses both an S7 'standard' and an F1 'fire' channel that operate in the same middle infrared (MIR) waveband, but which use different detectors with differing dynamic ranges and which are located at different focal plane locations. When S7 provides saturated observations, for example over higher FRP active fire pixels, F1 must be used to provide a reliable MIR spectral measurement. However, the two channels differing data characteristics (slightly different size, shape and spatial location of the matching pixels) means that swapping between their measurements is non-trivial. The main algorithm enhancement has therefore been the addition of a dedicated active fire pixel clustering component, required to cluster the detected AF pixels into individual fires as a solution to this issue. Focusing on night-time data due to the added complexity of daytime implementation, we compare AF information derived with this updated SLSTR algorithm to that from near-simultaneous MODIS Terra, and we find that SLSTR has a lower minimum FRP detection limit which enables more lower FRP active fire pixels to be identified than is the case with MODIS. When both sensors detect the same fire cluster at the same time, SLSTR typically measures a slightly higher FRP due to it being able to detect more of the low FRP AF pixels lying at the cluster edge (the OLS linear best fit between matched SLSTR and MODIS per-fire FRP matchups has a slope of 1.08). At the regional scale, SLSTR detects 90% of the AF pixels that the matching MODIS data contains, but also identifies an additional 44% more AF pixels - the vast majority of which have FRP < 5 MW. Regional FRP totals derived from SLSTR appear slightly higher than those from MODIS because of this, and the OLS linear best fit between these regional FRP matchup datasets has a slope of 1.10. Global fire mapping at 1 degrees grid cell resolution for January 2019 shows very similar fire patterns and FRP totals from SLSTR onboard of Sentinel-3B and MODIS Terra, with SLSTR detecting seven times more AF pixels but very similar FRP totals. Case studies in 5 degrees grid cell areas show the same pattern, and longer-term comparisons like these will provide the data required to mesh MODIS and SLSTR data into a single compatible time-series for long-term trend analysis. The night-time SLSTR AF product based largely on this algorithm has been fully operational from March 2020 and is available from near real-time feeds. A non-time critical (NTC) version based on a similar processing chain will follow shortly after, with products available from the Sentinel-3 Data Hub.

AB Remote surface measurements by imaging spectrometers play an important role in planetary and Earth science. To make these measurements, investigators calibrate instrument data to absolute units, invert physical models to estimate atmospheric effects, and then determine surface properties from the spectral reflectance. This study quantifies the uncertainty in this process. Global missions demand predictive uncertainty models that can estimate future errors for varied environments and observing conditions. Here we validate uncertainty predictions with remote surface composition retrievals and in situ measurements in a field analogue of Earth and planetary exploration. We consider rover transects at Cuprite, Nevada, and remote observations by NASA's NextGeneration Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). We show that accounting for input uncertainties can benefit mineral detection methods such as constrained spectrum fitting. This suggests that operational uncertainty estimates could improve future NASA missions like the Earth Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) and the Lunar Trailblazer mission, as well as NASA's Decadal Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Investigation.

AB Due to global climate change, very large areas of reef are susceptible to warming-induced coral bleaching, leaving coral reef stakeholders reliant upon remote sensing forecasts of coral bleaching for estimates of when and where bleaching will occur. Coral bleaching prediction methods, to date based on satellite sensed sea surface temperature, are being developed further to improve the accuracy of predictions. This review examines the coral physiological and bleaching forecasting literature to identify biological and geophysical parameters that explain variance in coral bleaching and knowledge gaps related to the application of this knowledge to bleaching prediction. Identified areas for the advancement of prediction methods include improvements in sea surface temperature product resolution and past datasets, incorporating the influence of UV irradiance on coral bleaching, and locally-varying thermal bleaching thresholds. More empirical data is necessary for some aspects of bleaching prediction development, though the potential exists for gains in predictive skill to be achieved through the implementation of current physiological and remote sensing knowledge.

AB Despite much progress has been made in recent years, the estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) remains highly uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from plants for estimating GPP. In this study, the relationships of GPP to SIF and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) under different environmental conditions are established using carbon flux data at 61 sites distributed globally and coincident SIF data from OCO-2 and PRI data from MODIS. We analyzed OCO-2 SIF data at both 757 nm and 771 nm against instantaneous and daily GPP values derived from the tower flux data. Our results for these four cases are similar, and those with SIF at 757 nm and daily GPP show that: (1) a significant relationship is found between GPP and observed SIF (SIFobs) for all vegetation types (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 4.28 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) p < .001); (2) NIRv, a product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance, can be used as an approximation of the canopy-escaping probability of emitted SIF to convert observed SIF at one angle to the hemispherical SIF emission that is better correlated to GPP. The relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv was considerably improved from that between GPP and SIFobs (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 3.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); (3) The remaining scatter in the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv is significantly negatively correlated to PRI (R-2 = 0.28-0.34, p < .001), and PRI can be used to improve the relationship between GPP and SIFobs/NIRv, (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 3.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), p < .001); and (4) After the use of PRI in the regression, the variability of the slope of GPP against SIF among different plant functional types is greatly reduced from 33% to 19%. As PRI is an indicator of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a pathway that is in parallel of photochemical quenching and chlorophyll fluorescence, these improvements suggest that the information of NPQ from PRI can be used in addition to SIF for better GPP estimation.

AB Woodland ecosystems, dominant on nearly 4% of all terrestrial land globally, are faced with a variety of threats, including increasingly prolonged and severe droughts, invasive insect outbreaks, and the rapid spread of pathogens. While many remote sensing methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of mortality in forested environments, woodland ecosystems present unique challenges to accurately mapping tree die-off due to relatively lower canopy covers, smaller and irregularly-shaped tree crowns, and greater influence of understory vegetation and soil cover on reflectance. To address these challenges, we developed a multi-sensor, multi-scale approach combining the analytical strengths of centimeter-resolution unmanned aerial system imagery for interpreting individual tree-level mortality, airborne lidar for crown mapping and quantifying percent canopy mortality, and Landsat imagery for upscaling mortality estimates to a regional scale. This approach utilizes a new algorithm for delineating the shapes of small, irregular woodland tree crowns using lidar. To demonstrate the application of this method, we map the extent and severity of a recent tree mortality event in pinon-juniper (PJ) woodlands of southeastern Utah. Our results suggest that 39% of PJ in this region has experienced some level of mortality, with patches exceeding 50% mortality. An analysis of potential mortality drivers revealed that canopy cover, terrain, and recent winter precipitation conditions are most directly linked with mortality, although the explanatory power of the mortality driver model was low. Our approach demonstrates a methodology that could be used for tree mortality mapping and scaling in a variety woodland ecosystems, and can provide a strong basis for further ecophysiological, ecological, and carbon cycle studies involving woodland tree mortality.

AB Scarcity of water temperature data in rivers may limit a diversity of studies considering this property, which regulates many physical, chemical, and biological processes. We present a robust method to generate a consistent, continuous daily river water temperature (RWT) data series for medium and large rivers using the combined techniques of remote sensing and water temperature modelling. In order to validate our approach, we divided this study into two parts: (i) we evaluated methods to derive RWT from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS imagery; and (ii) we evaluated the calibration and validation of river temperature models, using these data, to generate the continuous RWT data series. A 1.2 km section of the White River located near Hazleton, IN, USA, was selected to assess this method mainly due to river width and data availability. We tested three methods to retrieve RWT from Landsat 7 and four from Landsat 8, and we also applied a simple thermal sharpening technique. For Landsat 7, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.01-0.46 degrees C and 1.32-1.84 degrees C, while for Landsat 8, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.08-1.27 degrees C and 1.74-2.17 degrees C, and in both cases, the best results were found applying the radiative transfer equation with NASA's Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator. For the second part of the validation process, we compared a stochastic model and a hybrid model, air2stream, using as input two datasets: the RWT data derived from Landsat 7 only, and a combined dataset of both Landsat 7 and 8 derived RWT. The air2stream model outperformed the stochastic model when calibrated with Landsat 7 data only, with RMSE of 1.83 degrees C, but both models showed similar results when calibrated with the combined Landsat data, when air2stream showed RMSE of 1.58 degrees C. Due to its physical basis, better calibration procedure, and higher consistency, air2stream was considered the best model for deriving the continuous RWT data series. When compared to the measured daily mean RWT data, there was no observed tendency in under or overestimating the RWT in low or high temperature conditions by the modelled series. While further tests are needed in order to evaluate if our approach can be applied to analyse past behaviour and present trends, and the impacts of climate change on the temperature of rivers, the consistent results indicate that this approach has the potential to be applied in rivers with no measured temperature data, for example, in the spatial modelling of longitudinal profiles of rivers and the modelling of tributary river temperatures.

AB Knowledge of snow water equivalent (SWE) magnitude and spatial distribution are keys to improving snowmelt flood predictions. Since the 1980s, the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) airborne gamma radiation soil moisture (SM) and SWE survey has provided over 20,000 SWE observations to regional National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs). Because the gamma SWE algorithm is based on the difference in natural gamma emission measurements from the soil between bare (fall) and snow-covered (winter) conditions, it requires a baseline fall SM for each flight line. The operational approach assumes the fall SM remains constant throughout that winter's SWE survey. However, early-winter snowmelt and rainfall events after the fall SM surveys have the potential to introduce large biases into airborne gamma SWE estimates. In this study, operational airborne gamma radiation SWE measurements were improved by updating the baseline fall SM with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced SM measurements immediately prior to winter onset over the north-central and eastern United States and southern Canada from September 2015 to April 2018. The operational airborne gamma SM had strong agreement with the SMAP SM (Pearson's correlation coefficient, R = 0.69, unbiased root mean square difference, ubRMSD = 0.057 m(3)/m(3)), compared to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM (R = 0.45, ubRMSD = 0.072 m(3)/m(3)) and the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) Mosaic SM products (R = 0.53, ubRMSD = 0.069 m(3)/m(3)) in non-forested regions. The SMAP-enhanced gamma SWE was evaluated with satellite-based SWE (R = 0.57, ubRMSD = 34 mm) from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) and in-situ SWE (R = 0.71-0.96) from the Soil Climate Analysis Network and United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) St. Paul District, which had better agreement than the operational gamma SWE (R = 0.48, ubRMSD = 36 mm for SSMIS and R = 0.65-0.75 for in-situ SWE). The results contribute to improving snowmelt flood predictions as well as the accuracy of the NOAA SNOw Data Assimilation System.

AB The Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR) was conducted from 2017 to 2018 in the semi-arid Luan River watershed located in the North of China. One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm-5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to similar to 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) at an intermediate value of similar to 0.35 cm(3)/cm(3). (2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large variation of similar to 30 dB and similar to 80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.5 cm(3)/cm(3). The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial resolutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval.

AB The cloud-top height (CTH) product derived from passive satellite instrument measurements is often used to make climate data records (CDR). CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) provides CTH parameters with high accuracy, but with limited temporal-spatial resolution. Recently, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Japanese Himawari-8/-9, provides high temporal (every 10 min) and high spatial (2 km at nadir) resolution measurements with 16 spectral bands. This paper reports on a study to derive the CTH from combined AHI and CALIPSO using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms with better accuracy than that from the traditional physical (TRA) algorithms. We find significant CTH improvements (1.54-2.72 km for mean absolute error, MAE) from four different machine learning algorithms (original MAE from TRA method is about 3.24 km based on CALIPSO data validation), particularly in high and optically thin clouds. In addition, we also develop a joint algorithm to combine optimal machine learning and traditional physical (TRA) algorithms of CTH to further reduce MAE to 1.53 km and enhance the layered accuracy (CTH < 18 km). While the ML-based algorithm improves CTH retrieval over the TRA algorithm, the lower or higher clouds still exhibit relatively large uncertainty. Combining both methods provides the better CTH than either alone. The combined approach could be used to process data from advanced geostationary imagers for climate and weather applications.

AB We present the first flight data using a Computational Reconfigurable Imaging Spectrometer (CRISP) system. CRISP (Sullenberger et al., 2017) is a novel hyperspectral thermal imaging spectrometer that uses computational imaging to enable high sensitivity measurements (via spectral multiplexing) from smaller, noisier, and less-expensive components (e.g., uncooled microbolometers) making it useful on small space and air platforms with strict size, weight, and power requirements. In contrast to other multiplexing hyperspectral solutions (e.g Michelson interferometer), it does not require moving parts, allowing for a robust system without aggressive engineering solutions. We discuss flight system design and calibration. Spectra from ground targets and gaseous species are compared to performance expectations. We successfully demonstrate the ability to extract airborne longwave infrared (8-12 mu m) imagery and spectra from an uncooled camera-based CRISP system.

AB Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) sensor onboard the COMS (Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite) launched in 2010 was primarily designed to provide high-frequency observations in and around the Korean Peninsula to ensure the thorough monitoring of ocean properties. Owing to its pixel resolution of 500 m and large set of spectral solar channels, GOCI can also be considered for applications related to the characterization of vegetation and the retrieval of aerosol properties over land. However, to apply it for the full characterization of land, it is mandatory to properly remove clouds from the images. Such a procedure has limitations when there is a lack of thermal bands, as is the case with GOCI. However, GOCI data are impacted by shadows and radiation scattering effects during the daily course of the sun. Although this yields strong directional effects, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) can be determined to a high level of accuracy. This information is used as a reference to detect clouds over land because surface BRDF varies slowly with time compared to that of clouds. The proposed algorithm relies on knowledge of the BRDF field derived from the application of a semi-empirical model that simulates the minimum difference between top and bottom of atmosphere reflectance values as the baseline of clear atmosphere. This step also serves to estimate background surface reflectance underneath clouds. Accuracy assessment of the new GOCI cloud mask product is appraised through a comparison with high-resolution vertical profiles of lidar data from the polar orbiting Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The results for the Probability Of Detection (POD) of all cloud types was found to be 0.831 for GOCI; this is comparable to that of MODIS (0.772). For the case of only thin cirrus, GOCI POD value was assessed to be 0.849, similar to that of MODIS, underlining the improved efficiency of determining thin cloud pixels.

AB The ongoing march toward freely available, highly pre-processed satellite imagery has given both researchers and the public unprecedented access to a vast and varied data stream teeming with potential. Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change.
   With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings. The BULC approach leverages the many successes of single-sensor research and can be used as a straightforward, complementary tool for blending many good-quality mapped classifications from disparate sources into a coherent, high-quality time series.

AB Many coastal waters include large areas of Optically Shallow Waters (OSWs) where the sea-bottom affects above-water observations of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs [sr(-1)]). If not treated, the effect of bottom reflectance will interfere with the correct retrieval of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) from hyperspectral and multi-spectral remote sensing observations. To study this phenomenon in more detail, the existing semi-infinite 2SeaColour Radiative Transfer (RT) model was modified into a finite water layer model, bounded by a diffusely reflecting surface at the sea-bottom. From simulations with the new model, called Water - Sea Bottom (WSB) model, it was observed that a ratio of spectral bands in the Near-Infrared, bands 750 nm and 900 nm, is nearly insensitive to the WCCs and increases with the shallowness of the water, and therefore can be used as a robust index to detect OSWs. The newly established Near-Infrared Bottom Effect Index (NISEI) was applied to a series of satellite observations over the Wadden Sea during high and low tidal phases. Images from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) were processed to retrieve WCCs of the study area. The results indicate that the sea-bottom effect in OSWs affects the accuracy of atmospheric correction and retrievals. On the other hand, applying the NIBEI to flag OSWs improves the reliability and consistency of WCCs maps. The application of proposed NIBEI on satellite images requires only Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at 750 nm and 900 nm and does not depend on atmospheric correction and ancillary local input data (e.g., bathymetry map, bottom type, empirical coefficients, in-situ measurements). As a result, the proposed NISEI can readily be applied to detect OSWs on various ocean colour remote sensors in various shallow coastal regions.

AB Ground-based monitoring and remote sensing of extreme rain events in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, Chile, reveal a complex relationship between precipitation, soil types and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence. These integrated analyses allow examination of temporal and spatial variations of the soil moisture response between locations dominated by sulfate soils and those with immature, silicate-mineral soils. The radar dataset captures at least four separate rain events within the 2015-2017 timeframe, two of which were regionally devastating. The lack of vegetation in this region allows us to discriminate between contributions to the InSAR coherence from permanent changes of the landscape (e.g., erosion or deposition) and transient changes associated with soil moisture variability. The spatial distribution and character of the transient InSAR response depends strongly on soil type, and is remarkably repeatable between rain events. The areas that experienced permanent changes included river channels, steep slopes, playas, and sites of anthropogenic activity, such as roads, mines, or telescope construction. Ground-based observations of soil moisture after each event also exhibit a strong dependence on soil type. The observations presented here demonstrate how InSAR data can constrain variations in soil moisture with high spatial resolution over large regions, complementing the higher-sensitivity but sparser field sites and enabling discrimination of inter-event variability and analysis of longer-term changes in soil mineralogy in arid regions.

AB Optimal estimation (OE) is a core method in quantitative Earth observation. The optimality of OE depends on the errors in the prior, measurements and forward model being zero mean and having well-known error covariance. Often these assumptions are not met. We show how to use matches of satellite observations to in situ reference measurements to estimate parameters for use in OE that bring the retrieval framework closer to the theoretical optimality. This is done by retrieving bias correction and error covariance parameters. Bias correction parameters for some components of the retrieved state and for the satellite radiances are anchored by the in situ reference measurements, and are obtained by a modification of Kalman filtering. Error covariance matrices for the prior state and for the observation-simulation difference are iteratively obtained by applying equations for diagnosing internal retrieval consistency. The theory is applied to the case of OE of sea surface temperature from a sensor on a geostationary platform. Relative to an initial OE implementation, all measures of retrieval performance are improved when the optimised OE is tested on independent data: mean difference from validation data is reduced from -0.08 K to -0.01 K, and the standard deviation from 0.47 to 0.45 K; retrieval sensitivity to sea surface temperature increases from 71% to 76%; and a 20% underestimation of retrieval uncertainty is corrected. Perhaps more significant than the quantitative improvements are the coherent new insights into the forward model simulations and prior assumptions that are also obtained. These include estimates of prior bias in the absence of in situ information, an important consideration when in situ information is not globally distributed. Biases and lack of information about error covariances arise in remote sensing very often. While illustrated here for a particular case, the principles and methods we present for constraining that lack of knowledge systematically using ground truth will be widely applicable in remote sensing.

AB In recent years, the concept of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) has become a new standard in the research of urban landscapes. LCZs outline a classification scheme, which is designed to categorize urban and rural surfaces according to their climate-relevant properties, irrespective of local building materials or cultural background. We present a novel workflow for a high-resolution derivation of LCZs using multi-temporal Sentinel 2 (S2) composites and supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We assume that CNNs, due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects, are best suited to predict the highly context-based LCZs on a large scale. As a first step, the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud-free S2 composites. These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities. Results show that by using a CNN, overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel-based and a texture-based Random Forest approach, respectively. If sufficient training data is available, CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to 86.5%. The proposed method constitutes a feasible approach for automated, large scale mapping of LCZs, and could be the preferred alternative for LCZ classifications in upcoming studies.

AB The cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the RADARSAT-2 satellite has the capability to simultaneously observe the tropical cyclone (TC) structure and ocean surface winds with high spatial resolution of similar to 1 km and large swath images of similar to 450 x 450 km. We propose a methodology to extract TC centers, radius of maximum winds, intensities and the azimuthal wave-number one asymmetric surface wind structures from 75 RADARSAT-2 cross-polarized SAR images over the period from 2008 to 2017. We present a quantitative investigation on both the symmetric mean flow and the asymmetries of azimuthal wave-number one in the surface wind fields retrieved from these SAR images. The results demonstrate that the radius of maximum wind decreases as maximum wind increases, which is consistent with the TC dynamic models for axisymmetric convective heating, and that TCs are more asymmetric when they are weak, and close to symmetric when they are strong.

AB In this study, the ability of satellite soil moisture to track tree growth is analyzed. Despite the reticence of using satellite soil moisture data in forest areas, there is evidence that in some cases, good and reliable results have been obtained. Forests cover very important continental areas and have great importance in many natural processes related to water resources, biodiversity and climate. For these reasons, it is interesting to investigate the applicability of remote sensing soil moisture products for new applications in these environments. In the present study, the CCI (Climate Change Initiative, Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, European Space Agency) soil moisture (CCISM) database has been correlated with the tree-growth series of 22 samples of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in Spain in different locations and environmental conditions. Aleppo pine is the most widespread pine species in the Mediterranean basin, and therefore, it is highly representative of the bioclimatic conditions in these water-limited environments. The series spans from 1978 to 2016, and the daily CCISM has been correlated with the annual tree-growth anomalies. The daily CCISM has been obtained using a moving window scheme with 1-, 7-, 15- and 30-day averages, starting on October 1st of the previous year and finishing on December 31st of the corresponding year. Another soil moisture product (Lisflood model) and precipitation have also been used in a similar approach to strengthen the assessment analysis. The results obtained show a clear temporal pattern of the relationship between satellite soil moisture and Aleppo pine tree growth, and the influence of soil moisture on tree-growth dynamics increases with reduced water availability. The CCISM was able to detect a bimodal pattern of tree growth with a maximum in May and a secondary peak in autumn. This temporal pattern was much clearer than that obtained using the modeled soil moisture and the precipitation. This study proves that satellite soil moisture is sensitive enough to track the phenology of this forest species. The results obtained demonstrate that satellite soil moisture data could be suitable for use in forest environments and for new applications.

AB The variability of the phytoplankton biomass derived from daily chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) satellite images was investigated over the period 1998-2017 in the surface waters of the English Channel and the northern Bay of Biscay. Merged satellite (SeaWiFS-MODIS/Aqua-MERIS-VIIRS) Chl-a was calculated using the OC5 Ifremer algorithm which is optimized for moderately-turbid waters. The seasonal cycle in satellite-derived Chl-a was compared with in situ measurements made at seven coastal stations located in the southern side of the English Channel and in the northern Bay of Biscay. The results firstly showed that the satellite Chl-a product, derived from a suite of space-borne marine reflectance data, is in agreement with the coastal observations. For compliance with the directives of the European Union on water quality, time-series of 6-year moving average of Chl-a were assessed over the region. A clear decline was observed in the mean and 90th percentile of Chl-a at stations located in the mixed waters of the English Channel. The time-series at the stations located in the Bay of Biscay showed yearly fluctuations which correlated well with river discharge, but no overall Chl-a trend was observed. In the English Channel, the shape of the seasonal cycle in Chl-a changed over time. Narrower peaks were observed in spring at the end of the studied period, indicating an earlier limitation by nutrients. Monthly averages of satellite Chl-a, over the periods 1998-2003 and 2012-2017, exhibited spatial and temporal patterns in the evolution of the phytoplankton biomass similar to these observed at the seven coastal stations. Both the in situ and satellite Chl-a times-series showed a decrease in Chl-a in the English Channel in May, June and July. This trend in phytoplankton biomass is correlated with lower river discharges at the end of the period and a constant reduction in the riverine input of phosphorus through improvements in the water quality of the surrounding river catchments.

AB Accurate and timely population distribution maps are critical to addressing health epidemics, coordinating natural disaster response, tracking global changes for environmental conservation, confronting human rights issues, and more. Satellite imagery has opened numerous ways for mapping population distribution - previously unattainable without conducting a resource intensive census. While great advances have been made in urban population mapping, large gaps still exist for rural and remote populations which tend to be the most vulnerable to environmental, economic, and socio-political change. Moderate resolution remote sensing data, such as Landsat, has generally been viewed as insufficient for rural mapping given its coarseness relative to the size of a rural dwelling. This paper presents an approach for detecting small rural settlements within Ann Township of Rakhine State, a remote region of Myanmar with a highly mobile population, by combining Landsat data with publicly available auxiliary geospatial data. The key to the success of detecting small settlements at the Landsat resolution was the inclusion of multi-temporal auxiliary data sensitive to human activity patterns in the regions, such as distance to water, change in seasonal vegetation signals, and distance to a recent active fire. The use of active fire in this context is novel and provided a key metric that increased the accuracy of the resultant map. The final dataset has a classification accuracy of 86.5% on a per-pixel basis and 93.1% on a location identification basis. Numerous small settlements (on the order of 2-3 structures in some cases) not previously mapped by other datasets are identified, revealing that the population of Ann Township is far more dispersed and isolated than previously mapped. This study concludes that by incorporating regionally specific characteristics, moderate resolution remotely sensed data can be used to successfully map geographically marginalized communities so that services and aid are better able to reach them.

AB Archaeological and cultural heritage (ACH), one of the core carriers of cultural diversity on our planet, has a direct bearing on the sustainable development of mankind. Documenting and protecting ACH is the common responsibility and duty of all humanity. It is governed by UNESCO along with the scientific communities that foster and encourage the use of advanced non-invasive techniques and methods for promoting scientific research into ACH and conservation of ACH sites. The use of remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular by specialists around the world as it allows fast prospecting and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multisource datasets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their surrounding environments. The cost of using remote sensing is lower or even zero in practical applications. In this review, in order to discuss the advantages of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), the principles that make passive (photography, multispectral and hyperspectral) and active (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)) imaging techniques suitable for ACH applications are first summarized and pointed out; a review of ASRS and the methodologies used over the past century is then presented together with relevant highlights from well-known research projects. Selected case studies from Mediterranean regions to East Asia illustrate how ASRS can be used effectively to investigate and understand archaeological features at multiple-scales and to monitor and assess the conservation status of cultural heritage sites in the context of sustainable development. An in-depth discussion on the limitations of ASRS and associated remaining challenges is presented along with conclusions and a look at future trends.

AB Spatial explicit monitoring of impervious surface fractions provides essential information for urban planning, urban disaster prevention and mitigation. Moderate spectral and spatial resolution satellite observation has become a tool to perform such monitoring across different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, one major challenge in urban remote sensing is the high spatial heterogeneity causing the presence of image pixels constituting a mixture of different land cover materials. Here we apply an automated unmixing procedure specifically designed to optimally account for the pronounced spectral variability (i.e. high within-class and low between-class variability) prevailing in urban settings. The approach is based on Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), a data dimensionality reduction technique in which between-class variability is maximized and within-class variability is minimized while transforming spectra from the reflectance to the Fisher feature space. We integrated the FDA transformation in the widely-applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) approach in an attempt to more effectively address the endmember variability problem. We made use of online spectral libraries to train the Fisher transformation parameters and steer the automated selection of image endmembers. Our Fisher transformed MESMA algorithm (F-MESMA) was tested on medium spatial resolution Landsat scenes and impervious fraction maps were generated for five major cities located in different regions of the world. The output of F-MESMA was compared to the output of state-of-the-art spectral mixture analysis approaches which were specifically designed to reduce endmember variability issues. We could demonstrate that compared to other spectral transformation approaches, the ratio of within- vs between-class variability of the endmembers was most strongly reduced after applying the Fisher transformation. As a direct consequence, across all five cities F-MESMA consistently provided the most accurate impervious surface fraction estimates (RMSEF-MESMA = 0.13 vs. RMSEalternative approaches = [0.16-0.17]).

AB This study applies deep learning (DL) to retrieve Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) from AMSR2 data. MODIS-derived SICs are calculated based on spectral unmixing with a new ice/water endmember extraction algorithm that exploits global/local representatives, and then used to train a DL network with AMSR2 data. The resulting SIC maps outperform popular SIC products both regionally and globally. The RMSE of the proposed DL model is 5.19, whereas those of the widely used Bootstrap and ASI-based SIC images are 6.54 and 7.38, respectively, with respect to MODIS-derived SICs at global scale. In particular, our proposed method better describes regions of low-SIC and melting ice in summer, which are generally difficult-to-estimate. As the DL-based model consistently generates accurate SIC values that are not time-or region-dependent, it is considered to be an operational system. Additionally, our SICs can be used to generate initial conditions facilitating development of more accurate climate models.

AB This study examines the use of spectral reflectance to determine ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) during mid-growing season for 32 globally distributed flux tower sites. Surface reflectance for 133 spectral bands were extracted for areas around the flux towers from imagery collected by the Hyperion instrument on the Earth Observing 1 satellite. The average reflectance spectra were matched with LUE derived from CO2 flux data collected using eddy covariance techniques from the La Thuile Fluxnet Synthesis Dataset, resulting in 79 observations collected between 2000 and 2007. LUE was calculated from daily gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from the flux towers and MODE fraction of absorbed PAR (fPAR). An examination of all possible two band normalized difference vegetation indices found that no index performed better than R-2 of 0.55, although 60 of the bands were included in normalized difference indices with a R-2 > 0.45. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) using all spectral bands produced a R-2 of 0.81, suggesting the use of this approach to develop a globally-applicable retrieval method for LUE using spectral imagery from future missions flying imaging spectrometers, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission.

AB The Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) instrument provides unique cloud droplet radius (CDR) and effective variance (EV) observations for the analysis of clouds on the global scale. However, the cloud droplet size distribution estimated using the conventional POLDER algorithm is limited by its coarse spatial resolution (150 km) and insufficient information for large droplets (CDR > 15 mu m). In this study, we proposed an improved primary cloudbow retrieval (PCR) algorithm to estimate CDR and EV from POLDER. Simulated retrievals based on a radiative transfer model indicate that primary cloudbow measurements are sensitive to large droplets (CDR > 15 mu m) and enable the retrieval to be applied at a higher spatial resolution; therefore, we employ POLDER polarized measurements from both primary and supernumerary cloudbow regions in the PCR algorithm. Retrieval cases using POLDER measurements reveal that the PCR algorithm is robust when the cloud fields are homogeneous. When the cloud field is heterogeneous, the estimation of CDR is sensitive to the scattering angle ranges as well as the grid size, with uncertainty < 1 mu m. In addition, a spatial resolution of 40-60 km is suitable for the PCR algorithm based on the relationship between the retrieval grid size and the total successful retrievals. Further comparisons between the PCR retrievals and operational products are conducted on the global scale using POLDER measurements for February, May, August and November 2008, revealing that PCR retrievals agree well with operational products on the global scale as CDR < 15 mu m. Our analysis indicates that most of the large droplets estimated using the conventional procedure are overestimated due to the absence of primary cloudbow measurements. The PCR algorithm permits an extended range of CDR (3-25 mu m) and EV (0.01-0.29) estimates and a higher resolution (40-60 km) in the retrieval.

AB Fire has a diverse range of impacts on Earth's physical and social systems. Accurate and up to date information on areas affected by fire is critical to better understand drivers of fire activity, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, air quality, and to aid fire management. Mapping burned areas was traditionally done from field sketches. With the launch of the first Earth observation satellites, remote sensing quickly became a more practical alternative to detect burned areas, as they provide timely regional and global coverage of fire occurrence. This review paper explores the physical basis to detect burned area from satellite observations, describes the historical trends of using satellite sensors to monitor burned areas, summarizes the most recent approaches to map burned areas and evaluates the existing burned area products (both at global and regional scales). Finally, it identifies potential future opportunities to further improve burned area detection from Earth observation satellites.

AB In this research, the active, passive and combined Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Soil Moisture (SM) products were evaluated in comparison with in situ SM measurements from five networks in Spain that have different spatial and temporal scales, densities and environmental conditions. Three of these networks, namely Rinconada, Morille and the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS), are small- to medium-scale networks and have high station densities, whereas the other two (Inforiego and FluxNet) are sparse and large-scale networks.
   The results of the comparisons with the former v02.2 version (before the inclusion of the SM retrieved by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission, SMOS, in the CCI dataset) showed that the combined CCI performed better than the active or passive, affording correlation coefficients (R) above 0.8 and errors between 0.03 and 0.08 m(3) m(-3) for the area-average, with biases close to zero. Regarding the land uses and environmental conditions, the stations that were located in the agricultural areas and some forested areas showed the best results, and those that were located in pasture and certain specific agricultural locations showed the poorest results.
   To test the opportunity of including SMOS in CCI, both datasets were compared over the same areas and coincident periods. After the results, the combined CCI and SMOS SM products matched very well (R = 0.83 on average), although the SMOS and CCI under- and overestimate the ground soil moisture measurements, respectively.
   Finally, the new version of the combined CCI (v03.2, after including SMOS) showed similar correlations to the previous one, but it significantly reduced the bias, leading to slightly lower errors (RMSD and cRMSD). Hence, it was shown that including SMOS in the CCI database enhanced its performance.
   The results in this work may improve knowledge of the CCI SM and its potential applications.

AB The vertical distributions of freshwater cyanobacteria populations are important to plankton community structure, ecology and for influencing water column optical properties relevant to remote sensing. In August of 2014, we examined the vertical structure of a cyanobacteria bloom across the western basin of Lake Erie with new technologies, including LIDAR and a digital holographic system. In addition, vertical profiles of environmental and optical properties were made. The active LIDAR penetrated the water column, and provided a detailed picture of the particle distribution for the whole water column. The holographic system provided digital images processed for particle size, count and identification of Microcystis and Planktothrix - the two main cyanobacteria genera that were present. The correlations between the LIDAR backscatter intensity and the cyanobacteria cell counts from holography averaged to 0.53 and ranged from -0.13 to 0.96 based on nearest matchups. The vertical structure of the overall cyanobacteria population was influenced by wind speed, and to a lesser degree the solar heating of surface waters. On a more detailed level, Microcystis populations were consistently nearer to the surface relative to Planktothrix. Pigments from surface samples revealed a higher degree of photoprotection for Planktothrix-dominated communities. The vertical distributions of the cyanobacteria genera were related to light intensity in the water column and known tolerances and/or preferences for each genus. Vertical profiles of optical properties supported the patterns seen in the LIDAR and holographic data, and had direct implications on the exiting light field. These combined data provide a unique view into the natural variations in spatial (vertical and horizontal) distribution patterns of cyanobacteria and resulting impacts on remote sensing detection and associated interpretations, and demonstrate the potential for these technologies to observe cyanobacteria in lake environments.

AB Sensors on remote sensing satellites have provided useful tools for evaluation of the environmental impacts of nighttime artificial light pollution. However, due to their panchromatic nature, the data available from these sensors (VIIRS/DNB and DMSP/OLS) has a limited capacity accurately to assess this impact. Moreover, in some cases, recorded variations can be misleading. Until new satellite platforms and sensors are available, only nighttime images taken with DSLR cameras from the International Space Station (ISS), airplanes, balloons or other such platforms can provide the required information. Here we describe a theoretical approach using colour-colour diagrams to analyse images taken by astronauts on the ISS to estimate spatial and temporal variation in the spectrum of artificial lighting emissions. We then evaluate how this information can be used to determine effects on some key environmental indices: photopic vision, the Melatonin Suppression Index, the Star Light Index, the Induced Photosynthesis Index, production of NO2-NO radicals, energy efficiency and CO2 emissions, and Correlated Colour Temperature. Finally, we use the city of Milan as a worked example of the approach.

AB High-spatiotemporal-resolution land surface temperatures (LSTs) are required in various environmental applications. However, due to the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing, such data are still unavailable. Many studies have been conducted to resolve this dilemma, but difficulties remain in generating high-spatiotemporal-resolution (i.e., diurnal, e.g., 30 m resolution) LSTs. Accordingly, this study proposes a weighted combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based methods (termed CKFM) to enhance the resolution of time series LSTs; the kernel-driven process can obtain abundant spatial details from visible bands, while the fusion-based process is applied for its spatiotemporal prediction ability. CKFM contains three parts. First, a kernel-driven method is applied to predict high-resolution LSTs via a regression relationship between simulated medium-resolution LSTs and kernels. Second, a fusion-based method is applied to predict the medium-resolution LST, the result of which is used for thin plate spline (TPS) downscaling. Finally, the results of the kernel-driven and fusion-based processes are combined via weights calculated from error estimations. Compared with existing thermal sharpening methods, CKFM has the following strengths: (1) it fully utilizes the available visible and thermal bands from multiple sensors, thereby obtaining spatial details in a variety of ways; (2) it downscales LSTs in a dynamic manner; and (3) it is suitable for heterogeneous regions. CKFM is tested with Landsat 8 and MODIS data and successfully downscales the 1 km resolution MODIS LSTs into 30 m resolution data. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, CKFM is more accurate and robust than the kernel-driven method with an improvement of 0.1-0.6 K, and it reconstructs more spatial details than the fusion-based process. Based on these characteristics, CKFM is a promising method for generating daily high spatial resolution LSTs for various environmental studies.

AB In this paper, we propose to estimate tree defoliation from ground-level RGB photos with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Tree defoliation is usually assessed with field campaigns, where experts estimate multiple tree health indicators per sample site. Campaigns span entire countries to come up with a holistic, nationwide picture of forest health. Surveys are very laborious, expensive, time-consuming and need a large number of experts. We aim at making the monitoring process more efficient by casting tree defoliation estimation as an image interpretation problem. What makes this task challenging is the strong variance in lighting, viewpoint, scale, tree species, and defoliation types. Instead of accounting for each factor separately through explicit modeling, we learn a joint distribution directly from a large set of annotated training images following the end-to-end learning paradigm of deep learning.
   The proposed workflow works as follows: (i) Human experts visit individual trees in forests distributed all over Switzerland, (ii) acquire one photo per tree with an off-the-shelf, hand-held RGB camera, and (iii) assign a defoliation value. The CNN approach is (iv) trained on a subset of the images with expert defoliation assessments and (v) tested on a hold-out part to check predicted values against ground truth.
   We evaluate our supervised method on three data sets with different level of difficulty acquired in Swiss forests and achieve an average mean absolute error (avgMAE) of 7.6% for the joint data set after cross-validation. Comparison to a group of human experts on one of the data sets shows that our CNN approach performs only 0.9% points worse. We show that tree defoliation estimation from ground-level RGB images with a CNN works well and achieves performance close to human experts.

AB Quantifying global terrestrial photosynthesis is essential to understanding the global carbon cycle and the climate system. Remote sensing has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of photosynthesis from leaf to global scale; however, substantial uncertainties still exist. In this review, we provide a historical overview of theory, modeling, and observations of photosynthesis across space and time for decadal intervals beginning in the 1950s. Then we identify the key uncertainties in global photosynthesis estimates, including evaluating light intercepted by canopies, biophysical forcings, the structure of light use efficiency models and their parameters, like photosynthetic capacity, and relationships between sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and canopy photosynthesis. Finally, we review new opportunities with big data and recently launched or planned satellite missions.

AB Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) can serve as an early and non-invasive indicator of the functioning and status of vegetation due to its close link to photosynthetic activity. Most existing approaches retrieve SIF at around few discrete absorption lines. However, the full SIF spectrum can provide more information on the functional status of photosynthetic machinery. European Space Agency's FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission, to be launched in 2022, is dedicated to the accurate reconstruction of the full SIF spectrum over land and incorporates the heights and positions of the two SIF peaks and the total fluorescence emission (spectrally-integrated value) into planned Level-2 products.
   In this paper, an advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction (aFSR) method was proposed to reconstruct the full SIF spectrum by capitalizing on the features of existing methods. The aFSR method used linear combinations of basis spectra to approximate the spectra of SIF and the reflectance factor and exploited all available bands within the spectral range of SIF emission for spectral fitting of SIF and reflected radiance. The number of basis spectra of the reflectance factor used was self-adaptively determined based on the Bayesian information criterion. A comprehensive intercomparison between the aFSR method and three other methods (i.e., the Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction method, the Full-spectrum Spectral Fitting Method, and the SpecFit method) was performed using simulated and experimental datasets. For simulated datasets, the impact of spectral resolution (SR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), atmospheric correction, canopy structure, leaf biochemical parameters and directional effect on the accuracy of SIF spectrum reconstruction was considered. Results show that while all methods could achieve the accuracy standard set by the FLEX mission (average absolute relative error of spectrally-integrated SIF < 10%) when spectral resolving power and SNR were high (e.g., SR s 0.3 nm and SNR >= 700), aFSR generally provided the highest reconstruction accuracy. For the first time we investigated the performance of the SIF spectrum reconstruction on 3-D radiative transfer (RT) simulations and compared with that on typical 1-D simulations. The increase of canopy heterogeneity from 1-D to 3-D did not noticeably deteriorate the accuracy of aFSR, implying that aFSR was applicable to different canopy structures. The aFSR method was also more robust than other methods as it was less affected by atmospheric correction and directional effect. For the experimental dataset, the SIF spectra reconstructed by aFSR agreed well with literature in terms of shape, magnitude and diurnal variation and were in agreement with the other methods: the coefficient of determination and the root-mean-square error between the reconstruction results of aFSR and the average of the SIF spectra reconstructed through three other methods were higher than 0.93 and lower than 0.09 W.m(-2).sr(-1).mu m(-1), respectively.

AB Satellite-based retrievals of land surface albedo at 20-m resolution are generated by coupling the surface reflectances from the recently launched Sentinel-2A satellite with surface anisotropy information (as described by Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, BRDF) from either the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The intrinsic black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A's Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI). A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD). Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative) at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution Sentinel 2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy requirement of 0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products. This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs, extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes.

AB There is a consensus that the spring phenology of deciduous forests is advancing in response to global warming. Since the late 1990s, however, this tendency of spring phenology advancement has been weakened in over 60% of boreal forests, particularly in Siberia (- 0.58 day yr(-1) for 1982-1997 vs. - 0.17 day yr(-1) for 1982-2013) and northwestern North America (NWNA; -0.42 day yr(-1) for 1982-1997 vs. 0.07 day yr(-1) for 1982-2013). This study investigated the major factor in the weakening trends in the advancement of the start of the growing season (SOS) based on the satellite-observed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in two regions by quantifying the effects of four climatic fields winter duration (WD; the number of freezing days), pre-season temperature (PT; accumulated temperature from late winter to early spring), green-up temperature (GT; accumulated temperature around the green-up date), and pre-season precipitation (PR; accumulated precipitation before the green-up date) on changes in the spring green-up trend. The GT explained the majority of the slowdown in the SOS trends in recent decades. In Siberia, the GT increases contributed to the advancement of the SOS during the 1980s and 1990s; however, the GT increase reduced to less than half of these periods resulting in a slowdown of the SOS advancing trend since the early 2000s. In NWNA, GT increases and WD shortening drove the SOS advancement until the late 1990s; however, both effects have been diminished to near zero to result in no further SOS advancements. This study demonstrates that the recent slowdown of the SOS advancing trends over Siberia and NWNA was largely attributed to the weakening of the warming trends, rather than the sensitivity changes of spring phenology to climate variables. This study suggests that the natural climate variability strongly affects the decadal variations in the boreal forest spring phenology.

AB Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence datasets from the 3-days phase of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) mission during the winter months of 1992 have been analyzed to assess the capability to retrieve forest stem volume in boreal forests. For three test sites in Sweden and Finland, coherence decreased for increasing repeat-pass interval from 3- to 12-days due to increasing temporal decorrelation. Overall strong decorrelation was observed for images acquired under unfrozen conditions or thawing conditions. Coherence was best preserved under stable frozen conditions and, in addition, short perpendicular component of the interferometric baseline (i.e., < 300 m). Stem volume was estimated with the Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) and multi-temporal combination of single-image estimates. For the test site of Tuusula, Finland, data from eight 3-days image pairs yielded a relative RMSE of 28.2% for stem volumes ranging between 3 and 482 m(3)/ha. For the 6-days repeat-pass interval, the relative RMSE was only slightly worse (32.4%). For longer repeat-pass intervals, the relative RMSE was above 50%. This study suggests that C-band short-term coherence has potential to support retrieval of forest biomass but the prospects of Sentinel-1 coherence to estimate biomass appear to be limited to the 6-days coherence in areas characterized by stable frozen, or likewise stable dry, conditions.

AB We present a new method for atmospheric correction of remote Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy. Our approach fits a combined model of atmospheric scattering, absorption, and surface reflectance across the solar reflected interval from 380 to 2500 nm. This can estimate spectrally-broad atmospheric perturbations such as aerosol effects that are difficult to retrieve with narrow spectral windows. A probabilistic formulation from Optimal Estimation inversion theory accounts for uncertainties in model parameters and measurement noise. This paper presents a field experiment using NASA's Next Generation Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) with analysis of retrieval accuracy and information content. The inversion outperforms traditional approaches, achieving mean reflectance accuracy of 1.0% on diverse validation surfaces. Predicted posterior distributions fully explain the observed discrepancies, demonstrating the first closed uncertainty budget for VSWIR imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction. This shows the potential of combined surface/atmosphere fitting to advance the accuracy and statistical rigor of remote reflectance measurements.

AB The Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) has been identified as a key species for monitoring the status and health of the Southern Ocean and Antarctic ecosystems. Breeding colonies of the Antarctic petrel are often found on isolated nunataks far from inhabited stations, some up to hundreds of kilometers from the shoreline. It is difficult therefore to monitor and census known colonies, and it is believed that undiscovered breeding locations remain to be found. We developed an algorithm that can detect Antarctic petrel colonies and used it to complete a continent-wide survey using Landsat-8 Operational Line Imager (OLI) imagery in Antarctica up to the southernmost extent of Landsat's orbital view at 82.68 degrees S. Our survey successfully identified 8 known Antarctic petrel colonies containing 86% of the known population of Antarctic petrels. The survey also identified what appears to be a significant population of breeding birds in areas not known to host breeding Antarctic petrel colonies. Our survey suggests that the breeding population at Mt. Biscoe (66 degrees 13'S 51 degrees 21'E), currently reported to be in the 1000s, may actually be on the order of 400,000 breeding pairs, which would make it the largest known Antarctic petrel breeding colony in the world. The algorithm represents a first-ever attempt to apply satellite remote sensing to assess the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic petrel on a continent-wide basis. As such, we note several algorithm shortcomings and identify research topics for algorithm improvement. Even with these caveats, our algorithm for identifying Antarctic petrel colonies with Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring their populations using satellite remote sensing and identifies breeding locations, including Mt. Biscoe, that should be considered high priorities for validation with directed field surveys.

AB Knowledge of the spatial distribution of populations at finer spatial scales is of significant value and fundamental to many applications such as environmental change, urbanization, regional planning, public health, and disaster management. However, detailed assessment of the population distribution data of countries that have large populations (such as China) and significant variation in distribution requires improved data processing methods and spatialization models. This paper described the construction of a novel population spatialization method by combining land use/cover data and night-light data. Based on the analysis of data characteristics, the method used partial correlation analysis and geographically weighted regression to improve the distribution accuracy and reduce regional errors. China's census data for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010 were assessed. The results showed that the method was better at population spatialization than methods that use only night-light data or land use/cover data and global linear regression. Evaluation of overall accuracies revealed that the coefficient of correlation R-square was > 0.90 and increased by > 0.13 in the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Moreover, the local R-square of over 90% of the samples (counties) was higher than the adjusted R-square of the general linear regression model. Furthermore, the gridded population density datasets obtained by this method can be used to analyse spatial-temporal patterns of population density and provide population distribution information with increased accuracy and precision compared to conventional models.

AB Airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) is used in forest inventories to quantify stand structure with three-dimensional point clouds. However, the 3D distribution of the point clouds depends not only on stand structure, but also on scan angle, because the probability for an oblique beam to be reflected by the canopy increases with the distance it must travel through the canopy. Thus, the canopy appears to increase in density as the incidence angle increases, all else being equal. The resulting variation between and within datasets can induce bias in LiDAR metrics derived from the vertical distribution of points. In this study, we modelled the effect of scan angle on the vertical structure of the point clouds to predict the bias of metrics derived from points sampled off-nadir. Comparison with paired observations from different flightlines (off- and at-nadir observations of the same point) demonstrated that the model accurately reproduced the bias of metrics calculated for a northern hardwood forest with relatively continuous canopy. Thus, the model could be used to correct the bias of LiDAR metrics, and provides a mathematical framework that could be used to inform the selection of maximum incidence angle in LiDAR surveys, considering the trade-off between decreasing acquisition costs and obtaining unbiased measurements.

AB Low frequency passive microwave remote sensing is a proven technology for providing soil moisture estimates, but the coarse resolution of its data restricts the range of applications. Downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation, has been proposed as the solution to spatially enhance these coarse resolution soil moisture observations, through association with complementary observations, or ancillary information about land surface features at higher spatial resolution. Such information includes solar reflectance, thermal emission, passive microwave emissions at a higher frequency, radar backscatter, soil or surface attributes such as topography and soil properties, and land surface modelling. Each of these ancillary data sources has its own strengths and limitations in terms of, for example, sensitivity to surface soil moisture dynamics and availability. This paper provides an extensive review of the capabilities and opportunities of current soil moisture downscaling approaches which provide a deterministic pattern of soil moisture, together with their strengths and limitations.

AB Precipitation is one of the most important hydrometeorological components of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The relationships between precipitation and topography in the TP were investigated using 17 years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) data and 2 years of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) data. First, the retrieval and total errors of the two radars were quantified in the TP using ground-based precipitation datasets. The TRMM PR and GPM DPR both significantly underestimate the precipitation, with total errors up to 40% and 53%, respectively. Then, precipitation of the two radars was corrected prior to effective application. The correction was separately performed for each river basin in the TP by adding total errors. Finally, precipitation topography relationships were documented using corrected radar data. The main findings on precipitation topography relationships are: (1) precipitation generally decreases with increasing elevation from 2 to 6 km in the TP. However, the trend is inverse in the Qaidam Basin which is characterized by extremely low precipitation in the interior basin and high precipitation along the windward slopes of surrounding mountains; (2) quantitative relationships between precipitation and elevation can be depicted for most exorheic basins in the TP using exponential fitting. The coefficients of determination for the fitting are higher than 0.9 in six basins; (3) the relationships based on GPM DPR data are less robust due to its fewer samples, whereas the GPM DPR probably resolves the problem of overestimating precipitation in some grid pixels with high elevation, compared to the TRMM PR; (4) three typical mountains (i.e., Himalaya, Hengduan, and Tianshan mountains) exhibit significantly negative correlation between precipitation and elevation. Particularly, there are two bands of precipitation maxima along the southern slopes of the central Himalayas (78 degrees E-88 degrees E), corresponding to the two-step topography, which affects the vegetation distribution. This study provides insights into the precipitation topography relationships in the TP and its surrounding regions based on data from spaceborne precipitation radars.

AB Spatially and temporally continuous estimation of plant photosynthetic carbon fixation (or gross primary production, GPP) is crucial to our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the impact of climate change. Besides spatial, seasonal and interannual variations, GPP also exhibits strong diurnal variations. Satellite retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a spatially continuous, but temporally discrete measurement of plant photosynthesis, and has the potential to be used to estimate GPP at global scale. However, it remains unclear whether the seasonal time series of SIF snapshots taken at a fixed time of the day can be used to infer daily total GPP variation at spatial and seasonal scales. In this study, we first used GPP estimates from 135 eddy covariance flux sites, covering a wide range of geographic locations and biome types, to investigate the relationship between the instantaneous GPP (GPP(inst)) and daily GPP (GPP(daily)) on the seasonal course for different times of the day. Latitudinal and diurnal patterns were found to correspond to variations in photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and light use efficiency (LUE), respectively. We then used the Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy Balance (SCOPE) model and the FluxCom GPP product to investigate the instantaneous and daily SIF-GPP relationships at five flux tower sites along a latitudinal gradient and at a global scale for different biome types. The results showed that daily SIF had a stronger linear correlation with daily GPP than instantaneous SIF at the seasonal scale, with an instantaneous to daily SIF conversion factor following the latitudinal and seasonal pattern driven by PAR. Our study highlights the necessity to take the latitudinal and diurnal factors into consideration for SIF-GPP relationship analyses or for physiological phenology analyses based on SIF.

AB We examine an extensive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data set from the Arctic Ocean spanning a time period from January to June 2015, with the aim of identifying multi-polarization parameters that can be used to accurately separate newly formed sea ice from the surroundings. Newly formed sea ice areas both provide favourable routing for ship traffic, and are key to Arctic climate science because they enable heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Our data set encompasses three different frequencies, X-, C- and L-band, at a range of incidence angles, and were acquired under different environmental conditions. Our results suggest that by combining the scattering entropy and the co-polarization ratio we can successfully separate the newly formed sea ice from open water and thicker sea ice within all three frequencies throughout the winter and spring season. We observe a high correlation between scattering entropy values calculated using quad-polarization C- and L-band data and scattering entropy values calculated using the same scenes reduced to the co-polarization channels (HH and VV). We therefore conclude that dual-polarization (HH and VV) X-band scenes can be directly used to complement quad-polarimetric C- and L-band scenes for studies of newly formed sea ice. To confine the quad-polarimetric data sets to their co-polarization channels one can ensure a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Incidence angles below 35 degrees are needed to keep the signal-to-noise ratios sufficiently high for the scattering entropy and co-polarization ratio. Due to its lack of incidence angle dependency, the polarization difference can provide additional support in newly formed sea ice studies. The regular coverage of the Arctic Ocean with C-band SAR means that such scenes should to be included in any automatic monitoring, however, X- and L-band SAR can, based on their difference in penetration depth, provide additional information about newly formed sea ice types and surface structure.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data have become almost ubiquitous as a remote sensing tool in forestry estimation and mapping applications. Such initiatives commonly rely on spatially aligned forest inventory plot measurements and LiDAR covariates to inform model-based estimators for small area estimation. There are many examples where such linking models provide the desired accuracy and precision of forest parameter estimates for small areas where paucity of inventory plot observations preclude design-based inference. This paper builds on previous small area estimation (SAE) work by linking LiDAR covariates with variable radius forest inventory plot measurements within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Using this framework, we compare SAE of forest aboveground biomass using: i) Fay-Herriot (FH); ii) FH with conditional autoregressive random effects (FHCAR); and ill) FHCAR with smoothed sampling variance (FHCAR-SMOOTH) models. Candidate models and the direct estimate based on plot measurements alone were compared using coefficient of variation (CV). On average, the FH model reduced the CV by 52.3% compared to the direct estimate. Incorporating spatial structure via the FHCAR model reduced the CV by 56.9% and 10.8% relative to the direct and the FH model estimates, respectively. Overall, these results illustrate the applicability and utility of using a SAE framework for linking LiDAR with typical forest inventory data.

AB This study used simulated hyperspectral (HyspIRI) and multispectral (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI) satellite imagery to compare regional land-cover mapping capabilities (San Francisco Bay Area, California) within an analytical framework that included consistent reference data and classification rules. Imagery had the pixel resolution (30 m) and extent (30,000 km(2)) of a Landsat scene, with multi-seasonal (spring, summer, fall) acquisitions from year 2013. Primary study objectives were to assess differences in map accuracy related to Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers, spectral resolution (hyperspectral vs. multispectral), and temporal resolution (multi-seasonal vs. summer). The RF classifier generally outperformed MESMA by 1.1 to 9.0% overall accuracy, with the exception of summer HyspIRI reflectance data. There were no clear patterns in accuracy when comparing HyspIRI and simulated multispectral reflectance bands with RF and MESMA classifiers. With summer data, HyspIRI had significantly higher accuracy for MESMA (+ 5.5 to + 8.7%) and significantly lower accuracy for RF (-9.7 to -16.4%). There were no significant differences in accuracy when using multi-seasonal HyspIRI and multispectral data with RF or MESMA (< 1.2% differences). There were highly significant improvements in overall accuracy (1.7 to 20.9%) with multi-season over summer-only images for all sensors, sample scales and classifiers. This result indicates that repeat image acquisitions from satellite sensors are important for land -cover classification, irrespective of sensor spectral resolution. A companion study (Clark & Kilham, 2016) that used RF with hyperspectral metrics derived from HyspIRI reflectance bands (from indices, derivatives, and absorption fitting) showed significant improvements in overall accuracy relative to map classifications in this study, which all used independent reflectance bands. These findings point to the need of additional land-cover mapping research with machine learning and hyperspectral data that span the spatial and temporal scales afforded by a satellite.

AB The extraction of forest information from SAR images is particularly complex in Mediterranean areas, since they are characterized by high spatial fragmentation and heterogeneity. We have investigated the use of multi-frequency SAR data from different sensors (ALOS/PALSAR and ENVISAT/ASAR) for estimating forest biomass in two test areas in Central Italy (San Rossore and Molise), where detailed in-situ measurements and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data were available. The study focused on the estimation of growing stock volume (GS, in m(3)/ha) by using an inversion algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The ANN algorithm was first appropriately trained using the available GS estimates obtained from ALS data. The potential of this algorithm was then improved through the innovative use of a simulated dataset, generated by a forward electromagnetic model based on the Radiative Transfer Theory (RTT). The algorithm is able to merge SAR data at L and C bands for predicting GS in diversified Mediterranean environments. The performed analyses indicated that GS was correctly estimated by integrating information from L and C bands on both test areas, with the following statistics: R > 0.97 and RMSE = 28.5 m(3)/ha for the independent test, and R = 0.86 and RMSE approximate to 77 m(3)/ha for the final independent validation, the latter performed on the forest stands of both areas not included in the ALS acquisitions and where conventional measurements were available. The research then illustrates the potential of using the obtained GS estimates from SAR data to drive the simulations of forest net primary production (NPP). This experiment produced spatially explicit estimates of GS current annual increments that are slightly less accurate than those obtained from ground observations (R = 0.75 and RMSE approximate to 1.5 m(3)/ha/year).

AB The Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) acquires multi-spectral reflective wavelength observations with directional effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and changes in the solar and viewing geometry. Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7 days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7 day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93 degrees. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications.
   The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel 2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI Disentangling remotely-sensed plant phenology and snow seasonality at

AB Land surface phenology is frequently derived from remotely sensed data. However, over regions with seasonal snow cover, remotely-sensed land surface phenology may be dominated by snow seasonality, rather than showing true plant phenology. Overlooking snow influences may lead to inaccurate plant phenology estimation, and consequently to misinterpretation of climate-vegetation interactions. To address the problem we apply the recently developed plant phenology index (PPI) to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for estimating plant phenology metrics over northern Europe. We compare PPI-derived start and end of the growing season with ground observations by professionals (6 sites) and nonprofessional citizens (378 sites), with phenology metrics derived from gross primary productivity (GPP, 18 sites), and with data on the timing of snow cover. These data are also compared with land surface phenology metrics derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using the same MODIS data. We find that the PPI-retrieved plant phenology agrees with ground observations and GPP-derived phenology, and that the NDVI-derived phenology to a large extent agrees with the end-of-snowmelt for the start-of-season and the start-of-snowing for the end of-season. PPI is thereby useful for more accurate estimation of plant phenology from remotely sensed data over northern Europe and other regions with seasonal snow cover.

AB Clouds are a pervasive and unavoidable issue in satellite-borne optical imagery. Accurate, well-documented, and automated cloud detection algorithms are necessary to effectively leverage large collections of remotely sensed data. The Landsat project is uniquely suited for comparative validation of cloud assessment algorithms because the modular architecture of the Landsat ground system allows for quick evaluation of new code, and because Landsat has the most comprehensive manual truth masks of any current satellite data archive. Currently, the Landsat Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS) uses separate algorithms for determining clouds, cirrus clouds, and snow and/or ice probability on a per-pixel basis. With more bands onboard the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/rhermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) satellite, and a greater number of cloud masking algorithms, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is replacing the current cloud masking workflow with a more robust algorithm that is capable of working across multiple Landsat sensors with minimal modification. Because of the inherent error from stray light and intermittent data availability of TIRS, these algorithms need to operate both with and without thermal data. In this study, we created a workflow to evaluate cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms using cloud validation masks manually derived from both Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat 8 OLI/FIRS data. We created a new validation dataset consisting of 96 Landsat 8 scenes, representing different biomes and proportions of cloud cover. We evaluated algorithm performance by overall accuracy, omission error, and commission error for both cloud and cloud shadow. We found that CFMask, C code based on the Function of Mask (Fmask) algorithm, and its confidence bands have the best overall accuracy among the many algorithms tested using our validation data. The Artificial Thermal-Automated Cloud Cover Algorithm (AT-ACCA) is the most accurate nonthermal-based algorithm. We give preference to CFMask for operational cloud and cloud shadow detection, as it is derived from a priori knowledge of physical phenomena and is operable without geographic restriction, making it useful for current and future land imaging missions without having to be retrained in a machine-learning environment.

AB The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has utilized a set of core validation sites as the primary methodology in assessing the soil moisture retrieval algorithm performance. Those sites provide well calibrated in situ soil moisture measurements within SMAP product grid pixels for diverse conditions and locations. The estimation of the average soil moisture within the SMAP product grid pixels based on in situ measurements is more reliable when location specific calibration of the sensors has been performed and there is adequate replication over the spatial domain, with an up-scaling function based on analysis using independent estimates of the soil moisture distribution. SMAP fulfilled these requirements through a collaborative Cal/Val Partner program. This paper presents the results from 34 candidate core validation sites for the first eleven months of the SMAP mission. As a result of the screening of the sites prior to the availability of SMAP data, out of the 34 candidate sites 18 sites fulfilled all the requirements at one of the resolution scales (at least). The rest of the sites are used as secondary information in algorithm evaluation. The results indicate that the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture data product meets its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) volumetric soil moisture (unbiased root mean square error); the combined radar-radiometer product is close to its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and the radar-based product meets its target accuracy of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) (the lengths of the combined and radar-based products are truncated to about 10 weeks because of the SMAP radar failure). Upon completing the intensive Cal/Val phase of the mission the SMAP project will continue to enhance the products in the primary and extended geographic domains, in co-operation with the Cal/Val Partners, by continuing the comparisons over the existing core validation sites and inclusion of candidate sites that can address shortcomings.

AB Satellite remote sensing provides continuous observations of vegetation properties that can be used to estimate global terrestrial ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been shown to be sensitive to vegetation photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), GPP and canopy water-stress. Here, we use the NASA EOS MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based PRI with eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements and meteorological observations from 20 tower sites representing major plant functional type (PFT) classes within the continental USA (CONUS) to assess GPP sensitivity to soil moisture related water stress. The sPRI (scaled PRI) metric derived using MODIS band 13 as a reference channel (sPRI(13)) shows generally higher correspondence with tower GPP estimates than other potential MODIS reference bands. The sPRI(13) observations were used as a proxy for soil moisture related water supply constraints to LUE within a satellite data driven terrestrial carbon flux model to estimate GPP (GPP(PRI)). The GPP calculations show generally favorable correspondence with tower GPP estimates (0.457 <= R-2 <= 0.818), except for lower GPP(PRI) performance over evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) sites. A regional model sensitivity analysis using the sPRI(13) as a water supply proxy indicated that water restrictions limit GPP over more than 21% of the CONUS domain, particularly in drier climate areas where atmospheric moisture deficits (VPD) alone are insufficient to represent both atmosphere demand and water supply controls affecting productivity. Our results indicate strong potential of the MODIS 5PRI(13) to represent soil moisture related water supply controls influencing photosynthesis, with enhanced (1-km resolution) delineation of these processes closer to the scale of in situ tower observations. These observations may provide an effective tool for characterizing sub-grid spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture related controls that inform coarser scale observations and estimates determined from other satellite observations and earth system models.

AB This study examines the evolution of the GERB-2 and GERB-1 Edition 1 shortwave radiance calibration between 2004-2007 and 2007-2012 respectively, through comparison with CERES instrument FM1 Edition 3A SSF instantaneous radiances. Two periods when simultaneous observations from both GERB-2 and GERB-1 were available, January 13th to February 11th 2007 and May 1st to May 10th 2007, are also compared. For these two overlap periods respectively, averaged over all CERES 'unfiltered-to-filtered radiance ratio' subsets, the GERB-1/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio is on average found to be 1.6% and 1.9% lower than the associated GERB-2/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio. Over the two longer time series the GERB/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio shows a general decrease with time for both GERB-2 and GERB-1. The rate of decrease varies through time but no significant seasonal dependence is seen. Averaged over all subsets the GERB-2/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio showed a decrease of 1.9% between June 2004 and June 2006. Between June 2007 and June 2012, the corresponding decrease in the GERB-1/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio was 6.5%. The evolution of the GERB/CERES unfiltered radiance ratio for both GERB-2 and GERB-1 shows a strong dependence on the CERES unfiltered-to-filtered radiance ratio, indicating that it is spectrally dependent. Further time-series analysis and theoretical work using simulated spectral radiance curves suggests that for GERB-1 the evolution is consistent with a darkening in the GERB shortwave spectral response function which is most pronounced at the shortest wavelengths. For GERB-2, no single spectral cause can be identified, suggesting that the evolution is likely due to a combination of several different effects. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Prominent yellow flowers that are present in a Brassica oilseed crop such as canola require careful consideration when selecting a spectral index for yield estimation. This study evaluated spectral indices for multispectral sensors that correlate with the seed yield of Brassica oilseed crops. A small-plot experiment was conducted near Adams, Oregon in which spring canola was grown under varying water regimes and nitrogen treatments to create a wide range in oilseed yield. Plot measurements consisted of canopy reflectance at flowering using a hand-held spectroradiometer and seed yield at physiological maturity. Spectroradiometric measurements were converted to MODIS band equivalent reflectance. Selected indices were computed from spectra obtained with the radiometer and correlated with seed yield. A normalized difference yellowness index (NDYI), computed from the green and blue wavebands, overcame limitations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during flowering and best modeled variability in relative yield potential. NDYI was more linear and correlated with county-wide oilseed yield data and MODIS satellite data from North Dakota (r(2) <= 0.72) than NDVI (r(2) <= 0.66). NDYI only requires wavebands in the visible region of the spectrum and can be applied to any satellite or aerial sensor that has blue and green channels. These findings highlight the benefit of using a spectral index that is sensitive to reproductive growth of vegetation instead of vegetative growth for crops with spectrally prominent reproductive canopy elements. Our results indicate that NDYI is a better indicator of yield potential than NDVI during mid-season development stages, especially peak flowering. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Derivation and validation of supraglacial lake volumes on the Greenland

AB Supraglacial meltwater lakes on the western Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are critical components of its surface hydrology and surface mass balance, and they also affect its ice dynamics. Estimates of lake volume, however, are limited by the availability of in situ measurements of water depth, which in turn also limits the assessment of remotely sensed lake depths. Given the logistical difficulty of collecting physical bathymetric measurements, methods relying upon in situ data are generally restricted to small areas and thus their application to largescale studies is difficult to validate. Here, we produce and validate spaceborne estimates of supraglacial lake volumes across a relatively large area (1250 km(2)) of west Greenland's ablation region using data acquired by the WorldView-2 (WV-2) sensor, making use of both its stereo-imaging capability and its meter-scale resolution. We employ spectrally-derived depth retrieval models, which are either based on absolute reflectance (single channel model) or a ratio of spectral reflectances in two bands (dual-channel model). These models are calibrated by using WV-2 multispectral imagery acquired early in the melt season and depth measurements from a high resolution WV-2 DEM over the same lake basins when devoid of water. The calibrated models are then validated with different lakes in the area, for which we determined depths. Lake depth estimates based on measurements recorded in WV-2's blue (450-510 nm), green (510-580 nm), and red (630-690 nm) bands and dual-channel modes (blue/green, blue/red, and green/red band combinations) had near-zero bias, an average root-mean squared deviation of 0.4 m (relative to post-drainage DEM5), and an average volumetric error of <1%. The approach outlined in this study- image-based calibration of depth-retrieval models - significantly improves spaceborne supraglacial bathymetry retrievals, which are completely independent from in situ measurements.

AB In this paper we describe measurements of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF) acquired over a 30-year period (1984-2014) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR). Our BRDF database encompasses various natural surfaces that are representative of many land cover or ecosystem types found throughout the world. CAR's unique measurement geometry allows a comparison of measurements acquired from different satellite instruments with various geometrical configurations, none of which are capable of obtaining such a complete and nearly instantaneous BRDF. This database is therefore of great value in validating many satellite sensors and assessing corrections of reflectances for angular effects. These data can also be used to evaluate the ability of analytical models to reproduce the observed directional signatures, to develop BRDF models that are suitable for sub-kilometer-scale satellite observations over both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape types, and to test future spaceborne sensors. All of these BRDF data are publicly available and accessible in hierarchical data format (http:car.gsfc.nasa.gov/). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With advances in satellite data, computer storage capacities and processing technologies, it is increasingly feasible to map forest cover over large areas at high spatial resolutions that are relevant for most decision-makers. For outputs to be informative, however, they must be accurate. The finer spatial resolution of recent large-scale forest products comes at a cost of lower temporal resolution. With few input images available for a given year, appropriate image selection in the creation of forest cover and forest-cover change maps is critical. This work highlights the need for more careful consideration of seasonality in mapping forest cover in the tropics. While most studies of seasonality on forest mapping focus on deciduousness and potential errors of omission, this study highlights seasonal fluctuations in non-forested vegetation and likely errors of comission. Vegetation indices provided good separability between tropical forests and low vegetation including commercial crops, pasture and young fallow, in the dry season, but not in the wet season. Forest-cover maps and change analyses that combine wet and dry-season images without accounting for seasonality risk overestimating initial forest cover and subsequent deforestation. Likewise, analyses that do not distinguish between truly aseasonal wet equatorial regions and seasonal regions of the tropics risk overestimating forest cover in the former. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Current bathymetric models for the South China Sea (SCS) are largely based on predicted depths from gravity and sparse single-beam echo-sounder measurements. Such models lack high-resolution coastlines and shallow water bottom features around atolls and islands. This study refines the gravity field of the SCS using sea surface heights from measurements of satellite altimeter Geosat/GM, ERS-1/GM, Jason-1/GM and the original Cryosat-2. A new one-minute gravity anomaly grid is determined. The modeled gravity anomalies show a 6-mgal RMS discrepancy with shipborne measurements in shallow waters. An altimeter-only bathymetric model is derived from the new gravity grid by the gravity-geological method that uses the latest global and regional models of the ocean depth and marine gravity as a priori knowledge. The new model outperforms current SCS bathymetric models and is accurate to 100 m, based on comparison with multi-beam depth measurements. Optical images from IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-1-2 and -3, are rectified and digitized to derive the zero (coastline) and 20-m depth contours (reef lines) around 44 atolls, which are integrated with the altimeter-only depths, giving significantly improved accuracies and spatial resolutions in modeled depths. The improvement percentages of coastlines by the satellite imagery range from 50% to 97% at 41 of the 44 atolls. We establish a webpage for free access to the optical and depth images, and the depth and gravity grids. We will continue to update satellite images, altimeter-derived gravity grids and bathymetric models over major atolls of the SCS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Echinococcus multilocularis (Em), a parasitic tapeworm, is responsible for a significant burden of human disease across continental Asia. Here, we use a time-series of MODIS 16-day 250 m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) satellite data to quantify the seasonal vegetation dynamics across a study area in Serxu County, Sichuan Province, China, in relation to the presence of the Em intermediate host Ochotona curzoniae (plateau pika) and Ochotona cansus (Gansu pika) (here merged to Ochotona spp.). A series of derived phenological metrics are analysed using the random forests statistical method to determine the relative importance of seasonal vegetation characteristics. Results indicate negative relationships between Ochotona spp. presence and EVI showing a preference for low-biomass habitats. However, EVI values during green-up and senescence periods are also shown to be important, potentially resulting from improved detectability of low-biomass grassland habitats at these times. Improved detection of Ochotona spp. preferred habitats via time-series EVI imagery offers better understanding of the distributions of this Em host, and the potential for monitoring the changes in Ochotona spp. optimal habitat distributions resulting from landscape change. This could aid the identification of villages at increased risk of infection, enabling preventive strategies to be adopted. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Despite widespread use of satellite ocean color data, measured radiance and derived geophysical parameters (e.g., remote sensing reflectance or R-rs, chlorophyll a concentration, absorption and scattering coefficients, diffuse attenuation coefficients) may show inconsistencies according to the sensor viewing geometry. In particular, data fluctuations based on sensor zenith angle (SZA) can cause variable uncertainties in derived time series, as well as regional or global means. This study analyses single- and merged-sensor datasets from SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS for the Gulf of Mexico region, finding pronounced variation within and between satellites as a function of SZA. Such effects are generally restricted to data with SZA above 40, although large variation exists between satellites and products. The non-tilted MODIS and VIIRS also show residual errors during summer time for SZA < 30 degrees due to imperfect sun glint and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrections. Furthermore, certain algorithms and products are more resilient to angular dependence in R-rs data. Overall, this study provides a framework for interpretation and account of SZA dependence in satellite ocean color data products, towards creation of cross-sensor time series as required for analysis of changes on multi-decadal scales. Finally, these findings can inform design and calibration of future geostationary sensors, for which targets have fixed viewing geometry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing is an effective way to monitor vast extents of global glaciers and snowfields. However, satellite remote sensing is limited by spatial and temporal resolutions and the high costs involved in data acquisition. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based glaciological studies are gaining pace in recent years due to their advantages over conventional remote sensing platforms. UAVs are easy to deploy, with the option of alternating the sensors working in visible, infrared, and microwave wavelengths. The high spatial resolution remote sensing data obtained from these UAV-borne sensors are a significant improvement over the data obtained by traditional remote sensing. The cost involved in data acquisition is minimal and researchers can acquire imagery according to their schedule and convenience. We discuss significant glaciological studies involving UAV as remote sensing platforms. This is the first review work, exclusively dedicated to highlight UAV as a remote sensing platform in glaciology. We examine polar and alpine applications of UAV and their future prospects in separate sections and present an extensive reference list for the readers, so that they can delve into their topic of interest. Because the technology is still widely unexplored for snow and glaciers, we put a special emphasis on discussing the future prospects of utilising UAVs for glaciological research.

AB The examination of annual, gap-free, surface reflectance, image composites over large areas, made possible by free and open access to Landsat imagery, allows for the capture of both stand replacing and non-stand-replacing forest change. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal information extracted from the time-series data enables the attribution of various forest change types over large areas. In this paper we apply spectral trend analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from 1984 to 2012 to detect, characterize, and attribute forest changes in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Change detection is performed using breakpoint analysis of the spectral trends and change events are characterized using a set of metrics derived from an image time series that relate the temporal, spectral, and geometrical properties on an object basis. Change objects are attributed to a change type (i.e., fire, harvesting, road, and non-stand-replacing changes) using a Random Forest classifier. Non-stand-replacing changes are generally low magnitude, punctual, trend anomalies that relate year-on-year ephemeral changes that do not lead to a change in land cover class (i.e., phenology, insects, water stress). The results confirm that land cover changes are detected with high overall accuracy (92.2%), with the majority of changes labeled to the correct occurrence year (91.1%) or within +/- 1 year (98.7%). Characterization of changes enables accurate attribution both at the object (91.6%) and area levels (98%), with fire and harvesting events the most successfully attributed (commission error < 10%), and roads, the most challenging to attribute correctly (commission error > 13%). Our approach, prototyped over the forested area of Saskatchewan, has enabled a highly automated and systematic depiction of a 30-year history of forest change, providing otherwise unavailable insights on disturbance trends including spatial, temporal, and categorical characteristics. The generation and application of metrics that relate a range of change characteristics allow for depiction of a broad range of change events, types, and conditions.

AB The tidal flats of the Wadden Sea are a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem with high economic and ecological value but which are also at risk due to climate change, rising sea levels, algae blooms, invasive species and marine pollution. There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53%, 66.85%, 68.22% and 68.2% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.

AB Terrain and landscape complexities can limit the accurate discrimination of land use categories with similar spectral signatures, as well as the accurate detection of land use change in temporal analyses of landscape dynamics. Studies based on misclassified land use data can generate biased parameter estimates and standard errors, inaccurate predictions, and incorrect policy recommendations. To address these challenges and improve the accuracy of land use analyses, we implement a post-classification strategy to detect misclassified land use observations using a latent multinomial logit model. This strategy is tested using both Monte Carlo simulations and a time series dataset based on supervised classification of remotely sensed data corresponding to land use decisions observed in a Mexican coffee growing region during the period 1984-2006. The results indicate that the strategy is useful for identifying land use observations with a high probability of being wrongly classified, even between categories with low discriminative spectral signatures. Reclassification of the land use data, based on the model results, increases the magnitudes of the marginal effects of the analyzed land use drivers in the theoretically expected directions, and in some cases improves the statistical significance of the parameter estimates.

AB Increasing attention on tropical deforestation and forest degradation has necessitated more detailed knowledge of forest change dynamics in the tropics. With an increasing amount of satellite data being released to the public free of charge, understanding forest change dynamics in the tropics is gradually becoming a reality. Methods to track forest changes using dense satellite time series allow for description of forest changes at unprecedented spatial, temporal and thematic resolution. We developed a data-driven approach based on structural change monitoring methods to track disturbance-regrowth dynamics using dense Landsat Time Series (LTS) in a tropical forest landscape in Madre de Dios, southern Peru. Whereas most existing post-disturbance regrowth monitoring methods rely on annual or near-annual time series, our method uses all available Landsat data. Using our disturbance-regrowth method, we detected annual disturbance from 1999 to 2013 with a total area-weighted accuracy of 91 +/- 2.3%. Accuracies of the regrowth results were strongly dependent on the timing of the original disturbance. We estimated a total area-weighted regrowth accuracy of 61 +/- 3.9% for pixels where original disturbances were predicted earlier than 2006. While the user's accuracy of the regrowth class for these pixels was high (84 +/- 8.1%), the producer's accuracy was low (56 +/- 9.4%), with markedly lower producer's accuracies when later disturbances were also included. These accuracies indicate that a significant amount of regrowth identified in the reference data was not captured with our method. Most of these omission errors arose from disturbances late in the time series or a lack of sensitivity to long-term regrowth due to lower data densities near the end of the time series. Omission errors notwithstanding, our study represents the first demonstration of a purely data-driven algorithm designed to detect disturbances and post-disturbance regrowth together using all available LTS data. With this method, we propose a continuous disturbance-regrowth monitoring framework, where LTS data are continually monitored for disturbances, post-disturbance regrowth, repeat disturbances, and so on.

AB In this paper we present a monitoring system for area-wide flow-velocity fields of the outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) utilizing the freely available Landsat archive. In order to process this large amount of satellite images an almost automatic monitoring system was developed. With the Global Digital Elevation Map V2 (GDEM-V2) of the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) an improved orthorectification was applied which, in combination with a destriping correction of the Landsat 7 products with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, leads to more precise flow-velocity information. In addition, outliers were removed using an adaptive, recursive filter approach. For the time span 1972-2012 more than 100,000 flow-velocity fields were derived from over 16,000 optical multi-sensoral Landsat scenes (Landsat 1 to Landsat 7) allowing the determination of the long-term flow-velocity trend. Moreover, the high temporal resolution facilitates the analysis of seasonal flow-velocity variations of numerous outlet glaciers. For many of the major outlet glaciers the results show an acceleration pattern that is consistent with most of the previously published analyses. However, the flow-velocity changes do not have a uniform pattern in their temporal and spatial distribution. This study provides both a high temporal densification and an extension of existing flow-velocity information of the GrIS margin. Finally, this processing chain in its generality allows for the determination of various types of surface displacements and can be applied to other glacier regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB High-latitude regions are experiencing rapid and extensive changes in ecosystem composition and function as the result of increases in average air temperature. Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map near-surface permafrost through decision and regression tree approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated medium-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout mainland Alaska. Our calibrated models (overall test accuracy of similar to 85%) were used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. Models indicate that near-surface permafrost underlies 38% of mainland Alaska and that near-surface permafrost will disappear on 16 to 24% of the landscape by the end of the 21st Century. Simulations suggest that near-surface permafrost degradation is more probable in central regions of Alaska than more northerly regions. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures. Additionally, warmer and drier conditions may increase fire activity and severity, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and carbon remobilization relative to climate alone. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate and consistent estimates of shrubland ecosystem components are crucial to a better understanding of ecosystem conditions in arid and semiarid lands. An innovative approach was developed by integrating multiple sources of information to quantify shrubland components as continuous field products within the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The approach consists of several procedures including field sample collections, high-resolution mapping of shrubland components using WorldView-2 imagery and regression tree models, Landsat 8 radiometric balancing and phenological mosaicking, medium resolution estimates of shrubland components following different climate zones using Landsat 8 phenological mosaics and regression tree models, and product validation. Fractional covers of nine shrubland components were estimated: annual herbaceous, bare ground, big sagebrush, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, shrub, sagebrush height, and shrub height Our study area included the footprint of six Landsat 8 scenes in the northwestern United States. Results show that most components have relatively significant correlations with validation data, have small normalized root mean square errors, and correspond well with expected ecological gradients. While some uncertainties remain with height estimates, the model formulated in this study provides a cross-validated, unbiased, and cost effective approach to quantify shrubland components at a regional scale and advances knowledge of horizontal and vertical variability of these components.

AB Foliar nitrogen (N) in plant canopies is central to a number of important ecosystem processes and continues to be an active subject in the field of remote sensing. Previous estimates of foliar N at the landscape scale have primarily focused on intact forests and grasslands using aircraft imaging spectrometry and various techniques of statistical calibration and modeling. The present study extends this work by examining the potential to estimate the foliar N concentration (%N) of residential, agricultural and other cultivated grassland areas within a suburbanizing watershed in southeastern New Hampshire. These grasslands occupy a relatively small fraction (17.5%) of total land area within the study watershed, but are important to regional biogeochemistry and are highly valued by humans. In conjunction with ground-based vegetation sampling (n = 20 sites with 54 sample plots), we developed partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for predicting mass-based canopy %N across management types using input from airborne and field-based imaging spectrometers. Models yielded strong relationships for predicting canopy %N from both ground- and aircraft-based sensors (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.67, respectively) across sites that included turf grass, grazed pasture, hayfields and fallow fields. Similarities in spectral resolution between the sensors used in this study and the proposed HyspIRI mission suggest promise for detecting canopy %N across multiple forms of managed grasslands, with the possible exception of areas containing lawns too small to be captured with HyspIRI's planned 60 m spatial resolution.

AB Woody vegetation cover affects several ecosystem processes including carbon and water cycling, energy fluxes, and fire regimes. In order to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems, information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation over large areas is needed. In this study we sought to assess multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter to map woody cover in southern African savannas. The SAR data were acquired from the JAXA archive, covering various modes and seasons between 2007 and 2010. We used high resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference data to interpret SAR parameters (including backscatter intensities and polarimetric decomposition components), to develop SAR-based models as well as to validate SAR-based woody cover maps. The LiDAR survey was carried out in April 2008 with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO, http://cao.ciw.edu). The highest correlations to the reference data were obtained from SAR backscatters of the dry season, followed by the wet season, and the end of the wet season. The volume components from polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl) were calculated for the end of wet season, and showed similar correlations to the LiDAR data, when compared to cross-polarized backscatters (HV). We observed increased correlation between the SAR and LiDAR datasets with an increase in the spatial scale at which datasets were integrated, with an optimum value at 50 m. We modeled woody cover using three scenarios: (1) a single date scenario (Le., woody cover map based on a single SAR image), (2) a mule-seasonal scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR images from the same year and different seasons, based on key phonological difference), and (3) a multi-annual scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR data from different years). Predicted SAR-based woody cover map based on Fine Beam Dual Polarization dry season SAR backscatters of all years yielded the best performance with an R-2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 7.88%. However, single dry season SAR backscatter achieved only a slightly lower accuracy (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 8.45%) as multi-annual SAR data, suggesting that a single SAR scene from the dry season can also be used for woody cover mapping. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the number of samples on the model prediction performance and showed the benefits of a larger spatially explicit LiDAR dataset compared to much smaller number of samples as they can be collected in the field. Collectively, our results demonstrate that L-band backscatter shows promising sensitivity for the purposes of mapping woody cover in southern African savannas, particularly during the dry season leaf-off conditions.

AB Soil moisture is a principal component of the Earth's climate and hydrological systems that is difficult to monitor and model due to high variability, uncertainty in land surface characterization and uncertainty in soil moisture forcing. Satellite soil moisture retrievals and brightness temperature observations, such as those available from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, can be a valuable source of information for data assimilation and merging with other satellite retrieval datasets. To correct for biases in these data sets, bias correction methods such as cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, linear rescaling and copulas are used to map satellite soil moisture climatology to that of in situ or model values. This study compared SMOS retrievals to soil moisture observations from the SCAN network for a calibration period of 2010-2011 and validation period of 2012-2013 before and after bias correction. The focus of the study was on the presence and removal of multiplicative bias when comparing SMOS retrievals to SCAN data. Additive bias between SMOS retrievals and SCAN observations was removed by standard bias correction techniques and a new resampling approach was found to reduce multiplicative biases. In addition, the new bias correction technique was found very competitive with the benchmark methods for both the calibration and validation periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of crop growth. In this paper, a hybrid inversion method was developed to estimate the LAI values of crops. Based on PROSAIL simulation datasets, 43 hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs), including the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSVAI) and modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2), were analyzed to identify optimal VIs for estimating LAI values. Hybrid inversion models were then built to determine the relationships between optimal simulated VIs and the LAI values (generated by the PROSAIL model) using modeling methods, including curve fitting, artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest regression (RFR) algorithms. Finally, remote sensing mapping of a Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) image was completed using the inversion model to verify the LAI estimation accuracy. The remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS image yielded an accuracy of R-2 = 0.928 and RMSE = 0.485 for OSAVI and R-2 = 0.910 and RMSE = 0.554 for MTVI2, demonstrating the feasibility of high-accuracy estimation of crop LAI using hyperspectral VIs and a hybrid inversion method. The estimation results of various VIs suggested that the identification of the appropriate VIs is critical to improve the inversion accuracy. In addition, to obtain the appropriate VIs, the factors must be evaluated with respect to two aspects, i.e., the sensitivity to target parameters and the insensitivity to interference. In this study, OSVAI and MTVI2 were sensitive to LAI and relatively insensitive to the effects of interference factors, such as chlorophyll, soil background, sky scattered light and observed geometry. Therefore, these indices could be primarily used as VIs for an LAI estimation. The inversion results of different datasets demonstrated that prior information is critical for improving the inversion accuracy and identifying the optimal VIs. Additionally, based on the comparison of the curve fitting, ANN, and RFR algorithms, RFR was an optimal method for modeling in this study, as indicated by the higher R-2 and lower RMSE values for different datasets and various VIs.

AB The spatial dynamics of coastal and inland regions are highly variable and monitoring these waters with ocean color remote sensors requires increased spatial resolution capabilities. A procedure for the spatial enhancement of ocean color products, including chlorophyll and inherent optical properties (IOPs), is developed using a sharpened visible water-leaving radiance spectrum for the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). A new approach for spectral sharpening is developed by utilizing the spatial covariance of the spectral bands for sharpening the M bands (412, 443,486, 551, 671 nm; 750-m resolution) with the I-1 band (645 nm; 375-m resolution). The spectral shape remains consistent by the use of a dynamic, wavelength-specific spatial resolution ratio that is weighted as a function of the relationship between proximate I- and M-band variance at each pixel. A comparison of bio-optical satellite products at 375-m and 750-m spatial resolution with in situ measurements of water leaving radiance and bio-optical properties show an improved capability of the VIIRS 375-m products in turbid and optically complex waters, such as the Chesapeake Bay and Mississippi River Plume. We demonstrate that the increased spatial resolution improves the ability for VIIRS to characterize bio-optical properties in coastal waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Differential SAR interferometry, a popular technique for measuring displacements of the Earth's surface, is potentially influenced by changes in soil moisture. Different mechanisms for this impact have been proposed, but its magnitude, sign and even presence remain poorly understood. In this study the dependence of the phase, the coherence magnitude as well as the phase triplets on soil moisture was inferred empirically with regression techniques: this was done for two airborne data sets at L-band. The phase dependence was significant (at a significance level of 0.05) for more than 70% of the fields at HH polarization, its sign corresponding to an increase in optical path upon wetting, and the magnitude of the associated deformation commonly exceeding 2 cm for a change in soil moisture of 20%. This trend was similar in both campaigns, whereas the prevalence of soil moisture-related decorrelafion differs. These results are only consistent with a dielectric origin of the soil moisture effects, and not with soil swelling or the penetration depth hypothesis. Changes in vegetation impact the phase depending on the crop and polarization, with the vegetation influence at VV being more pronounced for the agricultural crops present in the study area.

AB Using GPS radio occultation refractivity data collected over the period of 2002-2013, we present a new method for identification of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ is identified by estimating the maximum in the monthly meridional refractivity and specific humidity field by applying a Gaussian fit at each longitude. The interannual variability and climatology of the ITCZ is presented from 12 years of refractivity data. This new method captures all the general features of ITCZ extent and its variability. We also examine the effects of the ITCZ vertically during different seasons. The ITCZ is observed mostly at eastern Pacific in May month, and it is zonally distributed in the September and October months of each year. The zonal variability is large between lower and higher levels, particularly over the Indian monsoon and western Pacific. The latitudinal difference in the vertical extent between 850 hPa and higher levels is larger during the northern hemisphere (NH) summer than NH winter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The vegetation state can have a prominent influence on the global energy, water and carbon cycles. This has been particularly evident during extreme conditions in recent years (e.g. Europe 2003 and Russia 2010 heat waves, Horn of Africa 2010 drought, and Australia 2010 drought recovery). Weather parameters are sensitive to the vegetation state and particularly to albedo and Leaf Area Index (IAI) that controls the partitioning of the surface energy fluxes into latent and sensible fluxes, and the development of planetary boundary conditions and clouds. An optimal interpolation analysis of a satellite-based surface albedo and LAI is performed through the combination of satellite observations and derived climatologies, depending on their associated errors. The final analysis products have smoother temporal evolution than the direct observations, which makes them more appropriate for environmental and numerical weather prediction.
   The impact of assimilating these near-real-time (NRT) products within the land surface scheme of the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is evaluated for anomalous years. It is shown that: (i) the assimilation of these products enables detecting/monitoring extreme climate conditions where the LAI anomaly could reach more than 50% and in wet years albedo anomaly could reach 10%, (ii) extreme NRT LAI anomalies have a strong impact on the surface fluxes, while for the albedo, which has a smaller inter-annual variability, the impact on surface fluxes is small, (iii) neutral to slightly better agreement with in-situ surface soil moisture observations and surface energy and CO2 fluxes from eddy-covariance towers is obtained, and (iv) in forecast using a land-atmosphere coupled system, the assimilation of NRT LAI reduces the near-surface air temperature and humidity errors both in wet and dry cases, while NRT albedo has a small impact, mainly in wet cases (when albedo anomalies are more noticeable).

AB Coastal regions are a resource for societies while being under severe pressure from a variety of factors. They also show a large diversity of optical characteristics, and the potential to optically classify these waters and distinguish similarities between regions is a fruitful application for satellite ocean color. Recognizing the specificities and complexity of coastal waters in terms of optical properties, a training data set is assembled for coastal regions and marginal seas using full resolution SeaWiFS global remote sensing reflectance RRs data that maximize the geographic coverage and seasonal sampling of the domain. An unsupervised clustering technique is operated on the training data set to derive a set of 16 classes that cover conditions from very turbid to oligotrophic. When applied to a global seven-year SeaWiFS data set, this set of optical water types allows an efficient classification of coastal regions, marginal seas and large inland water bodies. Classes associated with more turbid conditions show relative dominance close to shore and in the mid-latitudes. A geographic partition of the global coastal ocean serves to distinguish general optical similarities between regions. The local optical variability is quantified by the number of classes selected as dominant across the period, averaging 5.2 classes if the cases accounting for 90% of the data days are considered. Optical diversity is more specifically analyzed with a Shannon index computed with the class memberships. Regions with low optical diversity are the most turbid waters as well as closed seas and inland water bodies. Oligotrophic waters also show a relatively low diversity, while intermediate regions between coastal domain and open ocean are associated with the highest diversity, which has interesting connections with ecological features.

AB Forest inventory attributes can be estimated using forest height data derived from remote sensing datasets. In this study, we estimated forest inventory attributes; i.e. stem volume, basal area, and Lorey's height using Tandem-X (TDX) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) elevation models and coherence data assisted by ancillary terrain models. It is well known that SAR interferomeby is sensitive to the structural changes taking place in the target between image acquisitions; e.g. changes caused by wind in vegetated areas. As regards nonsimultaneous InSAR imaging, temporal changes in the target lead to loss of coherence and consequently to digital elevation models of low quality. Therefore, repeat-pass InSAR data have limited use-in forest resource mapping. The problem of low coherence in forested areas can be partially avoided by using simultaneous InSAR data acquisition, e.g. the bistatic TDX SAR satellite system, which was launched in June 2010. We processed five interferometric TDX pairs from a test site located in Southern Finland, and collected data from 335 field plots, to study the accuracy of TDX InSAR elevation models and coherence data in forest resource mapping at a resolution of 314 m(2). The SAR-derived elevation models (16 m(2) pixel size) were converted to heights above the ground level using a digital terrain model based on airborne laser scanning data. The random forest (RF) method was used to create a model for estimating the forest attributes using remote-sensing-derived metrics as the predictors. The results for accuracy of prediction were the following: the relative RMSE of 32% was obtained for stem volume, 20% for Lorey's height, and 29% for basal area. The forest inventory attributes were derived from the TDX data with an accuracy equivalent with the accuracy of other remote sensing techniques. This result shows the potential of TDX data in robust and cost-effective forest inventory covering large areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The application of remote sensing technology to water quality monitoring has special significance for lake management at regional scales. Many studies have proposed algorithms between Landsat data and in-situ water quality parameters using classical regression models. The novelty of this paper is that we developed algorithms to determine log-transformed chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and Secchi disk transparency (SDT) in Rio Tercero reservoir using Landsat TM and ETM + imagery, ancillary environmental factors and linear mixed models (LMM), obtaining an increase in the accuracy of the estimates. The validation results showed that LMM with spatial correlation structure that take into account water surface temperature (WST) and rainfall were the most suitable method for estimating these parameters. WST derived from the Landsat thermal band was also validated. The algorithms were used to generate quantitative maps providing spatially and temporally rich information on patterns of water quality throughout the reservoir. Water quality features related to the hydrogeomorphology of the reservoir, typical seasonality and influx from the cooling system of a local nuclear reactor were identified in the time series maps.

AB We evaluated MERIS spectral inversion processors in the estimation of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM) at 443 nm) and Secchi disk transparency (Z(SD)) in four lakes located in southern Finland. The lakes represent oligotrophic, mesotrophic and humic (high a(CDOM), low TSM) lake types. Our validation data was extensive, consisting of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measured in the field, detailed measurements of (specific) inherent optical properties ((S)IOP) and water quality measurements. Validation measurements were collected at stations and as spatially intensive transects. The tested processors were Boreal lakes (BOR) and Free University of Berlin WeW WATER processor (FUB). In the case of BOR we included two versions, the original one available in 2008 and the most recent version. The processing chains of these versions differed in terms of MERIS archive reprocessing (2nd reprocessing (RP2) and 3rd reprocessing (RP3) were used), version of adjacency effect correction (ICOL) and rectification method. However, all these had only minor effect on the estimated R-rs when compared to the effect caused by the differences in the atmospheric correction versions. The use of ICOL improved the estimation of R-rs and therefore all IOP and water quality validations were made with ICOL pre-processed data. R-rs was best estimated with RP2 BOR, although it somewhat overestimated R-rs in blue in the humic lake. RP3 BOR greatly overestimated the R-rs in blue. FUB was outside its aCDOM training range in most of the studied lakes. RP2 BOR estimated water quality with the best accuracy in mesotrophic lakes, but failed in humic and clear water lakes. BOR overestimated Chl-a, particularly with RP3. The best TSM correlation was for RP2 BOR. All processors underestimated a(CDOM). The SIOP measurements showed that overestimation of Chl-a was not due to incorrect conversion factors, and that underestimation of TSM was to some extent explained by lower average conversion factor than that measured in the validation lakes. The inaccuracies in Chl-a and a(CDOM)(443) estimation were related to the partition of a(tot) to phytoplankton and CDOM absorption, which emphasizes the importance of including IOP measurements in the validation studies. Z(SD) was best estimated on the basis of a(tot) and b(tot), which were separately calculated from BOR output and the bio-optical model assumed in the processor. For the needs of transparency estimation the processors should produce a(tot) and b(tot) for all MERIS bands as standard output. Atmospheric correction over humic lakes is another problem to be solved in future versions of the processors. The 2008 version of BOR provided better atmospheric correction results in humic lakes and is thus more applicable in the boreal zone where these lakes are common. This suggests that before a new processor version is published it should be validated with existing in situ data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is an important component of the terrestrial water cycle. Currently there are two operational ETa products using moderate spatial resolution remote sensing data at continental and global scales, i.e. MOD16 and LSA-SAF MSG ETa These two products are based on different parameterizations and forcing data, with the spatial and temporal resolutions of 1-km/8-day and 5-km/daily for MOD16 and LSA-SAF MSG ETa respectively. We compared the MOD16 ETa and LSA-SAF MSG ETa products and evaluated them against in-situ measurements at 15 ground sites with biome types ranging from croplands, grasslands, shrublands, savannas, to forests over Europe for 2011. The intercomparison results at local scale demonstrate that LSA-SAF MSG ETa is closer to eddy covariance (EC) measurements than MOD16 ETa product, with larger correlation coefficient Rest-obs, smaller root mean square error RMSEest-obs and bias of LSA-SAF MSG vs. EC at most of the 15 flux sites. Spatial distributions of the RMOD16-MSG and RMSEMOD16-MSG between MOD16 and LSA-SAF MSG ETa for 2011 show that both ETa data products are consistent over most of Europe, except for some semi-arid regions where the water availability is the main limiting factor of land surface evapotranspiration.

AB Although satellite-based sensors have made vegetation data series available for several decades, the detection of vegetation trend and change is not yet straightforward. This is partly due to the scarcity of available change detection algorithms suitable for identifying and characterizing both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, without sacrificing accuracy or computational speed. We propose a user-friendly program for analysing vegetation time series, with two main application domains: generalising vegetation trends to main features, and characterizing vegetation trend changes. This program, Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) uses a novel segmentation algorithm which simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three user-defined parameters: a generalisation-threshold parameter delta, them largest changes, or a threshold 0 for the magnitude of changes of interest for detection. The outputs of DBEST are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and estimates for the characteristics (time and magnitude) of the change. DBEST was tested and evaluated using simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at two sites, which included different types of changes. Evaluation results demonstrate that DBEST quickly and robustly detects both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, and accurately estimates change time and magnitude.
   DBEST was also tested using data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI image time series for Iraq for the period 1982-2006, and was able to detect and quantify major change over the area. This showed that DBEST is able to detect and characterize changes over large areas. We conclude that DBEST is a fast, accurate and flexible tool for trend detection, and is applicable to global change studies using time series of remotely sensed data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The influence of Arctic vegetation on albedo, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and active layer thickness is a crucial link between boundary layer climate and permafrost in the context of climate change. Shrubs have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies. Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches, including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71% of the total canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading. Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI, decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing with increasing shrub biomass. We conclude that the leaf to branch ratio, canopy background, and vegetation type replaced by shrubs need to be considered when predicting feedbacks of shrubification to summer albedo, permafrost thaw, and climate warming.

AB There is a need to quantify large-scale plant productivity in coastal marshes to understand marsh resilience to sea level rise, to help define eligibility for carbon offset credits, and to monitor impacts from land use, eutrophication and contamination. Remote monitoring of aboveground biomass of emergent wetland vegetation will help address this need. Differences in sensor spatial resolution, bandwidth, temporal frequency and cost constrain the accuracy of biomass maps produced for management applications. In addition the use of vegetation indices to map biomass may not be effective in wetlands due to confounding effects of water inundation on spectral reflectance. To address these challenges, we used partial least squares regression to select optimal spectral features in situ and with satellite reflectance data to develop predictive models of aboveground biomass for common emergent freshwater marsh species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus acutus, at two restored marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA. We used field spectrometer data to test model errors associated with hyperspectral narrowbands and multispectral broadbands, the influence of water inundation on prediction accuracy, and the ability to develop species specific models. We used Hyperion data, Digital Globe World View-2 (WV-2) data, and Landsat 7 data to scale up the best statistical models of biomass. Field spectrometer-based models of the full dataset showed that narrowband reflectance data predicted biomass somewhat, though not significantly better than broadband reflectance data [R-2 = 0.46 and percent normalized RMSE (%RMSE) = 16% for narrowband models]. However hyperspectral first derivative reflectance spectra best predicted biomass for plots where water levels were less than 15 cm (R-2 = 0.69, %RMSE = 12.6%). In species-specific models, error rates differed by species (Typha spp.: %RMSE = 18.5%; S. acutus: %RMSE = 24.9%), likely due to the more vertical structure and deeper water habitat of S. acutus. The Landsat 7 dataset (7 images) predicted biomass slightly better than the WV-2 dataset (6 images) (R-2 = 0.56, %RMSE = 20.9%, compared to R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 21.5%). The Hyperion dataset (one image) was least successful in predicting biomass (R-2 = 027, %RMSE = 33.5%). Shortwave infrared bands on 30 m-resolution Hyperion and Landsat 7 sensors aided biomass estimation; however managers need to weigh tradeoffs between cost, additional spectral information, and high spatial resolution that will identify variability in small, fragmented marshes common to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere in the Western U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite observation is an eminently suitable tool for monitoring and study of coccolithophore blooms but quantitative estimation needs perfected algorithms. The current satellite algorithm using the data of ocean color scanners, such as SeaWiFS and MODIS, is based on retrieval of the bacicscattering coefficient and then estimation of the calcite concentration via an empirical relationship. The regional algorithm for the Black Sea is also an empirical relationship between the coccolithophore concentration and the particle bacicscattering coefficient, based on in situ measured data. The drawback of the both algorithms is that "non-coccolithophore" backscattering is not accounted for. This shortcoming is particularly significant for the Black Sea which is strongly influenced by river runoff.
   We analyze the problem of taking into account the "non-coccolithophore" backscattering by using the integrated approach with the comprehensive data set including satellite data and optical, hydrological and biogeochemical parameters measured in situ in the eastern part of the Black Sea. The main result obtained is a new algorithm for retrieval of coccolithophore concentration in the Black Sea from satellite ocean color data. The algorithm is based on the two-parametric model of the particle backscattering coefficient, which takes into account both coccolithophore bloom and river runoff. Application of the new algorithm to satellite ocean color data in 1998-2011 gave an opportunity to separate the changes associated with the abovementioned factors. Several new interesting results were obtained. It was shown that coccolithophore blooms occupied only a part of the area with high values of the particle backscattering coefficient, and there were the years with no coccolithophore bloom in the Black Sea in June even though the high values of the particle backscattering coefficient were observed.
   The other problems to be solved for improvement of the satellite algorithm, providing a quantitative assessment of the intensity of coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea, were discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) are important vegetation variables which can be monitored using remote sensing (RS). Physically-based approaches have higher transferability and are therefore better suited than empirically-based approaches for estimating LAI and Cab at global scales. These approaches, however, require the inversion of radiative transfer (RT) models, which is an ill-posed and underdetermined problem. Four regularization methods have been proposed, allowing finding stable solutions: 1) model coupling, 2) using a priori information (e.g. Bayesian approaches), 3) spatial constraints (e.g. using objects), and 4) temporal constraints. For mono-temporal data, only the first three methods can be applied.
   In an earlier study, we presented a Bayesian object-based algorithm for inverting the SLC-MODTRAN4 coupled canopy-atmosphere RT model, and compared it with a Bayesian LUT inversion. The results showed that the object-based approach provided more accurate LAI estimates. This study, however, heavily relied on expert knowledge about the objects and vegetation classes. Therefore, in this new contribution, we investigated the applicability of the Bayesian object-based inversion of the SLC-MODTRAN4 model to a situation where no such knowledge was available.
   The case study used a 16 x 22 km(2) simulated top-of-atmosphere image of the upcoming Sentinel-2 sensor, covering the area near the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Seven APEX radiance images were nadir-normalized using the parametric Li-Ross model, spectrally and spatially resampled to Sentinel-2 specifications, geometrically corrected, and mosaicked. The atmospheric effects between APEX flight height and top-of-atmosphere level, were added based on two MODTRAN4 simulations. The vegetation objects were identified and delineated using a segmentation algorithm, and classified in four levels of brightness in the visible domain. The LAI and Cab maps obtained from the Bayesian object-based inversion of the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 model presented realistic spatial patterns. The impact of the parametric Li-Ross nadir-normalization was evaluated by comparing 1) the angular signatures of the SLC-MODTRAN4 and Li-Ross models, and 2) the LAI and Cab maps obtained from a Li-Ross nadir-normalized image (using nadir viewing geometry) and from the original image (using the original viewing geometry). The differences in angular signatures were small but systematic, and the differences between the LAI and Cab maps increased from the center towards the edges of the across-track direction. The results of this study contribute to preparing the RS community for the arrival of Sentinel-2 data in the near future, and generalize the applicability of the Bayesian object-based approach for estimating vegetation variables to cases where no field data are available.

AB The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data has been used by several studies to calculate the top of atmosphere (TOA) shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (SWARF) of biomass burning aerosols over land. However, the current CERES angular distribution models that are used to convert Measured TOA radiances to fluxes are not characterized by aerosols. Using our newly developed empirical angular models for smoke aerosols we calculate the SWARF over South America for eight years (2000-2008) during the biomass burning season. Our results indicate that when compared to our new angular distribution model-derived values, the instantaneous SWARF is underestimated by the CERES data by nearly 3.3 Wm(-2). Our studies indicate that it is feasible to develop angular models using empirical methods that can then be used to reduce uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing calculations. More importantly, empirically-based methods for calculating radiative forcing can serve as a benchmark for modeling studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Especially for a shallow and extremely turbid lake, light availability in the water column can determine the euphotic zone, and the horizontal and vertical distribution of algae species. Light attenuation is traditionally quantified as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation (K-d(PAR)). Global coverage of K-d(PAR) at high spatial and temporal resolution can be provided by satellite measurements, and these data can be used to improve our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China, of considerable importance as a source of drinking water for several large cities.
   The primary dominated contributor to K-d(PAR) was determined firstly using linear regression. There was a significant positive correlation between K-d(PAR) and concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM). The determination coefficient between K-d(PAR) and TSM (R-2 = 0.91) was significantly higher than that between K-d(PAR) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) (R-2 = 0.11), and between K-d(PAR) and absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2 = 0.01). Our results therefore could demonstrate that TSM usually plays a dominant role in the attenuation of light in Lake Taihu.
   A retrieval model of K-d(PAR) values for Lake Taihu was subsequently developed using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) image data at band 10, which was strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR) (R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.005, N = 48). In contrast, the atmospheric corrected reflectance of MERIS image data was not strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR). Thus, atmospheric correction was not a prerequisite for estimations of K(PAR) in this highly turbid and hyper-eutrophic lake, and a simple empirical model of the K-d(PAR) estimation for Lake Taihu was effective.
   With the simple model, the seasonal and spatial distributions of K-d(PAR) in Lake Taihu were studied using the MERIS measurements from 2003 to 2010. Our results show distinct seasonal, spatial, and wind driven, K-d(PAR) values in Lake Taihu. The highest and the lowest K-d(PAR) values were found in summer and in winter, respectively. The increase of K-d(PAR) in summer can be attributed to the phytoplankton blooms, and wind-driven sediment resuspension. Spatially, the K-d(PAR) values were high in the southern part and the lake center, and low K-d(PAR) in East Lake Taihu. Based on the MERIS derived K-d(PAR) values, a significant correlation was found between K(PAR) and wind speeds, suggesting a critical role of wind speeds in the K-d(PAR) variations in Lake Taihu.

AB This study aims at validating Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) products derived from MODIS surface reflectance (MOD09CMG) at coarse resolution (0.05) over crops. These Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) are estimated by using the inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer (BV-NNET tool) applied on MODIS BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) corrected surface reflectances and non-corrected. ECV estimates and the corresponding MCD15A3 Collection 5 and GEOLAND-2 (GE0v1) products are compared with ECV reference maps derived from BV-NNET applied on 105 high spatial resolution images (Formosat-2, 8 m) which were acquired from 2006 to 2010 in Southwest France. These latter are compared with local scale in situ measurements. The validation shows an uncertainty of 035 and 0.07 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively.
   The comparison shows that the ECV estimates from the three products properly capture the crops phenology in agreement with reference maps. Results indicate that MCD15A3 uncertainties (023 and 0.07 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) are similar to previous intercomparison studies. GE0v1 shows a systemic positive bias for both LAI and FAPAR. The best agreement with the reference maps is found for MODIS BV-NNET products with r2 higher than 0.9 and relative uncertainties lower than 17%. The use of BRDF-corrected surface reflectances as input of BV-NNET tool improves the uncertainty of LAI estimates (0.11, compared to 0.17 when directional surface reflectances are used as input) but not the uncertainty of FAPAR estimates. The deviation between FAPAR products which mostly.affects low winter FAPAR, is related to the discrepancy of the soil directional assumption in PROSAIL model and BRDF correction method. The temporal stability of the daily MODIS BV-NNET products is better than the 4-day composite MCD15A3 products. Finally, BV-NNET tool applied at finer resolutions demonstrates that the increase of the resolution results in a decrease of the LAI and FAPAR uncertainties and a conservation of the biases.

AB Vegetation variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) are important inputs for vegetation growth models. LAI and Cab can be estimated from remote sensing data using either empirical or physically-based approaches. The latter are more generally applicable because they can easily be adapted to different sensors, acquisition geometries, and vegetation types. They estimate vegetation variables through inversion of radiative transfer models. Such inversions are ill-posed but can be regularized by coupling models, by using a priori information, and spatial and/or temporal constraints. Striving to improve the accuracy of LAI and Cab estimates from single remote sensing images, this contribution proposes a Bayesian object-based approach to invert at-sensor radiance data, combining the strengths of regularization by model coupling, as well as using a priori data and object-level spatial constraints.
   The approach was applied to a study area consisting of homogeneous agricultural fields, which were used as objects for applying the spatial constraints. LAI and Cab were estimated from at-sensor radiance data of the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer by inverting the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 canopy-atmosphere model. The estimation was implemented in two steps. In the first step, up to six variables were estimated for each object using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. In the second step, a look-up-table (WT) was built for each object with only LAI and Cab as free variables, constraining the values of all other variables to the values obtained in the first step. The results indicated that the Bayesian object-based approach estimated LAI more accurately (R-2 = 0.45 and RMSE = 1.0) than a LUT with a Bayesian cost function (LUT-BCF) approach (R-2 = 022 and RMSE = 2.1), and Cab with a smaller absolute bias (-9 versus -23 mu g/cm(2)).
   The results of this study are an important contribution to further improve the regularization of ill-posed RT model inversions. The proposed approach allows reducing uncertainties of estimated vegetation variables, which is essential to support various environmental applications. The definition of objects and a priori data in cases where less extensive ground data are available, as well as the definition of the observation covariance matrix, are critical issues which require further research.

AB This paper describes the scientific validation of the first version of global biophysical products (i.e., leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and fraction of vegetation cover), namely GEOV1, developed in the framework of the geoland-2/BioPar core mapping service at 1 km spatial resolution and 10-days temporal frequency. The strategy follows the recommendations of the CEOS/WGCV Land Product Validation for LAI global products validation. Several criteria of performance were evaluated, including continuity, spatial and temporal consistency, dynamic range of retrievals, statistical analysis per biome type, precision and accuracy. The spatial and temporal consistencies of GEOV1 products were assessed by intercomparison with reference global products (MODIS c5, CYCLOPES v3.1, GLOBCARBON v2 LAI, and JRC SeaWIFS FAPAR) over a global network of homogeneous sites (BELMANIP-2) during the 2003-2005 period. The accuracy of GEOV1 was evaluated against a number of available ground reference maps. Our results show that GEOV1 products present reliable spatial distribution, smooth temporal profiles which are stable from year to year, good dynamic range with reliable magnitude for bare areas and dense forests, and optimal performances with ground-based maps. GEOV1 outperforms the quality of reference global products in most of the examined criteria, and constitutes a step forward in the development of consistent and accurate global biophysical variables within the context of the land monitoring core service of GMES.

AB The leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by the vegetation are key biophysical measures of canopy foliage area and light harvesting potential. Accurately quantifying these properties is important for characterizing the dynamics of mass and energy exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere. The overall objective of this research was to validate the spatial and temporal performance of the MODIS LAI/FPAR products for a boreal forest landscape in northern Manitoba, Canada. We examined both the MODIS collection 4 (C4) and updated collection 5 (C5) versions over a multiyear period (2004 to 2006) and spatially across seven different-aged forests originating from wildfire and ranging in age from 1-to 154-years-old. We made optical measurements of LAI and FPAR, which were empirically scaled to high-resolution imagery (ASTER; 15-30 m pixel size) to derive detailed reference LAI and FPAR maps. These maps were then aggregated to MODIS resolution (i.e. 1 km) for comparison. We characterized the temporal accuracy of the MODIS products using repeat measurements of LAI and FPAR, and through comparisons with continuously operating measurements of canopy light interception.
   MODIS captured the general phenological trajectory of these aggrading forests, however the MODIS LAl and FPAR products overestimated and underestimated the LAI and FPAR for the youngest and oldest sites, respectively. In addition, MODIS displayed larger seasonal variation in LAI and FPAR compared to field measurements for the needle-leaf evergreen dominated sites. The peak growing season difference between MODIS and spatially aggregated ASTER reference values of LAI and FPAR decreased significantly by 69% and 55%, respectively, for the updated C5 versus the previous C4 LAI/FPAR products. The overall uncertainty (i.e. RMSE) in the MODIS LAI retrievals decreased from 1.6 (C4) to 0.63 m(2) m(-2) (C5) and from 020 (C4) to 0.07 (C5) for FPAR. The incorporation of understory vegetation into the validation of the MODIS products yielded significantly higher agreement between observed and MODIS values, likely due to the relatively open canopy architecture and abundant understory found within boreal forests.

AB Accurate precipitation data at high spatial and temporal resolution is deemed necessary for many hydrological and water management applications, and especially in data scarce river basins and regions where strong competition for water resources prevails. In this study we used a new downscaling-calibration procedure of the freely accessible Version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B43 product, in conjunction with limited rain gauge data sets, to generate improved monthly pixel-based precipitation data at higher spatial resolution (1 km). The spatial downscaling from 0.25 degrees to 1 km grids was achieved by using site-specific non-linear relationships between annual precipitation and annually averaged NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The calibration was based on Geograhical Difference Analysis (GDA) and Geographical Ratio Analysis (GRA). The new integrated procedure was tested for Lake Tana Basin (LTB) in Ethiopia with a humid climate (rainfall 1395 mm/yr during 1998-2004) and for the Caspian Sea Region (CSR) in Iran with a semi-arid climate (rainfall 442 mm/yr during 1999-2003). The best 1 km annual precipitation data were achieved through downscaling followed by GDA calibration for most cases. The monthly fractions derived from the un-calibrated TRMM 3B43 product can be used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. The disaggregated 1 km monthly precipitation has not only significant improvement in the spatial resolution, but also good agreements with rain gauge data were achieved for both LTB (R-2=0.87, RMSE=56 mm, MAE=32 mm and Bias=0.01) and the CSR (R-2=0.79, RMSE=23 mm, MAE=16 mm and Bias=0.14). A similar calibration procedure using rain gauges at monthly time scale did not improve the level of performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Extended optimal estimation techniques for sea surface temperature from

ID VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL
AB Sea surface temperature (SST) can be estimated from day and night observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) by optimal estimation (OE). We show that exploiting the 8.7 mu m channel, in addition to the "traditional" wavelengths of 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, improves OE SST retrieval statistics in validation. However, the main benefit is an improvement in the sensitivity of the SST estimate to variability in true SST.
   In a fair, single-pixel comparison, the 3-channel OE gives better results than the SST estimation technique presently operational within the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility. This operational technique is to use SST retrieval coefficients, followed by a bias-correction step informed by radiative transfer simulation. However, the operational technique has an additional "atmospheric correction smoothing", which improves its noise performance, and hitherto had no analogue within the OE framework. Here, we propose an analogue to atmospheric correction smoothing, based on the expectation that atmospheric total column water vapour has a longer spatial correlation length scale than SST features. The approach extends the observations input to the OE to include the averaged brightness temperatures (BTs) of nearby clear-sky pixels, in addition to the BTs of the pixel for which SST is being retrieved. The retrieved quantities are then the single-pixel SST and the clear-sky total column water vapour averaged over the vicinity of the pixel. This reduces the noise in the retrieved SST significantly. The robust standard deviation of the new OE SST compared to matched drifting buoys becomes 0.39 K for all data. The smoothed OE gives SST sensitivity of 98% on average. This means that diurnal temperature variability and ocean frontal gradients are more faithfully estimated, and that the influence of the prior SST used is minimal (2%). This benefit is not available using traditional atmospheric correction smoothing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since the scan line corrector (SLC) of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) sensor failed permanently in 2003, about 22% of the pixels in an SLC-off image are not scanned. To improve the usability of the ETM + SLC-off data, we propose an integrated method to recover the missing pixels. The majority of the degraded pixels are filled using multi-temporal images as referable information by building a regression model between the corresponding pixels. When the auxiliary multi-temporal data cannot completely recover the missing pixels, a non-reference regularization algorithm is used to implement the pixel filling. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, simulated and actual SLC-off ETM + images were tested. The quantitative evaluations suggest that the proposed method can predict the missing values very accurately. The method performs especially well in edges, and is able to keep the shape of ground features. According to the assessment results of the land-cover classification and NDVI, the recovered data are also suitable for use in further remote sensing applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The accuracy of spaceborne/airborne sensor measurements in the solar domain keeps increasing over time. High resolution, multi-directional and hyperspectral image acquisitions start to be abundant With regard to the multi-angular remote sensing data, the hot spot, i.e. the exact backscattering direction of direct sunlight together with its neighboring directions, is of special interest. Accurate hot spot models have to be used to adequately simulate the hot spot signature and to allow reliable inversion of multi-angular data. In this paper, we propose a physical hot spot model (Leaf Spatial Distribution based Model, LSDM) assuming that for a given point inside the vegetation to be sunlit (respectively, observed) it should be located within a cylinder free from leaf centers. The cylinder is oriented to the sun (respectively, sensor) direction. Assuming a leaf random, regular or clumped spatial distributions, the gap probabilities in the sun and sensor directions are expressed as a function of these cylinder volumes. Based on the same hypothesis, the bidirectional gap probability is estimated as a function of the total volume of the two cylinders. The evaluation of the needed common volume of two cylinders having different radii is reduced to calculation of some elliptic integrals. Finally, the hot spot signature is estimated based on the bidirectional gap probability distribution. Different model versions with different leaf spatial distribution functions are compared. Particularly, it is shown that compared to the random distribution, the regular (the clumped, respectively) distribution increases (decreases, respectively) the reflectance due to single scattering contribution from foliage. The proposed model is validated using the ROMC web-based tool and its better performance compared to the Semi-Discrete Model and Kuusk's model is confirmed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the Gulf of Mexico, repeated satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations show circular trajectories of oil slicks with a radius of several km. Some circles overlay onto each other; while in other cases the circles are modified by the ambient current to form a train of spirals. We show that these SAR-observed features originate from oil seeps of the ocean bottom and the circles are induced by near inertial oscillation (NI). From the SAR images, we have estimated the ambient current velocity from a train of spiral-like circles and verified the NIO by calculating its oscillation period. In this study, we also analyze time series of wind and velocity profiles obtained from a moored buoy and acoustic Doppler current profilers mounted on oil platforms in the area covered by the SAR images. The ocean current analysis confirms that during the SAR imaging times, there were NIOs. Buoy measurements also show that moderate wind of 7 ms(-1) existed 24 h prior to a SAR observation, and it diminished to 2 ms(-1) in 6 h and remained very low for the next 18 h, a condition ideal for producing NIOs.

AB The Arctic is vulnerable to the long-term transport of aerosols because they affect the surface albedo when particles are deposited on snow and ice. However, aerosol observations for this area are sparse and hence there is considerable uncertainty in the knowledge on the properties of the Arctic aerosol. Atmospheric remote sensing using satellite-based instruments offers an opportunity to obtain information on aerosol properties, in particular the aerosol optical depth (AOD) on an extended spatial scale as determined by the instrument's swath width. However, ADD retrieval over a bright surface is a difficult task because it is difficult to separate and explicitly describe the contribution of the surface and that due to back-scattering by aerosols to the radiance observed by a satellite at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), especially at large Solar Zenith Angles (SZA). In this paper, an approach to achieve this is presented based on a synergetic approach using data from both Moderate Resolution Imaging.Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments flying on the TERRA and AQUA satellites. The approached also uses prior knowledge for aerosol properties retrieval over snow as well as a Snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The detailed analysis of the model results demonstrates that the Aerosol Properties Retrieval over Snow (APRS) algorithm is suitable for Arctic region Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval. The study periods include April 2010 and April 2011, when the Arctic haze mostly occurs. Six AERONET stations at high latitude (Andenes, Barrow, Ittoqqortoormiit, OPAL, Thule, and PEARL) were used for comparison. The correlation coefficient between retrieved AODs and AERONET AODs was 0.8 and the relative error is between 10% and 20%, demonstrating the potential of the APRS method to retrieve ADD over the Arctic, with highly reflective snow/ice surfaces and large solar zenith angles.

AB Building representative spectral libraries and quantitatively selecting a subset of spectra for mapping plant species and land cover/land use within remotely sensed imagery remain challenging for accurate classification. Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) can be used for both classification and modeling fractional composition, and has been applied to map multiple biogeophysical variables. Our major objectives in this research were to 1) test a sampling design for building independent and representative training and validation spectral libraries; 2) compare endmember selection by a combination of two established techniques (count-based selection (CoB) and endmember average root mean square error (EAR)) with a recently introduced one (iterative endmember selection (IES)); and 3) develop and test a hybrid method, which combines the strengths of the previous two methods. We applied CoB/EAR, IES, and the new hybrid technique to mapping plant species and cover types in the Santa Ynez Mountains and Santa Barbara urban area, California, USA, using Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. For all endmember selection techniques, the number of selected endmembers varied across 25 random training samples. IES was consistently more accurate than CoB/EAR, but resulted in spectral libraries more than twice as large and failed to model rare species. The hybrid endmember selection technique resulted in the highest overall accuracy and kappa values and proved to be least sensitive to the random sampling protocols, but also produced the largest spectral libraries. A modified hybrid method, in which the number of endmembers selected was limited, produced the second highest accuracies, combining the strengths of the more parsimonious endmember selection by CoB/EAR with improved endmember selection by IES. Both IES and the hybrid methods selected endmembers that successfully classified a wide range of plant species and cover types, indicating their usefulness for these applications.

AB One of the difficulties in analyzing the ocean signal provided by satellite ocean color sensors is that it is strongly polluted by atmospheric contributions, which should be removed by an atmospheric correction process.
   We propose a new methodology, based on spectral optimization in the near-infrared, to simultaneously estimate the contributions generated by atmospheric signals and oceanic particles, which is valid for case-1 and case-2 waters. This approach, denoted NeuroVaria, combines a neural network to model the radiative transfer with a variational algorithm for the spectral inversion.
   NeuroVaria was applied to MERIS data recorded between August 2003 and September 2005 over the Adriatic Sea, off the Venice Lagoon. for which, in situ measurements of the water-leaving reflectance and aerosol optical thickness were available. We present comparisons between the results obtained using NeuroVaria and the MERIS second reprocessing (Megs7.4), and those derived from in situ measurements. We show that NeuroVaria achieves better estimations of the Aerosol optical properties, and improves the atmospheric correction for case-2 waters. Using MERIS multi-spectral images, it was thus possible to detect typical features of the Po River discharge into the northern Adriatic, as well as suspended sediments due to the shoaling of wind waves on their approach to the seashore shallow waters.

AB Medium resolution leaf area index (LAI) products have usually been validated only at the peak of the growing season for boreal forest areas. In this study, we evaluated seasonal variations in MODIS Collection 5 (C5) LAI products for an evergreen coniferous forest area in southern Finland. A time series of field measurements of LAI and nine fine resolution satellite images (SPOT4 HRVIR, EO-1 Hyperion) for the snow free period in 2010 were used for developing empirical regression models for LAI estimation. We used two different reference LAI: the first one corresponded to an effective overstory LAI, and the second one was a clumping-corrected LAI that included both over- and understory vegetation. According to the results, MODIS LAI retrievals were closer to the effective LAI in the spring and autumn, when saturation of MODIS LAI main algorithm did not occur. On the other hand, in the summer, when saturation occurred, MODIS LAI was closer to the total LAI. Therefore, as a result of high LAI retrieved under the condition of saturation, the seasonal course of LAI was exaggerated in comparison to the reference LAI time series. Furthermore, MODIS LAI retrievals were unrealistically small before the leaf burst if considering the large proportion of evergreen coniferous forest in the study area. The results emphasize the need for multi-seasonal validation data sets in order to better understand the performance of LAI retrieval algorithms for evergreen coniferous forests throughout the snow free period.

AB While ridges and furrows on the surface of rock glaciers are probably the most characteristic morphological features of this expression of creeping mountain permafrost, this is the first study that examines the utility of texture filters in detecting rock glacier flow structures. Texture features were derived from a Gabor filterbank applied to two panchromatic IKONOS orthoimages from the Chilean Andes, and terrain attributes were obtained in order to narrow down the area of interest and as additional predictor variables. Four classification methods of different complexity (generalized linear model. GLM; generalized additive model. GAM; support vector machine, SVM; Bundling) were applied to three sets of predictor variables (texture attributes, terrain attributes, and the combination of both), and predictive performances were estimated using two spatial cross-validation strategies in terms of the median area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve (AUROC). Overall, classifiers utilizing texture attributes alone or, usually even better, in combination with terrain attributes outperformed terrain attributes alone, and Bundling (in most cases followed by SVM) showed the overall best performance as a classification method. Cross-validated median AUROC values were mostly between 0.70 and 0.80, or "fair," in this focused pilot study, but much better results are to be expected at the landscape scale. Permutation-based spatial variable importance measures indicate that Gabor features corresponding to texture wavelengths between 10 and 30 m are the most important predictors, which is consistent with typical ridge spacing on rock glaciers. Confounding occurred mostly in areas with linear erosion features and ridges or scarps in morainic and thermokarst terrain. We suggest that texture filters and the chosen methodological approach are relevant not only for rock glacier mapping but also for delineating debris-covered glaciers and characterizing glacier surfaces, as well as for other geomorphological and cryospheric applications.

AB The two-layer Markov chain Analytical Canopy Reflectance Model (ACRM) was linked with in situ hyperspectral leaf optical properties to simulate the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) for a corn crop canopy at three different growth stages. This is an extended study after a successful demonstration of PRI simulations for a cornfield previously conducted at an early vegetative growth stage. Consistent with previous in situ studies, sunlit leaves exhibited lower PRI values than shaded leaves. Since sunlit (shaded) foliage dominates the canopy in the reflectance hotspot (coldspot), the canopy PRI derived from field hyperspectral observations displayed sensitivity to both view zenith angle and relative azimuth angle at all growth stages. Consequently, sunlit and shaded canopy sectors were most differentiated when viewed along the azimuth matching the solar principal plane. These directional PRI responses associated with sunlit/shaded foliage were successfully reproduced by the ACRM. As before, the simulated PRI values from the current study were closer to in situ values when both sunlit and shaded leaves were utilized as model input data in a two-layer mode, instead of a one-layer mode with sunlit leaves only. Model performance as judged by correlation between in situ and simulated values was strongest for the mature corn crop (r = 0.87, RMSE = 0.0048), followed by the early vegetative stage (r = 0.78; RMSE = 0.0051) and the early senescent stage (r = 0.65; RMSE = 0.0104). Since the benefit of including shaded leaves in the scheme varied across different growth stages, a further analysis was conducted to investigate how variable fractions of sunlit/shaded leaves affect the canopy PRI values expected for a cornfield, with implications for remote sensing monitoring options. Simulations of the sunlit to shaded canopy ratio near 50/50 +/- 10 (e.g., 60/40) matching field observations at all growth stages were examined. Our results suggest the importance of the sunlit/shaded fraction and canopy structure in understanding and interpreting PRI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The West African Monsoon region is of great concern due to the negative ecological, economical, and societal impacts of the persistent drought. Our results support the established postulation that the onset of summer rain in the southern region is associated with the migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone and in phase with the meridional moisture transport from the Gulf of Guinea. We present recent satellite measurements that illustrate the phase shift of the precipitation in the northern region, the Sahel, with respect to the region to the south. These satellite data and associated analysis techniques let us combine the effect of the onshore flow at the surface and offshore transport aloft to demonstrate with sufficient clarity that the depth-integrated moisture advection across the west coast, from the open Atlantic Ocean into the Sahel region, is in-phase with the annual and inter-annual variations of Sahel rainfall, but out-of-phase with rainfall in the southern region around the Gulf of Guinea. The peak Sahel rainfall is associated with the short-lived net moisture influx from the Atlantic, which may interact with local instability related to the African Easterly Waves. The data show two precipitation regimes in Western Africa Monsoon region associated with moisture input from two different regions of the ocean. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper summarizes the implementation of a physically based algorithm for the retrieval of vegetation green Leaf Area Index (LAI) from Landsat surface reflectance data. The algorithm is based on the canopy spectral invariants theory and provides a computationally efficient way of parameterizing the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) as a function of spatial resolution and wavelength. LAI retrievals from the application of this algorithm to aggregated Landsat surface reflectances are consistent with those of MODIS for homogeneous sites represented by different herbaceous and forest cover types. Example results illustrating the physics and performance of the algorithm suggest three key factors that influence the LAI retrieval process: 1) the atmospheric correction procedures to estimate surface reflectances; 2) the proximity of Landsat-observed surface reflectance and corresponding reflectances as characterized by the model simulation: and 3) the quality of the input land cover type in accurately delineating pure vegetated components as opposed to mixed pixels. Accounting for these factors, a pilot implementation of the LAI retrieval algorithm was demonstrated for the state of California utilizing the Global Land Survey (GLS) 2005 Landsat data archive. In a separate exercise, the performance of the LAI algorithm over California was evaluated by using the short-wave infrared band in addition to the red and near-infrared bands. Results show that the algorithm, while ingesting the short-wave infrared band, has the ability to delineate open canopies with understory effects and may provide useful information compared to a more traditional two-band retrieval. Future research will involve implementation of this algorithm at continental scales and a validation exercise will be performed in evaluating the accuracy of the 30-m LAI products at several field sites.

AB Landsat data constitute the longest record of global-scale medium spatial resolution earth observation data. As a result, the current methods for large area monitoring of land cover change using medium spatial resolution imagery (10-50 m) typically employ Landsat data. Most large area products quantify forest cover change. Forests are a comparatively easy cover type to map as well as a current focus of environmental monitoring concerning the global carbon cycle and biodiversity loss. Among existing change products, supervised or knowledge-based characterization methods predominate. Radiometric correction methods vary significantly, largely as a function of geographic/algorithmic scale. For instance, products created by mosaicking per scene characterizations do not require radiometric normalization. On the other hand, methods that employ a single index or classification model over an entire study area do require radiometric normalization. Temporal updating of cover change varies between existing products as a function of regional acquisition frequency, cloud cover and seasonality. With the Landsat archive opened for free access to terrain-corrected data, future product generation will be more data intensive. Per scene, interactive analyses will no longer be viable. Coupling free and open access to large data volumes with improved processing power will result in automated image pre-processing and land cover characterization methods. Such methods will need to leverage high-performance computing capabilities in advancing the land cover monitoring discipline. Robust validation efforts will be required to quantify product accuracies in determining the optimal change characterization methodologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lidar is currently the most accurate method for remote estimation of forest structure, but it has limited spatial and temporal coverage. Conversely, Landsat data are more widely available, but exhibit a weaker relationship with structure under medium to high leaf area conditions. One potentially valuable means of enhancing the relationship between Landsat reflectance and forest structure is to incorporate Landsat spectral trends prior to a date of interest. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is linked to the stand's disturbance history, an approach that directly leverages the temporal information of Landsat time series should improve estimates of forest structure. The main objective of this study was to test and demonstrate the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from spectral profiles of annual Landsat time series (LTS) to predict current forest structure attributes (as compared to more traditional approaches, including airborne, discrete return lidar and single-date Landsat). We estimated aboveground live biomass (AGB(live)), dead woody biomass (AGB(dead)), basal area (live and dead), and Lorey's mean stand height for a mixed-conifer forest in eastem Oregon, USA, and compared the results with estimates from lidar and single, current-date Landsat imagery. Annual time-series stacks for the entire Landsat record (1972-2010) were obtained to characterize all long-term (insect, growth) and short-term (fire, harvest) vegetation changes that occurred during that period. This required the additional objective of integrating Landsat data from MSS and TM/ETM + sensors, and we describe here our approach. To extract spectral trajectories and change metrics associated with forest disturbances and recovery we applied a temporal segmentation to the calibrated time series.
   Lidar predicted forest structure of live trees most accurately (e.g. AGB(live): R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 35.3 Mg ha(-1)). However, LTS metrics significantly improved model predictions (e.g. AGB(live): R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 46.9 Mg ha(-1)) compared to single-date Landsat data (AGB(live), R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 65.1 Mg ha(-1)). Conversely, distributions of AGB(dead) were more strongly associated with disturbance history than current structure of live trees. As a result, LTS models performed significantly better in estimating AGB(dead) (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 31.0 Mg ha(-1)), than lidar models (R-2 = 0.21, RMSE= 43.8 Mg ha(-1)); and single-date Landsat data failed completely (R-2 = 0, RMSE= 47.8 Mg ha(-1)). Further, ITS metrics that integrated disturbance and recovery history over the entire time series generally predicted AGB(dead) better than metrics describing single events only (e.g. the greatest disturbance). This study demonstrates the unique value of the long, historic Landsat record, and suggests new potentials for mapping current forest structure with Landsat. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Six of the operational global satellite sea surface temperature products from infrared and microwave sensors are validated in a consistent way in waters north of 60 degrees N. The 15-month validation with drifting buoy in situ observations shows that data from the Advanced Along-Tracking Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) on-board the ENVISAT satellite and NAVOCEANO data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board the NOAA 18 satellite are superior in terms of bias and standard deviation. The observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) on-board the Aqua satellite have superior coverage due to the microwaves' ability to penetrate cloud cover.
   The performance of the different satellite products is examined for variation with season, water temperature, solar elevation angle, and proximity to the marginal ice zone. The validation results identify errors in the satellite products related to observation techniques, data processing and cloud masking. Temporal and spatial error scales are derived for all satellite products using the satellite versus in situ match-up dataset. Temporal error scales are typically between 1 and 2 days and the characteristic spatial error scales between 300 and 500 km. The error cross correlations between the different satellite products reveal that the products from the infrared sensors generally show significant error correlation, whereas the errors of the microwave AMSR-E product have a low correlation with all the products from the infrared sensors.

AB The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) will be part of ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite platform scheduled for launch in late 2014. One of TROPOMI's primary goals will be to accurately monitor methane (CH4) concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere by measuring spectra of sunlight backscattered by the Earth's surface and atmosphere in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral range. Absorption by CH4 along the lightpath allows for the spectroscopic retrieval of its atmospheric abundance given accurate knowledge of the lightpath. Scattering by aerosol and cirrus particles, however, can modify the lightpath substantially causing retrieval errors if not appropriately taken into account. We propose and evaluate a method to minimise these errors by simultaneously retrieving CH4 total column concentrations and scattering properties of the atmosphere. The method exploits observations by TROPOMI's SWIR and near-infrared (NIR) channels and is based on a parameterisation of particle amount, height distribution, and microphysical properties. Retrieval performance is tested for a trial ensemble of simulated observations that cover a realistic range of aerosol and cirrus loaded scenes. For more than 90% of the trials, residual scattering induced CH4 errors are less than 1%. Retrievals with residual errors larger than 1% and non-convergent retrievals typically occur for difficult scenes with high particle load or very small surface albedo. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites. and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180 degrees providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality. Level 1 data processing and operational applications.

AB Clumping index (CI), quantifying the level of foliage grouping within distinct canopy structures relative to a random distribution, is a key structural parameter of plant canopies and very useful in ecological and meteorological models. Previously, a Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been proposed to accurately retrieve the global CI using POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data at similar to 6 km resolution (Chen et al., 2005). In this study, we show for the first time a global Cl map at 500 m resolution derived using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which currently provides the finest pseudo multi-angular data for the global land surface. In computing the NDHD we found that the hotspot calculated from the MODIS BRDF product is underestimated in comparison with POLDER measurements very near the hotspot. Without correcting the bias in MODIS data, the MODIS-derived Cl could be overestimated. We have developed an approach to correct the MODIS hotspot magnitude with co-registered POLDER-3 data acquired at about the same time. Field-measured element-Cls in zenith angles of 30-60 by the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument from 38 sites together with corresponding needle-to-shoot area ratios were used to evaluate the performance of hotspot-corrected NDHD and to tune the parameters to get accurate CI. It is found that the MODIS-derived CI has a dependence on the solar zenith angle, and this dependence in the red band is smaller than that in the near infrared (NIR) band. The highest correlation between field measurements and MODIS-derived CI is achieved when hotspot at nadir is used. The correct estimation of forest species (and therefore the crown shapes) from land cover is very important to the accuracy of MODIS-derived CI. For the red band, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between MODIS-derived CIand field-measured CI is 0.76 for all sites and le is 0.53 for only the needle-leaved forest sites after the hotspot correction, indicating that a strong correlation between MODIS-derived NDHD and CI indeed exists. The MODIS-derived CI is regularly smaller than the field measurement. The red band in the MODIS BRDF product is found to be better than the NIR band for deriving CI for the vegetation covers investigated (mostly dense forests). Therefore a global clumping index map has been produced using the corrected MODIS hot\spot in the red band and optimized parameters. However there were 10 broad-leaved forest sites used in the validation, which are too few for a reliable validation. For the broad-leaved forest area, where the same crown shape (ellipsoid) is used in the algorithm, the global CI spatial pattern is interestingly very similar to the pattern of the land cover distribution, suggesting that the MODIS-derived map has effectively captured the structural differences among cover types.

AB The global distribution of croplands is of critical interest to a wide group of end-users. Different crops have their own representative phenological stages during their growing seasons, which differ considerably from other natural vegetation types. During the last decade, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has become a key tool for vegetation monitoring because of its high temporal resolution, extensive scope, and rapid availability of various products. However, mixed pixels caused by the moderate spatial resolution produce significant errors in crop area estimation. Here we propose a Crop Proportion Phenology Index (CPPI) to express the quantitative relationship between the MODIS vegetation index (VI) time series and winter wheat crop area. The utility of this index was tested in two experimental areas in China: one around Tongzhou and the other around Shuyang, as representative districts around a metropolis and a rural area, respectively. The CPPI performed well in these two regions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) in fractional crop area predictions ranging roughly from 15% in the individual pixels to 5% above 6.25 km(2). The training samples containing mixtures of crop types mitigated the challenges of pure end-member selection in a spectral mixture analysis. A small number of training samples are sufficient to generate the CPPI, which is adaptable to other crop types and larger regions. Estimating the CPPI parameters across larger spatial scales helped improve the stability of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we examine the possibility of using satellite remote sensors for the detection of air traffic emissions produced during the en-route segment of flight in the Upper Troposphere/Lower Stratosphere region (8000-12,000 m). NO2 has been considered as the tracer of aircraft plumes with highest possibility of being successfully detected from space. An analysis of the technical potential of the current orbital sensors capable of measuring NO2 in the proximity of the tropopause has been conducted. In order to estimate an upper bound for the NO2 column related to aircraft emissions, the Canary Islands Corridor has been selected for conducting a simple emission calculation exercise based on real air traffic and operational data, assuming an ideal atmospheric scenario. The results obtained in this approximation have been compared to the actual information retrieved from space sensors. An in-depth inspection of the NO2 column data for two particular areas (Canary Islands Corridor and North Atlantic Flight Corridor) obtained in recent years by SCIAMACHY and OMI has also been carried out.
   The general conclusions of this viability study are not optimistic. The estimated maximum NO2 column value attributable to aircraft emissions at cruise altitudes were lower than the detection limits associated with SCIAMACHY and OMI for NO2 column measurements. As a result, detecting and quantifying the actual NO2 levels in aircraft corridors by space remote sensing is a very challenging task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many algorithms have been developed for the remote estimation of biophysical characteristics of vegetation, in terms of combinations of spectral bands, derivatives of reflectance spectra, neural networks, inversion of radiative transfer models, and several multi-spectral statistical approaches. However, the most widespread type of algorithm used is the mathematical combination of visible and near-infrared reflectance bands, in the form of spectral vegetation indices. Applications of such vegetation indices have ranged from leaves to the entire globe, but in many instances, their applicability is specific to species, vegetation types or local conditions. The general objective of this study is to evaluate different vegetation indices for the remote estimation of the green leaf area index (Green LAI) of two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. Among the indices tested, the chlorophyll Indices (the CIGreen, the CIRed-edge and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI) exhibited strong and significant linear relationships with Green LAI and thus were sensitive across the entire range of Green LAI evaluated (i.e., 0.0 to more than 6.0 m(2)/m(2)). However, the CIRed-edge was the only index insensitive to crop type and produced the most accurate estimations of Green LAI in both crops (RMSE = 0.577 m2/m2). These results were obtained using data acquired with close range sensors (i.e., field spectroradiometers mounted 6 m above the canopy) and an aircraft-mounted hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer (AISA). As the CIRed-edge also exhibited low sensitivity to soil background effects, it constitutes a simple, yet robust tool for the remote and synoptic estimation of Green LAI. Algorithms based on this index may not require re-parameterization when applied to crops with different canopy architectures and leaf structures, but further studies are required for assessing its applicability in other vegetation types (e.g., forests, grasslands).

AB In this paper we quantify the effects of temporal decorrelation in repeat pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). Temporal decorrelation causes significant uncertainties in vegetation parameter estimates obtained using various InSAR techniques, which are desired on a global scale. Because of its stochastic nature temporal decorrelation is hard to model and isolate. In this paper we analyze temporal decorrelation statistically as observed in a large swath of SIR-C L-Band InSAR data collected over the eastern United States, with a repeat pass duration of one day in October 1994 and a near zero perpendicular baseline. The very small baseline for this particular pair makes the effect of volumetric scattering on correlation magnitude statistics nearly imperceptible, allowing for a quantitative analysis of temporal effects alone. The swath analyzed in this paper spans more than a million hectares of terrain comprised primarily of deciduous and evergreen forests, agricultural land, water and urban areas. The relationships of these different land-cover types, phenology and weather conditions (i.e. precipitation and wind) on the measures of interferometric correlation is analyzed in what amounts to be the most geographically extensive analysis of this phenomenon to date.

AB Understanding the spatial variability of tropical forest structure and its impact on the radar estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) is important to assess the scale and accuracy of mapping AGB with future low frequency radar missions. We used forest inventory plots in old growth, secondary succession, and forest plantations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to examine the spatial variability of AGB and its impact on the L-band and P-band polarimetric radar estimation of AGB at multiple spatial scales. Field estimation of AGB was determined from tree size measurements and an allometric equation developed for tropical wet forests. The field data showed very high spatial variability of forest structure with no spatial dependence at a scale above 11 m in old-growth forest. Plot sizes of greater than 0.25 ha reduced the coefficients of variation in AGB to below 20% and yielded a stationary and normal distribution of AGB over the landscape. Radar backscatter measurements at all polarization channels were strongly positively correlated with AGB at three scales of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha, and 1.0 ha. Among these measurements, PHV and LHV showed strong sensitivity to AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) and AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) respectively at the 1.0 ha scale. The sensitivity varied across forest types because of differences in the effects of forest canopy and gap structure on radar attenuation and scattering. Spatial variability of structure and speckle noise in radar measurements contributed equally to degrading the sensitivity of the radar measurements to AGB at spatial scales less than 1.0 ha. By using algorithms based on polarized radar backscatter, we estimated AGB with RMSE = 22.6 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) at P-band and RMSE = 23.8 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) at L-band and with the accuracy optimized at 1-ha scale within 95% confidence interval. By adding the forest height, estimated from the C-band Interferometry data as an independent variable to the algorithm, the AGB estimation improved beyond the backscatter sensitivity by 20% at P-band and 40% at L-band. The results suggested the estimation of AGB can be improved substantially from the fusion of lidar or InSAR derived forest height with the polarimetric backscatter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A ground-based, upward-scanning, near-infrared lidar, the Echidna (R) validation instrument (EVI), built by CSIRO Australia, retrieves forest stand structural parameters, including mean diameter at breast height (DBH), stem count density (stems/area), basal area, and above-ground woody biomass with very good accuracy in six New England hardwood and conifer forest stands. Comparing forest structural parameters retrieved using EVI data with extensive ground measurements, we found excellent agreement at the site level using five EVI scans (plots) per site (R-2 = 0.94-0.99): very good agreement at the plot level for stem count density and biomass (R-2 = 0.90-0.85); and good agreement at the plot level for mean DBH and basal area (R-2 = 0.48-0.66). The observed variance at site and plot levels suggest that a sample area of at least 1 ha (10(4) m(2)) is required to estimate these parameters accurately at the stand level using either lidar-based or conventional methods. The algorithms and procedures used to retrieve these structural parameters are dependent on the unique ability of the Echidna (R) lidar to digitize the full waveform of the scattered lidar pulse as it returns to the instrument, which allows consistent separation of scattering by trunks and large branches from scattering by leaves. This successful application of ground-based lidar technology opens the door to rapid and accurate measurement of biomass and timber volume in areal sampling scenarios and as a calibration and validation tool for mapping biomass using airborne or spaceborne remotely sensed data.

AB To interpret the snowpack evolution, and in particular to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE), passive microwave remote sensing has proved to be a useful tool given its sensitivity to snow properties. However, the main uncertainties using existing SWE algorithms arise from snow metamorphism which evolves during the winter season, and changes the snow emissivity. To consider the evolution in snow emissivity a coupled snow evolution-emission model can be used to simulate the brightness temperature (T-B) of the snowpack.
   During a dedicated campaign in the winter season. from November to April, of 2007-2008 two surface-based radiometers operating at 19 GHz and 37 GHz continuously measured the passive microwave radiation emitted through a seasonal snowpack in southern Quebec (Canada). This paper aims at modeling and interpreting this time series of T-B over the whole season, with an hourly step, using a coupled multi-layer snow evolution-emission model. The thermodynamic snow evolution model, referred as to Crocus, was driven by local meteorological measurements. Results from this model provided, in turn, the input variables to run the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) in order to predict T-B at 19 GHz and 37 GHz for both vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarizations. The accuracy of T-B predicted by the Crocus-MEMLS coupled model was evaluated using continuous measurements from the surface-based radiometers.
   The weather conditions observed during the winter season were diverse, including several warm periods with melting snow and rain-on-snow events, producing very complex variations in the time series of T-B. To aid our analysis, we identified days with melting snow versus days with dry snow. The Crocus-MEMLS coupled model was able to accurately predict melt events with a success rate of 86%. The residual error was due to an overestimation of the duration of several melt events simulated by Crocus. This problem was explained by 1) a limitation of percolation, and 2) a very long-acting melt of lower layers due to geothermal flux.
   When the snowpack was completely dry, the global trend of T-B during the season was characterized by a decrease of T-B due to growth in the snow grain size. During most of the season, Crocus-MEMLS correctly predicted the evolution of T-B resulting from temperature gradient metamorphism; the root mean square errors ranged between 2.8 K for the 19 GHz vertical polarization (19V) and 6.9 K for the 37 GHz horizontal polarization (37H). However, during dry periods near the end of the season, the values of T-B were strongly overestimated. This overestimation was mainly due to a limitation of the growth of large snow grains in the wet snowpack simulated by Crocus. This effect was confirmed by estimating snow grain sizes from the observed T-B and the coupled model. The estimated snow grain sizes were larger and more realistic than those initially predicted by the Crocus model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive species disrupt landscape patterns and compromise the functionality of ecosystem processes. Non-native saltcedar poses significant threats to native vegetation and groundwater resources in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and quantifying spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for monitoring its spread. Considerable research focuses on determining the accuracy of various remote sensing techniques for distinguishing saltcedar from native woody riparian vegetation through sub-pixel, or soft classifications. However, there is a lack of research quantifying spatial distribution patterns from these classifications, mainly because landscape metrics, which are commonly used to statistically assess these patterns, require bounded classes and cannot be applied directly to soft classifications. This study tests a new method for discretizing sub-pixel data to generate landscape metrics using a continuum of fractional cover thresholds. The developed approach transforms sub-pixel classifications into discrete maps compliant with metric terms and computes and interprets metric results in the context of the region to explain patterns in the extent, distribution, and connectivity of saltcedar in the Rio Grande basin. Results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to sub-pixel values and can vary greatly with fractional cover. Therefore spectral unmixing should be performed prior to metric calculations. Analysis of metric trends provides evidence that saltcedar has expanded away from the immediate riparian zones and is displacing native vegetation. This information, coupled with control management strategies, can be used to target remediation activities along the Rio Grande. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information regarding the extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance are key inputs required for accurate estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Equally important for studying carbon dynamics is the ability to distinguish the cause or type of forest disturbance occurring on the landscape. Wildfire and timber harvesting are common disturbances occurring in boreal forests, with each having differing carbon consequences (i.e., biomass removed, recovery rates). Development of methods to not only map, but distinguish these types of disturbance with satellite data will depend upon an improved understanding of their distinctive spectral properties. In this study, we mapped wildfires and clearcut harvests occurring in a Landsat time series (LTS) acquired in the boreal plains of Saskatchewan, Canada. This highly accurate reference map (kappa = 0.91) depicting the year and cause of historical disturbances was used to determine the spectral and temporal properties needed to accurately classify fire and clearcut disturbances. The results showed that spectral data from the short-wave infrared (SWIR; e.g., Landsat band 5) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was most effective at separating fires and clearcut harvests possibly due to differences in structure, shadowing, and amounts of exposed soil left behind by the two disturbance types. Although SWIR data acquired 1 year after disturbance enabled the most accurate discrimination of fires and clearcut harvests, good separation (e.g., kappa >= 0.80) could still be achieved with Landsat band 5 and other SWIR-based indices 3 to 4 years after disturbance. Conversely, minimal disturbance responses in near infrared-based indices associated with green leaf area (e.g.. NDVI) led to unreliably low classification accuracies regardless of time since disturbance. In addition to exploring the spectral and temporal manifestation of forest disturbance types, we also demonstrate how Landsat change maps which attribute cause of disturbance can be used to help elucidate the social, ecological and carbon consequences associated with wildfire and clearcut harvesting in Canadian boreal forests.

AB Drylands cover about 41% of the globe's surface and provide important ecosystem services, but land use and climate change exert considerable pressure on these ecosystems. Both of these drivers frequently result in gradual vegetation change and landscape-scale trend analysis based on yearly vegetation estimates can capture such changes. Such trend analyses based on high-resolution time series of satellite imagery have so far not widely been used and existing studies in drylands relied on different vegetation measures. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been chosen due to its superiority to simpler vegetation estimates in quantifying vegetation cover in single-date studies, however SMA can be challenging to implement for large areas. Here, we quantify the trade-off involved when using simple vegetation estimates instead of SMA fractions for subsequent trend analyses. We calculated NDVI, SAVI and Tasseled Cap Greenness, as well as SMA green vegetation fractions for a time series of Landsat images from 1984-2005 for a study region in Crete. Linear trend analysis showed that trend coefficients and the spatial patterns of trends were similar across all vegetation estimates and the entire study region, especially for areas where vegetation changed gradually. On average, trends based on simple measures differed less than 5% from SMA-based trends with decreasing similarity in trend results from Tasseled Cap Greenness to SAVI and NDVI. Vegetation estimates differed markedly in their response to disturbance events such as fires. Trend analyses based on qualitative measures can easily be applied across very large areas and using multi-sensor time series based on high-resolution data. While the subtle differences between vegetation estimates may still be important for some applications, the robustness of trend analyses regarding the choice of vegetation estimate bears considerable promise to reconstruct fine-scale vegetation dynamics and land use histories and to assess climate change impacts on the world's drylands.

AB The recent paper by Wang and Zender [Wang. X., & Zender, C. S. (2010). MODIS snow albedo bias at high solar zenith angles relative to theory and to in situ observations in Greenland. Remote Sensing of Environment.] draws erroneous conclusions about solar zenith angle biases at high latitudes by not making appropriate use of the extensive quality flags available with the MODIS BRDF/Albedo. Coarse resolution MODIS white-sky albedo data are compared with actual blue-sky field albedometer measurements from the Greenland GC-Net. By utilizing large area averages of the MODIS data product that combine both high quality and poor quality data indiscriminately, the authors erroneously conclude that the accuracy deteriorates for solar zenith angle (SZA)>55 degrees and often becomes physically unrealistic for SZA>65 degrees. Once the quality flags are considered, however, the comparisons demonstrate that the MODIS product performs quite well out to the recommended limit for product use of 70 degrees SZA. This verifies the conclusions of an earlier more rigorous evaluation performed by Stroeve et al. [Stroeve, J., Box, J. E., Gao, F., Liang, S., Nolin, A., & Schaaf, C. B. (2005). Accuracy assessment of the MODIS 16-day albedo product for snow: comparisons with Greenland in situ measurements. Remote Sensing of Environment]. With over a decade of observations and products now available from the MODIS instrument, these data are increasingly being used to evaluate and tune climate and biogeochemical models. However, such use should take into account the documented quality and limitations of the satellite-derived product. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in numerous environmental studies. Surface heterogeneity induces uncertainty in estimating subpixel temperature. To take an advantage of simultaneous, multi-resolution observations at coincident nadirs by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), LST products from the two sensors were examined for a portion of suburb area in Beijing, China. We selected Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as representative remote sensing indices for four land cover types (vegetation, bare soil, impervious and water area), respectively. By using support vector machines, the overall classification accuracy of the four land cover types with inputs of the four remote sensing indices, extracted from ASTER visible near infrared (VNIR) bands and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, reached 97.66%, and Kappa coefficient was 0.9632. In order to lower the subpixel temperature estimation error caused by re-sampling of remote sensing data, a disaggregation method for subpixel temperature using the remote sensing endmember index based technique (DisEMI) was established in this study. Firstly, the area ratios and statistical information of endmember remote sensing indices were calculated from ASTER VNIR/SWIR data at 990 m and 90 m resolutions, respectively. Secondly, the relationship between the 990 m resolution MODIS LST and the corresponding input parameters (area ratios and endmember indices at the 990 m resolution) was trained by a genetic algorithm and self-organizing feature map artificial neural network (GA-SOFM-ANN). Finally, the trained models were employed to estimate the 90 m resolution subpixel temperature with inputs of area ratios and endmember indices at the 90 m resolution. ASTER LST product was used for verifying the estimated subpixel temperature, and the verified results indicate that the estimated temperature distribution was basically consistent with that of ASTER LST product. A better agreement was found between temperatures derived by our proposed method (DisEMI) and the ASTER 90 m data (R-2=0.709 and RMSE = 2.702 K). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS
AB Argo profiles of temperature and salinity data from the north Indian Ocean have been used to address the seasonal and interannual variability of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and SSS Anomaly (SSSA) in 2 boxes from the eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO: 5 degrees S-5 degrees N, 90 degrees-95 degrees E) and Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS: 5 degrees-9 degrees N, 72 degrees-76 degrees E) and to compare with the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulated SSS for the period from January 2002 to February 2007. The observational period covered one strong negative Indian Ocean Dipole Zonal Mode (IODZM) event in 2005 and a strong positive IODZM event in 2006. The Argo profiles in each box captured the impact of these IODZM events with a larger impact in the EIO box showing salting (positive SSSA, +0.9) during negative IODZM (November 2005) and freshening (negative SSSA, -0.6) during positive IODZM (November 2006). A band of positive (negative) SSSA occurs in the central EIO during negative (positive) IODZM event in 2005 (2006) under the influence of IODZM dynamics. The impact of IODZM event in the SEAS is more evident during boreal winter months. The observed anomalous eastward (westward) surface current contributed to the observed intense salting (freshening) during negative (positive) IODZM event in the E10. Following the IODZM events, the East India Coastal Current (EICC) gets modulated through the propagation of downwelling/upwelling Kelvin Waves and further lead to the freshening/salting in the SEAS during boreal winter. These are well corroborated with the HYCOM simulations of SSS and currents. This study emphasizes that the HYCOM simulated salinity fields would be useful to provide rapid checks revealing either problems or successes in the satellite retrievals of salinity from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius missions.

AB The leaf area index (LAI) of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations is highly dynamic both seasonally and interannually, and is spatially variable depending on pedo-climatic conditions. LAI is very important in determining the carbon and water balance of a stand, but is difficult to measure during a complete stand rotation and at large scales. Remote-sensing methods allowing the retrieval of LAI time series with accuracy and precision are therefore necessary. Here, we tested two methods for LAI estimation from MODIS 250m resolution red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance time series. The first method involved the inversion of a coupled model of leaf reflectance and transmittance (PROSPECT4), soil reflectance (SOILSPECT) and canopy radiative transfer (4SAIL2). Model parameters other than the LAI were either fixed to measured constant values, or allowed to vary seasonally and/or with stand age according to trends observed in field measurements. The LAI was assumed to vary throughout the rotation following a series of alternately increasing and decreasing sigmoid curves. The parameters of each sigmoid curve that allowed the best fit of simulated canopy reflectance to MODIS red and NIR reflectance data were obtained by minimization techniques. The second method was based on a linear relationship between the LAI and values of the GEneralized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI), which was calibrated using destructive LAI measurements made at two seasons, on Eucalyptus stands of different ages and productivity levels. The ability of each approach to reproduce field-measured LAI values was assessed, and uncertainty on results and parameter sensitivities were examined. Both methods offered a good fit between measured and estimated LAI (R(2) = 0.80 and R(2) = 0.62 for model inversion and GESAVI-based methods, respectively), but the GESAVI-based method overestimated the LAI at young ages.

AB Appropriate information on solar resources is very important for a variety of technological areas, such as: agriculture, meteorology, forestry engineering, water resources and in particular in the designing and sizing of solar energy systems. However, the availability of observed solar radiation measurements has proven to be spatially and temporally inadequate for many applications. In this paper we propose to merge the global solar radiation measurements from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium solar measurements network with the operationally derived surface incoming global short-wave radiation products from Meteosat Second Generation satellites imageries to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of the surface global solar radiation data over Belgium. We evaluate several merging methods with various degrees of complexity (from mean field bias correction to geostatistical merging techniques) together with interpolated ground measurements and satellite-derived values only. The performance of the different methods is assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The characteristics and benefits of ocean color merged data sets created using a semi-analytical model and the normalized water-leaving radiance observations from the SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS ocean color missions are presented. Merged data products are coalesced from multiple mission observations into a single data product with better spatial and temporal coverage than the individual missions. Using the data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-AQUA and MERIS for the 2002-2009 time period, the average daily coverage of a merged product is similar to 25% of the world ocean which is nearly twice that of any single mission's observations. The frequency at which a particular area is sampled from space is also greatly improved in merged data as some areas can be sampled as frequently as 64% of the time (in days). The merged data presented here are validated through matchup analyses and by comparing them to the data sets obtained from individual missions. Further, a complete error budget for the final merged data products was developed which accounts for uncertainty associated with input water-leaving radiances and provides uncertainty levels for the output products (i.e. the chlorophyll concentration, the combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient and the particulate backscattering coefficient). These merged products and their uncertainties at each pixel were developed within the NASA REASON/MEaSUREs and ESA GlobColour projects and are available to the scientific community. Our approach has many benefits for the creation of unified Climate Data Records from satellite ocean color observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bidirectional reflectance signatures of vegetation are strongly shaped by the shadows cast between objects in a scene, such as tree crowns or leaves. Differences in the shape and spatial density of these objects result in distinct bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) in different biomes. We examined how allometry may constrain the variability of canopy architectural parameters in BRDF models, and consequently alter the attribution of variation in the simulated bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Allometry is the covariation between the size or number of organisms and their component parts.
   To test the importance of realistic variation and covariation of canopy architecture on BRDF, we incorporated the 3-D radiative transfer model DISORD (which uses the geometric optics (GO) model of Li and Strahler) into a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. The MC algorithm generated an ensemble of tree canopies whose parameters fulfilled the allometry of a set of measured forest plots from Russian forest inventory. The role of view geometry was directly considered using perturbations of the parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of the BRF itself, evaluated at different view angles, and the difference in BRF (Delta BRF) as measured at two view angles representing paired satellite observations.
   The allometrically constrained forest plots had reduced variation in Delta BRF compared to the uncorrelated plots, but the variation of the BRF itself is dramatically increased by allometry. The variation of the BRF is relatively constant among the view angles examined, whereas the variation in Delta BRF increases dramatically with larger phase angles. The BRF was most sensitive to canopy attributes that were important in radiative transfer, such as LAI and stem area index (SAI), but there were also large (similar to 40% of variance) contributions of geometric components such as tree number, crown size, and ground cover. By contrast, sensitivity of Delta BRF was dominated by ground cover, crown size and tree number, which all play a role in the GO calculations. The mix of sensitive parameters was not dramatically different between gymnosperms and angiosperms, nor between allometric and correlated runs. Together these results indicate that forest structure and leaf area could be usefully inverted together using paired observations with different viewing geometries. Ideal pairs of observations are those with large difference in phase angle, and along the gradient of the BRF peak, which most commonly occur with sequential MODIS/Terra overpasses.

TI Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil mass wasting processes

AB The beautiful Longmenshan area is one of the main tourist attractions in Sichuan Province, China. The epicenter of a catastrophic earthquake measured at 8.0 Ms (China Seismological Bureau), occurred within this area at Wenchuan (31 degrees 01'16"N, 103 degrees 22'01"E) at 14:28 May 12, 2008 (Beijing time). The earthquake triggered numerous types of landslide transport and hazards, including soil and debris avalanches, rockfalls, slumps, debris flows, creation of barrier lakes and slope fattenings. This paper examines the landslide hazards in the Longmenshan area caused by the earthquake using remotely sensed images, mainly Beijing-1 Microsatellite data before and after the earthquake, compared to digital elevation maps and slope gradient maps, land use and vegetation cover maps. Areas of erosion and loss of vegetation were compared from pre- and post-earthquake data, from which were calculated changes in vegetated areas, bare slopes, and mass movement during the earthquake. These events occurred over altitudes from 1000 to 4000 m and on slope angles between 25 and 55 degrees. The results show that the total area of erosion and land movement due to the earthquake increased by 86.3 km(2) (19.2% of the study area). Compared with pre-earthquake, the areas of very low intensity soil erosion and moderate intensity soil erosion were respectively reduced by 3.6 km(2), 24.3 km(2) and 30.9 km(2). On the other hand, the areas of severe and very severe intensity soil erosion were substantially increased by 45.8 km(2) and 99.2 km(2). In the post-earthquake stage, the bare areas (vegetation cover <15%) have increased by 65.8 km(2). Without vegetation, the denuded earthquake damaged slopes and other high risk sites have become severe erosion problems. Thus, it is essential to continue long-term monitoring of mass wasting in the denuded areas and evaluate potential risk sites for future landslides and debris flows. We anticipate that these results will be helpful in decision making and policy planning for recovery and reconstruction in the earthquake-affected area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional field-based lithological mapping can be a time-consuming, costly and challenging endeavour when large areas need to be investigated, where terrain is remote and difficult to access and where the geology is highly variable over short distances. Consequently, rock units are often mapped at coarse-scales, resulting in lithological maps that have generalised contacts which in many cases are inaccurately located. Remote sensing data, such as aerial photographs and satellite imagery are commonly incorporated into geological mapping programmes to obtain geological information that is best revealed by overhead perspectives. However, spatial and spectral limitations of the imagery and dense vegetation cover can limit the utility of traditional remote sensing products. The advent of Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) as a remote sensing tool offers the potential to provide a novel solution to these problems because accurate and high-resolution topographic data can be acquired in either forested or non-forested terrain, allowing discrimination of individual rock types that typically have distinct topographic characteristics. This study assesses the efficacy of airborne LiDAR as a tool for detailed lithological mapping in the upper section of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. Morphometric variables (including slope, curvature and surface roughness) were derived from a 4 m digital terrain model in order to quantify the topographic characteristics of four principal lithologies found in the area. An artificial neural network (the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map) was then employed to classify the lithological units based upon these variables. The algorithm presented here was used to generate a detailed lithological map which defines lithological contacts much more accurately than the best existing geological map. In addition, a separate map of classification uncertainty highlights potential follow-up targets for ground-based verification. The results of this study demonstrate the significant potential of airborne LiDAR for lithological discrimination and rapid generation of detailed lithological maps, as a contribution to conventional geological mapping programmes.

AB Increasing dominance of lianas in many tropical forests is considered a fingerprint of global environmental change. Despite the key role they play in ecosystem functioning, lianas remain one of the least studied life forms in tropical environments. This paper contrasts leaf traits and spectral properties (400-1100 nm) of liana and tree communities from a tropical dry forest and a tropical rainforest in Panama, Central America. Differences between lianas and tree leaf traits were analyzed using spectroscopy, leaf histology and pigment extractions. Results from this study indicate that many of the biochemical, structural, and optical properties of lianas and trees are different in the dry forest site but not in rainforest sites. In the dry forest site, liana leaves exhibited significantly lower chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and were thinner than the leaves of their host trees. Specific leaf area, dry to fresh mass ratio, and mean water content of liana leaves were significantly higher when compared with tree leaves. The differences observed in the tropical dry forest site indicate that lianas may have a higher rate of resource acquisition and usage, whereas trees tend to conserve acquired resources. We suggest that our results may be indicative of the presence of a liana syndrome related to water availability and thus best exhibited in tropical dry forests. Our findings have important implications for using remote sensing to accurately map the distribution of liana communities at regional scales and for the continued expansion of lianas in tropical environments as a result of global change.

AB Bezymianny (Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia) is an active stratovolcano, characterized by a summit lava dome and overlapping pyroclastic flow (PF) deposits to the southeast. Three explosive eruptions (24 December 2006, 11 May 2007, and 14 October 2007) generated PFs that were dominated by juvenile material and were emplaced primarily due to column collapse. Following this, a gravitational lava flow front collapse event generated block and ash flow on 5 November 2007. Moderate spatial resolution data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument were collected between October 2006 and December 2007 to assist in post-eruption monitoring and interpretation of the volcanological processes that produced the PF deposits. Using multitemporal ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) data, three periods of increased activity were observed that coincided with each eruption and subsequent activity. During a field campaign in August 2007, the May 2007 PF deposit was investigated in detail. Eight ASTER TIR pixels (90 m spatial resolution) were selected from the 30 June 2007 ASTER TIR image, seven of which were accessible in the field. Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) image and thermocouple data over these areas were collected to observe thermal heterogeneities with distance along the PF deposit. Although synchronous ASTER data were not possible at the time of fieldwork due to cloud cover, a held survey of blocks versus ash in each pixel was carried out to investigate thermal and textural variation with distance from the vent and to provide preliminary field results. Based on the field-derived temperature data and surface block percentages, the May 2007 PF deposit was more block-rich in the medial portion of the flow surface, but more ash-dominated at the PF terminus region, which promoted more rapid cooling. We present multitemporal ASTER data spanning a 14 month period and highlight ground-based observations acquired within the same period of eruptive and dome-growth activity. These data collectively provide thermal radiative and emissivity information on an actively changing explosive volcanic system and specifically documents changes over recently-emplaced and cooling PF deposits.

AB The k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) estimation and prediction technique is widely used to produce pixel-level predictions and areal estimates of continuous forest variables such as area and volume, often by sub-categories such as species. An advantage of k-NN is that the same parameters (e.g., k-value, distance metric, weight vector for the feature space variables) can be used for all variables, whether continuous or categorical. An obvious question is the degree to which accuracy can be improved if the k-NN estimation parameters are tailored for specific variable groups such as volumes by tree species or categorical variables. We investigated prediction of categorical forest attribute variables from satellite image spectral data using k-NN with optimisation of the weight vector for the ancillary variables obtained using a genetic algorithm. We tested several genetic algorithm fitness functions, all derived from well-known accuracy measures. For a Finnish test site, the categorical forest attribute variables were site fertility and tree species dominance, and for an Italian test site, the variables were forest type and conifer/broad-leaved dominance. The results for both test sites were validated using independent data sets. Our results indicate that use of the genetic algorithm to optimize the weight vector for prediction of a single forest attribute variable had a slight positive effect on the prediction accuracies for other variables. Errors can be further decreased if the optimisation is done by variable groups. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an automated method for mapping burned areas using 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery coupled with 1-km MODIS active fire observations. The algorithm applies dynamic thresholds to composite imagery generated from a burn-sensitive vegetation index and a measure of temporal texture. Cumulative active fire maps are used to guide the selection of burned and unburned training samples. An accuracy assessment for three geographically diverse regions (central Siberia, the western United States, and southern Africa) was performed using high resolution burned area maps derived from Landsat imagery. Mapped burned areas were accurate to within approximately 10% in all regions except the high-tree-cover sub-region of southern Africa, where the MODIS burn maps underestimated the area burned by 41%. We estimate the minimum detectable burn size for reliable detection by our algorithm to be. on the order of 120 ha. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Whenever possible, intercomparisons of Earth radiation budget data from different spaceborne instruments should be made as they are important steps in the overall validation process. Intercomparisons are also key elements to compile long-term climate datasets by merging data from several instruments. In this study the GERB Edition-1 and CERES Edition-2 data are compared for June and December 2004. The comparisons concern shortwave and longwave radiance and flux at the top-of-atmosphere. Three different GERB level-2 data products with differing space-time characteristics are compared with data from the 4 CERES instruments. In general, the GERB unfiltered radiances and fluxes are found to be 5.9% and 7.5% higher than CERES for the shortwave. The GERB longwave radiance and flux are 1.3% lower than CERES. Analysis separated by scene type reveals differences between the GERB products. These differences should be taken into account by the user of the GERB data. The LW flux intercomparison shows angular dependency problem affecting the GERB dataset in cloudy and aerosol regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface albedo is one of the key parameters in the radiation budget, the hydrological cycle and climate modeling studies. It is now widely understood that large errors may occur in the estimation of surface albedo without taking into consideration the anisotropy reflectance effect, which is a general feature of the earth surface. Two major anisotropic correction methods exist for the retrieval of land surface albedo under clear sky conditions. One method involves linearly converting from top of the atmosphere (TOA) albedo to surface albedo, and another is based on the inversion of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model of the surface. In the present study, a new approach that utilizes an empirical model for estimating surface albedo has been proposed for snow free land surfaces under clear sky conditions. We analyzed the bidirectional reflectance data set with numerous samples representing various land cover types, which derived from POLDER/ADEOS-1 multi-angle imagery data and distributed by MEDIAS-France. Through the analysis, an empirical relation between bidirectional reflectance and albedo was established and has been discussed in detail. The proposed model can be used for direct estimation of surface albedo from a single BRF observation when the sun-target-sensor geometry is known. No BRDF model inversion scheme is necessary. The present model has no or weak dependence on the existing land surface classifications, and is insensitive to wavelength. The theoretical absolute accuracy of the estimated albedo is approximately 0.010 for visible (0.4-0.7 mu m), 0.023 for near infrared (0.7-3.0 mu m) and 0.016 for shortwave (0.2-3.0 mu m), respectively. Albedo consistency with viewing geometry has been verified, resulting in good agreement for albedo estimated from various viewing directions. Validation of the satellite estimated albedo derived by the proposed method, using field observations were also presented and results show it can give reasonably accurate estimation. The proposed method is expected to be a suitable candidate for practical applications of albedo estimation for sensors that do not perform multi-angle observations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems.
   The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A remote sensing approach permits for the first time the derivation of a map of the carbon dioxide concentration in a volcanic plume. The airborne imaging remote sensing overcomes the typical difficulties associated with the ground measurements and permits rapid and large views of the volcanic Processes together with the measurements of volatile components exolving from craters. Hyperspectral images in the infrared range (1900-2100 nm), where carbon dioxide absorption lines are present, have been used. These images were acquired during an airborne campaign by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over the Pu'u'O'o Vent situated at the Kilauea East Rift zone, Hawaii. Using a radiative transfer model to simulate the measured up-welling spectral radiance and by applying the newly developed mapping technique, the carbon dioxide concentration map of the Pu'u'O'o Vent plume were obtained. The carbon dioxide integrated flux rate were calculated and a mean value of 396 +/- 138 t d(-1) was obtained. This result is in agreement, within the measurements errors, with those of the ground measurements taken during the airborne campaign. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrological cycle for high latitude regions is inherently linked with the seasonal snowpack. Thus, accurately monitoring the snow depth and the associated aerial coverage are critical issues for monitoring the global climate system. Passive microwave satellite measurements provide an optimal means to monitor the snowpack over the arctic region. While the temporal evolution of snow extent can be observed globally from microwave radiometers, the determination of the corresponding snow depth is more difficult. A dynamic algorithm that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures and was validated over the U.S. Great Plains and Western Siberia.
   The purpose of this study is to assess the dynamic algorithm performance over the entire high latitude (land) region by computing a snow depth multi-year field for the time period 1987-1995. This multi-year average is compared to the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase2 (GSWP2) snow depth computed from several state-of-the-art land surface schemes and averaged over the same time period. The multi-year average obtained by the dynamic algorithm is in good agreement with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient for January is 0.55). The static algorithm, which assumes a constant snow grain size in space and time does not correlate with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient with GSWP2 data for January is -0.03), but exhibits a very high anti-correlation with the NCEP average January air temperature field (correlation coefficient -0.77), the deepest satellite snow pack being located in the coldest regions, where the snow grain size may be significantly larger than the average value used in the static algorithm. The dynamic algorithm performs better over Eurasia (with a correlation coefficient with GSWP2 snow depth equal to 0.65) than over North America (where the correlation coefficient decreases to 0.29).

AB Large area land-cover monitoring scenarios, involving large volumes of data, are becoming more prevalent in remote sensing applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for increased automation in the change mapping process. The objective of this research is to compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms (MLAs); two classification tree software routines (S-plus and C4.5) and an artificial neural network (ARTMAP), in the context of mapping land-cover modifications in northern and southern California study sites between 1990/91 and 1996. Comparisons were based on several criteria: overall accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and variation, and noise. ARTMAP produced the most accurate maps overall (similar to 84%), for two study areas - in southern and northern California, and was most resistant to training data deficiencies. The change map generated using ARTMAP has similar accuracies to a human-interpreted map produced by the U.S. Forest Service in the southern study area. ARTMAP appears to be robust and accurate for automated, large area change monitoring as it performed equally well across the diverse study areas with minimal human intervention in the classification process.

AB Vegetation phenology is the chronology of periodic phases of development. It constitutes an efficient bio-indicator of impacts of climate changes and a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation-climate interactions and their implications on carbon cycling. Numerous studies were devoted to the remote sensing of vegetation phenology. Most of these were carried out using data acquired by AVHRR instrument onboard NOAA meteorological satellites. Since 1999, multispectral images were acquired over the whole earth surface every one to two days by MODIS instrument onboard Terra and Aqua platforms. In comparison with AVHRR, MODIS constitutes a significant technical improvement in terms of spatial resolution, spectral resolution, geolocation accuracy, atmospheric corrections scheme and cloud screening and sensor calibration. In this study, 250 in daily MODIS data were used to derive precise vegetation phenological dates over deciduous forest stands. Phenological markers derived from MODIS time-series and provided by MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics product (MOD12Q2) were compared to field measurements carried out over the main deciduous forest stands across France and over five years. We show that the inflexion point of the asymmetric double-sigmoid function fitted to NDVI temporal profile is a good marker of the onset of green-up in deciduous stands. At plot level, the prediction uncertainty is 8.5 days and the bias is 3.5 days. MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics MODI2Q2 provides estimates of onset of green-up dates which deviate substantially from in situ observations and do not perforin better than the null model. RMSE values are 20.5 days (bias -17 days) using the onset of greenness increase and 36.5 days (bias 34.5 days) using the onset of greenness maximum. An improvement of prediction quality is obtained if we consider the average of MOD12Q2 onset of greenness increase and maximum as marker of onset of green-up date. RMSE decreases to 16.5 days and bias to 7.5 days. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information about forest cover is needed by all of the nine societal benefit areas identified by the Group of Earth Observation (GEO). In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper aims to investigate several new nonlinear/non-Gaussian filters in the context of the sequential data assimilation. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the sampling importance resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) and the unscented particle filter (UPF) are described in the state-space model framework in the Bayesian filtering background. We first evaluated those methods with a simple highly nonlinear Lorenz model and a scalar nonlinear non-Gaussian model to investigate the filter stability and the error sensitivity, and then their abilities in the one-dimensional estimation of the soil moisture content with the synthetic microwave brightness temperature assimilation experiment in the land surface model VIC-3L. All the results are compared with the EnKF. The advantages and disadvantages of each filter are discussed.
   The results in the Lorenz model showed that the particle filters are suitable for the large measurement interval assimilation and that the Kalman filters were suitable for the frequent measurement assimilation as well as small measurement uncertainties. The EnKF also showed its feasibility for the non-Gaussian noise. The performance of the SIR-PF was actually not as good as that of the UKF or the EnKF regarding a very small observation noise level compared with the uncertainties in the system. In the one-dimensional brightness temperature assimilation experiment, the UKF, the EnKF and the SIR-PF all proved to be flexible and reliable nonlinear filter algorithms for the low dimensional sequential land data assimilation application. For the high dimensional land surface system that takes the horizontal error correlations into account, the UKF is restricted by its computational demand in the covariance propagation; we must use the EnKF, the SIR-PF and other covariance reduction algorithms. The large computational cost prevents the UPF from being applied in practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing has been used extensively to provide quantitative information on the distribution of phytoplankton in inland waters through the surrogate mapping of chlorophyll a, but as chlorophyll a is common to almost all species of phytoplankton it cannot provide any information on the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities. However, the varied optical properties of phytoplankton taxa may present a means to their discrimination via remote sensing data. This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which the spectral dissimilarities of brown, green, blue-green and red algae were examined with a view to establishing a basis upon which broad changes in phytoplankton communities might be monitored through remote sensing. Pseudo phytoplankton communities were simulated in a series of mesocosm experiments from which spectral reflectance measurements were acquired. The results demonstrated that the phytoplankton colour groups examined were indeed spectrally dissimilar. The spectral distinction between colour groups was noted to be greatest at high concentrations of chlorophyll a and between pseudo-communities dominated by a single species; spectral differences were lower in mixed pseudo-communities with co-dominant species. Moreover, it proved possible to quantify the concentration of two potential biomarker pigments, fucoxanthin and C-phycocyanin, through the derivation of simple spectral indices. The coincidental presence of varying concentrations of SPM (SPIM and SPOM) caused significant attenuation of the spectral response of the pseudo-communities and affected the accuracy of biomarker pigment estimation. It is considered that the realisation of a remote sensing technique for the discrimination of phytoplankton taxa in inland waters would be an extremely useful tool for limnological research and water resource management and thus the future application of this research to inland waters is also discussed.

AB Satellite radar backscattering coefficient sigma(0) data from ENVISAT-ASAR and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from SPOT-VEGETATION are assimilated in the STEP model of vegetation dynamics. The STEP model is coupled with a radiative transfer model of the radar backscattering and NDVI signatures of the soil and herbaceous vegetation. These models are driven by field data (rainfall time series, soil properties, etc.). While some model parameters have fixed values, some other parameters have target values to be optimized. The study focuses on a well documented 1 km(2) homogeneous area in a semi-arid region (Gourma, Mali).
   We here investigate whether departures between model predictions and the corresponding data result from field data errors, in situ data lack of representativeness or some model shortcomings. For this purpose we introduce an evolutionary strategy (ES) approach relying on a bi-objective function to be minimized in the data assimilation/inversion process. Several numerical experiments are conducted, in various mono-objective and bi-objective modes, and the performances of the model predictions compared in terms of NDVI, backscattering coefficient, leaf area index (LAI) and biomass.
   It is shown that the bi-objective ES leads to improved model predictions and also to a better readability of the results by exploring the Pareto front of optimal and admissible solutions. It is also shown that the information brought from the optical sensor and the radar is coherent; that the corresponding radiative transfer models are also coherent; that the representativeness of in situ data can be compared to satellite data through the modeling process. However some systematic biases on the biomass predictions (errors in the range 140 to 300 kg ha(-1)) are observed. Thanks to the bi-objective ES, we are able to identify some likely shortcoming in the vegetation dynamics model relating the LAI to the biomass variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km(2) landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0 W m(-2) up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94 W m(-2) (at the 28.5 m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r=0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

ID INVENTORY
AB A multi-source forest inventory (MSFI) method has been developed for use in the Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI). The method is based on a k-nearest neighbour rule and uses field plots from the NFI, land cover maps, and satellite image data from Landsat Thematic Mapper. The inventory method is used to produce maps of selected forest variables and to estimate the selected forest variables for large areas such as municipalities. In this study, focus has been on the qualitative variables 'dominating species group' and 'development class' because these variables are of central interest to forest managers. A mid-summer Landsat 5 TM scene was used as image data, and all NFI plots inside the scene were used as a reference dataset. The relationship between the spectral bands and the forest variables was analysed, and it was found that the levels of association were low. A leave-one-out method based on the reference dataset was used to estimate the pixel-level accuracies. They were found to be relatively low with 63% agreement for species groups. An independent control survey was available for a municipality and estimates from the MSFI were compared to it. The levels of error were quite high. It was concluded that the large area estimates were biased by the reference dataset. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter used by most process-oriented ecosystem models. LAI of forest ecosystems has routinely been mapped using spectral vegetation indices (SVI) derived from remote sensing imagery. The application of SVI-based approaches to map LAI in peatlands presents a challenge, mainly due to peatlands characteristic multi-layer canopy comprising shrubs and open, discontinuous tree canopies underlain by a continuous ground cover of different moss species, which reduces the greenness contrast between the canopy and the background. Our goal is to develop a methodology to map tree and shrub LAI in peatlands and similar ecosystems based on multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). This new mapping method is validated using LAI field measurements from a precipitation-fed (ombrotrophic) peatland near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We demonstrate first that three commonly applied SVI are not suitable for tree and shrub LAI mapping in ombrotrophic peatlands. Secondly, we demonstrate for a three-endmember model the limitations of traditional linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) due to the unique and widely varying spectral characteristics of Sphagnum mosses, which are significantly different from vascular plants. Next, by using a geometric-optical radiative transfer model, we determine the nature of the equation describing the empirical relationship between shadow fraction and tree LAI using nonlinear ordinary least square (OLS) regression. We then apply this equation to describe the empirical relationships between shadow and shrub fractions obtained from mixture decomposition with SMA and MESMA, respectively, and tree and shrub LAI, respectively. Less accurate fractions obtained from SMA result in weaker relationships between shadow fraction and tree LAI (R-2 =0.61) and shrub fraction and shrub LAI (R-2 =0.49) compared to the same relationships based on fractions obtained from MESMA with R-2 = 0.75 and R-2 =0.68, respectively. Cross-validation of tree LAI (R-2 =0.74; RMSE=0.48) and shrub LAI (R2=0.68; RMSE=0.42) maps using fractions from MESMA shows the suitability of this approach for mapping tree and shrub LAI in ombrotrophic peatlands. The ability to account for a spectrally varying, unique Sphagnum moss ground cover during mixture decomposition and a two layer canopy is particularly important. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

ID ACCURACY
AB We analyzed hyperspectral airborne imagery (CASI 2 with 46 contiguous VIS/NIR bands) that was acquired over a Lake Huron coastal wetland. To support detailed Great Lakes coastal wetland mapping, the optimal spatial resolution of imagery was determined to be less than 2 in. There was a 23% change in classification resiliency using the SAM classifier upon resampling the original 1-meter, 18-band imagery to 2-meter pixels, and further classifications with larger pixels (4 and 8 in) increased overall classification change to 35% and 50%, respectively. We performed a series of image classification experiments incorporating three independent band selection methodologies (derivative magnitude, fixed interval and derivative histogram), in order to explore the effects of spectral resampling on classification resiliency. This research verified that a minimum of seven, strategically located bands in the VIS-NIR wavelength region (425.4 nm, 514.9 nm, 560.1 nm, 685.5 nm, 731.5 nm, 812.3 nm and 916.7 nm) are necessary to maintain a classification resiliency above the 85% threshold. Significantly, these seven bands produced the highest classification resiliency using the fewest number of bands of any of the 63 band-reduction strategies that were tested. Analyzing only derivative magnitudes proved to be an unreliable tool to identify optimal bands. The fixed interval method was adversely influenced by the starting band location, making its implementation problematic. The combined use of derivative magnitude and frequency of occurrence appears to be the best method to determine the "optimal" bands for a wetland mapping hyperspectral application.

AB Accuracy assessment of classified imagery is an important task in remote sensing. Various measures have been developed to describe and compare the accuracy of maps and the performance of different classifiers, but the extent to which these measures are consistent with each other is largely unknown. In this paper the consistency of fourteen category-level and twenty map-level accuracy measures was tested on 595 published error matrices using nonparametric correlation coefficients (Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau-b) as well as the probability of concordance. The results show that four groups can be identified for the category-level measures and three groups for map-level measures. The consistency among the measures within a group is generally higher than that among the measures from different groups though all the measures at the same level are highly consistent with each other. We recommend that user's accuracy and producer's accuracy and the overall accuracy should be provided as primary accuracy measures and the two relative entropy change measures and the mutual information normalized by the arithmetic mean of the entropies on map and ground truthing be provided as supplementary measures. The chance-corrected, error matrix-normalized and user's and producer's accuracy-combined measures were found to contain estimation and interpretation problems at both category- and map-levels and are therefore not recommended for general use.

AB The retrieval of biophysical variables using canopy reflectance models is hindered by the fact that the inverse problem is ill posed. This is due to the measurement, model errors and the inadequacy between the model and reality, which produces similar reflectances for the different combination of the input parameters into the radiative transfer model. This leads to unstable and often inaccurate inversion results. The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem requires some regularization. Regularization means that one tries to consider only those solutions that are in the proximity of the true value. In order to regularize the model inversion, we propose kernel-based regularization by support vector machines regression (SVR) method.
   The formulation of the SVR contains meta-parameters C (regularization) and e-insensitive loss. The SVR generalization performance (estimation accuracy) depends on these two parameters and the kernel parameters. Often the meta-parameters are selected using prior knowledge and/or user expertise. In this paper we adopt methods for the estimation of the meta-parameters from the input data itself instead of relying on any prior information. This paper is focused on the retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) from multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The proposed methodology was implemented by inverting a ID canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) using SVR over MISR data. The results were validated against the LAI retrievals at the Alpilles EOS validation core site. An RMSE of 0.64 was obtained using both near-infrared (NIR) in conjunction with the red band and an RMSE of 0.50 using only the NIR band. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between the MISR multi-angle observations of sun glint pattern width over ocean and the near-surface wind speed is explored. With this relationship, we develop an algorithm that can constrain the standard, wind-driven glint/white cap model that defines the ocean-surface boundary condition in MISR aerosol retrievals. The key geometric factor determining wind retrieval quality is the angular distance between the reflection vector and the closest MISR multi-angle observation - the minimum Sun Glint Angle (SGA).
   MISR-retrieved winds are within 2.4 m/s of buoy-measured values for minimum SGA below about 15 degrees for the 38 cases studied, and usually better than 1.1 m/s, except one for which the wind speed was extremely low. For minimum SGA above about 15 degrees, MISR angular glint pattern reflectance sampling is not adequate to perform wind retrievals. An ambiguity in the retrieval that can occur for minimum SGA greater than 6 degrees or 7 degrees is resolved by the minimum observed absolute reflectance. We also confirm the high accuracy of the Cox-Munk ocean surface reflectance model, used to analyze the glint pattern dependence on wind speed. The wind-retrieval method could be used in an operational multi-angle aerosol retrieval algorithm to dynamically constrain the ocean surface boundary condition when glint pattern angular sampling is adequate.

AB Detailed information on cloud properties is needed to rigorously test retrieval algorithms for satellite and ground-based remote sensors. The inherent complexity of clouds makes this information difficult to obtain from observations alone and cloud resolving models (CRMs) are often used to generate synthetic datasets that can be used as proxies for real data. We test the ability of a CRM to reproduce the observed structure of low-level clouds detected by the Earth Observing System (EOS) validation program in north central Oklahoma on March 3, 2000. A threedimensional radiative transfer model is applied to bigh-resolution cloud fields generated by the CRM in order to simulate the top of atmosphere radiances. These synthetic radiances are then statistically compared with observations from the airborne Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (AirMISR), flown on the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft. Simulations match well the blue channel radiance distributions at oblique view angles but overestimate the minimum in reflectance at near-nadir viewing angles, The model reproduces correctly the angular change in the width of radiance distribution, as measured by the standard deviation but the change in skewness of these distributions is captured only qualitatively. The model biases are suggestive of the simulated cloud boundaries being too sharp and the distribution of the vertical liquid water path being too narrow. A power spectrum analysis shows a close agreement between simulations and observations including a break in the scaling properties of the radiance fields around 400 in. The scaling properties of the ID power spectrum of simulated radiance at smaller scales exhibit directional dependence not seen in corresponding observations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The MODIS Rapid Response (RR) System was developed to meet the near real time needs of the applications community. Generally, its products are available online within hours of the satellite overpass. We recently adapted the standard MODIS land surface temperature (LST) split-window algorithm for use in the RR System. To minimize latency, we eliminated the algorithm's dependency on upstream MODIS products. For example, although the standard MODIS LST requires prior retrieval of air temperature and water vapor from the MODIS scene, the RR LST employs a climatological database of atmospheric values based on a 25-year record of NOAA TOVS observations. The standard and RR algorithms also differ in upstream processing, surface emissivity determination, and use of a cloud mask (RR product does not contain one). Comparison of the MODIS RR and standard LST products suggests that biases are generally less than 0.1 K, and root-mean-square differences are less than I K despite the presence of some larger outliers. Initial validation with field data suggests the absolute uncertainty of the RR product is below I K. The MODIS RR land surface temperature algorithm is a stand-alone computer code. It has no dependencies on external products or toolkits, and is suitable for Direct Broadcast and other processing systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An automated binary change detection model using a threshold-based calibration approach was introduced in the study. The burdensome processes required in binary change detection, including calibration, calculation of accuracy, extraction of optimum threshold(s), generation of a binary change mask, and removal of "salt-and-peppet" noise were integrated and automated in the model. For practical purpose, the model was implemented as a dynamic linked library in ESRI ArcMap 9.1 using Visual Basic. This study demonstrated the model with a variety of single and multiple variables (layers) extracted from multiple-date QuickBird imagery for three study sites in Las Vegas, NV and two study sites in Tucson, AZ. The use of multiple variables in binary change detection resulted in significantly better performance than single variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data from three thermal sensors with different spatial resolution were assessed for urban surface temperature retrieval over the Yokohama City, Japan. The sensors are Thermal Airborne Broadband Imager (TABI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Two algorithms were developed for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from TABI image and ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) channels 13 and 14. In addition, ASTER LST and MODIS LST products were also collected. All the LST images were assessed by analyzing the relationship between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and by spatial distributions of LST profiles, derived from typical transects over the LST images. In this study, a strong negative relationship between LST and NDVI has been demonstrated although the degree of correlation between NDVI and LST varies slightly among the different LST images. Cross-validation among the LST images retrieved from the three thermal sensors of different spatial resolutions indicates that the LST images retrieved from the 2 channel ASTER data and a single band TABI thermal image using our developed algorithms are reliable. The LST images retrieved from the three sensors should have different potential to urban environmental studies. The MODIS thermal sensor can be used for the synoptic overview of an urban area and for studying urban thermal environment. The ASTER, with its TIR subsystem of 90-m resolution, allows for a more accurate determination of thermal patterns and properties of urban land use/land cover types, and hence, a more accurate determination of the LST. In consideration of the high heterogeneity of urban environment, the TABI thermal image, with a high spatial resolution of 2 m, can be used for rendering and assessing complex urban thermal patterns and detailed distribution of LST at the individual house level more accurately.

AB A leaf level investigation on the spectral signature of Phaseolus vulgaris was undertaken by using a very high spectral resolution spectroradiometer featuring full width at half maximum of 0.06 nm and spectral range of 635.5-802.5 nm. High spectral resolution allows detection of leaf reflected and emitted radiance fields in two narrow absorption bands at 687 and 760 nm, respectively, where solar irradiance is strongly reduced owing to molecular oxygen absorption of the terrestrial atmosphere. The flux emitted due to chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using the Fraunhofer line depth principle by spectrally modelling the signal, capitalizing on the high resolution of the spectroradiometer devices. An experiment was conducted on two potted bean plants. One was maintained in good health for use as a reference while the other was treated with a photosystem II inhibitor. Collected spectra show that the fluorescence emission produces a pair of characteristic peaks superimposed on the typical leaf-specific reflectance curve. The magnitude of the fluorescence signal of the herbicide-treated leaf was four times greater than that of the control plant, thus indicating damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant.

AB One obstacle to successful modeling and prediction of crop yields using remotely sensed imagery is the identification of image masks. Image masking involves restricting an analysis to a subset of a region's pixels rather than using all of the pixels in the scene. Cropland masking, where all sufficiently cropped pixels are included in the mask regardless of crop type, has been shown to generally improve crop yield forecasting ability, but it requires the availability of a land cover map depicting the location of cropland. The authors present an alternative image masking technique, called yield-correlation masking, which can be used for the development and implementation of regional crop yield forecasting models and eliminates the need for a land cover map. The procedure requires an adequate time series of imagery and a corresponding record of the region's crop yields, and involves correlating historical, pixel-level imagery values with historical regional yield values. Imagery used for this study consisted of 1-km, biweekly AVHRR NDVI composites from 1989 to 2000. Using a rigorous evaluation framework involving five performance measures and three typical forecasting opportunities, yield-correlation masking is shown to have comparable performance to cropland masking across eight major U.S. region-crop forecasting scenarios in a 12-year cross-validation study. Our results also suggest that I I years of time series AVHRR NDVI data may not be enough to estimate reliable linear crop yield models using more than one NDVI-based variable. A robust, but suboptimal, all-subsets regression modeling procedure is described and used for testing, and historical United States Department of Agriculture crop yield estimates and linear trend estimates are used to gauge model performance.

AB High spatial resolution QuickBird satellite data have provided new opportunities for remote sensing applications in agriculture. In this study, image-based algorithms for atmospheric correction were evaluated on QuickBird imagery for retrieving surface reflectance (rho(lambda)) of corn and potato canopies in Minnesota. The algorithms included the dark object subtraction technique (DOS), the cosine approximation model (COST), and the apparent reflectance model (AR). The comparison with ground-based measurements of canopy reflectance during a 3-year field campaign indicated that the AR model generally overestimated rho(lambda) in the visible bands, but underestimated rho(lambda) in the near infrared (NIR) band. The DOS-COST model was most effective for the visible bands and produced rho(lambda) with the root mean square errors (RMSE) of less than 0.01. However, retrieved rho(lambda) in the NIR band were more than 20% (mean relative difference or MRD) lower than ground measurements and the RMSE was as high as 0.16. The evaluation of the COST model showed that atmospheric transmittance (T-lambda(theta)) was substantially overestimated on humid days, particularly for the NIR band because of the undercorrection of water vapor absorption. Alternatively, a contour map was developed to interpolate appropriate T-lambda(theta) for the NIR band for clear days under average atmospheric aerosol conditions and as a function of precipitable water content and solar zenith angle or satellite view angle. With the interpolated T-lambda(theta), the accuracy of NIR band rho(lambda) was significantly improved where the RMSE and MRD were 0.06 and 0.03%, respectively, and the overall accuracy of rho(lambda) was acceptable for agricultural applications.

AB Chikurachki volcano (Northern Kurile Islands Chain, Paramushir Island 50 degrees 20'N, 155 degrees 27'E; elevation 1816 m, stratovolcano) has been in a state of unrest for over twenty years. Its most recent eruption that began in April 2003 was preceded by an eruption between January and May 2002. Thermal infrared images from the Japanese-United States' Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER-5 TIR channels, 8-12 mu m, 90 m/pixel, Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature [NE Delta T] similar to 0.1-0.3 K; onboard the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Terra polar-orbiting spacecraft) of a snow-covered Chikurachki Volcano taken in January 2003 show muted evidence of thermal activity. ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images from February 2003, however, indicate warmer areas within the summit crater. Average whole-pixel temperatures of adjacent summit slopes are in the range of 250-252 K, while many summit-crater whole pixel temperatures are similar to 2-6 K greater. A two component Planck solution for the warmer pixels yields a solution of 275-277 K for 10-15% of the Chikurachki summit crater and 285-295 K for 25-35% of a prominent "botspot" on its flank. An interpretation of this enhanced pre-eruption beat flow is the presence of surface melt water. The detection in ASTER data of such subtle precursory heat-flow enhancement, even retrospectively, raises important issues for remote monitoring of "dormant" snow-capped volcanoes, especially those that threaten nearby populations, like Mt. Rainier. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used spaceborne imaging spectroscopy provided by the Earth Observing-1 Hyperion sensor to quantify the relative importance of precipitation and substrate age that control ecosystem development and functioning in Metrosideros polymorpha rainforests of Hawaii. Four hyperspectral vegetation indices provided metrics of forest canopy structure, biochemistry and physiology to compare along gradients of annual rainfall (750 to >6000 mm year(-1)) and substrate age (0 to 250,000 years). The canopy greenness index NDVI increased with annual precipitation and substrate age, but saturated in forests with rainfall of 3000 min year(-1). Precipitation and substrate age were roughly equal contributors to the observed greenness of the forests. A canopy water content index (NDWI) also increased with precipitation and substrate age, but did not reach a maximum until very wet (> 5000 mm year(-1)) forest conditions were encountered on the oldest substrates. The water index appears superior to the NDVI in capturing spatial and climate-substrate driven variations in canopy structure. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) indicated highest light-use efficiency levels in canopies on the most developed substrates and at annual precipitation levels of 3-4500 min year(-1). A leaf carotenoid index (CRI) suggested a maximum canopy photosynthetic capacity at similar to 4000 min rainfall year(-1) on the oldest substrates. These results quantify the sensitivity of rainforest canopies to changing precipitation and soil conditions, and they corroborate plot-scale analyses in native Hawaiian forests ecosystems. Structural and functional studies of remote rainforest regions are possible with spacebome imaging spectroscopy, and could be used to understand the dynamics of rainforests with climate change.

AB There are large discrepancies among estimates of the cropland area in China due to the lack of reliable data. In this study, we used Landsat TM/ ETM data at a spatial resolution of 30 in to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of cropland across China for the time period of 1990-2000. Our estimate has indicated that total cropland area in China in 2000 was 141.1 million hectares (ha), including 35.6 million ha paddy land and 105.5 million ha dry farming land. The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB NOAA AVHRR has been used extensively for monitoring vegetation condition and changes across the United States. Integration of crop growth models with MODIS imagery at 250 in resolution from the Terra Satellite potentially offers an opportunity for operational assessment of the crop condition and yield at both field and regional scales. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of the MODIS 250 in resolution data for retrieval of crop biophysical parameters that could be integrated in crop yield simulation models. A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 in resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2.000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 in resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield simulations were conducted on a 1.6 x 1.6 km(2) spatial resolution grid and the results integrated to the county level. The results were within 10% of county yields reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Ecosystem models are routinely used to estimate net primary production (NPP) from the stand to global scales. Complex ecosystem models, implemented at small scales (<10 km(2)), are impractical at global scales and, therefore, require simplifying logic based on key ecological first principles and model drivers derived from remotely sensed data. There is a need for an improved understanding of the factors that influence the variability of NPP model estimates at different scales so we can improve the accuracy of NPP estimates at the global scale. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of using leaf area index (LAI) and three different aggregated land cover classification products-two factors derived from remotely sensed data and strongly affect NPP estimates-in a light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate NPP in a heterogeneous temperate forest landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Three separate land cover classifications were derived from three different remote sensors with spatial resolutions of 15, 30, and 1000 m. Average modeled net primary production (NPP) ranged from 402 gC m(-2) year(-1) (15 m data) to 431 gC m(-2) year(-1) (1000 in data), for a maximum difference of 7%. Almost 50% of the difference was attributed each to LAI estimates and land cover classifications between the fine and coarse scale NPP estimate. Results from this study suggest that ecosystem models that use biome-level land cover classifications with associated LUE coefficients may be used to model NPP in heterogeneous land cover areas dominated by cover types with similar NPP. However, more research is needed to examine scaling errors in other heterogeneous areas and NPP errors associated with deriving LAI estimates. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this research was to map thaw lakes and drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs) on the North Slope of Alaska using satellite remote sensing. This research is the first to map DTLBs on a large scale for Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain. Thaw lakes and DTLBs were classified from seven Landsat-7 scenes using texture analysis, spectral transformations, and image segmentation. The overall classification accuracy was 97.7% with, a Kappa coefficient of 0.96. Thaw lakes had a producer accuracy of 99.1% and a user accuracy of 98.6%, while DTLBs had a producer accuracy of 93.8% and user accuracy of 98.1%. A total of 7054 km(2) of thaw lakes were mapped, accounting for 20.4% of the Arctic Coastal Plain; there were 8917 km(2) of DTLBs covering 25.7% of the study area. Continued research in the analysis of thaw lakes and DTLBs is crucial to our understanding of the global carbon cycle, atmospheric methane concentrations, heat flow and climate change.

AB The overarching goal of this study was to map irrigated areas in the Ganges and Indus river basins using near-continuous time-series (8-day), 500-m resolution, 7-band MODIS land data for 2001-2002. A multitemporal analysis was conducted, based on a mega file of 294 wavebands, made from 42 MODIS images each of 7 bands. Complementary field data were gathered from 196 locations. The study began with the development of two cloud removal algorithms (CRAs) for MODIS 7-band reflectivity data, named: (a) blue-band minimum reflectivity threshold and (b) visible-band minimum reflectivity threshold.
   A series of innovative methods and approaches were introduced to analyze time-series MODIS data and consisted of. (a) brightness-greenness-wetness (BGW) RED-NIR 2-dimensional feature space (2-d FS) plots for each of the 42 dates, (b) end-member (spectral angle) analysis using RED-NIR single date (RN-SD) plots, (c) combining several RN-SDs in a single plot to develop RED-NIR multidate (RNMDs) plots in order to help track changes in magnitude and direction of spectral classes in 2-d FS, (d) introduction of a unique concept of space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs) to continuously track class dynamics over time and space and to determine class separability at various time periods within and across seasons, and (e) to establish unique class signatures based on NDVI (CS-NDVI) and/or multiband reflectivity (CS-MBR), for each class, and demonstrate their intra- and inter-seasonal and intra- and inter-year characteristics. The results from these techniques and methods enabled us to gather precise information on onset-peak-senescence-duration of each irrigated and rainfed classes.
   The resulting 29 land use/land cover (LULC) map consisted of 6 unique irrigated area classes in the total study area of 133,021,156 ha within the Ganges and Indus basins. Of this, the net irrigated area was estimated as 33.08 million hectares-26.6% by canals and 73.4z5 by groundwater. Of the 33.08 Mha, 98.4% of the area was irrigated during khariff (Southwest monsoonal rainy season during June-October), 92.5% irrigated during Rabi (Northeast monsoonal rainy season during November-February), and only 3.5% continuously through the year. Quantitative Fuzzy Classification Accuracy Assessment (QFCAA) showed that the accuracies of the 29 classes varied from 56% to 100%-with 17 classes above 80% accurate and 23 classes above 70% accurate.
   The MODIS band 5 centered at 1240 nm provided the best separability in mapping irrigated area classes, followed by bands 2 (centered at 859 nm), 7 (2130 nm) and 6 (1640 rim). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The establishment of monitoring frameworks for environmental problems is frequently based on retrospective, multi-temporal series of satellite images. The derivation of concise conclusions from these series largely depends on their quantitative consistency; hence, a completely standardized analysis of multi-temporal time series is mandatory. In the context of the required radiometric rectification, sensor calibration is an essential component, the accuracy of which largely determines the overall result. While for newer sensor systems extensive documentation on the development of the sensor's sensitivity exists, older systems often lack the corresponding information.
   A methodology has been developed, tested and validated to radiometrically intercalibrate different sensor systems based on the precondition of simultaneous image acquisition, which is for example provided by the Landsat TM and MSS sensor systems hosted on Landsat 5. Different interpolation and processing steps within the procedure have been analyzed, and an intercalibration scheme is proposed to derive Landsat MSS calibration factors from Landsat TM, which is used as a calibrated reference. It supports a full radiometric rectification of Landsat MSS data and enables their incorporation into satellite image time series, which can thus be significantly extended by a maximum of 12 years.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

DE spectral mixture analysis; normalization; lichen; mineral
ID ENDMEMBERS; VEGETATION
AB In subarctic regions the ubiquitous presence of rock encrusting lichens compromises the ability to map the reflectance signatures of minerals from imaging spectrometer data. The use of lichen as an endmember in spectral mixture analysis (SMA) may overcome these limitations. Because lichens rarely completely occupy the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV), it is difficult to define a lichen endmember from an image using visual or automated endmember extraction tools. Spectral similarity of various crustose/foliose lichen species in the short wave infrared (SWIR) suggests that spectral unmixing of rock and lichens may be successfully accomplished using a single lichen endmember for this spectral range. We report the use of a spectral normalization method to minimize differences in SWIR reflectance between five lichen species (U. torrefacta, R. bolanderi, R. geminatum, R. geographicum, A. cinerea). When the normalization is applied to reflectance spectra from 2000-2400 nm acquired for a lichen encrusted quartzite rock sample we show that only a single lichen endmember is required to account for the lichen contribution in the observed mixtures. In contrast, two such endmembers are required when the normalization is not applied to the reflectance data. We illustrate this point using examples where endmembers are extracted manually and automatically, and compare the SMA results against abundances estimated from digital photography. For both the reflectance and normalized reflectance data, SMA results correlate well (R-2 > 0.9) with abundances estimated from digital photography. The use of normalized reflectance implies that any field/laboratory lichen spectrum can be selected as the lichen endmember for SMA of airborne/spaceborne imagery. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A vegetation index (VI) model for predicting evapotranspiration (ET) from data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the EOS-1 Terra satellite and ground meteorological data was developed for riparian vegetation along the Middle Rio Grande River in New Mexico. Ground ET measurements obtained from eddy covariance towers at four riparian sites were correlated with MODIS VIs, MODIS land surface temperatures (LSTs), and ground micrometeorological data over four years. Sites included two saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) and two Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. Wislizennii) dominated stands. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was more closely correlated (r=0.76) with ET than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; r=0.68) for ET data combined over sites and species. Air temperature (T.) measured over the canopy from towers was the meteorological variable that was most closely correlated with ET (r=0.82). MODIS LST data at 1- and 5-km resolutions were too coarse to accurately measure the radiant surface temperature within the narrow riparian corridor; hence, energy balance methods for estimating ET using MODIS LSTs were not successful. On the other hand, a multivariate regression equation for predicting ET from EVI and T. had an r(2)=0.82 across sites, species, and years. The equation was similar to VI-ET models developed for crop species. The finding that ET predictions did not require species-specific equations is significant. inasmuch as these are mixed vegetation zones that cannot be easily mapped at the species level.

AB The SPOT 5 satellite was launched in May 2002; it provides multispectral imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m and fused imagery with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. These types of satellite imagery were used for mapping beds of Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea, where it is a dominant species forming monospecific beds in a structurally simple environment (four classes: sand, photophilous algae on rock, patchy seagrass beds and continuous seagrass beds). Supervised classifications by depth range were made of both types of image. A direct comparison of overall accuracy between SPOT 2.5 m and SPOT 10 m revealed that this tool provided accurate mapping in both cases (between 73% and 96% accuracy). Although SPOT 2.5 m provides lower overall accuracy than SPOT 10 m, it is a very useful tool for the mapping of P. oceanica, as it allows the patchiness of the formations to be better taken into account. The opportunity to use a reliability scale, which takes into account the effects of extrinsic factors on the processing of the images, confirmed the usefulness of the option of using a reduced pixel size in order to obtain an improved match between the results from mapping and field observations.

AB Watershed scale soil moisture estimates are necessary to validate current remote sensing products, such as those from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR). Unfortunately, remote sensing technology does not currently resolve the land surface at a scale that is easily observed with ground measurements. One approach to validation is to use existing soil moisture measurement networks and scale these point observations up to the resolution of remote sensing footprints. As part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), one such soil moisture gaging system in the Walnut Creek Watershed, Iowa, provided robust estimates of the soil moisture average for a watershed throughout the summer of 2002. Twelve in situ soil moisture probes were installed across the watershed. These probes recorded soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm from June 29, 2002 to August 19, 2002. The sampling sites were analyzed for temporal and spatial stability by several measures including mean relative difference, Spearman rank, and correlation coefficient analysis. Representative point measurements were used to estimate the watershed scale ( similar to 25 km) soil moisture average and shown to be accurate indicators with low variance and bias of the watershed scale soil moisture distribution. This work establishes the validity of this approach to provide watershed scale soil moisture estimates in this study region for the purposes of satellite validation with estimation errors as small as 3%. Also, the potential sources of error in this type of analysis are explored. This study is a first step in the implementation of large-scale soil moisture validation using existing networks such as the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and several Agricultural Research Service watersheds as a basis for calibrating satellite soil moisture products, for networks design, and designing field experiments.

AB Early and detailed information regarding the location and extension of areas affected by forest fires is a critical issue for assessing their effects at several scales. Remote sensing is a valuable tool for burned area mapping, providing spatially explicit information on the scorched areas, even for remote regions.
   Various sensors have been used for burned land mapping in recent years, covering local (10-30 m pixel size) and global scales (500-1000 m pixel size). Regional inventories require higher detail than global studies, but typically cover larger territories than local studies. For this purpose, the use of medium spatial resolution sensors (100-300 in pixel size) is highly advisable. Few studies have evaluated these sensors, and none have specifically assessed the performance of images acquired by the Argentinian Satellite for Scientific Applications-C/Multispectral Medium Resolution Scanner (SAC-C/MMRS) for mapping burned areas, which is the main objective in this paper.
   Since information on calibration parameters was not available, raw data was converted into ground reflectance values after a "cross-calibration" method, using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data as reference. Estimated radiance values showed very high correlation with those for the ETM+ (r(2)>0.9). Several spectral indices were generated and tested. The Burned Area Index (BAI), derived from red and near infrared (NIR) reflectances showed the greatest sensitivity to discriminate burned areas from other land cover types, although the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), based on the Red and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands also provided good discrimination capability.
   Image segmentation was performed by using a multi-threshold approach, based on the BAI and the NDII since these two spectral indices have the highest sensitivity to (1) discriminate burned areas and (2) to avoid confusion with water and cloud shadows.
   Burned perimeters delineated using a seeded region growing algorithm showed good agreement with the perimeters digitised on Landsat ETM+ data, providing accurate estimation of the burned areas compared to statistics provided by the Spanish forest fire authorities. In the first study area (Almeria, south-eastern Spain), the perimeters showed a 90% agreement. In the second study site (Madrid), two fires were studied. The first one (Cadalso, south-west of Madrid) showed an agreement of 64%, and for the second one (Patones, north-east of Madrid), the agreement was 84%. The lower accuracy of the former was caused by the great spatial discontinuity of that fire, which includes many patches of unaffected vegetation within the scar perimeter. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB We summarize early research on land-cover, land-use, and biophysical properties of vegetation from the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazonia. LBA is an international research program developed to evaluate regional function and to determine how land-use and climate modify biological, chemical and physical processes there. Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in LBA in research planning, land-cover mapping and in long-term monitoring of changes in land-cover and land-use at multiple scales. This special issue includes 12 papers that cover a range in spatial scales from regional mapping to local scales that cover only a portion of a Landsat scene. Several themes dominate, including land-cover mapping with an emphasis on wetlands and second-growth forest, evaluation of pasture sustainability and forest degradation and the impact of land-cover change on stream chemistry. New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4, Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR. Census data are fused with an existing land-cover map to generate spatially explicit estimates of land-use from historical data. Several papers include important, new field measures of species composition, forest structure and biomass in mature forest and secondary succession. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maximum posterior probability (MAP) maps of forest inventory (FI) cover type classes were produced from a maximum likelihood (ML) classified TM image and 5% (2%) systematic reference sampling of actual cover types for of nine 2 x 2 kin study sites in New Brunswick, Canada. MAP cover type maps were obtained via sequential indicator simulation (SIS) using collocated indicator cokriging. A 5% reference sampling increased the coefficient of accuracy of MAP cover type maps by about 0.2 compared to the accuracy of the ML classified maps. MAP prediction errors were obtained for global and small area estimates of cover type extent. MAP-based cover type statistics of extent and precision were compatible with corresponding results for maximum likelihood bias-corrected estimates (MLE). Spatial autocorrelation of MAP prediction errors declined rapidly with distance and were near 0 for distances of more than 3-4 Landsat TM pixels. MAP cover type maps produced by SIS are attractive when both global and local estimates of precision of map-derived statistics are needed. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Future remote sensing satellite missions exploring the earth will feature advanced hyperspectral and directional optical imaging instruments. Given the complex nature of the data to be expected from these missions, a thorough preparation for them is essential and this can be accomplished by realistic simulation of the imagery data, years before the actual launch. Based on given spectral and directional capabilities of the instrument, and in combination with biophysical land surface properties obtained from existing imagery, the spectral and directional responses of several types of vegetation and bare soil have been simulated pixel by pixel using the radiative transfer models PROSPECT (for hyperspectral leaf reflectance and transmittance), GeoSAIL (for two-layer canopy bidirectional spectral reflectance), and MODTRAN4 (for atmospheric hyperspectral and directional effects). In this way, one obtains realistically simulated hyperspectral and directional top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance images, with all major effects included, such as heterogeneity of the landscape, non-Lambertian reflectance of the land surface, the atmospheric adjacency effect, and the limited spatial resolution of the instrument. The output of the image simulations can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of future earth observation missions. In addition, instrument specifications and image acquisition strategies might be optimized on the basis of simulated image analysis results, and new advanced data assimilation procedures could be validated with realistic inputs under controlled circumstances. This paper describes the applied methodology, the study area with the input images, the set-up of the actual image simulations, and discusses the final results obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB We report application and validation of a spectral optimization algorithm for processing SeaWiFS data in Case I waters. The algorithm couples a simplified aerosol model with a sophisticated water-reflectance model to simultaneously retrieve both atmospheric and ocean parameters. Two of the retrieved ocean properties-the absorption coefficient of colored detrital material and the chlorophyll a concentration-are validated by comparison with "surface" truth obtained with airborne and space-borne sensors. We show that employing a more complete water reflectance model significantly improves the decoupling between the oceanic and atmospheric optical signals. Methodologies for applying the algorithm to Case 2 waters and for delineating terrestrial vs. marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MODIS; RESOLUTION; ALGORITHM
AB On December 18, 1999, the Terra satellite was launched with a complement of five instruments including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Many geophysical products are derived from MODIS data including global snow-cover products. MODIS snow and ice products have been available through the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) since September 13, 2000. MODIS snow-cover products represent potential improvement to or enhancement of the currently available operational products mainly because the MODIS products are global and 500-m resolution, and have the capability to separate most snow and clouds. The MODIS snow-mapping algorithms are automated, which means that a consistent data set may be generated for long-term climate studies that require snow-cover information. Extensive quality assurance (QA) information is stored with the products.. The MODIS snow product suite begins with a 500-m resolution, 2330-km swath snow-cover map, which is then gridded to an integerized sinusoidal grid to produce daily and 8-day composite tile products. The sequence proceeds to a climate-modeling grid (CMG) product at 0.05degrees resolution, with both daily and 8-day composite products. Each pixel of the daily CMG contains fraction of snow cover from 40% to 100%. Measured errors of commission in the CMG are low, for example, on the continent of Australia in the spring, they vary from 0.02% to 0.10%. Near-term enhancements include daily snow albedo and fractional snow cover. A case study from March 6, 2000, involving MODIS data and field and aircraft measurements, is presented to show some early validation work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID OSCILLATION; DROUGHT
AB The relation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) interannual variability, precipitation and atmospheric circulation at 700 mbar in northwest Mexico is analyzed during the warm and cold phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A conditional probability test was conducted between this phenomenon and NDVI values. It was found that the negative ENSO phase is associated with drought conditions with a delay of 4 - 6 months related to the start of event, while the positive phase is related to high NDVI values during the driest season in the region. Clustering the NDVI values by terciles, it was determined that summers with high NDVI values are related to an intensification of the Mexican summer monsoon; while, in dry summers, the flow is characterized by the presence of an enhanced ridge of high-pressure aloft over most of the national territory. In winters with high NDVI values, a very intense low-pressure trough induces a meridional flow with penetration of humid air associated with frontal activity. This circulation pattern is common during the ENSO warm phase. Winters with low NDVI are associated atmospheric circulation patterns typical of the so-called Pacific North American (PNA) type. Based on the bio-seasonality and precipitation modulation in northwest Mexico due to the ENSO, it is concluded that the delay of a few months observed in NDVI values with respect to precipitation inputs supports the Seed Hydration Memory (SHM) concept. The ecological implications of this phenomenon for the region are also discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The majority of burning in the boreal forest zone consists of stand replacement fires larger than 10 km(2) occurring in remote, sparsely populated regions. Satellite remote sensing using coarse resolution (approximate to 1 km) sensors is thus well suited in documenting the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in this zone. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor for estimating three key parameters related to boreal forest fire: burned area, postfire regeneration age, and aboveground biomass. Based on a sample of fires across Canada, the best overall discrimination of burned forest was provided by a normalized short-wave-based vegetation index (SW-VI) that combines near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels from VGT. Multitemporal differencing of this index from anniversary date VGT composites was combined synergistically with active fire locations from NOAA/AVHRR to map Canadian forest that burned during 1998 and 1999. National burned area estimates for both years were within 15% of those compiled by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, The normalized index also was correlated (R=.68) with the age of regenerating forests in Saskatchewan and Manitoba that burned between 1949 and 1998. An artificial neural network (ANN) model developed using temporal metrics computed from VGT could predict the age of these forests with an RMS error of 7 years (R=.83). By contrast, forest biomass based on Canada's Forest Inventory (CanFI) was estimated with relatively poor accuracy (RMS = 32 tons/ha) from VGT reflectance and terrestrial ecozone using a network model, We conclude that the VGT instrument is effective for mapping large boreal bums at the end of a fire season and approximating the age of regenerating bums less than about 30 years old. This information can be useful to supplement conventional ground-based data sets in remote areas where coverage may be incomplete. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

A nonlinear regression analysis was used ir. deriving models for volume and biomass as a function of WiFS data. The estimates were evaluated by applying independent estimates from the Finnish Multi-source National Forest Inventory (MS-FNFI): The estimates are derived using field plots from the Finnish National Forest Inventory (FNFI) and Landsat-TM images. Mean volume as estimated from the Finnish multisource data for a study area of 447000 ha was 84.2 m(3) ha(-1). This compared with 87.2 m(3) ha(-1) as derived from the developed method presented in this paper, The corresponding estimates for aboveground tree biomass were 59.5 and 58.3 tons ha(-1), respectively.

AB The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) flown on-board NASA's first earth observing system (EOS) platform, Terra, offers complete global data coverage every 1-2 days at spatial resolutions of 250, 500, and 1000 m. Its ability to detect emitted radiation in the short (4 mum)- and long (12 mum)-wave infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, combined with the excellent geolocation of the image pixels (similar to 200 m), makes it an ideal source of data for automatically detecting and monitoring high-temperature volcanic thermal anomalies. This paper describes the underlying principles of, and results obtained from, just such a system, Our algorithm interrogates the MODIS Level 1B data stream for evidence of high-temperature volcanic features. Once a hotspot has been identified, its details (location, emitted spectral radiance, satellite observational parameters) are written to an ASCII text file and transferred via file transfer protocol (FTP) to the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP), where the results are posted on the Internet (http://modis.higp.hawaii.edu), The global distribution of volcanic hotspots can be examined visually at a variety of scales using this website, which also allows easy access to the quantitative data contained in the ASCII files themselves. We outline how the algorithm has proven robust as a hotspot detection tool for a wide range of eruptive styles at both permanently and sporadically active volcanoes including Soufriere Hills (Montserrat), Popocatepetl (Mexico), Bezymianny (Russia), and Merapi (Java), amongst others. We also present case studies of how the system has allowed the onset, development,. and cessation of discrete eruptive events to be monitored at Nyamuragira (Congo), Piton de la Fournaise (Reunion Island), and Shiveluch (Russia).

AB Boreal forest cover and tree crown transparency (a function of crown leaf area index [LAI]) were estimated from Landsat TM data and a limited amount of ancillary information by inverting a hybrid geometric-radiative transfer model. Inversion performed better than a number of empirical spectral features tested, including single TM bands and the NDVI. Inversion allowed both cover and transparency variations in the TM data to be simultaneously taken into account, while the presence of variations in both factors impaired the empirical relationships. However, the method could not provide accurate information on a per-stand basis. Consideration of a number of sources of uncertainty in the inversion process highlighted some important limitations in the method; these included the adequacy of the model, noise in the TM data, and errors in the ancillary parameters. The results indicated that a lack of stand-specific ancillary information on the needle and background reflectances was a serious limitation in the utility of the approach. Improved methods for obtaining ancillary information seem necessary. In this context, using existing forest inventory information to help estimate some of the key ancillary parameters is considered a possible way forward. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are frequently used to estimate the amount of live green canopy material. They have generally been developed as an attempt to reduce spectral effects caused by external factors such as the atmosphere and the soil background. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of selected VIs, including some hyperspectral VIs based on waveform, analysis of the reflectance across the vegetation red edge. The analysis is based on biophysical data measured in a winter wheat field fertilized at three nitrogen (N) levels. The measurements were acquired continuously throughout the growing season and related to canopy spectral reflectance measured with a ground-based spectroradiometer. Green crop area index (GCAI) and canopy chlorophyll density (CCD) were the major variables determined from the biophysical data set. Canopy chlorophyll was measured using nondestructive methods based on two optical instruments. The prediction power of selected VIs calculated from spectra resampled to Landsat TM configuration was compared with narrow-band indices including some VIs based on waveform analysis techniques. It was concluded that an exponential relationship exists between the two biophysical parameters and all of the selected indices except for the simple ratio index (RVI), for which a linear relationship was formed. The results indicate that VIs based on waveform analysis using narrow bands across the red edge may improve the prediction of CCD. However, none of the hyperspectral indices that were included in the study was better at estimating GCAI than the best of the traditional VIs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EVAPORITE MINERALS
AB Salinization is a major cause of soil degradation ill the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. The objective of this research is to evaluate the utility of field-derived spectra of saline soils and related vegetation for characterizing and mapping the spatial distribution of irrigation-induced soil salinization. A FieldSpee FR hand-held spectrometer was used to measure the spectra of a range of salinized soils and associated vegetation. Strategies for mapping field-derived spectra using hyperspectral (HyMap) imagery were assessed, and a continuum-removed Spectral-Feature-Fitting (SFF) approach adopted. Field-derived spectra of the vegetation comprising of samphire, sea blite, and native grass species are also useful indicators of salinization: however, their absence is not necessarily ail indicator of healthy soils. Distribution maps created using the SFF method and a restricted wavelength range of field-derived spectra provide ail accurate record of the distribution of both vegetation and soil indicators of salinization at the time of image acquisition. Salinized soil and vegetation indicator class maps show a similar spatial distribution to soil salinization as mapped by ground-based geophysical surveys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Indices derived from hyperspectral reflectance spectra have the potential to be used as indicators of environmental stress in crops, This study uses canopy-scale. ground-based measurements of hyperspectral reflectance to demonstrate the temporal patterns in corn development under imposed fertility (N rate) and environmental (water availability) stresses. In 1998. two large areas in a 30-ha corn (Zea mays, L.) field near Ottawa. Canada (45degrees 18'N. 75degrees44'W) were supplied with 99 and 17 kg N ha(-1), while the balance of the field received the recommended rate of 155 kg N ha(-1). Reflectance measurements, ere taken time times using a portable spectroradiometer at georeferenced locations within these areas. Individual reflectance-based indices demonstrated the relative differences between application rates and identified both nitrogen and water stresses at various times in the growing season. No single index was able to describe the status of the corn crop throughout the season. Canonical discriminant analysis provided accurate classification of samples by N rate during early, mid, and late season conditions with overall success rates of 70%. 88%. and 93%', respectively. A shift in importance from green-based derivatives to red-based derivatives was noted from mid to late season and attributed to the natural reduction in green pigments as the crop entered senescence. Canopy-scale photochemical reflectance index (PRI) was shown to be cot-related with canopy radiation use efficiency (RUE). Mid-season water stress affected the relationship. Multiple years of data are required to demonstrate robust relationships between hyperspectral indices and corn ecophysiological status because of the interaction between environmental and nutrient stresses. Identifying areas of fields sensitive to weather-induced stresses will allow better management of N application. Timing the collection of hyperspectral image data at early and late vegetative phase could enhance precision agriculture by allowing supplemental nutrient application. identifying stress patterns and aid in yield forecasting.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the surface parameters that has importance in climate, weather, and ecological studies, and has been routinely estimated from remote sensing measurements. Canada-wide LAI maps are now being produced using cloud-free Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery every 10 days at 1-km resolution. The archive of these products began in 1993. LAI maps at the same resolution are also being produced with images from the SPOT VEGETATION sensor, To improve the LAI algorithms and validate these products, a group of Canadian scientists acquired LAI measurements during the summer of 1998 in deciduous, conifer, and mixed forests, and in cropland. Common measurement standards using the commercial Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) and LAI-2000 instruments were followed. Eight Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes at 30-m resolution were used to locate ground sites and to facilitate spatial scaling to 1-km pixels. In this paper, examples of Canada-wide LAI maps are presented after an assessment of their accuracy using ground measurements and the eight Landsat scenes. Methodologies for scaling from high- to coarse-resolution images that consider surface heterogeneity in terms of mixed cover types are evaluated and discussed. Using Landsat LAI images as the standard, it is shown that the accuracy of LAI values of individual AVHRR and VEGETATION pixels was in the range of 50-75%. Random and bias errors were both considerable. Bias was mostly caused by uncertainties in atmospheric correction of the Landsat images, but surface heterogeneity in terms of mixed cover types were also found to cause bias in AVHRR and SPOT VEGETATION LAI calculations. Random errors come from many sources, but pixels with mixed cover types are the main cause of random errors. As radiative signals from different vegetation types were quite different at the same LAI, accurate information about subpixel mixture of the various cover types is identified as the key to improving the accuracy of LAI estimates.

AB The mean tree height, dominant height, mean diameter. stem number, basal area, and timber volume of 144 georeferenced field sample plots were estimated from various canopy height and canopy density metrics derived by means of a small-footprint laser scanner over young and mature forest stands using regression analysis. The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and the size of each plot was 200 m(2). On the average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 in on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality. The stratum-specific regressions explained 82-95%, 74-93%, 39-78%, 50-68%, 69-89%. and 80-93% of the variability in ground-truth mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume, respectively. A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding characteristics of entire forest stands was tested. Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m(2) regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics were predicted for each grid cell from the corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated regression equations. Average values for each stand was computed. Most stand level predictions were unbiased (P>.05). Standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume were 0.61-1.17 m, 0.70-1.33 m. 1.37-1.61 cm, 16.9-22.2% (128-400 ha(-1)), 8.6-11.7% (2.33-2.54 m(2) ha(-1)) and 11.4-14.2% (18.3-31.9 m(3) ha(-1)), respectively.

AB Land surface temperature measurements have been widely used to estimate surface energy balance. However. because land surface temperature and energy balance both depend on a complex suite of factors, precise estimation of surface energy exchanges using thermal remote sensing is difficult. In recent years, a variety of methods have been developed that overcome previous limitations and show substantial promise for robust estimation of surface fluxes from remote sensing. This paper reviews recent progress in this domain and describes a two-layer energy balance model designed for use with thermal remote sensing. An important aspect of the model is that it is specifically designed to account for the complex micrometeorology and thermal properties of land surfaces possessing a range of density in vegetation. Further, the physics underlying this model are complementary to the physics of land surface thermal remote sensing. Comparisons between field measurements and modeled fluxes show good agreement, which suggests that the model describes land surface energy balance processes with good realism. More importantly. these results reinforce the conclusions of other recent studies that have demonstrated the compatibility of two-layer energy balance models with remote sensing observations and. by extension, the viability of using thermal remote sensing to model surface energy balance.

AB Interferometric processing of six C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image pairs for the Mackenzie River Delta shows that phase coherence is more effective than radar backscatter for differentiating willow-alder, spruce, ice, and open water. Similar radar backscattering from vegetation and wind-roughened water surfaces can make such distinctions difficult in SAR backscatter images. In contrast, coherence is preserved over surfaces with rigid scattering elements, such as leafless woody alder, but is lost over temporally unstable surfaces such as open water. We find that willow-alder display highest coherence followed by spruce, frozen lakes and channels, and open water, respectively. This general hierarchy is preserved even when overall image coherence is decreased by increasing temporal and spatial baselines. Evaluation of spatial, thermal noise and temporal components of total observed coherence indicates that temporal decorrelation is a primary control. Short temporal baselines, such as those obtained during the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) 1-day tandem missions, are therefore optimal for obtaining maximum differentiation of surface classes.

AB Simulations and measurements were used derive information on the form and strength of the nitrogen (N) "signal" in near-infrared (NIR) spectra of fresh leaves. Simulations across multiple species indicated that in total, protein absorption decreased NIR reflectance by up to 1.8% absolute and transmittance by up to 3.7% absolute, all other inputs held equal. Associated changes in spectral slope were generally of +/-0.02% nm(-1) absolute. Spectral effects were about an order of magnitude more subtle fur a smaller, though potentially ecologically significant, change in N concentration of 0.5% absolute over measured. Nitrogen influence on spectral slope was fairly consistent across four empirical datasets as judged by wavelength dependence of N correlation, and there was reasonable agreement of observed and modeled slope perturbations with locations of known protein absorption features. Improved understanding of the form and strength of the N signal under differing conditions will support continued development of laboratory-based spectral measurement and analysis strategies for direct N estimation in individual fresh leaves. A pragmatic approach for canopy-level estimation by remote sensing, however, might additionally consider surrogate measures such as chlorophyll concentration or canopy biophysical properties.

ID IN-FLIGHT; RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION
AB The paper describes a new methodology that uses spatially extensive hyperspectral imagery as reference data to carry out vicarious radiometric calibrations for multiple satellite sensors. The methodology has been validated using data from a campaign at the Railroad Valley playa test site in Nevada in June 1998. The proof of concept has been further tested based on data acquisition campaigns at the Newell County rangeland test site in Alberta in August and October 1998. The rangeland test site in the Newell County region of Alberta is tested for its suitability as a calibration test site for satellite sensor systems. All three campaigns included ground-based measurements, satellite imagery and airborne hyperspectral data. The airborne hyperspectral sensor data were acquired using the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) at Railroad Valley and the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi) in all three campaigns. This paper describes the formulation and implementation of the new methodology, and radiometric calibration monitoring results obtained for five different sensors: NOAA-14 AVHRR, OrbView-2 SeaWiFS, SPOT-4 VGT, SPOT-1/2 HRV, and Landsat-5 TM. The results indicate that the nominal on-orbit radiometric calibrations of all the satellite sensors fit within their predicted uncertainties. The combination of both lower-reflectance and higher-reflectance test sites is shown to improve the quality of the calibration monitoring results. In particular, the combined QUASAR monitoring results obtained from the three airborne data acquisition days at the two test sites, encompassing five satellite sensors and a total of 40 spectral band cases, yield a correlation between QUASAR-based and nominal TOA radiances characterized by y = 1.026x - 1.26, and r(2)=0.990. Temporal extensions of QUASAR data sets to calibrate satellite sensors imaging the test site one or more days away from the airborne data acquisition day yield mixed results.

AB A methodology was developed and applied to estimating forest area and producing forest maps. The method utilizes satellite data and ground reference data. It takes into consideration the fact that a pixel rarely represents any single ground cover class. This is particularly true for low-spatial-resolution data. It also takes into consideration that the spectral classes overlap. The image was first classified using an unsupervised clustering method. A (multinormal) spectral density function was estimated for each class based on the spectral vectors (reflectance values) of the cluster members. Values of the target variable - the proportion of forested area - were determined for the spectral classes using sampling from CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover database. Each pixel was assigned class membership probabilities, which were proportional to the value of the density function of the respective class evaluated at the spectral value of the pixel. The estimate of forest area for the pixel was finally computed by multiplying the class membership probabilities by the class forest area and summing over all the classes. The method was applied over a mosaic of 49 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-14 satellite. The estimated forest areas were compared with those extracted from the full-coverage CORINE data and with official Forest statistics reported to the European Commission's Statistical Office (EUROSTAT). The forest percentage (proportion of forest area of the total land area) of 12 countries of the European Union was underestimated by 1.8% compared to the CORINE data. It was underestimated by 4.2% when compared with EUROSTAT's statistics and 6.0% when compared to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agricultural Organization (UN-ECE/FAO) statistics. The largest underestimation of forest percentage within a country (compared to CORINE) was in France (5.9%). The largest overestimation was found in Ireland. 15.6%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB We present a 3D modeling approach to assess the robustness of remotely derived spectrometric equations predictive of forest chemistry (cellulose, lignin, proteins) to structural variables (tree ground cover, leaf area index: LAI, understory) and to the view direction. Our methodology uses mio radiative transfer models that operate at leaf(PROSPECT) and canopy (DART) levels. It includes three stages: (1) simulation of short wave infrared bidirectional reflectances of a "reference scene" with constant architecture and variable chemistry; (2) establishment of predictive relationships of chemicals with stepwise regressions; (3) assessment of the robustness of these relationships for scenes with variable structures. Results stressed that predictive relationships are influenced by canopy structure and view direction. Their reliability decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the understory and also if tree cover or LAI decreases. On the other hand, they tend to remain robust if tree cover and LAI increase, that is if the influence of the understory on canopy reflectance decreases. Their reliability increases when the view direction becomes more oblique, except for the hotspot and specular directions. Finally, this work stresses factors that can explain the difficulty to establish robust predictive relationships with remote sensing data. It shows also that 3D modeling approaches can be an efficient tool for studying forest chemistry from space, for instance, in order to assess the domain of validity of predictive relationships.

AB This study shows the evolution of water vapor content, cloud liquid water, rain rate, and surface wind speed in Typhoon Herb. The use of both passive and active microwave observations from different satellites, together with ground weather radar data, has allowed us to consider changes in the typhoon's structure at a higher temporal resolution. It may be assumed that the adaptation of both traditional and new types of remote sensing data in numerical weather prediction models will improve the forecasting of a typhoon's wind field and intensity. A comparison of the fields for wind, precipitation, total cloud liquid water content, and total water vapor content, with weather radar data and the Okean image demonstrate the mutually supplementary character of lower resolution passive microwave data within a 1400-km swath, as well as medium resolution radar data. The results indicate that the intensification of Herb before its landfall was associated with increases in the derived total latent heat release. The set of water vapor distributions revealed a cyclonic movement of dry airflow around the typhoon center, which was confirmed by radiosonde reports. The evolution of the amount of water vapor, cloud liquid water, precipitation, and total latent heat release in circular areas within a radius of 1 degrees, 2.5 degrees, and 4 degrees of latitude relative to Herb's center was estimated.

AB Radiometric temperature observations T-H(phi) at a sensor view angle phi are routinely available from weather satellites such as the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES) and provide a unique spatially distributed boundary condition for surface energy balance modeling at regional scales. Reliable flux estimates over heterogeneous surfaces have been obtained using two-source models that implicitly account for differences between T-H(phi) and aerodynamic temperature, T-O, by considering separately the contributions of soil/substrate and vegetation to T-R(phi) observations and to the turbulent fluxes. A simple two-source energy balance model developed to use T-H(phi) observations has been applied successfully to a wide range of vegetation cover conditions at the field scale. However, its application with course resolution weather satellite data (i.e., pixel resolution greater than or similar to 1 km) will invariably result in errors in pixel-averaged heat flux estimation for surfaces with significant variability in vegetation cover and stress conditions. Indeed, with the highest resolution of satellite T-H(phi) data similar to 100 m, subpixel heterogeneity will still be significant for many landscapes, especially arid and semiarid areas. Uncertainty in flux estimation due to significant subpixel heterogeneity is examined using the simplified two-source model with T-R(phi) inputs from simulations using a detailed plant-environment model (Cupid) under six different "homogeneous" surface conditions commonly found in semiarid and arid regions and under high and low winds. These surface types are comprised of shrub and tall riparian vegetation, high and low canopy cover, wet and dry surface soil moisture state, and stressed versus unstressed vegetation condition. From six homogeneous surface conditions defined by vegetation type, cover, surface moisture and stress, four mixed-pixel cases were constructed, each containing two contrasting surface types. Significant or unacceptable errors (i.e., similar to 50 W m(-2)) in pixel-average heat fluxes are found in all four mixed-pixel cases, but the significant errors primarily occur when the fraction of the extreme surface condition (e.g., riparian wetland) comprises between similar to 20% and 80% of the mixed-pixel. Additionally, the results are influenced by the wind conditions with a higher wind speed tending to reduce errors. This preliminary analysis suggests that when there is a significant discontinuity in surface conditions, particularly under low winds, the subpixel variability in energy fluxes will likely cause unacceptable errors in two-source model predictions. However, daytime wind speeds are typically >2 m s(-1) and the resolution of T-H(phi) observations from weather satellites are relatively coarse (i.e., similar to5-19 km), which means riparian areas are likely to comprise less than 10% of a pixel. Both of these factors are likely to reduce errors in heat flux predictions at these large spatial scales caused by using pixel-average inputs. The Advanced Spaceborn Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument proposed for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) has 90 m resolution. This will be useful for evaluating the impact of subpixel variability on flux predictions with coarser resolution data more routinely available from weather satellites.

AB The amount and spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation are important information in environmental studies and agricultural practices. There has been a great deal of interest in estimating vegetation parameters and their spatial and temporal extent using remotely sensed imagery. There are primarily two approaches to estimating vegetation parameters such as leaf area index (LAI). The first one is associated with computation of spectral vegetation indices (SVI) from radiometric measurements. This approach uses an empirical or modeled LAI-SVI relation between remotely sensed variables such as SVI and biophysical variables such as LAI. The major limitation of this empirical approach is that there is no single LAI-SVI equation (with a set of coefficients) that can be applied to remote-sensing images of different surface types. The second approach involves using bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models. It inverts a BRDF model with radiometric measurements to estimate LAI wing an optimization procedure. Although this approach has a theoretical basis and is potentially applicable to varying surface types, its primary limitation is the lengthy computation time and difficulty of obtaining the required input parameters by the model. In this study, we present ct strategy that combines BRDF models and conventional LAI-SVI approaches to circumvent these limitations. The proposed strategy runs implemented in three sequential steps. In the first step, a BRDF model was inverted with a limited number of dam points or pixels to produce a training data set consisting of leaf area index and associated pixel values. In the second step, the training data set passed through a quality control procedure to remove outliers from the inversion procedure. In the final step, the training data set was used either to fit an LAI-SVI equation or to train a neural fuzzy system. The best fit equation or the trained fuzzy system was then applied to large-scale remote-sensing imagery to map spatial LAI distribution. This approach was applied to Landsat TM imagery acquired in the semiarid southeast Arizona and AVHRR imagery over the Hapex-Sahel experimental sites near Niamy, Niger. The results were compared with limited ground-based LAI measurements and suggested that the proposed approach produced reasonable estimates of leaf area index over large areas in semiarid regions. This study was not intended to show accuracy improvement of LAI estimation from remotely sensed data. Rather, it provides an alternative that is simple and requires little knowledge of study target and few ground measurements. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB An experimental design based on an airborne TIR camera equipped with wide-angle lenses for measuring directional brightness temperature over forest canopies is described. A particular care is given to the analysis of possible sources of errors (related to instruments and atmosphere) and to their corrections. The protocol of data acquisition is adapted to provide TIR measurements in a -60 degrees-+60 degrees range of zenith view angles and in all azimuthal directions. The results obtained over maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) stands in the Landes forest in the southwest of France during summers 1995 and 1996 reveal important hot spot effects and differences of brightness temperatures reaching 4 K between vertical and oblique measurements. Acquisitions performed over stands of different ages, between 5 and 48 years old, also illustrate the dependence of the structure of stands on the hot spot. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

ID SCATTERING MODEL; SAR DATA; VEGETATION; BACKSCATTER; SURFACE; BIOMASS
AB Polarimetric AIRSAR data acquired over a variety of mangrove forests are analyzed with the assistance of a three-layer radiative transfer model. The necessary input parameters to the model come from detailed ground measurements performed in 12 mangrove stands that are representative of the different successional stages of the mangrove forest dynamics. On the whole, P-band provides the most pronounced polarimetric signatures. Among the polarimetric parameters, the polarization ratio is found to be useful for analyzing scattering mechanisms and for discriminating between various forest stages. Comparison between AIRSAR data and simulations shows that the model is able to describe the overall radar signature of mangrove forests at P-, L- and C-band. However, this study also points out the limitation of such models. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This article describes the application of a neural network method designed to improve the efficiency of map production from remote sensing data. specifically, the ARTMAP neural network produces vegetation maps of the Sierra National Forest, in Northern California, using landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. In addition to spectral values, the data set includes terrain and location information for each pixel. The maps produced by ARTMAP are of comparable accuracy to maps produced by a currently used method, which requires expert knowledge of the area as well as extensive manual editing. In fact, once field observations of vegetation classes had been collected for selected sites, ARTMAP took only a few hours to accomplish a mapping task that had previously taken many months. The ARTMAP network features fast online learning, so that the system can be updated incrementally when new field observations arrive, without the need for retraining on the entire data set. In addition to maps that identify lifeform and Calveg species, ARTMAP produces confidence maps, which indicate where errors are most likely to occur and which can, therefore, be used to guide map editing.

AB Substantial research seeks to improve estimates of eco-system processes and fluxes at a range of scales, notably from the stand scale (< l km(2)) using ecosystem physiology and eddy covariance techniques, to the landscape (similar to 10(2) km(2)) and global (10(8) km(2)) scales using a variety of modeling and data acquisition approaches. One approach uses remotely sensed ecosystem properties in the scaling process. This approach combines digital maps of key ecosystem properties such as land cover type, leaf area index, and/or canopy chemistry with quantitative models of biological processes based on these ecosystem properties. Constraints on parametrizing models for global scale applications mean that relatively simple algorithms must be used which are based almost exclusively on satellite-derived inputs, for example, the planned Earth Observation System (EOS)-MODIS Land Science Team model output. Presently, there are limited ways of validating these outputs. At the landscape scale, the opportunity exists to combine remote sensing data with spatially distributed, process-based biogeochemistry models to examine variation in ecosystem processes such as NPP as a function of land cover type, canopy attributes, and/or location along environmental gradients. These process models can be validated against direct measurements made with eddy covariance flux towers and ground-based NPP sampling. Once ran and validated over local landscapes, these fine scale models may provide our best opportunity, to provide meaningful evaluation (or "validntion" in some sense) of simpler globally applied models. In this article, we I) provide a biological framework that links ecosystem attributes and ecosystem carbon flux processes at a variety of scales, and summarizes the state of knowledge and models in these areas, 2) describe the need for developing NPP surfaces at a local landscape scale as a means of validating global models, in particular the MODIS NPP product, 3) describe the approach of the BigFoot project to performing such a validation exercise far a series of sites in North America, and 4) present an example using one such model (PnET-II) across diverse vegetation types in a heterogeneous landscape in central North America.

TI Evaluation of different methods for extracting relative spectral
   emissivity information from simulated thermal infrared multispectral
   scanner data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The performance of five published methods for extracting relative spectral emissivity information from thermal infrared multispectral data has been evaluated. In the first part of this article, we have recalled those five methods and shown mathematically that they are almost equivalent to each other. Then, using simulated data built up wit the TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) instrument, we have analyzed the sensitivity of those methods to different sources of error which may occur in real data such as errors due to 1) method simplification, 2) instrumental noise and systematic calibration error, 3) uncertainties on the estimation of downwelling atmospheric radiance, and 4) uncertainties of atmospheric parameters in atmospheric corrections. In terms of resulting errors in relative emissivity, the results show that: a) All methods are very sensitive to the uncertainties of atmosphere. An error of 20% of water vapor in midlatitude summer atmosphere (2.9 cm) may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 of TIMS. b) The effect of the atmospheric reflection term is very important. If this term is neglected in method development, this may lead to an error of 0.03 (rms) for Channel 1 and midlatitude summer atmosphere. This is the cae for the alpha method. c) Instrumental noise commonly expressed by noise equivalent difference temperature (NE Delta T) from 0.1 K to 0.3 K results in an error of relative emissivity ranging from 0.002 to 0.005 for all methods. d) Error in relative emissivity due to the instrument calibration error (systematic error) is negligible. The stud also shows that the relative emissivity derived wit an incorrect atmosphere is linearly related to its actual value derived with correct atmospheric parameters. Based on this property, we propose three methods to correct for the errors caused by atmospheric corrections under horizontally invariant atmospheric conditions. A practical analysis with the real TIMS data acquired for Hapex-Sahel experiment in 1992 supports the results of this simulation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB The Rodaquilar mining area in southern Spain has been mined for gold for an extensive period, most recently in the 1940s and 1950s. This activity has resulted in waste rock and tailings being dispersed from the mine workings down to a large tailings dump and then along a river valley eventually reaching the sea. This tailings dump material consists of a variety of ferruginous materials that often contain trace elements that are environmentally harmful and possibly toxic. These ferruginous materials have distinctive spectral features which make them amenable to detection and mapping by airborne imaging spectrometer data. The dispersion of the tailings material was studied using two semiquantitative techniques, matched filtering and linear spectral unmixing and qualitative methods using band ratios and the variation in strength of spectral features. The distinct ferruginous mineral phases resolved by these methods were then compared to laboratory reference spectrum using qualitative analysis of the spectral profiles and two quantitative techniques, spectral angle mapping and cross correlogram spectral matching. The distribution of the ferruginous materials identified from the imaging spectrometer data supports the results of laboratory experiments on the dependence of the formation of iron species on their geochemical and physical situation.

AB As a part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), measurements of the spectral reflectance anisotropy of three boreal forest canopies were studied for cloudless sky conditions at the phenological growth stages which were at or near maximum leaf area index at each site. The three sites were relatively homogeneous mature stands of black spruce, jack pine, and aspen located in the southern boreal zone of central Saskatchewan. Measurements of the spectal bidirectional reflectance factors with a 15 degrees instrument field of view in three spectral bands centered at 662 nm, 826 nm, and 1658 nm were made with the PARABOLA instrument over a range of solar zenith angles typically varying from 35 degrees (near solar noon) to 70 degrees. The measured reflectance factors showed large anisotropy at all three sites and for all three wavelengths, with prominant backscatter peak reflectances, and strong retro solar view angle (hot spot) maximum reflectances in the visible (662 nm) and shortwave infrared (1658 nm) for the jack pine and black spruce sites, with a less pronounced hot spot at the aspen site. Pronounced effects of canopy and understory shadowing in the visible, as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA), were observed for the black spruce and jack pine sites, with resultant large linear increases in computed normalized difference and simple ratio vegetation indices as SZA increased for near-nadir view angles. Hemispheric spectral reflectances or spectral albedos were computed from angular integration of PARABOLA measured bidirectional reflectances. Visible (662 nm.) hemispheric reflectances for the jack pine and black spruce canopies showed very little variation with solar zenith angle, while near-infrared hemispheric reflectances increased strongly with increasing SW. Estimates were made of the total shortwave albedo for the aspen and jack pine sites from irradiance and reflectance weighting of the spectral hemispheric reflectances in the three measured wavelengths. Comparison of estimated to pyranometer measured total albedo showed all estimates to be biased high, but only by about 0.007-0.018, depending on which of two sets of pyranometer measured albedos were utilized for the comparison. The measured bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data sets reported in this study coupled with ancillary data of biophysical parameters collected at the same sites by BOREAS researchers provide a unique data set for the de development and characterization of canopy bidirectional reflectance modeling and for the interpretation of remotely sensed data for boreal forest canopies.

AB Glacial recession rates can be reconstructed by conducting physiochemical and ecological surveys of glacial forelands and can be determined by analysis of the distribution and composition of successional vegetation. This latter method is used in this study, which illustrates that a basic vegetation index such as a near-infrared/red ratio, obtained from ground-based reflectivity measurements with a Milton Multiband Radiometer (MMR) for individual foreland moraines, correlates well with the age of the moraines. This suggests that ground, airborne, or spaceborne remotely sensed data, when obtained with established ground-based observations, may facilitate the spatial determination of glacial recession. It does not aim to replace existing techniques but explores the potential for a rapid synoptic assessment of glacial foreland chronosequences in conjunction with conventional groundbased techniques of age determination.

AB The remote sensing literature on laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence has indicated a relation between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis but, so far, has not presented a quantitative interpretation of the measurements. The present article presents the development of a model to quantify the gross photosynthesis on the basis of remote measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and radiance with the Laser Environmental Active Fluorosensor (LEAF-NL). Combined measurements of the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and CO2 exchange have been carried out during several days. Drought and ozone stress were imposed in two separate experiments. The laser-induced fluorescence measurements show a remarkable behavior. After sunrise the fluorescence yield rises first, but at high radiation and high temperature the fluorescence yield may decline below the nighttime fluorescence. This extremely strong quenching of fluorescence is attributed to photosystem deactivation. On the basis of the available laser-induced fluorescence data, a photosystem energy partitioning model is developed and finally used to predict photosynthetic electron transport. The results of this new model are compared with those of the current theory, the results from the new model show a fairly good correspondence with the CO2 assimilation data. It is believed that the present results are a significant step forward to the development of practical applications. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID VARIOGRAMS
AB This article presents a quantitive analysis of the sensitivity of textural information of high resolution remote sensing images of a forest plantation (Les Landes, France) to a number of biophysical parameters: crown diameter, distance between trees and rows, tree positioning, leaf area index (LAI), and tree height. Influence of acquisition parameters (spatial resolution, spectral domain and viewing, and illumination configurations) is also investigated. The work is realized with the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model (DART) simulated images with which we quantify texture with variograms. Results point out the complex dependency of variogram characteristics (range, sill, amplitude of oscillations) on biophysical and acquisition parameters. Neglect of spatial variations of the reflectance of canopy elements, as in most geometric-optical models, can lead to important errors. This stresses the interest of accurate radiative transfer models, such as DART. Although tree crown diameter is the most influential biophysic parameter, its influence may be totally masked by acquisition parameters. Finally, theoretical results were tested against high resolution airborne data (1.67 m resolution). Although encouraging results were obtained, this work both confirms the difficulty of extracting reliable texture information from real remote sensing data, and stresses the usefulness of radiative transfer models for studying the texture of high resolution satellite images.

TI Potential for determining the sea water absorption coefficient by

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SCATTERING; LIGHT
AB The problem of the present-day methods for determining the sea water absortion coefficient from space is the fact that the valid signal is an order of magnitude lower than the noise. In the present work, the pulse-gating method is considered as a means to increase the ratio of valid to spurious signals. A theoretical model is developed in order to estimate the radiance of the atmosphere-ocean system irradiated by a lidar in the pulse-gating regime in the range of sea-water transmittance (0.400-0.550 mu m). The model makes it possible to formulate technical requirements to the lidar (the emergent beam angle, pulse power, etc.), which prove to be quite achievable at the present time. Three typical situations are considered when the method under discussion can be used: 1) at night, with clear skies; 2) daytime, with clear skies; 3) at night, with thin clouds. The estimates are given for each case. The primary emphasis is placed on the expediency of constructing and testing an equipment for measuring optical properties of sea water by the pulse gating method from space.

AB When measuring laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence the intention is to probe the photosynthetic system of the plant, that is, to measure its state without notably affecting it. This is a common measuring principle. It was not known if the 10 ns green laser pulses used for our laser induced fluorescence measurements satisfy this requirement. In this article we consider the problem from a theoretical point of view and by experiment. Two unwanted effects may play a role: unintended partial closure of the reaction centers and exciton annihilations. The primary photochemical events in the photosystem of the plant are simulated numerically. In addition the fluorescence in the dark adapted state has been measured with a range of excitation energies. Both theoretical and experimental results are compared and analyzed. Our results show that the probing laser pulse, used for measuring the laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence, should not exceed an excitation energy of 100 mJ/m(2) at the plant. Additional laser pulses that could serve as an actinic light source to close all reaction centers before the measurement must have a pulse length of at least 100 ns. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB There is an increasing need for data on land-cover changes at broad spatial scales. In this study, a remote sensing-based technique for land-cover-change analysis was applied to the African continent for the last decade. Ten years of daily, continental-scale satellite remote sensing data (from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very-high resolution radiometer) were analyzed. Deviations in the seasonal trajectory of the land surface-characterized by its brightness temperature and a vegetation index-were interpreted in terms of land-cover change on a yearly basis, from 1982 to 1991. Land-cover-change magnitudes were measured and mapped for every year. The major categories of seasonal patterns of changes were identified. Multiyear patterns of change also were categorized, and all areas affected by a continuous decrease and gain in vegetation cover over the decade were mapped. Results were related to published high-resolution remote sensing-based studies. This study's results demonstrate that interannual land-cover changes in Africa mostly involve erratic variations in land-cover conditions due to interannual climatic variability and temporary modifications in seasonality. Continuous, unidirectional change processes (decrease or gain in vegetation cover) affected less than 4% of sub-Saharan Africa during the study period. Although such linear changes are just a fraction of the total land-cover changes detected, their effect on ecosystems and sustainability of livelihood might be significant. In the semiarid regions, temporary modification of the biophysical attributes of the surface driven by variations in rainfall is the dominant process. Future work will focus on finer-scale interpretation and validation of patterns of changes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Potential evaporation has been used to provide a reference level for actual evaporation in many studies of land surface heat and water balance. While Thornthwaite's formula has been used in many regional and global studies, the Penman-Monteith equation has been shown to provide an accurate estimate of this evaporation. Thus, global pattern gf potential evaporation has been calculated from the Penman-Monteith equation using satellite and assimilated data for a 24-month period, January 1987 to December 1988. The albedo and surface resistance have been taken to be, respectively, 0.23 and 70 s m(-1), which are considered to be representative values for actively growing well-watered grass covering the ground. Satellite observations have been used to obtain spatially representative monthly values of solar radiation, fractional cloud cover, air temperature, and vapor pressure, while aerodynamic resistance has been calculated using four-dimensional data assimilation results. Meteorologic data derived from satellite observations are compared with the surface (station) measurements. The calculated potential evaporation values are compared with lysimeter observations for evaporation from well-watered grass at 35 widely distributed locations in different climatic regimes to quantify the accuracy of the calculated values. The evaporation values have been archived for distribution. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Laboratory measurements of the directional reflectance of plant canopies fit radiative-transfer-based plane-parallel models well when the plants are low and leaves are small. Bidirectional reflectance measurements were collected at a unique facility in Changchun, China, using an apparatus that simulates solar radiation at zenith angles up to 45 degrees on a 1-m square target. A curved arm fitted with multiband radiometers revolves on a circular track around the target, allowing rapid measurement of multispectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) of the target at 10 degrees-zenith and azimuth angles. Because the measurements are made under controlled conditions, effects of such confounding factors as wind and diffuse (sky) irradiance can be avoided. Three one-dimensional radiative-transfer canopy models were compared to the BRF measurements in the near-infrared. The models generally fit the data for a young wheat canopy well. However, young corn and soybean canopies showed significant differences that are attributed to the escape of multiply scattered radiation from the sides of the canopy.

AB The most comprehensive large-scale characterization of the global sea ice cover so far has been provided by satellite passive microwave data. Accurate retrieval of ice concentrations from these data is important because of the sensitivity of surface flux (e.g., heat, salt, and water) calculations to small changes in the amount of open water (leads and polynyas) within the polar ice packs. Two algorithms that have been used for deriving ice concentrations from multichannel data are compared. One is the NASA Team algorithm and the other is the Bootstrap algorithm, both of which were developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The two algorithms use different channel combinations, reference brightness temperatures, weather filters, and techniques. Analyses are made to evaluate the sensitivity of algorithm results to variations of emissivity and temperature with space and time. To assess the difference in the performance of the two algorithms, analyses were performed with data from both hemispheres and for all seasons. The results show only small differences in the central Arctic in winter but larger disagreements in the seasonal regions and in summer. In some areas in the Antarctic, the Bootstrap technique shows ice concentrations higher than those of the Team algorithm by as much as 25%; whereas, in other areas, it shows ice concentrations lower by as much as 30%. The differences in the results are caused by temperature effects, emissivity effects, and tie point differences. The Team and the Bootstrap results were compared with available Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. AVHRR, Landsat, and SAR data sets all yield higher concentrations than the passive microwave algorithms. Inconsistencies among results suggest the need for further validation studies.

AB The backscattering behavior of the snow cover was investigated on the basics of nine European Remote Sensing-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (ERS-1 SAR) images of a southeastern Quebec study area in Canada (center lattitude 47 degrees 30' N center longitude 69 degrees 45'W), which were acquired in the winters of 1992 and 1993. Comparative field measurements on physical properties of the snow cover were carried out in 25 test sites. Dry snow shores backscattering coefficients similar to those of snow-free surfaces, whereas backscattering is clearly reduce for wet snow. An algorithm was developed for oct-snow mapping by means of C-band SAR, based on multitemporal ERS-1 data. The SAR-derived snow maps could be successfully applied for runoff modeling during a full period of snow melt. The accuracy of the method for wet-snow zu mapping demonstrates the high operational potential of SAR. C-band ERS-1 SAR has been proved to be a suitable device for snow monitoring. It is of great interest for studies in hydrology. For our experimental conditions, the algorithm operates with a relative false detection ratio of 1.33% for the study area.

ID SUCCESSION; AMAZONIA
AB The relationship between mean backscattering coefficient, as measured by spaceborne SAR instruments, and the areal density of above-ground biomass in regenerating tropical forest is investigated for a study area in the central Amazon basin. Measurements of tree height, diameter, and species composition were made in 1994 in the Tapajos region of Para State in Brazil in order to estimate the biomass density in 15 widely distributed sample plots. These plots were chosen so as to characterize homogeneous forest areas representing a range of ages of regeneration from new regrowth to mature forest. The mean backscattering coefficients of these forest areas, as measured by SAR instruments on the ERS-1 and JERS-1 satellites and by SIR-C on the Space Shuttle, was determined so that its dependence on the biomass density of regenerating forest at different radar wavelengths and polarizations could be quantified. Results confirm the findings of similar studies of different type of forest, and of radar backscatter models, that the longer wavelength (L-band) SAR imagery may be used to discriminate between different levels of forest biomass up to a certain threshold and that cross polarized backscatter is more sensitive to changes in biomass density. The shorter wavelength (C-band) SAR imagery is limited to differentiating between vegetation and bare soil when it is dry. The biomass density limit of around 60 tonnes per hectare, above which the L-band backscatter shows no further sensitivity to increased biomass density, suggests that spaceborne SAR imagery is suitable for estimating the biomass density and determining the extent of cleared and regenerating forest in tropical regions.

AB Two experiments were performed in April and December 1992 in the French Alps, using simultaneous remote sensing and ground truth data at 11 different locations. The snow grain size and soot content were measured from samples collected in the field. The snow reflectance tons computed from Landsat Thermatic Mapper (TM) data with and without atmospheric correction. Then the data were compared with theoretical results obtained from a bidirectional reflectance model. Most visible-channel signals are affected by the pollutants in the snow. The near-infrared channel signals are dependent on the grain size. For the near infrared channel TM4, the optical grain size is close to the measured one, but the Landsat-derived snow reflectance is not accurate enough to allow an inversion of the grain size from the reflectance. For the middle infrared channels TM5 and TM7, the computed optical grain size is very different from the measured one, but a linear relation was found between those different sizes for April and December data in spite of the very different solar irradiance conditions. Using ratios between channels instead of a single channel gives only a qualitative estimate of the grain size. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

TI Rain measurement with SIR-C/X-SAR
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RADAR
AB Rain measurement is needed over many parts of the world: oceans and less-developed areas without ground-based radars and extensive rain-gauge networks. The presence of several synthetic-aperture radars (SARs) imaging the Earth suggests that these may be used to get an idea of the rainfall in the needed areas. An experiment was conducted using SIR-C/X-SAR that flew in 1994 to determine how well we can measure rain with such systems. The experiment reported here involved measurements over the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the Amazon rain forest. In the former case, a method was developed to measure the rain rate using the strength of the backscatter from rain. In the latter, we used estimates of the attenuation through the rain. Backscatter methods suffer from lack of knowledge of the appropriate Z-R relations. In addition, for SARs one must estimate independently the rain height and turbulent velocity. Furthermore, some method must provide information on the background ''clutter'' from the surface. Other problems arise in dealing with attenuation through the rain cell. Here we found reasonable rain rates from 10 mm/h to 200 mm/h in convective cells over the ocean. Without correction of the C-band calibration, an unreasonable peak rain rate of 375 m/s appeared, but we believe a correction is necessary. We present results in terms of two Z-R relations and both with and without correction for C-band calibration. Some discrepancies between C-band and X-band measurements remain to be explained. The attentuation method can be used where obvious rain shadows occur, as over the Amazon. Here the difference between echo in the shadow and in the unshadowed background can be used to estimate rain from the attentuation. Fewer assumptions are needed for this method than for the backscatter method, and results appear more consistent between C-band and X-band. Rates from 77 mm/h to 128 mm/h were measured in storm cells. The results show that spaceborne SARs can measure rain, but the accuracy of the measurements is unknown. Accurate absolute calibration is necessary for the backscatter method, as well as sound estimates of surface clutter, storm height, and turbulent velocities. Further study is needed, particularly for the backscatter method. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID NOAA-9 AVHRR DATA; TEMPERATURE; MODEL
AB In this article we explore the relations between the thermal parameters of a partially vegetated land surface and the radiance observed by a satellite or airborne instrument. The calculations are carried out for four simple approximations of the canopy structure. For each of these we have derived the canopy geometry in the field of view as a function of zenith and azimuth viewing angles. These models can be inverted to allow estimation of the canopy geometry from measurements of the vegetation fractions at given viewing angles. The shape factors, determining the irradiance of each component of the canopy system by the other components, have also been calculated analytically for each of the four geometries. A technique for defining the effective radiative temperature and emissivity for a pixel is given, and the errors due to linearization of Planck's function and first-order scattering are evaluated quantitatively. A significant contribution to the effective emissivity in the form of a cavity term is identified, and the implications for reflection of atmospheric radiance are discussed. Finally the sensitivity of the effective thermal parameters to the choice of vegetation geometry is evaluated by comparing the results from each of four canopy geometries, with similar ground cover proportions and canopy lengths.

AB This article demonstrates the use of spectral decomposition for analyzing the spectral response of different semiarid vegetation species found throughout Mediterranean Europe. Using this technique, it is possible to decompose a spectral data set into a smaller number of significant factors that represent the key variables affecting vegetation spectral response. The results presented here show how spectral decomposition can be used to determine the intrinsic number and identity of the significant factors affecting the multispectral response. For the dataset investigated here, which comprises field spectra recorded over 1130 wavelengths, using a GER single field-of-view IRIS (SIRIS) spectroradiometer, it was found that a combination of just four factors was responsible for the majority of spectral variance. Interpretation of these factors was carried out by graphical analysis, stepwise regeneration of the original spectra, and correlation with biophysical data. Considering the identity of these factors, it was found that the second most significant factor (factor 2) was strongly related to the proportion of directly irradiated green leaves within the field-of-view of the spectroradiometer. In addition, it was found that the fourth most significant factor (factor 4) provided a good summary of the spectral response of the different samples in the region of strong chlorophyll absorption. This demonstrates the possibility of using spectral decomposition techniques, particularly in environments dominated by spectrally similar vegetation classes, to model the mixed spectral population, as mixtures of fundamental biophysical parameters rather than as mixtures of the classes themselves.

AB Landsat Thematic Mapper multispectral data were used to identify the spectral reflectance characteristics of Yellowstone lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var latifolia) successional stages, and to examine the relationships between spectral and biophysical factors. Ten spectrally defined forest cover types were created from unsupervised classification of the Landsat TM data, using a geographic information system to restrict data analysis to areas of similar slope, elevation, and surficial geology within the Central Plateau region of the park. Biotic data on forest overstory and understory conditions were collected from 69 sample sites within the 10 spectral cover classes. Field data were used to regroup the 69 sites into six biotically and spectrally distinct cover types, ranging from early postfire regeneration (LPO) to late-stage (LP3) subalpine fir succession. Increased absorption in the visible (TM 1, 2, and 3) and middle-infrared (TM 5 and 7) bands were related to the age and development of a stand. Changes in absorption were rapid during the initial stages of stand regeneration, but the rate of change slowed as stands progressed into later successional stages. Biotic factors relating to the physical structure of the forest canopy (height, basal area, biomass, and LAI) are cor-related with the visible and middle-infrared bands of the Thematic Mapper. Understory factors were poorly correlated with spectral response, except soil and fireweed, which are dominant early in succession, but rapidly decrease in Later stages. The spectral reflectance of a successional forest stand over time is a function of the combined effects of the overstory canopy, the amount of shadow within a canopy, and the condition of the forest understory As a forest develops from a disturbance to old-growth, the spectral response of a stand progresses along a vector or vectors linking the three factors. Spectral response changes are nonlinear with respect to time, as large-magnitude changes are observed in the first 20-30 years following a disturbance, and the rate of change lessens as forests develop into old-growth.

TI Cloud detection from a sequence of SST images
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A cloud detection algorithm mas designed as an adjunct to a companion edge-detection algorithm. The cloud detection integrates two distinct algorithms: one based on multiimage processing, the other on single-image analysis. The multiimage portion of the cloud detection algorithm operates on a time sequence of sea surface temperature (SST) images. It is designed to detect clouds associated with regions of apparently lower temperatures than the underlying SST field. A pixel in the current image is initially considered to be corrupted by clouds if it is significantly cooler than the corresponding pixel in a neighbor image. To refine the initial classificatlon, the algorithm checks the current image and the neighbor image for the presence of water masses, which through displacement could explain the change in temperature. The single-image cloud detection algorithm is designed to detect clouds associated with regions of the SST image where gradient vectors have a large magnitude. These regions are flagged in the map of potential clouds. Multiimage processing is integrated with the single-image algorithm by adding pixels classified as cloudy at the multiimage level to the map of potential clouds. Further analysis of the gradient vector field and of the shapes of potentially cloudy areas allows one to determine whether these regions correspond to clouds or SST fronts. A previous study has shown that the clouds identified by the single-image algorithm were in close agreement with those detected by a human expert. To validate the additional multiimage processing, the effect of the integrated cloud detection on the performance of a companion edge detection algorithm is examined. These results and a direct comparison with the cloud masks produced by a human expert indicate that, compared to the single-image algorithm, the multiimage algorithm successfully identify additional cloud-corrupted regions while keeping a Low rate for the detection of false clouds.

AB The applicability of imaging spectrometry to the measurement of foliar chemistry of herbaceous wetland vegetation was assessed for cultivated rice. Multiple samples were obtained from five California rice fields for analyses of nitrogen and lignin concentrations, and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images were obtained in August 1992. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to develop calibration equations for nitrogen and lignin based on AVIRIS reflectance (R) spectra transformed as the first difference of absorbance [log(1/R)]. Transformed AVIRIS absorbances were not as well correlated to lignin (r(2) = 0.44) as to nitrogen (r(2) = 0.74); the relative standard error of calibration (SEC) for nitrogen was 11%. To further test the predictive ability of this technique with respect to nitrogen concentration, four new calibration equations were derived based on each possible set of three fields. With each new subset of the data, MLR selected different wavelengths for the nitrogen calibration equation. Coefficients of multiple determination (r(2)) ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, with relative standard SECs ranging from 8.4% to 11.4%. Each of these equations was then used to predict the nitrogen concentration of samples in the omitted field, resulting in relative standard errors of prediction (SEP) ranging up to 37%. Results from this study suggest that calibration equations derived from multiple linear regression of AVIRIS spectra can be used to predict the nitrogen concentration of rice in the field. It was not possible to derive a general equation for the detection of nitrogen concentration with AVIRIS because the calibration equations developed with MLR were based on a different set of wavelengths for each subset of the data.

ID THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; TASSELED CAP; INTEGRATION; AGREEMENT
AB An investigation was undertaken to compare satellite image classification techniques to delineate forest wetlands in Maine. Four classification techniques were compared, including a GIS rule-based model. Accuracy assessments of the four methods on two study sites, Orono and Acadia, revealed very similar results. Overall accuracy for four super groups (forest wetland, other wetland, forest upland, other upland) ranged from 72% to 81% at Orono and 74% to 82% at Acadia. Pairwise significance tests indicated that the GIS model was significantly better than unsupervised classification at both study sites, and significantly better than tasseled cap (Acadia) in classifying the four super groups. Although Kappa coefficients were slightly higher for the GIS model compared to hybrid classification, there was no significant difference between the two methods at either study site. Forest wetland user's and producer's accuracy was in the 80% range for the highest accuracy achieved either by the GIS model or hybrid classification. Hydric soils, National Wetland Inventory data, and slope percentage were the most important variables in the GIS model. From this study, it appears that a combination of hybrid and GIS rule-based classification methods are the most promising for further investigations of forest wetland delineation.

AB Feedforward neural networks were used to identify bedrock types from satellite images and airborne geophysical data of the Melville Peninsula, Northern Canada. The first experiment, on rock outcrop pixels, demonstrated that more than 90% classification accuracy was achieved with as few as 150 training samples (0.5% of ''rock outcrop'' pixels). The second experiment consisted of rebuilding the bedrock geology map based on all pixels (except water pixels) in the area. The results demonstrated that greater than 85% classification accuracy can be obtained with only 150 training samples (0.17% of all pixels in training area). Tests with more training samples were also performed in bath experiments and only a moderately higher accuracy was obtained. In both experiments the geophysical data were the controlling factors in the classification. The Landsat TM data contributed to classification results only for the experiment on rock outcrop pixels.

ID REFLECTANCE CSAR MODEL; AVHRR; RED
AB Current vegetation indices are normally computed with directional spectral reflectances and are subjected to many external perturbations such as soil background variations, atmospheric conditions, geometric registration, and especially sensor viewing geometry. Subsequent use of these indices to estimate vegetation amounts would result in substantial uncertainties. To reduce the uncertainties due to sun/view angle variations, spectral albedos, which are integrated reflectance values over a hemisphere of the surface within the specific spectral waveband, were derived from multidirectional measurements and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models and were subsequently used in vegetation index computations. The albedo-based vegetation indices were then compared with those computed with spectral reflectances using ground-, aircraft-, and satellite-based remote sensing measurements over harvested alfalfa, full-cover cotton canopy, pecan orchards, and bare soil surfaces. The results showed that spectral albedo-based vegetation indices were independent of view angles while the spectral reflectance vegetation indices varied substantially with sensor viewing geometry. Therefore, the view angle effects on spectral vegetation indices can be normalized, and the sun angle effects can be further reduced with a limited number of multidirectional measurements and BRDF models.

ID THEMATIC MAPPER DATA
AB Reflectance changes caused bg thinning cuttings in northern Sweden were measured using multitemporal Landsat TM data. The test area was dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) mixed with Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spp). Landsat TM images from eight sequential summers were relatively calibrated pairwise using regression functions. For each combination of images from different years, local relative changes in digital numbers (DNs) were obtained from the differences between measured data from the late image and a prediction of these data based on the early image. These changes were scaled into units of reflectance using the radiative transfer code 5S. Between 19% and 57% of the basal area was removed in the thinning cuttings. This caused an increase of between 0.001 and 0.004 reflectance in the visible bands and around 0.01 in the middle infrared bands. The best single bands for discrimination of thinned stands from normally developed stands were, in order, TM5, TM7, and TM3. The reflectance changes in these bands increased with thinning grade and with the proportion of pine in the stand. In TM4, the thinning cuttings caused a decrease in reflectance that, to a large degree, could be explained by the proportion of deciduous forest removed. In, detected thinning cuttings, around 50% of the variance in the thinning grade, basal area cut, or stem volume cut, could be explained by regression functions based on the TM data only. The reflectance changes caused by thinning cuttings were, in most bands, reduced to half between 4 and 5 years after cutting. The method used for calibration of local changes in DN to changes in reflectance allows data from different image acquisitions to be compared; thus it also may be suitable for creating a knowledge base containing reflectance changes caused by cuttings and local damages in forest.

AB A procedure for reducing cloud contamination in NOAA/AVHRR composite imagery is proposed and applied to the NOAA global vegetation index data set. The suggested approach is based on thresholding the AVHRR/Channel 4 (11 mu m) brightness temperature. The global spacetime-angle dependent thresholds (monthly, 2 degrees x2 degrees, for 30 degrees-viewing angle bins) are estimated in two steps. First, a clear-sky background for Channel 4, in terms of means and standard deviations, is developed from GVI weekly composite data using their ''greenest'' subsamples. Second, this background is used to estimate the space-time-angle dependent thresholds. Both the size of the ''greenest'' subsample for deriving the climatology and its use for constructing the thresholds are discussed in detail using targets in central United States and Thailand. The approach is generalized further and applied globally. Special attention is devoted to the development of quantitative criteria to estimate the efficiency of both steps and to the improvement resulting from implementation of the proposed procedure of cloud screening.

AB Better ways are needed to assess the extent and severity of soil salinity in fields in terms of economic impact on crap production and effectiveness of reclamation efforts. Procedures to help meet these needs were developed from soil salinity, plant height and boll counts, and digitized color infrared aerial photography and videography acquired during midboll set development stage for four salt-affected cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Unsupervised classification procedures were used to produce seven-category spectral maps by field. Regression equations were developed from salinity measurements in the surface 30 cm (EC1) at 100-200 sample sites per field and the photography and videography digital counts at those same sites. The equations were used to estimate the salinity of each of the approximately 100,000 pixels per field, and the salinity categories corresponding to the spectral ones were mapped. The spectral classification maps and the estimated salinity maps corresponded well. Boll counts, made at about 20 sites per field, were converted to lint yield and regressed on NDVI from both the photography and videography; the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.72 for video and 0.73 for the photographic data. Lint yields decreased by 43 +/- 10 kg ha(-1) per dS m(-1) increase in EC1, or $52 +/- 12 ha(-1) at current market prices. Our results illustrate very practical ways to combine image analysis capability, spectral observations, and ground truth to map and quantify the severity of soil salinity and its effects on crops.

AB Aircraft remote sensing of surface chlorophyll concentrations with NASA's Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS) was used to determine the seasonal and interannual dynamics of phytoplankton biomass in the Chesapeake Bay from 1989 to 1992. Flights were conducted at a frequency of 1-2 per week from late winter through early fall, and were scheduled to coincide with shipboard sampling as weather permitted. The primary sources of in situ data for developing and validating biomass algorithms were monitoring cruises sponsored by the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) and the NSF-sponsored Land Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) program of the University of Maryland. The general approach was to recover estimates of biomass from the relationship of surface chlorophyll to the concentration of vertically-integrated chlorophyll weighted bathymetrically. The seasonally and annually specific relations used to estimate biomass were then applied to ODAS estimates of surface chlorophyll for each of >90 flights to produce a time series of total phytoplankton biomass (in metric tons of chlorophyll) for the Chesapeake Bay. Estimates of algal biomass averaged approximately 500 metric tons, with maximum values of 1400 metric tons in spring 1990. These values are in agreement with estimates computed from the integrated vertical profiles of the CBP database using a 3D interpolator model. The total biomass of phytoplankton during the spring bloom of 1990 was significantly higher than in 1989, 1991, and 1992. The causes of these interannual differences are discussed in terms of variations in Susquehanna River flow and nutrient loading to the estuary.

AB Soil moisture estimates from a distributed hydrologic model and two microwave airborne sensors (Push Broom Microwave Radiometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar) are compared with ground measurements on two different scales, using data collected during a field experiment over a 7.4-km2 heterogeneous watershed located in central Pennsylvania. It is found that both microwave sensors and the hydrologic model successfully reflect the temporal variation Of soil moisture. Watershed-averaged soil moistures estimated by the microwave sensors are in good agreement with ground measurements. The hydrologic model initialized by streamflow records yields estimates that are wetter than observations. The preliminary test of utilizing remotely sensed information as a feedback to correct the initial state of the hydrologic model shows promising results.

AB We analyzed airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) imagery of forest, wetland, and agricultural ecosystems in northern Belize, Central America. Our analyses are based upon four biophysical indices derived from the fully polarimetric SAR data: the volume scattering index (VSI), canopy structure index (CSI), biomass index (BMI), calculated from the backscatter magnitude data, and the interaction type index (ITI), calculated from the backscatter phase data. We developed a four-level landscape hierarchy based upon clustering analyses of the 12 index parameters (four indices each for P, L, and C band) from two test site images. Statistical analyses were used to examine the relative importance of the 12 parameters for discriminating ecosystem characteristics at various landscape scales. We found that ITI was the most important index (primarily C band = CITI) for level, vegetated terrain at all levels of the hierarchy. BMI was most important for differentiating between vegetated and nonvegetated areas and between sloping and level terrain. These findings indicate that upper canopy spatial characteristics and flooding in marshlands (reflected in the CITI) are more important than biomass in differentiating many tropical ecosystems with radar data. The relative importance of the indices varied with vegetation type; for example, PVSI was the most important for distinguishing between upland forests and regrowth, and PCSI was the most important for differentiating swamp forest types. Finally, we evaluated the potential of present and future spaceborne SARs for tropical ecosystem studies based on our results. Most of these SARs are single channel systems and will provide limited capability for characterizing biomass and structure of tropical vegetation. This is especially true for C band systems, which produce data similar to our CBMI parameter, which was one of the least important in our analyses. The SIR-C/X-SAR and proposed EOS SAR are future spaceborne multifrequency fully polarimetric SAR systems, and they will provide a significant contribution to tropical ecosystem studies.

ID RINGS
AB Twelve years (1977-1988) of NOAA infrared imagery data were used to study the variations of the north wall displacements of the Gulf Stream east of Cape Hatteras (i.e., between 74 W and 65 W). The variations of the north wall displacements were compared with the variations in the Straits of Florida transport, which was estimated using a multifrequency model based on the sea-level differences between Siboney, Cuba and Key West, Florida for the period 1977-1988, and with transport measurements based on the submarine cable between Jupiter, Florida, and Settlement Point in the Bahamas for the period 1982-1988. The north wall reached a maximum northward position in 1985 when the cable data indicated that the Straits of Florida transport was a maximum. The north wall reached a maximum southward position in 1981. Cable data were not available before 1982, but the available data suggested that there may have been a minimum transport in 1981. A weak annual cycle of the north wall was found with a maximum northward position in the fall and a maximum southward position in the spring. No relationship was found between the annual cycle of the Gulf Stream's north wall and the annual cycle of the Straits of Florida transport.

AB A geometric-optical model of the bidirectional reflectance of a forest canopy, developed by Li and Strahler, fits observed directional radiance measurements with good accuracy. This model treats the forest cover as a scene of discrete, three-dimensional objects (trees) that are illuminated and viewed from different positions in the hemisphere. The shapes of the objects, their count densities and patterns of placement, are the driving variables, and they condition the mixture Of sunlit and shaded objects and background that are observed from a particular viewing direction, given a direction of illumination. This mixture, in turn, controls the brightness apparent to an observer or a radiometric instrument. The Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) was used to validate this model. This aircraft sensor presently acquires images in 29 spectral bands in the range (465-871 nm) and is pointable fore-and-aft, allowing directional measurements of radiance as a target is approached and imaged at view angles ranging +/- 45-degrees from nadir. Through atmospheric correction, ASAS radiances were reduced to bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). These were compared to corresponding BRF values computed from the Li-Strahler model using, wherever possible, ground measured component BRFs for calibration. The comparisons showed a good match between the modeled and measured reflectance factors for four of the five Oregon Transect Sites. Thus, the geometric-optical approach provides a realistic model for the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of such natural vegetation canopies. Further modifications are suggested to improve the predicted BRFs and yield still better results.

DT Article
AB Two simple techniques to retrieve path precipitable water from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) (Vane et al., 1993) high spectral resolution radiance data (Continuum interpolated Band Ratio, CIBR, and Narrow/Wide ratio, NIW), using the 940 nm water absorption band, are compared. Since the shape and depth of the atmospheric water bands are influenced not only by the water present but also by surface (background) reflectance, atmospheric scattering, and instrument radiance by calibration, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the radiative transfer code LOWTRAN 7 (Kneizys et al., 1988) to determine which one of these two approaches will provide a better estimate over land and water areas. The CIBR proved to be the technique less sensitive to perturbing effects, except for errors in visibility estimate. Both techniques were applied to AVIRIS radiance data acquired over Salton Sea, California. Resulting images confirmed that the use of a constant gray reflectance in the model led to a higher overestimation of the amount of water retrieved for N/W over vegetated areas. Validation was performed through comparison between an independent estimate Of water vaporfrom concurrent Reagan sunphotometer measurements and AVIRIS estimates. Amounts retrieved using the N/W approach match more closely in situ measurements, even after adjusting model parameters for background reflectance, viewing geometry and type Of aerosol at the site. The 13% underestimation observed for the CIBR was explained by small differences AL(lambda(i)) between AVIRIS and LOWTRAN 7 modeled radiances. Resultsfrom this study emphasizes the importance Of accurate instrument calibration in flight and correct physical modeling of atmospheric absorptions.

TI EVALUATION OF MULTICHANNEL WIENER FILTERS APPLIED TO FINE RESOLUTION
   PASSIVE MICROWAVE IMAGES OF 1ST-YEAR SEA ICE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past two decades passive microwave imaging systems have proven to be effective reconnaissance tools in polar environments. However, the mechanical scan mechanism and high gain electronics characteristic of this class of sensors commonly impart noise and unwanted artifacts to image data they produce, complicating visual analysis and automated classification procedures. The fact that data in individual scan lines are characterized by statistical stationarity and that information in adjacent pixels is highly correlated due to oversampling of these image data suggests that Wiener multichannel filtering techniques may prove effective in this application. Wiener filters applied to passive microwave images of first-year sea ice were constructed. Four major parameters that define the filter (lag or pixel offset between the original and desired scenes, filter length, number of lines in the filter, and weight applied to the empirical correlation functions) were varied. Results were compared visually to assess the effect of each variable on image quality. Effective filters that limit high frequency noise and enhance ice characteristics use a lag of one pixel, consist of two or three channels, are five pixels in length, and weigh the auto- and cross-correlation functions equally.

Our objective was to evaluate a technique for field measurements of rho and tau that does not require an, integrating sphere. Values of near-normal hemispherical rho and tau of green leaves of common bean, maize, wheat, and senesced leaves of potato measured with an integrating sphere and a high resolution spectroradiometer were compared with estimates of rho and tau derived from contrasting white and black backgrounds. Values of rho and tau were determined from a relationship relating rho and tau to reflectance from contrasting backgrounds using the hemispherical sensor head of the spectroradiometer and with leaves placed on a 0.6 m x 0.6 m white / black panel. Derivation of rho and tau involved estimating infinite reflectance (R(infinity)) and then calculating rho and tau. The technique produced good estimates of rho and tau compared to the integrating sphere-derived measurements of rho and tau. Based on these results, it was concluded that the radiometer used to measure canopy reflectance can be used to measure rho and tau in the field.

TI A COMPARISON OF SPATIAL FEATURE-EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS FOR LAND-USE
   CLASSIFICATION WITH SPOT HRV DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID COVER CLASSIFICATION; TEXTURE
AB A large number of spatial feature extraction methods were developed during the past 20 years. The effectiveness of each method has been assessed in different studies using different data. However, there have been few application-oriented studies made to evaluate the relative powers of these methods in a particular environment. In this study, three spatial feature extraction methods have been compared in the land-use classification of the SPOT HRV multispectral data at the rural-urban fringe of Metropolitan Toronto. The first two methods are the well-known gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and the simple statistical transformation (SST). The third method is the texture spectrum (TS), which was developed recently. Twenty-seven spatial features were derived from the SPOT HRV Band 3 image using these methods. Each of these features or a combination of two of these features were used in combination with the three spectral images in the classification of 10 land-use classes. Results indicated that some spatial features derived using the GLCM and the SST methods can largely improve the classification accuracies obtained by the use of the spectral images only. In addition, average transformed divergence was found to be ineffective in selecting optimal spatial features for land-use classification.

TI ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTISPECTRAL MEIS IMAGERY FOR SPRUCE
   BUDWORM DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ON A SINGLE TREE BASIS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BALSAM FIR; DEFOLIATION; STANDS
AB Forty centimeter resolution MEIS (Multispectral Electro-optical Imaging Scanner) data in five visible and near-infrared bands were acquired August 1984 on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. Spectral signatures of individual balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] trees with varying levels of cumulative defoliation caused by the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.]) were analyzed to determine their relationships with defoliation level. The relationship between visually estimated tree defoliation and spectral features was linear for trees with > 20 % defoliation and curvilinear if the entire defoliation range from healthy to dead trees was considered. There was lower discrimination capability at low defoliation levels. Single variable regression models were generally sufficient for predicting defoliation. Of the five spectral bands, the 445 nm band was the best for defoliation discrimination. Transformed spectral features were better than the original bands, especially ratios or normalized differences of the 845 nm and 665 nm bands. Signatures from the whole tree and sunlit side provided the best measures for predicting individual tree defoliation, while the signature of the shaded side gave the poorest results. Single pixels representing the top of the trees were also effective for defoliation assessment and are relatively simple, fast, and efficient to specify on the imagery. The best empirical model for predicting defoliation derived from this study had a prediction interval of +/- 17% defoliation, with an interval of +/- 16% for trees with defoliation of 26-100% and +/- 19% for trees with 0-25% defoliation (alpha = 0.05). The highest accuracy of the models for predicting defoliation class when tested on an independent sample was 51% for eight classes, 53% for seven classes, 60% for six classes, 80% for five classes, and 92% for four classes. Results demonstrated that high resolution MEIS data has good potential for single tree defoliation assessment suitable for sample plot or site-specific surveys.

AB This article presents a detailed case study of the observed impact of rainfall and soil moisture on microwave brightness temperatures of the lower Great Plains of the United States using SSM/I satellite data.  The SSM/I channels provide better spatial resolution and are at higher frequencies than typically used for studies of this type.  Examination of the SSM/I observations during a month and a half period in Oklahoma in 1987 indicated large spatial temperature variations due to both vegetation cover and soil moisture.  The brightness temperatures of the land background were strongly modulated by rainfall during the study period.  Areas of lowest brightness temperatures coincided with regions of bare soil which had received significant rainfall.  Examination of the time history of brightness temperatures in the bare soil regions showed that rainfall events caused significant temperature drops, which persisted for at least several days.  Time history plots of brightness temperature and the antecedent precipitation index during an extremely large rain event indicated a slow recovery period (approximately 15 days) back to the dry soil state.  On the other hand, vegetated regions showed smaller temperature drops and much weaker correlation with rain events, thus questioning the feasibility of using these SSM/I measurements for soil moisture estimation.

AB Three atmospheric correction methods for satellite-borne imagery are described and compared.  The main problem considered is to determine the reflectance of a small Lambertian target which is located on a uniform Lambertian background.  The principal differences between the three methods for solving the problem are that i) in the first method the background reflectance is used, but not the apparent background reflectance (the classical method), ii) just the opposite is done in the second method, and iii) both reflectances are used in the third method, thereby eliminating the often inaccurate path radiances.  These correction methods may not only be used for atmospheric correction itself, but also to evaluate the use of approximative radiative transfer calculations in atmospheric correction schemes.  As an example, we evaluate the Sobolev Modified Approximate Radiative Transfer (SMART) method employing numerical values obtained with the exact doubling method.  It is found that the accuracies of the derived target reflectances depend significantly on the correction method used, the actual target and background reflectances, the optical properties of the atmospheric constituents, and the viewing direction considered.  It is shown that the first method yields, generally, poorer results for the target reflectance than the second and third method.  It is tentatively concluded that replacement of SMART by a more accurate algorithm significantly improves the derived target reflectance only if the aerosol phase function is known with sufficient accuracy.

ID IMAGERY; RANGELAND; MANAGEMENT; DAMAGE
AB Remote sensing data has not been used to its fullest potential for management of natural resources largely because these data are not readily available.  Video remote sensing has been proposed as an alternative to provide near-real-time information about natural resources.  This paper reviews the status and development of airborne video imaging systems and their application for resource management, with special emphasis on agriculture.  Video imagery has been used to detect or assess a variety of agricultural variables such as plant species, chlorosis, grass phytomass levels, cotton and alfalfa root rot infestations, wind erosion, soil moisture and irrigated crops, soil drainage and salinity, and insect pests.  The digitization and computer processing of video imagery has also been demonstrated.  Presently video does not have the detailed resolution of film, but it can provide farm manager with immediately available remote sensing data that can allow them to make quick decisions concerning their operations.

AB Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) leverages signals of opportunity for remote sensing, such as for mapping sea surface topography. This study investigates Grazing angle observations of GNSS-R (GG-R) to systematically retrieve ice sheet surface height in Greenland and Antarctica using Spire Global, Inc. CubeSats. Over a nine-month period, approximately 7800 coherent segments have been processed over the polar regions to compute relative height of the ice sheet above the WGS84 reference ellipsoid under grazing angle geometries. The retrieval of surface height is based on using ionosphere-free phase measurements from both the direct and reflected signals. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were used for the relative height adjustment and the validation of the GG-R retrievals, which presented a root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 1.7 m for both regions. Furthermore, the collocated GG-R profiles manifest good agreement among each other and reveal systematic behavior in the height residuals that might be caused by the DEMs. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of dual-frequency GG-R for measuring ice sheet surface heights.

AB The onset of melt ponds on landfast first-year and multiyear sea ice is detected using dual co-polarized Ku-band spaceborne scatterometer data. Twenty-nine locations in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are used to develop and test the methodology. The daily ScatSat-1 sigma-nought backscatter composite product with a spatial resolution of 2.216 km is used. Vertical (VV) and horizontal (HH) polarizations of these data are used to derive the co-polarized ratio (VV/HH). An increase in VV/HH is associated with an increase in melt pond fraction on the sea ice. This occurs because there is a larger increase in resonant Bragg scattering for VV than for HH when melt pond surfaces exhibit wind-generated capillary waves. VV backscatter magnitude is evaluated in time series using a peak-finding methodology to initiate detection of melt ponds with VV/HH. The peak-finding is based on geophysical controls on backscatter from snow-covered sea ice during the melt season. Daily time-series data from ScatSat-1 are used in conjunction with ERA-5 reanalysis data (2-m air temperature and wind) and a semiempirical snowmelt model. Air temperature data are used to identify snow melt onset and to force the snowmelt model. Wind data are used to evaluate if the wind speed is sufficient for capillary wave formation. The NSCAT4DS geophysical model function is used to model Ku-band backscatter from water, which is then used in a sea ice mixture model to simulate the VV/HH magnitude for a range of pond fractions and wind speeds. The potential for detecting pond onset is evaluated in relation to the noise inherent in the ScatSat-1 VV/HH sea ice measurements, which is found to be approximately 0.16 dB. When the melt pond fraction is sufficiently large to cause VV/HH to exceed the noise, pond onset is detected. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery is used for validation; specifically, the near-infrared albedo. We find an overall mean bias of -0.5 days, and an absolute deviation of 1.4 days, when comparing our method to a near-infrared method for detecting pond onset. The mean biases (absolute deviations) for first-year and multiyear sea ice are -0.3 (1.5) and -0.8 (1.2) days, respectively. Results show that the temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and efficacy of this method can provide robust sea ice melt pond onset timing for landfast sea ice regions of the Arctic.

AB Accurate and timely monitoring of flooded crop areas is crucial for disaster rescue and loss assessment. However, most flooded crop monitoring methods based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery were developed for rice, which is probably inappropriate for crops with complex canopy structures that strongly attenuate SAR signals. Additionally, these methods often rely on empirical thresholds and region-specific reference samples, limiting their reliability and applicability on a larger spatial scale. To address these issues, we developed a novel flooded crop mapping approach at a regional scale using Sentinel-1 time-series data and an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our approach leverages a Flood Separability Index (FSI) derived from the fitted prob-ability density function of flooded and non-flooded crop areas in a GMM. This allows us to overcome the limi-tations of manual input selection in previous studies. The multi-temporal GMM was constructed using the time-series images with optimal polarization to estimate the flooded crop extents on a regional scale. We also investigated the scattering mechanisms of three typical crop disaster structures within an agricultural landscape area. Our results indicate that the proposed multi-temporal GMM is robust in crop planting areas with complex canopy structures. The performance of both single-temporal and multi-temporal GMMs surpasses that of baseline methods such as Otsu and K-means. Compared with VV polarization, VH polarization exhibits greater potential for accurately mapping flooded crops in complex agricultural regions. Our approach does not require labeled samples or many predefined parameters, making it fast and feasible for mapping flooded crops with complex canopy structures in large spatial areas.

AB This study proposes a multi-scale soil moisture algorithm for the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission to estimate high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture (the water content of the soil). The algorithm takes advantage of the high-resolution (-10 [m]) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and coarse resolution modeled/ reanalysis soil moisture products (-9 [km]) to create a high-resolution (200 [m]) soil moisture product at a global extent. The end goal of the algorithm is to remove dependencies on any complex modeling, tedious retrieval steps, or multiple ancillary data needs, and subsequently decrease the degrees of freedom to achieve optimal accuracy in soil moisture retrievals. The use of modeled/reanalysis soil moisture products with high temporal resolution gives an added advantage in reducing the temporal mismatch between the two different inputs used in the algorithm. In this study, the proposed algorithm is tested using L-band UAVSAR backscatter (& sigma;degrees) data and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) SAR & sigma;degrees as a substitute for the NISAR L-band SAR observations. The algorithm uses the L-band SAR & sigma;degrees to disaggregate coarse resolution (-9 [km]) reanalysis soil moisture of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) to a high-resolution of-200 [m] soil moisture product. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated over three sites in different hydro climatic regions of the world, such as India, the USA, and Canada. The high-resolution soil moisture estimates were compared with the in-situ soil moisture measurements available for three sites (North India, Southern California, and Carman, Manitoba, Canada). In North India, in-situ measurements are from paddy crops with high vegetation water content, the unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) for the high-resolution soil moisture retrievals was found to be 0.036 [m3/m3] with a bias of-0.051 [m3/m3]. For the southern California site, the validation statistics shows low ubRMSE of 0.027 [m3/m3] and a low bias of 0.016 [m3/m3]. At the Carman, Manitoba test site of Canada, where in-situ soil measurements were available for multiple crop types, the comparison shows that the ubRMSE for all the crop types lies below 0.05 [m3/m3] with an average bias of <0.07 [m3/m3]. The result confirms that the proposed algorithm meets the NISAR mission's accuracy goals, i.e., 0.06 [m3/m3] ubRMSE over areas with vegetation water content (VWC) below 5 [kg/m2]. Rigorous validation work will still need to be carried out in the future based on the availability of L-band SAR datasets and after the launch of the NISAR satellite.

AB Several high spatial resolution thermal infrared (TIR) missions are planned for the coming decade and their data will be crucial to constrain volcanic activity patterns throughout pre- and post-eruption phases. Foundational to these patterns is the subtle (1-2 K) thermal behavior, which is easily overlooked using lower spatial resolution data. In preparation for these new data, we conducted the first study using the entire twenty-two-year archive of higher spatial, lower temporal resolution TIR data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor. This archive presents a unique opportunity to quantify low-magnitude temperature anomalies and small plumes over long time periods. We developed a new statistical algorithm to automatically detect the full range of thermal activity and applied it to >5000 ASTER scenes of five volcanoes with well-documented eruptions. Unique to this algorithm is its ability to use both day and night data, account for clouds, quantify accurate background temperatures, and dynamically scale depending on the anomaly size. Results improve upon those from the more commonly used lower spatial resolution data, despite the less frequent temporal coverage of ASTER, and show that high spatial resolution TIR data are equally as effective. Significantly, the smaller, subtle thermal detections served as precursory signals in -81% of eruptions, and the algorithm's results create a framework for classifying future eruptive styles.

AB Cashews are grown by over 3 million smallholder farmers in >40 countries worldwide as a principal source of income. Expanding the area of cashew plantations and increasing productivity are critical to improving the livelihood of many smallholder communities. As the third largest cashew producer in Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15% of the country's national export earnings. Expansion of the cashew industry is thus an essential economic driver and a governmental priority in Benin. However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, two newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first-of-its-kind national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations with 2.4-m multi-temporal Planet Basemaps from 2019 to 2021, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. The U-Net model was employed to map the distribution of cashew plantation with 0.5-m mono-temporal aerial imagery in 2015, which can achieve accurate and fast predictions even with limited training data. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% based on 1400 ground truth point samples from each year. The CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76% based on 348 ground truth samples of planting density. We found that the cashew area in Benin has almost doubled to 519 & PLUSMN; 20 kha from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only about half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification. Our study illustrates the power of combining highresolution remote sensing imagery and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to better understand tree crops in the heterogeneous smallholder landscape, which can help efficiently allocate limited training and nursery resources for sustainable agricultural development.

AB We introduce a new unified atmospheric-topographic correction approach that estimates surface geometry directly from the radiance measurement. Surface topography influences the at-sensor radiance measurement, making precise topography modeling critical in applications like vegetation or snow studies in mountainous terrain. Currently, elevation maps are used to derive topographic variables such as the slope and sky-view factor. This process is error-prone since static global digital elevation models do not generally achieve the accuracy required, and even minor mismatches in spatial resolution can introduce significant artifacts in downstream processing. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate topographic parameters directly from spectral data, ensuring perfect physical consistency, temporal coincidence, and spatial alignment. We present experiments estimating topographic slope in two scenes in Southern California, with data from NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). We compared our radiance-based estimates against high-resolution lidar datasets. Our initial validation result showed a correlation of R2 = 0.864 (n = 160) over the homogeneous surface of Beckman Auditorium's cone-shaped roof on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California. We then validate the model over a larger study site near Santa Clarita, California, finding R2 = 0.923 (n = 40, 000) in a 350 x 350 m area. The accuracy of our model estimates, combined with its systematic advantages over the alternative, show the potential of the approach for use in both airborne campaigns and orbital missions.

AB Phytoplankton play a central role in the planetary cycling of important elements and compounds. Understand-ing how phytoplankton are responding to climate change is consequently a major question in Earth Sciences. Monitoring phytoplankton is key to answering this question. Satellite remote sensing of ocean colour is our only means of monitoring phytoplankton in the entire surface ocean at high temporal and large spatial scales, and the continuous ocean-colour data record is now approaching a length suitable for addressing questions around climate change, at least in some regions. Yet, developing ocean-colour algorithms for climate change studies requires addressing issues of ambiguity in the ocean-colour signal. For example, for the same chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) of phytoplankton, the colour of the ocean can be different depending on the type of phytoplankton present. One route to tackle the issue of ambiguity is by enriching the ocean-colour data with information on sea surface temperature (SST), a good proxy of changes in three phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) independent of changes in total Chl-a, a measure of phytoplankton biomass. Using a global surface in -situ dataset of HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) pigments, size-fractionated filtration data, and concurrent satellite SST spanning from 1991 to 2021, we re-tuned, validated and advanced an SST-dependent three-component model that quantifies the relationship between total Chl-a and Chl-a associated with the three PSCs (pico-, nano-and microplankton). Similar to previous studies, striking dependencies between model parameters and SST were captured, which were found to improve model performance significantly. These relationships were applied to 40 years of monthly composites of satellite SST, and significant trends in model parameters were observed globally, in response to climate warming. Changes in these parameters highlight issues in estimating long-term trends in phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) from ocean colour using standard empirical algorithms, which implicitly assume a fixed relationship between total Chl-a and Chl-a of the three size classes. The proposed ecological model will be at the centre of a new ocean-colour modelling framework, designed for investigating the response of phytoplankton to climate change, described in subsequent parts of this series of papers.

AB The extent and duration of snow cover, a critical component of the hydrologic cycle and the global climate system, is expected to shift dramatically under climate change. Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snowcovered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of Fscores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snowrelated processes.

AB Solar induced fluorescence efficiency (SIF) provides a unique chance to capture the dynamics of photosynthesis or gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship between GPP and SIF observed by sensors (SIFobs) is affected by the solar-target-viewing geometry. Although the effects of viewing geometry on SIFobs and its relationship with GPP have been recognized, solar geometry effects on SIFobs have been ignored and less studied in recent decades. This study used SIFobs from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to investigate solar geometry effects on GPP-SIFobs relationships at the diurnal scale. Furthermore, we derived total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal) that should be insensitive to solar-target-viewing geometry in theory. Our results indicated that SIFtotal can effectively mitigate solar geometry effects on SIFobs (including SIF observed at nadir, SIFnadir) and its relationship with GPP from six flux towers. After mitigating the solar angle effects in OCO-3 SIFnadir, the correlation (R2) with GPP increased from 0.73 to 0.87 for SIFnadir to 0.84-0.95 for SIFtotal. The correlations between TROPOMI SIFobs and GPP at three high-latitude sites were also clearly improved by TROPOMI SIFtotal. In addition, the diurnal pattern of SIFtotal was more consistent with that of GPP compared to SIFnadir or SIFobs. This study aims to reveal solar geometry effects on SIF measurements, which should be considered when studying the SIF-GPP relationship especially at the diurnal scale with large variations in solar geometry.

AB Global savannas are the third largest carbon sink with large human populations being highly dependent on their ecosystem services. However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8-and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (gamma 0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 x 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean gamma 0. The ALS cover change (Delta CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between Delta gamma 0 and Delta CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018-2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018-2008. Overall, 1 dB Delta gamma 0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (-0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L -band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35-0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves.

AB The detection of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in the field with spectrometers is based on the depth of the solar Fraunhofer or oxygen absorption lines in the upwelling radiance compared to that in the downwelling irradiance. This relative depth enables the differentiation of SIF from the reflected radiation. Recent studies have shown that if oxygen bands are used to retrieve SIF from tower-based measurements, then atmo-spheric correction is required. This study presents a band shape fitting (BSF) approach to retrieve both the relative optical path length (deepening) and SIF (infilling) from field measurements at the same time, using information in the measured spectral shape of the O2 feature. This approach is an alternative to using radiative transfer process models for estimating atmospheric transmittance. The method was applied to measurements taken from 100 m elevation above a forest, yielding plausible results for SIF in the O2A and O2B bands. The sensitivity to combined atmospheric and instrument characteristics prohibits application at much greater dis-tances from the surface.

AB The ICESat-2 ATL08 land and vegetation product includes several flags that can be used for the assessment of LiDAR-environment interactions and can help select data of the highest quality. However, the usability of these flags has not been sufficiently studied to date. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of atmospheric scattering, the presence of snow, canopy cover, terrain slope, beam strength, and solar angle on the accuracy of terrain and canopy height of the ATL08 product as well as on providing recommendations on how to filter data in order to minimize errors. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of ATL08 terrain and canopy height in European mountains by comparing them with the digital terrain model and canopy height model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the assessment of atmospheric effects using the cloud confidence flag (cloud_-flag_atm; i.e. number of cloud layers) is better than the previously used multiple scattering warning flag (msw_flag). Day acquisitions with more than one layer of clouds yielded a terrain elevation RMSE of 3.22 m in forests while night acquisitions with no more than a single layer of clouds resulted in RMSE of 1.73 m. The increasing atmospheric scattering effects increased the photons' path length, resulting in terrain height under-estimation. The presence of snow had a strong positive effect on the number of identified ground photons, independently of the canopy cover, but resulted in an overestimation of terrain height in higher altitudes. Accordingly, the presence of snow cover resulted in a significant underestimation of canopy height in forests. The canopy height in broadleaf/mixed as well as coniferous forests was in summer underestimated on average by 2.1 m (%ME of-15.3%) and 1.2 m (%ME of-8.2%), respectively; in winter, however, the underestimation increased to 8.5 m (%ME of-56.8%) and 5.7 m (%ME of-38.3%), respectively. Canopy height estimates had better accuracy for the strong beam (RMSE of 5.09 m; %RMSE of 35.4%) than for the weak beam (RMSE of 7.03 m; %RMSE of 51.3%). Our results show that the ATL08 terrain height accuracy decreases with uneven distribution of signal photons within individual segments and further deteriorates with increasing terrain slope. Filtering out segments with poor distribution of photons, more than one layer of clouds during the day, and snow cover in high altitudes is the best approach for minimizing the error while maximizing the number of segments left for subsequent analysis.

AB Agricultural irrigation, as an important practice to protect crops from drought and promote grain yield, has a long history in China. A timely and precise dataset about the extent and dynamics of irrigated areas is necessary for water allocation and agricultural management but is scarce in China. Here we developed annual irrigated cropland maps across China (IrriMap_CN) at 500-m resolution from 2000 to 2019, using MODIS data, machine-learning method, and Google Earth Engine platform. First, we generated annual nationwide training samples by strictly screening the existing irrigation maps downscaled from the statistical data. Second, we implemented locally adaptive random forest classifiers in 511 nominal 1 x 1 grid cells across China with MODIS vegetation indices, climatic factors, and topography variables. Third, we conducted nationwide pixel-wise validation of the IrriMap_CN using independent samples. The validation results based on more than 3000 ground truth points revealed that IrriMap_CN had high accuracies ranging from 77.2% to 85.9%. The time series of IrriMap_CN detected substantial expansion of irrigated areas in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang (more than 50% in total) and pronounced decreases in Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Hebei. The analyses of irrigation frequency, start time, and end time implied that North China Plain was the most intensive irrigated area; but the irrigation area showed a decreasing trend since 2000, consistent with the reduced agricultural water consumption. The annual irrigation datasets allow us to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated croplands in China and are expected to contribute to the improvement of earth system models and facilitate sustainable agricultural water management.

AB In a context of accelerated human-induced biodiversity loss, remote sensing (RS) is emerging as a promising tool to map plant biodiversity from space. Proposed approaches often rely on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), linking the heterogeneity of terrestrial vegetation to the variability of the spectroradiometric signals. Yet, due to observational limitations, the SVH has been insufficiently tested, remaining unclear which metrics, methods, and sensors could provide the most reliable estimates of plant biodiversity. Here we assessed the po-tential of RS to infer plant biodiversity using radiative transfer simulations and inversion. We focused specifically on "functional diversity," which represents the spatial variability in plant functional traits. First, we simulated vegetation communities and evaluated the information content of different functional diversity metrics (FDMs) derived from their optical reflectance factors (R) or the corresponding vegetation "optical traits," estimated via radiative transfer model inversion. Second, we assessed the effect of the spatial resolution, the spectral char-acteristics of the sensor, and signal noise on the relationships between FDMs derived from field and remote sensing datasets. Finally, we evaluated the plausibility of the simulations using Sentinel-2 (multispectral, 10 m pixel) and DESIS (hyperspectral, 30 m pixel) imagery acquired over sites of the Functional Significance of Forest Biodiversity in Europe (FunDivEUROPE) network. We demonstrate that functional diversity can be inferred both by reflectance and optical traits. However, not all the FDMs tested were suited for assessing plant functional diversity from RS. Rao's Q index, functional dispersion, and functional richness were the best-performing metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that spatial resolution is the most limiting RS feature. In agreement with simu-lations, Sentinel-2 imagery provided better estimates of plant diversity than DESIS, despite the coarser spectral resolution. However, Sentinel-2 offered inaccurate results at DESIS spatial resolution. Overall, our results identify the strengths and weaknesses of optical RS to monitor plant functional diversity. Future missions and biodiversity products should consider and benefit from the identified potentials and limitations of the SVH.

AB Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a multi-epoch InSAR method for measuring displacements of Earth's surface over time by exploring the interferometric phase of constantly coherent points, named Persistent Scatterer (PS). PSI has shown its superior capability to monitor linear features with long-distance and large-span characteristics. Nevertheless, the interpretation of estimated displacements over PS is a challenge to overcome. Here, we propose a target characterization approach for multi-epoch InSAR post-processing to efficiently correlate the target's possible deformation types and corresponding deformation characteristics. The PS targets were categorized into elevated (ELV) and ground (GRD) groups. The deformation signals are assigned into four types: Defo-Type I stable, Defo-Type II shallow, Defo-Type III structural, and Defo-Type IV mixed deformation based on the ELV versus GRD differential motion estimation. Our approach is demonstrated over the metro network of Shanghai city, China using High-resolution TerraSAR-X data. The seven-year displacements map along Shanghai metro lines estimated by PSI shows that 85% of the points are relatively stable, while only 0.07% exhibits a significant deformation trend. We performed the stability evaluation along the subway by incorporating velocity, cumulative and relative deformation. It was found that the lines that have been operated for a long time are relatively stable, and obvious deformations were observed on the newly built lines and the extension sections of existing lines. By interpreting deformation types, We inferred that the displacements along metro lines mainly corresponded to Defo-Type II, and the areas with obvious deformation involve the superposition of multiple deformation types.

It is designed to overcome some limitations in existing Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) inversion methods, including the high dimensionality of the inverse problem, the convergence problem due to possible equifinality, and the dependence of some RTM variables on the crop-specific architecture. The PROSAIL model is first inverted in a calibration step using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm over a global dataset of ground GAI measurements (for maize, wheat, and rice) and the corresponding reflectance observations from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Quickbird to derive crop-specific distributions of PROSAIL input variables. These distributions were then used as prior information to predict GAI over an independent set of reflectance observations. Results show that the full Bayesian approach provides close estimates of GAI to ground truth, with respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.01, 1.33, and 0.97 for maize, wheat, and rice (R-2=0.67, 0.76 and 0.63, respectively). The performances are better than those approaches generally reported using radiative transfer models that are non-crop-specific, like the SNAP algorithm for Sentinel-2, but are slightly behind the purely empirical models based on machine learning. However, the proposed approach provides an explicit insight of the joint distribution of PROSAIL variables that are valid for any satellite platform. This constitutes a major advantage against purely empirical models, as it enables to fully exploit large observational datasets from multiple sensors and generalize to other platforms.

AB Information on grassland land-use intensity (LUI) is crucial for understanding trends and dynamics in biodi-versity, ecosystem functioning, earth system science and environmental monitoring. LUI is a major driver for numerous environmental processes and indicators, such as primary production, nitrogen deposition and resil-ience to climate extremes. However, large extent, high resolution data on grassland LUI is rare. New satellite generations, such as Copernicus Sentinel-2, enable a spatially comprehensive detection of the mainly subtle changes induced by land-use intensification by their fine spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a methodology quantifying key parameters of grassland LUI such as grazing intensity, mowing frequency and fertiliser application across Germany using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on Sentinel-2 satellite data with 20 m x 20 m spatial resolution. Subsequently, these land-use components were used to calculate a continuous LUI index. Predictions of LUI and its components were validated using comprehensive in situ grassland management data. A feature contribution analysis using Shapley values substantiates the applicability of the methodology by revealing a high relevance of springtime satellite observations and spectral bands related to vegetation health and structure. We achieved an overall classification accuracy of up to 66% for grazing in-tensity, 68% for mowing, 85% for fertilisation and an r2 of 0.82 for subsequently depicting LUI. We evaluated the methodology's robustness with a spatial 3-fold cross-validation by training and predicting on geographically distinctly separated regions. Spatial transferability was assessed by delineating the models' area of applicability. The presented methodology enables a high resolution, large extent mapping of land-use intensity of grasslands.

AB The changes in the permafrost environment have been of interest as a sensitive indicator of changes in global climate conditions. Since changes in the soil and ecosystem of the permafrost active layer are spatially and temporally complex depending on many environmental factors, it is not easy to grasp climate-induced changes occurring in coupled atmospheric-ecological-geocryological systems. To understand the changes in the permafrost active layer, spatially detailed monitoring methods such as multi-spectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technologies have been extensively applied to the permafrost observation. Optical and SAR systems observe different permafrost features due to significant differences in electromagnetic wave frequencies and imaging mechanisms. Therefore, most studies used optical and SAR data separately according to the purpose and characteristics of each study. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of combined interpretation of optical and SAR data for identifying and understanding spatiotemporal details of the short- and long-term changes occurring in the permafrost active layer. Multi-spectral optical images acquired during the thawing period and L-band polarimetric SAR images acquired during the freezing period are used in this study in order to examine ecological characteristics and cryogenic processes, respectively. The result of analyzing the relationship between information obtained from optical and SAR sensors revealed that there was a significant correlation between winter changes in scattering properties observed in SAR data and summer land cover changes observed in optical data. The scattering characteristics of winter soil were found to be particularly related to the ecosystem changes in areas that can be explained by the thermokarst development process. Additional data from independent sources, such as elevation data, meteorological data, and long-term optical data, consistently supported the relationship between the winter SAR observations and the thermokarst-related ecosystem changes. The experimental results also elucidated that polarimetric scattering mechanism indicators representing the signal depolarization and surface roughness properties played an important role in deriving information related to the permafrost process from the winter SAR data.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be used as an indicator of crop photosynthetic activity and a proxy for vegetation stress in plant phenotyping and precision agriculture applications. SIF quantification is sensitive to the spectral resolution (SR), and its accurate retrieval requires sensors with sub-nanometer resolutions. However, for accurate SIF quantification from imaging sensors onboard airborne platforms, sub-nanometer imagers are costly and more difficult to operate than the commonly available narrow-band imagers (i.e., 4-to 6nm bandwidths), which can also be installed on drones and lightweight aircraft. Although a few theoretical and experimental studies have evaluated narrow-band spectra for SIF quantification, there is a lack of research focused on comparing the effects of the SR on SIF from airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical applications. This study investigates the effects of SR and sensor altitude on SIF accuracy, comparing SIF quantified at the 760nm O-2-A band (SIF760) from two hyperspectral imagers with different spectral configurations (full width at half maximum resolutions of 0.1-0.2 nm and 5.8 nm) flown in tandem on board an aircraft. SIF760 retrievals were compared from two different wheat and maize phenotyping trials grown under different nitrogen fertilizer application rates over the 2019-2021 growing seasons. SIF760 from the two sensors were correlated (R-2 = 0.77-0.9, p < 0.01), with the narrow-band imager producing larger SIF760 estimates than the sub-nanometer imager (root mean square error (RMSE) 3.28-4.69 mW/m(2)/nm/sr). Ground-level SIF760 showed strong relationships with both sub-nanometer (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.07 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) and narrow-band (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.001, RMSE = 3.26 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) airborne retrievals. Simulation-based assessments of SIF760 for SRs ranging from 1 to 5.8 nm using the SCOPE model were consistent with experimental results showing significant relationships among SIF760 quantified at different SRs. Predictive algorithms of leaf nitrogen concentration using SIF760 from either the narrow-band or sub-nanometer sensor yielded similar performance, supporting the use of narrow-band resolution imagery for assessing the spatial variability of SIF in plant phenotyping, vegetation stress detection and precision agriculture contexts.

AB This paper presents MARMIT-2, a radiative transfer model that predicts the spectral reflectance of soils in the solar domain (0.4-2.5 mu m) as a function of their surface moisture. This is an improved version of MARMIT (multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) that represents a wet soil as a dry soil topped with a thin layer of liquid water. The changes brought in this article concern the mixing of the spectral reflectance of the dry and wet soil areas, the transmission of diffuse light in the water layer, and the inclusion of soil particles in the water layer. Wet soil reflectance is now expressed in terms of dry soil reflectance and three free parameters: the thickness of the water layer, the surface fraction of the wet soil, and a new parameter, the volume fraction of soil particles in the water layer. With more accurate physical modeling, MARMIT-2 simulates soil spectral reflectance with better accuracy than MARMIT. In particular, the fit of the soil reflectance spectra is much better for high water contents, both in the visible range (0.4-0.7 mu m) and in the water absorption bands around 1.45 mu m and 1.95 mu m. The average root mean square error between measured and predicted reflectance obtained on a set of 225 soil samples is about 0.8% with MARMIT-2 versus 1.8% with MARMIT.

AB Under the background of global change, increasing attention has been paid to the changes of benthic habitats in shallow ocean ecosystems (e.g., seagrass beds and coral reefs). Optical satellite remote sensing via both active and passive methods plays an important role in monitoring the health of benthic habitats by retrieving benthic reflectance spectra, but it remains difficult to accurately retrieve benthic reflectance spectra from only active or passive remote sensing because of the coupling between water column scattering and benthic reflectance. Here, we developed a semi-analytical model to retrieve benthic reflectance spectra in Case-I waters by combining active lidar and passive high-resolution imagery. Based on two-stream radiative transfer theory, the analytical relationship among the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and water column reflectance (R-w), benthic reflectance (R-b), diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), and water depth was established. The lidar data at a certain wavelength were applied to derive the water depth and the chlorophyll concentration (chl) along the lidar track. Then, the values of K-d at different wavelengths were estimated from the derived chl. In addition, we established a look-up table (LUT) for the relationship between R-w and chl and water depth using Hydrolight simulation, and the R-w values at different wavelengths were then estimated by the lidar-derived chl and water depth. Finally, R-b(lambda) values at different wavelengths along the lidar track were retrieved from the R-rs(lambda) values observed by passive high-resolution imagery and the values of R-w(lambda), K-d(lambda), and water depth derived by lidar observation. The accuracy of the model was verified by using the Hydrolight simulated datasets, and the high correlation coefficient (R) revealed promising model performance for different benthic habitats, e.g., R > 0.9 for typical clean shallow water (chl = 0.5 mg/m(3), H < 4 m) for the wavelength range of 400-640 nm. The model was further applied to real satellite data from ICESat-2 lidar and passive high-resolution satellite imagery (multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral imagery of Zhuhai-1) at two different benthic habitat sites (seagrass beds in Xincun Bay and coral reefs in the Huaguang Reef) in the South China Sea, and the results revealed that the model could reproduce the benthic spectra in both magnitude and shape. Overall, the proposed model can reliably yield benthic reflectance spectra along the lidar track without any requirement on prior knowledge, which should be beneficial for further benthic habitat health monitoring.

AB Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at similar to 1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML) based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.

AB Fresh water stored by on-farm reservoirs (OFRs) is an important component of surface hydrology and is critical for meeting global irrigation needs. Farmers use OFRs to store water during the wet season and for crop irrigation during the dry season, yet their seasonal and inter-annual variability and downstream impacts are not quantified. Therefore, OFRs' sub-weekly surface area changes are critical to understanding their dynamics and mitigating their downstream impacts. However, prior to the recent increase in satellite imagery availability and improvement in sensors' spatial resolution, monitoring the OFRs' sub-weekly surface area changes across space and time was challenging because OFRs occur in high numbers (i.e. hundreds) and are small water bodies (50 ha). We propose a novel multi-sensor approach to monitor OFRs surface areas, developed based on 736 OFRs in eastern Arkansas, USA, which leverages the use of PlanetScope (PS), RapidEye (RE), Sentinel 2 (S2), and Sentinel 1 (S1). First, we estimate the uncertainties in surface area for each sensor by comparing the surface area estimates to a validation dataset, and by comparing RE, S2 and S1 to PS-the sensor with the highest spatial resolution (i.e. 3.125 m). Second, we use the uncertainties of each sensor with a data assimilation algorithm based on the Kalman filter to obtain sub-weekly surface area time series for all OFRs. Our results show the lowest uncertainties for PS, followed by RE, S2 and S1. These uncertainties varied according to the OFRs' size and shape complexities. The surface area estimates derived from the Kalman filter including only the optical sensors resulted in high agreement (r(2) > 0.95) and small uncertainties (4-8%) when compared to the validation dataset. We found higher uncertainties (5-14%) when adding S1 to the Kalman filter-this is related to the higher uncertainties found for S1 (similar to 20%). The algorithm can assimilate optical and radar satellite data to increase the OFRs' surface area time series cadence allowing us to investigate sub-weekly surface area changes. The algorithm is not sensor-specific, and it accounts for the uncertainties in both the sensors observations and the resulting surface areas, which are key advantages when compared to other algorithms used to combine satellite data. By improving the surface area observations cadence and providing the surface area uncertainties, the approach presented in this study has the potential to enhance water conservation plans by allowing better assessment and management of the OFRs.

AB Accurately quantifying tree and forest structure is important for monitoring and understanding terrestrial ecosystem functioning in a changing climate. The emergence of laser scanning, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS), has advanced accurate and detailed forest structural measurements. TLS generally provides very accurate measurements on the plot-scale (a few ha), whereas UAV-LS provides comparable measurements on the landscape-scale ( 10 ha). Despite the pivotal role dense tropical forests play in our climate, the strengths and limitations of TLS and UAV-LS to accurately measure structural metrics in these forests remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose to combine TLS and UAV-LS data from dense tropical forest plots to analyse how this fusion can further advance 3D structural mapping of structurally complex forests. We compared stand (vertical point distribution profiles) and tree level metrics from TLS, UAV-LS as well as their fused point cloud. The tree level metrics included the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown projection area (CPA), and crown volume (CV). Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of point density and number of returns for UAV-LS data acquisition. DBH measurements from TLS and UAV-LS were compared to census data. The TLS and UAV-LS based H, CPA and CV measurements were compared to those obtained from the fused point cloud. Our results for two tropical rainforest plots in Australia demonstrate that TLS can measure H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of 0.30 m (H-average =27.32 m), 3.06 m(2) (CPAaverage =66.74 m(2)), and 29.63 m(3) (CVaverage =318.81 m(3)) respectively. UAV-LS measures H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of <0.40 m, <5.50 m(2), and <30.33 m(3) respectively. However, in dense tropical forests single flight UAV-LS is unable to sample the tree stems sufficiently for DBH measurement due to a limited penetration of the canopy. TLS can determine DBH with an accuracy (RMSE) of 5.04 cm, (DBHaverage =45.08 cm), whereas UAV-LS can not. We show that in dense tropical forests stand-alone TLS is able to measure macroscopic structural tree metrics on plot-scale. We also show that UAV-LS can be used to quickly measure H, CPA, and CV of canopy trees on the landscape-scale with comparable accuracy to TLS. Hence, the fusion of TLS and UAV-LS, which can be time consuming and expensive, is not required for these purposes. However, TLS and UAV-LS fusion opens up new avenues to improve stand-alone UAV-LS structural measurements at the landscape scale by applying TLS as a local calibration tool.

AB NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a key climate mission whose goal is to advance our understanding of the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. While GEDI is the first space-based LIDAR explicitly optimized to measure vertical forest structure predictive of aboveground biomass, the accurate interpretation of this vast amount of waveform data across the broad range of observational and environmental conditions is challenging. Here, we present a novel supervised machine learning approach to interpret GEDI waveforms and regress canopy top height globally. We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach based on an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to avoid the explicit modelling of unknown effects, such as atmospheric noise. The model learns to extract robust features that generalize to unseen geographical regions and, in addition, yields reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Ultimately, the global canopy top height estimates produced by our model have an expected RMSE of 2.7 m with low bias.

AB Diameter frequency distributions provide essential information for estimating timber assortment, monitoring carbon stocks, and formulating forest management measures. In this study, we estimated diameter distribution utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) data by applying three Weibull distribution modeling methods: (1) parameter prediction method (PPM); (2) moment-based parameter recovery method (PRMM); and (3) percentile-based parameter recovery method (PRMP). The variables used in Weibull distribution modeling methods were combined with stand density as response groups to be modeled with ULS metrics. Considering the hierarchical structure of ULS data and the autocorrelation among sub-models, mixed-effects seemingly unrelated regression (SURM) were applied to take into account both spatial and cross-model correlations. The experiments were conducted for 11 sites of larch plantations using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The diameter distribution was estimated and calibrated by the observed stand density considering the correlations of submodels' random-effects. The results demonstrated that applying a relatively small number of plots (1 to 6) and estimated best linear predictor (EBLUP) for local calibration could improve the prediction performance. The optimal results were obtained from PRMM with six calibrated plots, and the average Reynolds error index was 45.30. Furthermore, simulation applications with different pulse densities were applied and suggested that calibration could also improve the estimation performance but brought little improvement on estimation stability, far lesser than the impact of point cloud density. This study provides an improved approach for diameter distribution estimation and benefits for operational forest applications using remote sensing data.

AB Estimating methane (CH4) emission rates using quantitative CH4 retrievals from the Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) requires the use of wind speeds. Model wind speeds have limited temporal and spatial resolution, meteorological station wind data are of variable quality and are often not available near observed plumes, and the use of ultrasonic anemometers co-located with methane sources is impractical for AVIRIS-NG flight campaigns with daily coverage of thousands of square kilometers. Given these limitations, this study focused on the use of the Twin Otter Doppler Wind Lidar (TODWL) to measure near surface winds and provide coincident measurements to CH4 plumes observed with AVIRIS-NG. In a controlled release experiment, TODWL observed wind speed and direction agreed well with ultrasonic anemometer measurements and CH4 emission rates derived from TODWL observations were more accurate than those using the ultrasonic anemometer or model winds during periods of stable winds. During periods exhibiting rapid shifts in wind speed and direction, estimating emission rates proved more challenging irrespective of the use of model, ultrasonic anemometer, or TODWL wind data. Overall, TODWL was able to provide reasonably accurate wind measurements and emission rate estimates despite the variable wind conditions and excessive flight level turbulence which impacted near surface measurement density. TODWL observed winds were also used to constrain CH4 emissions at a refinery, landfill, wastewater facility, and dairy digester. At these sites, TODWL wind measurements agreed well with wind observations from nearby meteorological stations, and when combined with quantitative CH4 plume imagery, yielded emission rate estimates that were similar to those obtained using model winds. This study demonstrates the utility of combining TODWL and AVIRIS-NG CH4 measurements and emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating both instruments on a single aircraft for future deployments.

AB Long-term and high-quality surface soil moisture (SSM) and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) data is crucial for understanding the land-atmosphere interactions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). More than 40% of QTP is covered by permafrost, yet few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SSM and RZSM products derived from microwave satellite, land surface models (LSMs) and reanalysis over that region. This study tries to address this gap by evaluating a range of satellite and reanalysis estimates of SSM and RZSM in the thawed soil overlaying permafrost in the QTP, using in-situ measurements from sixteen stations. Here, seven SSM products were evaluated: Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 (SMAP L3) and L4 (SMAP-L4), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in version IC (SMOS IC), Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and the fifth generation of the land component of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERAS-Land). We also evaluated three RZSM products from SMAP-L4, ERA5-Land, and the Noah land surface model driven by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-Noah). The assessment was conducted using five statistical metrics, i. e. Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, slope, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) between SSM or RZSM products and in-situ measurements. Our results showed that the ESA CCI, SMAP-L4 and SMOS-IC SSM products outperformed the other SSM products, indicated by higher correlation coefficients (R) (with a median R value of 0.63, 0.44 and 0.57, respectively) and lower ubRMSE (with a median ubRMSE value of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.07 m(3)/m(3), respectively). Yet, SSM overestimation was found for all SSM products. This could be partly attributed to ancillary data used in the retrieval (e.g. overestimation of land surface temperature for SMAP-L3) and to the fact that the products (e.g. LPRM) more easily overestimate the in-situ SSM when the soil is very dry. As expected, SMAP-L3 SSM performed better in areas with sparse vegetation than with dense vegetation covers. For RZSM products, SMAP-L4 and GLDAS-Noah (R = 0.66 and 0.44, ubRMSE = 0.03 and 0.02 m(3)/m(3), respectively) performed better than ERAS-Land (R = 0.46; ubRMSE = 0.03 m(3)/m(3)). It is also found that all RZSM products were unable to capture the variations of in-situ RZSM during the freezing/thawing period over the permafrost regions of QTP, due to large deviation for the ice-water phase change simulation and the lack of consideration for unfrozen-water migration during freezing processes in the LSMs.

AB Aerodynamic resistance (hereafter r(a)) is a preeminent variable in evapotranspiration (ET) modelling. The accurate quantification of r(a) plays a pivotal role in determining the performance and consistency of thermal remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models for estimating ET at local to regional scales. Atmospheric stability links r(a) with land surface temperature (LST) and the representation of their interactions in the SEB models determines the accuracy of ET estimates.
   The present study investigates the influence of r(a) and its relation to LST uncertainties on the performance of three structurally different SEB models. It used data from nine Australian OzFlux eddy covariance sites of contrasting aridity in conjunction with MODIS Terra and Aqua LST and leaf area index (LAI) products. Simulations of the sensible heat flux (H) and the latent heat flux (LE, the energy equivalent of ET in W/m(2)) from the SPARSE (Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration), SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) and STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure) models forced with MODIS LST, LAI, and in-situ meteorological datasets were evaluated against flux observations in water-limited (arid and semi-arid) and energy-limited (mesic) ecosystems from 2011 to 2019.
   Our results revealed an overestimation tendency of instantaneous LE by all three models in the water-limited shrubland, woodland and grassland ecosystems by up to 50% on average, which was caused by an underestimation of H. Overestimation of LE was associated with discrepancies in r(a) retrievals under conditions of high atmospheric instability, during which uncertainties in LST (expressed as the difference between MODIS LST and in-situ LST) apparently played a minor role. On the other hand, a positive difference in LST coincided with low r(a) (high wind speeds) and caused a slight underestimation of LE at the water-limited sites. The impact of r(a) on the LE residual error was found to be of the same magnitude as the influence of LST uncertainties in the semi-arid ecosystems as indicated by variable importance in projection (VIP) coefficients from partial least squares regression above unity. In contrast, our results for the mesic forest ecosystems indicated minor dependency on r(a) for modelling LE (VIP < 0.4), which was due to a higher roughness length and lower LST resulting in the dominance of mechanically generated turbulence, thereby diminishing the importance of buoyancy production for the determination of r(a).

AB In the recent years satellite radar altimetry has evolved from pulse-limited low resolution mode (LRM) to a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high resolution mode. The SAR mode focusses and coherently sums all radar return echoes within the 2-s time window the target surface area is in the antenna beam. In principle the SAR processing improves along-track resolution. Land contamination has been a major concern for inland waters altimetry and SAR can reduce land interference. This paper shows that the physics of specular echoes from smooth inland waters leads to a very different approach which we call precise inland surface altimetry (PISA). PISA uses only echoes within the specular "flash" period, which is approximately the time the satellite nadir crosses over the water body. The processing is four orders of magnitude less than SAR. Land interference is negligible because specular water echoes are usually >50 dB greater than land. Sentinel-3 SRAL dataset on the salar de Uyuni (Bolivia) is used to evaluate PISA ranging precision. During inundation (wet months), echoes are at the theoretical maximum radar cross section (RCS), sigma = 129 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 mm. In dry months the echoes are quasi-specular, with sigma = 70-100 dBsm, and ranging precision is -1 cm. The precision assessment is made with variate-differences, with pass-to-pass repeatability, and by comparison with GPS measurements. In addition to the salar de Uyuni analysis we gathered sigma statistics on five millions Sentinel-3 SRAL Ku-band altimeter bursts (one burst = 64 contiguous echoes) from 52 passes of Sentinel-3A track 167 over South America. We illustrate specular and quasi-specular waters on lakes, a river, and a fjord. Ranging precision is similar to Uyuni, in the 1 mm-1 cm range. Water surface slopes of 1-3 cm/km are detected. We propose a simple rule-set to distinguish specular waveforms (sigma >100 dBsm, sidelobes (with Hamming window) of -37 dB or lower) and quasi-specular (sigma >70 dBsm, sidelobes lower than -20 dB), and non-specular (sidelobes> - 20 dB). PISA is appropriate to specular and quasi-specular echoes.

TI A simple yet robust framework to estimate accurate daily mean land

AB Remotely sensed and accurate daily mean land surface temperature (T-dm) is valuable for various applications such as air temperature estimation and climate change monitoring. However, most traditional methods employed by the remote sensing community estimate T-dm by averaging the - usually few - observed cloud-free land surface temperatures (LSTs). Such estimates can have large sampling bias, especially for tandem polar orbiters, due to their sparse sampling of diurnal LST dynamics and the unavailability of under-cloud LSTs. To estimate accurate T-dm based on thermal observations from tandem polar orbiters, here we propose a simple yet robust framework that combines the annual temperature cycle (ATC) and the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models (termed the ADTC-based framework). The ATC model is used to reconstruct daily instantaneous undercloud LSTs, based on which the DTC model is employed to establish diurnally continuous LST dynamics for estimating T-dm. The proposed framework is validated with geostationary LST observations and in-situ thermal measurements under both cloud-free and overcast conditions. The validations show that, under cloud-free conditions, the ADTC-based framework is able to reduce the positive sampling bias obtained with simple averaging (> 2.0 K) and yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.5 K. Under overcast conditions, the ADTC-based framework yields MAEs of 1.0 K and 0.5 K at the daily and monthly scales, respectively. Furthermore, a contribution analysis indicates that the ATC model reduces the MAE from around 4.2 K to 2.0 K while the DTC model reduces the MAE from around 2.0 K to 1.0 K. Based on our validation results and tests performed with MODIS data, the presented simple yet robust ADTC-based framework is able to accurately estimate large-scale spatiotemporally continuous T-dm from thermal observations of tandem polar orbiters. Therefore, the ADTC-based framework is a potentially valuable tool for many related applications.

AB Around 350 million hectares of land are affected by wildfires every year influencing the health of ecosystems and leaving a trail of destruction. Accurate information over burned areas (BA) is essential for governments and communities to prioritize recovery actions. Prior research over the past decades has established the potentials and limitations of space-borne earth observation for mapping BA over large geographic areas at various scales. The operational deployment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 constellations significantly improved the quality and quantity of the imagery from the microwave (C-band) and optical regions on the spectrum. Based on that, this study set to investigate whether the existing coarse BA products can be further improved by the synergy of optical surface reflectance (SR), radar backscatter coefficient (BS), and/or radar interferometric coherence (COR) data with higher spatial resolutions. A Siamese Self-Attention (SSA) classification strategy is proposed for the multi-sensor BA mapping and a multi-source dataset is constructed at the object level for the training and testing. Results are analyzed by test sites, feature sources, and classification strategies to appraise the improvements achieved by the proposed method.

AB Crop type maps were created without the traditional need for in-season training data across the Corn Belt and Great Plains regions of the United States. This was accomplished through machine learning of historical land cover information, paired with a time-series of multi-spectral satellite imagery composites spanning the growing season, to develop rulesets, which were used for real-time prediction in the current year. Specifically, a decade's worth of annual 30 m resolution crop specific maps, known as the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), provided the foundation, and prior and current year's satellite imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2a and-2b built upon it. Four modeling scenarios, all using random forests, were performed to understand the crop mapping abilities of the datasets independently and combined. They were 1) use of CDLs only (i.e. prediction based solely on crop rotation history) 2) use of Landsat 7 and 8 bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance imagery only, 3) use of Sentinel-2a and-2b top-of-atmosphere imagery only, and 4) integration of the CDL, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 information together in a unified effort. Furthermore, the model runs were generated monthly, beginning in April, through the growing season to provide understanding of classification performance as a function of time. The 2020 crop year, relatively normal in terms of planting and weather, was used for the test. Accuracy statistics were generated by randomly sampling 50 counties and comparing those classification outputs to the actual 2020 CDL. Pixel-level results showed that prediction by midsummer using only the CDL information provided a crop type map with corn and soybean consumer and producer agreement above 70% and winter wheat just below 50%. The early season imagery-based classifications were markedly worse. However, as Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery accumulated through July, those classifications became significantly better than those reliant on the use of the CDL information only. Ultimately, the very best crop maps resulted from integrating the CDLs with a full season's worth of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. At that point in late September, the corn and soybean agreements were around 85% and winter wheat near 70%. All analysis was performed within Google Earth Engine cloud-based public imagery repository and high-performance computing system. The classification outputs provide practitioners with US crop type maps in near real-time.

AB As a significant forest disturbance factor, pine shoot beetles (PSB) have caused widespread tree mortality in Yunnan pine forests over southwestern China. Due to significant vertical heterogeneity of tree crowns, empirical remote sensing methods or one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer (RT) models are not qualified enough to accurately retrieve the damage level of PSB damage. Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) RT models which have the ability to describe vertically complex heterogeneous canopies are more suitable for the damaged forests. In this study, shoot dieback ratio (SDR) was used to parameterize the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model, in order to accurately estimate the PSB damage. Specifically, the vertically heterogeneous characteristics of the biophysical and optical properties within the canopy were carefully considered. First, we developed an approach to reconstruct damaged forest scenes through individual tree segmentation from UAVlidar data and in situ measurements. Second, the simulated reflectance of forest scenes was compared with the actual hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 (S2) reflectance data to evaluate the performance of the parameterized RAPID. Then, the parameterized RAPID model was used to create a look-up table (LUT) containing the leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), effective leaf area index (LAIe), SDR, and dead needles LAIe (LAIdead, LAIe x SDR) as well as the corresponding simulated canopy reflectance. Furthermore, tree allometric equations were used to regularize the LUT with the intention to improve the estimation accuracy. Good agreement (RMSE: 0.015-0.031, index of agreement: 0.97-0.99) was found between the simulated reflectance and the remote sensing observations. The retrieval accuracy of the biochemical and biophysical parameters using S2 data yielded R2 = 0.55 (normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 19%) for Cab, R2 = 0.70 (NRMSE = 15%) for the LAIe, R2 = 0.66 (NRMSE = 25%) for SDR, and R2 = 0.82 (NRMSE = 18%) for LAIdead. Using hyperspectral data with higher spatial and spectral resolution yielded better retrieval performance. This study demonstrated that 3D models (such as RAPID) have great potential to accurately invert SDR and LAIdead to assess PSB damage for the forests.

AB Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellitederived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The subpixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way.

AB Plant leaf water content plays a key role in several biogeochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production. Yet, the accurate estimation of leaf water content using multi-angular reflectance measurements across different plant species is still challenging. This study aims to propose a generic spectral index for accurately estimating equivalent water thickness (EWT) when multi-angular spectral reflection is considered. The index was selected to have the format of a difference ratio using three reflectance factors. The reflectance factor at 410 nm was used to reduce the specular reflection from the leaf surface in the 400-2500 nm range, and the ratio of the wavelengths in the 1268-1285 nm range (at non-water absorption wavelengths) to the wavelengths in the 1339-1346 nm range (at water absorption wavelengths) strengthened the relationship with EWT for all of the sampled plant species. The modified difference ratio (MDR) index, (R-1271-R-410)/(R-1342-R-410), was linearly proportional to EWT, with R-2 > 0.90, when the leaves reflection data were collected from various viewing angles. However, the relationships between some existing indices (simple difference, simple ratio, normalized difference, double difference index and difference ratio indices) and EWT at the leaf level were weak and unstable for all of the 18 plant species (including 14 broadleaf, 3 shrub, and 1 liana species) at different angles under laboratory and field conditions. Moreover, validation results from six independent datasets (n = 1800) and one modeled dataset (n = 2375) further confirmed that the algorithm derived from the proposed index (based on multi-angular reflectance factors of leaves) was not only effective for EWT estimation across a diverse set of plant species with widely variable leaf structure and water content, but also insensitive to different measurement conditions (leaf clip, integrating spheres or multi-angle measurements). The algorithm developed from this new index is generic, does not require reparameterization for each species, and can be accurately used for nondestructive EWT estimations using a simple handheld laboratory or field instrument, and thus, is convenient for agricultural and ecological studies.

AB Different InSAR algorithms and methods produce velocities and times series that are not identical, even using the same data for the same area. This inconsistency can cause confusion and be a barrier to uptake and widespread use of the data in the commercial sector. With the widespread availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data and a suite of new algorithms in the commercial and academic sectors, it is timely to develop a method for comparison of different results. In this study, we focus on developing and testing an independent and robust methodology for assessment of different InSAR processing results. Our proposed method is adapted from the Terrafirma Process Validation project; we compare geocoded line-of-sight velocities and time series, density and coverage, as well as some qualitative metrics. We use Sentinel-1 data from an area in Glasgow (UK) processed using 4 different approaches modified RapidSAR, SqueeSAR, GAMMA-IPTA and conventional StaMPS. The main areas of ground motion are detected using all approaches, with the average standard deviation of velocity differences for all inter comparison pairs in all polygons equal to 1.1 mm/yr. Sentinel-1 InSAR therefore provides comparable results that are independent of processing approaches. However, there are considerable differences in some aspects of the results, in particular in their density and coverage. We discuss the reasons for these differences and suggest a framework for validation that could be used in future national or pan-national ground motion services.

AB This study evaluated the possibility of studying mesoscale surface circulation in coastal areas, as is the Gulf of Cadiz, Spain, using high-resolution altimetry data (20-Hz of posting rate) along with the use of wind and bottom friction ageostrophic corrections. Absolute cross-track surface zonal current velocities, derived from filtered along-track CryoSat-2 SIRAL-SARM Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) measurements, are compared with high-frequency radar (HFR) data in the coastal area of the Gulf of Cadiz. The filter strategy followed in this study for the altimetry data is dependent on the HFR measurements for each track. Absolute surface geostrophic velocities obtained from 20-Hz altimetry data agree well HFR further than 25 km from the coast. Close to land ([3-25] km) the ageostrophic component of the surface current (due to the wind drag and the bottom friction) needs to be considered in the altimeter data. On average, the correlation between altimetry and HFR improved from 0.61 (no correction) to 0.72 (correcting these effects). The root mean square error (RMSE) lowered from 12.54 cm.s(-1) to 7.35 cm.s(-1). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that corrected altimeter measurements are useful for the study of dynamics and patterns of coastal areas.

AB Land-surface temperature retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has proven to be a valuable constraint in surface energy balance models for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). For optimal utility in agricultural water management applications, frequent thermal imaging (<4-day revisit) at sub-field (100 m or less) spatial resolution is desired. While, the current suite of Landsat satellites (7 and 8) provides the required spatial resolution, the 8-day combined revisit can be inadequate to capture rapid changes in surface moisture status or crop phenology, particularly in areas of persistent cloud cover. The new ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, with an average 4-day revisit interval and nominal 70-m resolution, provides a valuable research platform for augmenting Landsat TIR sampling and for investigating TIR-based ET mapping mission requirements more broadly. This study investigates the interoperability of Landsat and ECOSTRESS imaging for developing ET image timeseries with high spatial (30-m) and temporal (daily) resolution. A data fusion algorithm is used to fuse Landsat and ECOSTRESS ET retrievals at 30 m with daily 500-m retrievals using TIR data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over target agricultural sites spanning the United States.The added value of the combined multi-source dataset is quantified in comparison with daily flux tower observations collected within these target domains. In addition, we investigate ET model performance as a function of ECOSTRESS view angle, overpass time, and time separation between TIR and Landsat visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) data acquisitions used to generate land surface temperature, leaf area index, and albedo inputs to the surface energy balance model. The results demonstrate the value of the higher temporal sampling provided by ECOSTRESS, especially in areas that are frequently impacted by cloud cover. Limiting usage to ECOSTRESS scenes collected between 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p. m. and nadir viewing angles <20 degrees yielded daily (24-h) ET retrievals of comparable quality to the well-tested Landsat baseline. We also discuss challenges in using land-surface temperature from a thermal free-flyer system for ET retrieval, which may have ramifications for future TIR water-use mapping missions.

AB Different image pairs of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from tandem satellites (i.e. ERS2 and EnviSat) and sunglint optical images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) between December 2002 and May 2016 are investigated and used to estimate the propagation speed of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) in the Andaman Sea. 426 ISWs are identified during this period and are found to be concentrated in four regions of the Andaman Sea namely, (a) southeastern region near Sumatra, (b) central eastern region, (c) around Nicobar Islands, and (d) northern region. However, to estimate the phase speed of ISWs, 11 image pairs are found suitable, which captured 24 ISWs. Two methods, (i) Multiple Images Comparison (MIC), and (ii) Tidal Time Period (TTP) are used to estimate the phase speed of ISWs. The estimated phase speeds are well agreed with theoretical results derived from Sturm-Liouville equation using monthly climatology stratification data and local bathymetry. A maximum phase speed of 3.02 m/s was estimated at 3740 m depth in the western side of Nicobar Islands and minimum speed of 0.83 m/s at 100 min the southeastern region of the Andaman Sea. It is found that the ISW phase speed decreases as they propagate from deep to shallow water. From the analysis of monthly variation of ISW phase speed, we found higher phase speed in December and January than March in the southeastern region of the Andaman Sea, which is attributed to monthly variation of environmental parameters such as mixed layer depth (MLD), thermocline depth, etc. over the region. It is found that water depth and monthly stratification play a vital role in controlling the phase speed of the ISWs in the Andaman Sea.

AB Wetland is a very fragile ecosystem that provides important services to a large variety of flora and fauna species, as well as for humans. As wetland depends on water availability, protecting this important ecosystem requires careful hydrological monitoring. The Sentinel-1 mission, featuring a wide swath coverage, high temporal observations and open data policy, provides unprecedented opportunity for high spatiotemporal resolution water level change mapping over regional-wide wetland areas. In this study, we assess Sentinel-1 InSAR observations for routine water level change measurements over the entire south Florida Everglades wetlands. The study utilizes 91 Sentinel-1 images acquired over a three-year period (Sep 2016 to Nov 2019) and generates routine 12-days Interferograms and correspondingly 30 m spatial resolution water level change maps over the entire Everglades. The high spatial resolution interferograms detect hydrological signals induced by both naturaland human-induced flow, including tides, gate operations, and canal overflow; all these cannot be detected by terrestrial measurements. The large number of both InSAR and ground-based gauge observations allow us to quantify the overall accuracy of the Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements, which is 3.9 cm for the entire wetland area, but better for smaller hydrological units within the Everglades. Our study reveals that the tropospheric delay for individual interferograms can be very large, as much as 30 cm (similar to 10 fringes). When applying tropospheric corrections to all three years of Sentinel-1 InSAR observations, the overall accuracy level improved by 13% to 3.4 cm. Although our study is focused on the Everglades, its implications in term of the suitability of Sentinel-1 observations for space-based hydrological monitoring of wetlands and the derived accuracy level are applicable to other wetlands with similar vegetation types, located all over the world.

AB Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine, coastal ecosystems, and related studies. In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R-2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters.

AB A primary challenge in cloud detection is associated with highly mixed scenes that are filled with broken and thin clouds over inhomogeneous land. To tackle this challenge, we developed a new algorithm called the Random-Forest-based cloud mask (RFmask), which can improve the accuracy of cloud identification from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) images. For the development and validation of the algorithm, we first chose the stratified sampling method to pre-select cloudy and clear-sky pixels to form a prior-pixel database according to the land use cover around the world. Next, we select typical spectral channels and calculate spectral indices based on the spectral reflection characteristics of different land cover types using the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature. These are then used as inputs to the RF model for training and establishing a preliminary cloud detection model. Finally, the Super-pixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling (SEEDS) segmentation approach is applied to re-process the preliminary classification results in order to obtain the final cloud detection results. The RFmask detection results are evaluated against the globally distributed United States Geological Survey (USGS) cloud-cover assessment validation products. The average overall accuracy for RFmask cloud detection reaches 93.8% (Kappa coefficient = 0.77) with an omission error of 12.0% and a commission error of 7.4%. The RFmask algorithm is able to identify broken and thin clouds over both dark and bright surfaces. The new model generally outperforms other methods that are compared here, especially over these challenging scenes. The RFmask algorithm is not only accurate but also computationally efficient. It is potentially useful for a variety of applications in using Landsat data, especially for monitoring land cover and land-use changes.

AB Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration.
   Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access.
   The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users.
   The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach.
   We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.

AB A method to differentiate open water from sea ice using quad-polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is presented, based on the roughness properties of the sea surface scattering facets and the polarization ratio (PR) between VV and HH polarization backscatter from the SAR images. In quad-polarization SAR images, the normalized radar cross section (NRCS), which is linked to sea surface roughness, can be used to derive the orientation angle shift and its standard deviation, as well as to compute the measured polarization ratio, PR. An X-Bragg backscatter model is explored to calculate a theoretical look-up table for the polarization ratio as a function of incidence angle, dielectric constant, orientation angle shift and its standard deviation. Thus, ocean surface backscatter can be identified as open water or sea ice by comparing the measured PR with a theoretical model for PR. The proposed method is validated by comparison to collocated optical video images and manual visual interpretations. Estimates of the size, shape and locations of open water from our method are shown to be in good agreement with observed data. The overall accuracy of our algorithm is about 96%. The classification accuracy for sea ice and open water is about 96% and 94%, respectively.

AB The Skin Sea-Surface Temperature (SSTskin) derived from satellite measurements is one of the critical factors for determining ocean-atmosphere interactions in climate prediction and ocean research. Sentinel-3A is a European Earth Observation satellite mission developed to support ocean, land, and atmospheric applications. We compare three years of SSTskin from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board the Sentinel-3A satellite from July 2017-March 2019 with independent data from Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers (M-AERIs) deployed on research cruises. The comparison results show an average difference of - 0.098 K and Robust Standard Deviation of 0.296 K between SLSTR and M-AERI SSTskin values; the average value meets the pre-launch scientific objective of a mean accuracy < 0.1 K. Differences between four SSTskin retrieval algorithms have been investigated, the results show that the Dual-view 3 channels night time algorithm (D3) is better than other algorithms. This study involves determining the error and uncertainty characteristics of the SST retrievals in terms of factors that influence the accuracies of the satellite SSTs, and we hope this information will be useful to improve the SLSTR atmospheric correction algorithms.

AB Rapid climate change in Arctic regions is resulting in more frequent extreme climatic events. These can cause large-scale vegetation damage, and are therefore among key drivers of declines in biomass and productivity (or "browning") observed across Arctic regions in recent years.
   Extreme events which cause browning are driven by multiple interacting climatic variables, and are defined by their ecological impact - most commonly plant mortality. Quantifying the climatic causes of these multi-variate, ecologically defined events is challenging, and so existing work has typically determined the climatic causes of browning events on a case-by-case basis in a descriptive, unsystematic manner. While this has allowed development of important qualitative understanding of the mechanisms underlying extreme event driven browning, it cannot definitively link browning to specific climatic variables, or predict how changes in these variables will influence browning severity. It is therefore not yet possible to determine how extreme events will influence ecosystem responses to climate change across Arctic regions.
   To address this, novel, process-based climate metrics that can be used to quantify the conditions and interactions that drive the ecological responses defining common extreme events were developed using publicly available snow depth and air temperature data (two of the main climate variables implicated in browning). These process-based metrics explained up to 63% of variation in plot-level Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at sites within areas affected by extreme events across boreal and sub-Arctic Norway. This demonstrates potential to use simple metrics to assess the contribution of extreme events to changes in Arctic biomass and productivity at regional scales. In addition, scaling up these metrics across the Norwegian Arctic region resulted in significant correlations with remotely-sensed NDVI, and provided much-needed insights into how climatic variables interact to determine the severity of browning across Arctic regions.

AB There is limited research focusing on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands with large water level fluctuations. In this study, we investigated the potential of using C-band SAR data to characterize marsh wetland and monitor water level changes along the coast of the Great Lakes. InSAR analysis was conducted using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data collected at Long Point, Ontario, Canada over the period of 2016-2018. Observations indicated that both backscattering coefficients and coherence from tall plants (e.g. cattail/Phragmites), short plants (e.g. grass), and water varied with different sensor modes (incidence angles and polarizations) in response to changes in phenology, disturbance, and water level. InSAR phase changes were closely related to fluctuations in water level and flow direction. We evaluated InSAR time series observations using measurements from water level loggers based on correlation and root mean square error (RMSE). It was found that correlation between InSAR measurements and water level changes in the field varied depending on the site, type of wetland vegetation, incidence angle and polarization. Although results from some sensor modes provided good correlation at a few locations, the low fringe rate and RMSE between 9 and 28 cm indicated that InSAR observations of water level changes were generally underestimated.

AB The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and is called the "heart of the lower Mekong" due to its high aquatic biodiversity and is considered as one of the most productive freshwater ecosystems of the world. Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.

AB Multi-sensor remote sensing applications consistently gain importance, boosted by a growing number of freely available earth observation data, increasing computing capacity, and increasingly complex algorithms that need as temporally dense data as possible. Using data provided by different sensors can greatly improve the temporal resolution of time series, fill data gaps and thus improve the quality of land cover monitoring applications. However, multi-sensor approaches are often adversely affected by different spectral characteristics of the sensing instruments, leading to inconsistencies in downstream products. Spectral harmonization, i.e., the transformation of one sensor into the spectral domain of another sensor, may reduce these inconsistencies. It simplifies workflows, increases the reliability of subsequently derived multi-sensor products and may also enable the generation of new products that are not possible with the initial spectral definition. In this paper, we compare the effect of multivariate spectral harmonization techniques on the inter-sensor reflectance consistency and derived products such as spectral indices or land cover classifications. We simulated surface reflectance data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A from airborne hyperspectral data to eliminate any sources of error originating from unequal acquisition geometries, illumination or atmospheric state. We evaluate different methods based on linear, quadratic and random forest regression as well as linear interpolation, and predict not only matching but also unilaterally missing bands (red edge). We additionally consider material-dependent spectral characteristics in the harmonization process by using separate transformation functions for spectral clusters of the input dataset. Our results suggest that spectral harmonization is useful to improve multi-sensor consistency of remote sensing data and subsequently derived products, especially if multiple transformation functions are incorporated. There is a strong dependency between harmonization performance and the similarity of source and target sensor's spectral characteristics. For spectrally transforming Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2A, we achieved the lowest radiometric inter-sensor deviations with 50 spectral clusters and linear regression. Based on simulated data, deviations are below 1.7% reflectance within the red edge spectral region and below 0.3% reflectance for the remaining bands (RMSE). Regarding spectral indices, our results show a reduction of inter-sensor deviation (vegetation pixels only) to 38% of the initial error for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and to 43% for EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furthermore, we computed the REIP (Red Edge Inflection Point) with an accuracy of 3.1 nm from Sentinel-2 adapted Landsat-8 data. An exemplary multispectral classification use case revealed an increasing inter-sensor consistency of classification results from 92.3% to 97.3% mean error. Applied to time series of real Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we observed similar trends, albeit intermingled with non-sensor-induced inconsistencies.

AB The paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of using satellite data to determine the radiation budget NET and its components at the Baltic Sea surface in near real time using a newly established SBRB system (SatBaltyk Radiation Budget). The system enables determination of daily radiation fluxes over the entire Baltic Sea employing data from satellites in combination with data from numerical prognostic models. Data from satellite radiometers like SEVIRI, AVHRR are used together with algorithms that take into account the specificity of this sea and are developed based on large empirical data sets collected in this region. A verification of the system has been carried out based on separate, empirical data collected in 2015 on the oil rig Plat placed on the Baltic Sea and Svenska Hogarna station. The analysis showed that daily average NET had been calculated with RMSD of 15 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.95 for the South Baltic. For downward radiation fluxes in the solar wavelength range (SW) and the terrestrial, thermal wavelength range (LW) RMSD is respectively 11.9 Wm(-2) and 9.6 Wm(-2) and in both cases increase with latitude. The NET components estimated using SBRB were also compared with the corresponding magnitudes OSI -303-a and OSI 304-a from OSI SAF, EBAF surface Edition 4.0 from CERES and ERA-interim data from ECMWF systems. The main reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. The analyses confirmed the advisability of using local solutions which ensure high accuracy and spatial resolution.
   SBRB was developed and implemented as part of the comprehensive SatBaltyk System designed to monitor the Baltic Sea environment. The maps together with instantaneous values of the radiation components measured at actinometric stations employed at SatBaltyk System are accessible at www.satbaltyk.iopan.gda.pl. The scheme, algorithms and the way of the SBRB operation are described in detail.

AB Global, repeat satellite imagery serves as an essential tool to understand ecological patterns and processes over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Recently, the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp, a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics. In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series, we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors. This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery. Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended (15 year) time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor. We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure. These developments have led to a publicly available 34-year, seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across similar to 1500 km of California coastline.
   We then use this time series to examine the role of temporal and spatial scale on the detection of long-term biomass trends. We found that kelp canopy biomass trends are associated with trends in low frequency marine climate oscillations, like the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Long-term (similar to 20 year) increases in the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have led to a cooler, nutrient-rich environment that benefits the growth of giant kelp across a large portion of the kelp biomass time series, however recent warming events have led to weak, or nonexistent trends over the length of the time series. The cyclical nature of these low frequency marine climate oscillations complicates the detection of trends that may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. A longer and continuous time series is needed to analyze long-term canopy biomass trends outside of natural low frequency climate variability for giant kelp ecosystems along the coast of California, if we are to make accurate assessments of the impacts of climate change.

AB An ensemble of time series algorithms improves land change monitoring. The methodology combines the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC; Zhu & Woodcock, 2014) and Cumulative Sum of Residuals (CUSUM) algorithms for break detection and the Chow Test (Chow, 1960) for removing false positives (or breaks in time series not representing land change). The algorithms included are based on fundamentally different approaches to change detection and therefore offer unique advantages. The ensemble, or the combination of the three algorithms, was applied to 3 Landsat scenes in the United States and the results were assessed based on their ability to correctly discern structural breaks from stable time periods. The CUSUM test was shown to detect significant breaks 84.18% of the time and the Chow Test correctly removed breaks in 87.4% of the breaks analyzed. The ensemble produced results with lower frequency of errors of omission and commission (Type-I and Type-II errors) than a single algorithm approach. These results indicate that using a combination of break detection algorithms can be an improvement over typical approaches that utilize only one algorithm.

AB Tropical forest loss currently contributes 5 to 15% of anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The large uncertainty in emissions estimates is a consequence of many factors, including differences in definitions of forests and degradation, as well as estimation methodologies. However, a primary factor driving uncertainty is an inability to properly account for forest degradation. While remote sensing offers the only practical way of monitoring forest disturbances over large areas, and despite recent improvements in data quality and quantity and processing techniques, remote sensing approaches are still limited in their ability to detect forest degradation. In this paper, a system is presented that uses time series of Landsat data and spectral mixture analysis to detect both degradation and deforestation in forested landscapes. The Landsat data are transformed into spectral endmember fractions and are used to calculate the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI; Souza et al., 2005). The spectrally unmixed data are used for disturbance monitoring and land cover classification via time series analysis. To assess the performance of the system, maps of deforestation and degradation were used to stratify the study area for collection of sample data to which unbiased estimators were applied to produce accuracy and area estimates of degradation and deforestation from 1990 to 2013. The approach extends previous research in spectral mixture analysis for identifying forest degradation to the temporal domain. The method was applied using the Google Earth Engine and tested in the Brazilian State of Rondonia. Degradation and deforestation were mapped with 88.0% and 93.3% User's Accuracy, and 68.1% and 85.3% Producer's Accuracy. Area estimates of degradation and deforestation were produced with margins of error of 13.9% and 5.3%, respectively, over the 24 year time period. These results indicate that for Rondonia a decreasing trend in deforestation after 2004 corresponds to an increase in degradation during the same time period.

AB Eutrophication and increasing prevalence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms among global inland water bodies is becoming a major concern and requires direct attention. The European Space Agency recently launched the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Sentinel 3 satellite. The success of the mission will depend on extensive validation efforts for the development of accurate and robust in-water algorithms. In this study, four full atmospheric correction methods are assessed over four inland water reservoirs in South Africa, along with a suite of red/NIR based semi-analytic and band difference models for chl-a estimation which were applied to both full and partial atmospherically corrected data. In addition, we tested a novel duplicate pixel correction method to account for duplicate pixels induced by high observation zenith angles. Radiometric errors associated with OLCI Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances over small water targets were also investigated by modeling in situ reflectance measurements to at-sensor radiances using MODTRAN. Of the four atmospheric corrections, the 6SV1 radiative transfer code showed the most promise for producing reasonable reflectances when compared to in-situ measurements. Empirically derived band difference models outperformed all other chl-a retrieval methods on both partially and fully corrected reflectances. The Maximum Peak Height (MPH) algorithm applied to Bottom of Rayleigh Reflectance (BRR) performed best overall (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE(%) = 99), while the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) performed best on atmospherically corrected data using 6SV1 (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE(%) = 107). Semi-analytic chl-a retrieval methods proved very successful when applied to in situ R-rs, however, are not reliable when applied to low quality reflectance data. The SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC), an adjacency correction applied in conjunction with the image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR) processor, did not improve retrieval results for these small water targets.

AB Antarctic coastal polynyas serve as crucially-important sea-ice "factories" and are (in certain cases) of global significance as sites of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation e.g., the Cape Darnley Polynya (CDP) in East Antarctica. As such, understanding change and variability in their behaviour, and the factors responsible, is a high priority in climate (change) science. One such important factor that is both poorly understood and quantified is their linkage with adjacent landfast sea ice (fast ice). Here, we present a first detailed analysis that identifies and quantifies key linkages between the dynamics/behaviour of the CDP and fast ice. By forming a barrier to the incursion of pack ice at the eastern boundary, fast ice immediately upstream of the CDP (associated with the distribution of grounded icebergs) plays a crucially-important role in the polynya formation, maintenance and variability. This satellite data-based study builds upon earlier conceptual work on polynya-fast ice feedback mechanisms in the Mertz Glacier region by showing that statistical estimation of the rates of sea ice production (and hence AABW formation) in the CDP is significantly improved through inclusion of two key fast-ice metrics, compared to use of atmospheric covariates alone. These two metrics are the meridional extent of fast ice upstream of the polynya and total fast ice area within the region of high sea ice production. The work highlights the importance of accurate representation of the coupled Antarctic coastal polynya-fast ice system in global climate models.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has proven valuable as a proxy of terrestrial ecosystem photosynthesis that can be used to study the impact of environmental limiting factors on terrestrial ecosystem productivity. In global drylands and croplands, soil moisture is often a primary limiting factor to plant growth. Here we use the SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and soil moisture (SM) retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites to study the soil moisture control on photosynthetic activity of global drylands and croplands. We primarily analyze the predawn SM control on daily peak photosynthetic activity using the morning SM observations from SMAP and the noon SIF observations from OCO-2. On global drylands (i.e., dry sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid zones) and majority of croplands, soil water content is typically low, moisture in the topsoil is critical for plant growth, and satellite-based SIF and SM observations are expected to have high retrieval accuracy. The SMAP SM retrievals show positive daily relationships with OCO-2 SIF for drylands and croplands of the tropics and Australia, where SM is expected to limit plant growth and concurrent data records are sufficient to make statistical inferences. Negative relationships between SIF and SM were observed in forested areas of mid-latitude dry subhumid zones with high average annual SM for which SIF showed a positive relationship with air temperature. The relationships between SM and SIF follow the expected spatial patterns, positive and stronger in drier and warmer regions whereas weaker and often negative in colder and wetter regions. We find strong evidence that the OCO-2 SIF is accurately capturing monthly SMAP SM dynamics particularly for regions with distinct seasonality of rainfall such as the Sub-Saharan North Africa, Indian subcontinent, and South African countries. These results indicate new opportunities for monitoring dryland and cropland productivity solely using satellite observed SIF and soil moisture data.

AB The biomass of the subtropical forests of China is an important component of the global carbon cycle. Recently, several above ground biomass (AGB) maps have been produced using a variety of approaches to assess the carbon stock of the subtropical forest in China. However, due to the lack of reliable ground observations and the limitations of AGB mapping methods at regional scales, estimates of the spatial distribution of AGB vary greatly, leading to large uncertainties in the carbon stock estimations. In this study, we produced a new 1-km spatial resolution AGB map by synthesizing an unprecedented number of ground AGB observations from published studies, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of ground observations, MODIS data, forest cover/gain/loss maps based on Landsat, GLAS forest canopy height, and climatic and terrain data. In addition, we validated our estimates using independent testing data and compared our estimates with three previous AGB maps. The results indicate that the total AGB stock in the subtropical forest of China is (266 +/- 9.1) x 10(6) Mg, with an average AGB of 123.2 Mg/ha. Based on sixteen explanatory variables, our ensemble mean model explains 75% of the variance in forest AGB, with an RMSE of 45.5 Mg/ha. Comparison using all observation data shows that our map has a significantly lower RMSE and bias than previous maps, where the RMSE and bias tended to vary with forest type. This study not only improved the accuracy of AGB estimation for the subtropical forests but also highlighted the importance of forest type for regional AGB estimation.

AB The spatial extent of northern peatlands remains highly uncertain in spite of rapidly developing satellite observation datasets. This is limiting progress in the understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes, such as the global carbon (C) cycle and climate feedback effects on C fluxes.
   In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of two new satellite datasets that enable regional scale mapping of peatland extent at high spatial resolution, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Arctic digital elevation model (ArcticDEM). Terrain indices and temporal features derived from these datasets provided input to Random Forest models for delineating four main land cover classes (forest, open upland, water and peatland) in an area in northern Sweden consisting of both lowland and mountainous terrain. The contribution of ArcticDEM to the classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those derived when a high quality LiDAR based DEM (LiDEM) was used as alternative model input.
   This study shows that multi-seasonal SAR alone can produce reasonable classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA; 81.6%), but also that it has limitations. The inclusion of terrain indices improved classification performance substantially. OA increased to 87.5% and 90.9% when terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM and LiDEM were included, respectively. The largest increase in accuracy was achieved for the peatland class, which suggests that terrain indices do have the ability to capture the features in the geographic context that aid the discrimination of peatland from other land cover classes.
   The relatively small difference in classification accuracy between LiDEM and ArcticDEM is encouraging since the latter provides circumpolar coverage. Thus, the combination of Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM presents opportunities for substantially improving regional estimates of peatland extent at high latitudes.

AB Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.

AB Optical identification and quantification of various marine-spilled oils play an important role in oil spill monitoring, assessment, and response. Through weathering processes, oil may become emulsified in two forms of oil water mixture: water in oil (WO) and oil in water (OW). These two forms of oil emulsion are significantly different in their volume concentration (oil/water ratio), physical properties (viscosity, density, thickness), and optical properties (spectral reflectance (R-u(lambda), sr(-1)), and spectral absorption (a(lambda), m(-1))). In this study, the optical properties of both types of oil emulsion, with different volumetric concentrations, are determined from carefully prepared oil emulsion samples, with the aim of helping to interpret optical remote sensing imagery. The concentrations of stable WO and OW emulsions range from 45% to 95% and from 0.025% to 3%, respectively. They exhibit different R-u spectral shapes in the near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths, with five "-CH" molecular bonds evident in the WO emulsion spectra. R-u (600-1400 nm) of OW emulsions increases with volume concentrations from 0% to 3.0%, but R-u (600-2400 nm) of the WO emulsions decreases with volume concentrations from 45% to 100%. On the other hand, for a fixed concentration (80%), R-u (600-2400 nm) of WO emulsions increases monotonically with thicknesses of up to similar to 0.4 mm, beyond which R-u (600-2400 nm) no longer increases with oil thickness. The difference between the R-u spectral shapes of OW and WO emulsions, as well as the statistical relationships between volume concentrations and R-u (NIR-SWIR) and between oil thickness and Ru (NIR-SWIR), provide the basis for developing optical models to classify oil emulsion types and for quantifying oil volume from remote sensing imagery. The potential of such an application is demonstrated using hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery collected over the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).

AB The land surface emissivity (LSE) in the MYD21 product contains the effects of viewing zenith angle. The influence of the angular variation of LSE on the surface upwelling longwave radiation (SULR) estimation is still unexplored at the satellite scale. We performed statistical analyses of MYD21 emissivity retrievals over different land surface types for three longwave bands centred around 8.55 pm (Band 29), 11 mu m (Band 31) and 12 pm (Band 32), respectively. A look-up table was generated to describe the angular variations for both single-band and broadband emissivities. The results showed that the angular variation of directional emissivity in Band 29 could reach up to 0.03, but was < 0.01 for Bands 31 and 32. The angular variation in broadband emissivity was intermediate to that for individual bands. In all cases, the directional emissivity was greatest and symmetric around nadir. By integrating the directional broadband emissivity, the influence of angular variation of the LSE on estimated SULR was quantified using simulation and measurements at seven stations from the US surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD). The difference between the directional and integrated hemispheric broadband emissivity was within 0.01. As a result, the influence of angular variation of LSE on the SULR estimation was modest. For the SURFRAD stations, the differences of root-mean-square error (RMSE) before and after considering the angular variation of LSE were generally < 1 W m(-2). We conclude that the angular variation of broadband emissivity is not pronounced because of the small linear weight for Band 29 in the calculation of broadband emissivity. Ignoring the anisotropy of emissivity does not introduce large errors in SULR estimation generally.

AB Cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) is an important parameter of liquid clouds and is crucial to understanding aerosol-cloud interactions. It couples boundary layer aerosol composition, size and concentration with cloud reflectivity. It affects cloud evolution, precipitation, radiative forcing, global climate and, through observation, can be used to partially monitor the first indirect effect.
   With its unique combination of multi-wavelength, multi-angle, total and polarized reflectance measurements, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) retrieves N-d with relatively few assumptions. The approach involves measuring cloud optical thickness, mean droplet extinction cross-section and cloud physical thickness. Polarimetric observations are capable of measuring the effective variance, or width, of the droplet size distribution. Estimating cloud geometrical thickness is also an important component of the polarimetric N-d retrieval, which is accomplished using polarimetric measurements in a water vapor absorption band to retrieve the amount of in-cloud water vapor and relating this to physical thickness. We highlight the unique abilities and quantify uncertainties of the polarimetric approach.
   We validate the approach using observational data from the North Atlantic and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). NAAMES targets specific phases in the seasonal phytoplankton lifecycle and ocean-atmosphere linkages. This study provides an excellent opportunity for the RSP to evaluate its approach of sensing N-d over a range of concentrations and cloud types with in situ measurements from a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The RSP and CDP, along with an array of other instruments, are flown on the NASA C-130 aircraft, which flies in situ and remote sensing legs in sequence.
   Cloud base heights retrieved by the RSP compare well with those derived in situ (R = 0.83) and by a cellometer aboard the R.V. Atlantis (R = 0.79). Comparing geometric mean values from 12 science flights throughout the NAAMES-1 and NAAMES-2 campaigns, we find a strong correlation between N-d retrieved by the RSP and CDP (R = 0.96). A linear least squares fit has a slope of 0.92 and an intercept of 0.3 cm(-3). Uncertainty in this comparison can be attributed to cloud 3D effects, nonlinear liquid water profiles, multilayered clouds, measurement uncertainty, variation in spatial and temporal sampling, and assumptions used within the method. Radiometric uncertainties of the RSP measurements lead to biases on derived optical thickness and cloud physical thickness, but these biases largely cancel out when deriving N-d for most conditions and geometries. We find that a polarimetric approach to sensing N-d is viable and the RSP is capable of accurately retrieving N-d for a variety of cloud types and meteorological conditions.

AB The dark spectrum fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution optical satellite imagery is adapted to Landsat and Sentinel-2 (L/S2), including an automated tiled processing of full scene imagery and an optional image based glint correction. The DSF uses multiple dark targets in the subscene to construct a "dark spectrum" which is used to estimate the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(pa)(th)) according to the best fitting aerosol model. This method is fully automated and can be used for full mission archive processing, as demonstrated here for a study region in the North Sea. The new approach overcomes common issues with the SWIR based exponential extrapolation approach (EXP). An evaluation of both methods is presented using L-w measurements from 19 sites in the AERONET-OC network over a 15 year period and 5 satellite sensors. Overall, the DSF performs better than the EXP, with a notable improvement in the blue spectral region. The tiled processing allows for a smooth rho(pa)(th) estimation for full and merged L/S2 scenes, over clear and turbid coastal waters, inland waters, and land. The DSF selects the most appropriate band automatically, i.e. the one giving the lowest atmospheric path reflectance, and hence largely avoids amplification of glint and adjacency effects in the atmospheric correction. After application of the DSF, sun glint reflectance can be estimated from the SWIR bands, and the application of a sun glint correction significantly improves data availability for these nadir viewing sensors. A consistent processing across sensors allows for the exploitation of the > 30 year L/S2 archive, including Landsat 5 imagery dating back to 1984. A practical application of the DSF and the L/S2 archive is presented, where the remotely sensed water turbidity from 5 satellites is compared with in situ measurements from a long-term (2000-present) monitoring station in the southern North Sea.

AB Global environmental changes are driving shifts in forest distribution across the globe with significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function. At the upper elevational limit of forest distribution, patterns of forest advance and stasis can be highly spatially variable. Reliable estimations of forest distribution shifts require assessments of forest change to account for variation in treeline advance across entire mountain ranges. Multispectral satellite remote sensing is well suited to this purpose and is particularly valuable in regions where the scope of field campaigns is restricted. However, there is little understanding of how much information about forest structure at the mountain treeline can be derived from multispectral remote sensing data. Here we combine field data from a structurally diverse treeline ecotone in the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, with data from four multispectral satellite sensors (GeoEye, SPOT-7, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) to identify spectral features that best explain variation in vegetation structure at the mountain treeline and the effect of sensor spatial resolution on the characterisation of structural variation. The green, red and short-wave infrared spectral bands and vegetation indices based on green and short-wave infrared bands offer the best characterisation of forest structure with R-2 values reported up to 0.723. There is very little quantitative difference in the ability of the sensors tested here to discriminate between discrete descriptors of vegetation structure (difference of R-MF(2) within 0.09). While Landsat-8 is less well suited to defining above-ground woody biomass (R-2 0.12-0.29 lower than the alternative sensors), there is little difference between the relationships defined for GeoEye, SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 data (difference in R-2 < 0.03). Discrete classifications are best suited to the identification of forest structures indicative of treeline advance or stasis, using a simplified class designation to separate areas of old growth forest, forest advance and grassland habitats. Consequently, our results present a major opportunity to improve quantification of forest range shifts across mountain systems and to estimate the impacts of forest advance on biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB Water composition in floodplains plays a key role in ecological processes and is affected by both local water sources and flooding from the main river. Despite local studies, still lacks a complete understanding on the relationship between hydrological processes and sediment distribution in the river-floodplain system of the Amazon basin. This paper presents the first mapping of the dynamics of suspended sediments in rivers and lakes (> 0.25 km(2)) of central Amazon, considering different water types. Previous studies have considered only white water rivers with high sediment concentration. This study also describes some river-lake systems in terms of their spatial-temporal pattern of sediments and water flows. Time series between 2003 and 2017 of red and infrared reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were temporally filtered to retrieve incomplete and low-quality data. These images were assessed as a proxy of the surface suspended sediments concentration; and maps of the spatial-temporal variation of sediments were created, such as the class frequency map. This map represents a 15-year frequency at which each pixel remains in one of the surface suspended sediments concentration classes: high, moderate, and low, with an overall accuracy of 71%. Our findings allowed to observe the variation of sediment concentration along the Solimoes-Amazonas River, such as, for instance, its increase from the confluence with the Tapajos River to the mouth. Some hydrological processes were also observed in lakes of the middle reach, such as overbank flow and resuspension of sediments in depression lakes. In some ria lakes, the main water source comes from local basin with the backwater promoting sediment input in these lakes during the low-water period. The maps produced by this study are available and useful for supporting biogeochemical studies.

AB The linear kernel-driven RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model was originally developed from the simplified scenarios of continuous and discrete vegetation canopies, and has been widely used to fit multiangle observations of vegetation-soil systems of the land surface in many fields. Although this model was not developed explicitly for snow surfaces, it can capture the geometric-optical effect caused by the shadowing of rugged or undulating snow surfaces. However, in this study, this model has been further developed to better characterize the scattering properties of snow surface, which can also exhibit strongly forward-scattering behavior. This study proposes a new snow kernel to characterize the reflectance anisotropy of pure snow based on the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model that assumes snow can be modeled as a semi-infinite, plane-parallel, weakly absorbing light scattering layer. This new snow kernel adopts a correction term with a free parameter a to correct the analytic form of the ART model that has been reported to underestimate observed snow reflectance in the forward scattering direction in the principal plane (PP), particularly in cases of a large viewing zenith angle (> 60 degrees). This snow kernel has now been implemented in the kernel-driven RTLSR BRDF model framework in conjunction with two additional kernels (i.e., the volumetric scattering kernel and geometric-optical scattering kernel) and is validated using observed and simulated multiangle data from three data sources. Pure snow targets were selected from the extensive archive of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) BRDF data. Antarctic snow field measurements, which were taken from the top of a 32-m-tall tower at Dome C Station and include 6336 spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs), were also utilized. Finally, a set of simulated BRFs, generated by a hybrid scattering snow model that combines the geometric optics with vector radiative transfer theory, were used to further assess the proposed method. We first retrieve the value of the free parameter a for a comprehensive analysis using single multiangle snow data with a sufficient BRDF sampling. Then, we determine the optimally fixed value of the a parameter as prior information for potential users. The new snow kernel method is shown to be quite accurate, presenting a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = similar to 0.9) and a negligible bias between the modeled BRFs and the various snow BRDF validation data. The finding demonstrates that this snow kernel provides an improved potential compared to that of the original kernel-driven model framework for a pure snow surface in many applications, particularly those involving the global water cycle and radiation budget, where snow cover plays an important role.

AB Urban morphology and aerodynamic roughness parameters are derived from three global digital elevation models (GDEM): Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and TanDEM-X. Initially, each is compared to benchmark elevation data in London (UK). A moving window is used to extract ground heights from the GDEMs, generating terrain models with root mean -square accuracy of up to 3 m. Subtraction of the ground heights extracted from each GDEM provides roughness-element heights only, allowing for calculation of morphology parameters. The parameters are calculated for eight directional sectors of 1 km grid-squares. Apparent merging of roughness elements in all GDEMs causes height-based parameter underestimation, whilst plan and frontal areas are over- and under-estimated, respectively. Combined, these lead to an underestimation of morphometrically-derived aerodynamic roughness parameters. Parameter errors are least for the TanDEM-X data. Further comparison in five cities (Auckland, Greater London, New York, Sao Paulo, Tokyo) provides basis for empirical corrections to TanDEM-X-derived geometric parameters. These reduce the error in parameters across the cities and for a separate location. Meteorological observations in central London give insight to wind-speed estimation accuracy using roughness parameters from the different elevation databases. The proposed corrections to TanDEM-X parameters lead to improved wind-speed estimates, which combined with the improved spatial representation of parameters across cities demonstrates their potential for use in future studies.

AB The Landsat archive presents a unique source for mapping and monitoring of shrublands. Still, efficient and accurate mapping approaches are needed that provide shrub cover fraction estimates over space and time. The spectral signal of shrubs is composed of green vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation as well as varying fractions of soil, grass, and shadow, which makes a direct mapping of fraction cover challenging. In this study, we mapped 32 years of shrub cover fractions from annual Landsat best observation composites covering a rockrose (genus Cistus) ecosystem in the Baixo Alentejo region of southern Portugal. Fraction mapping was based on a multi-year support vector regression model trained with synthetically mixed data from a multi-annual image spectral library. Resulting fractions maps were validated using reference information derived from high-resolution satellite imagery available for 10 out of 32 years. Fraction maps reproduced the spatial-temporal patterns of shrub cover in the study region very well, with an average mean absolute error over all validation years of 13.7%. For individual validation years, mean absolute errors ranged from 7.7% to 17.1%. Our consistent modeling framework led to a reliable annual shrub cover fraction time-series, which allowed identifying areas of stable shrub cover and areas with different types and intensities of change. Such long-term shrub cover fraction monitoring is of great value for land use assessments and contributes to a thorough understanding and management of Earth's arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

AB Although in most circumstances, sea wave slope probability density function (PDF) is expressed as Gaussian distribution, there is evidence that it follows quasi-Gaussian distribution, which can be represented by Gram-Charlier series to fourth order. All the statistical parameters of slope PDF have previously been derived by using optical methods in specular conditions, and values and relationships with surface parameters have been presented in the literature. However they may not be relevant at microwave wavelengths due to diffraction effects. Up to now, sea surface slope PDF consistent with ocean microwave remote sensing is not known yet. So it is important to establish the parameter models of quasi-Gaussian slope PDF compatible with radar application. In this paper, based on the backscattering coefficients from the Ku-band space-borne radar Precipitation Radar (PR) data, all the parameters of the quasi-Gaussian slope PDF are inverted using a so-called "GO4" (Boisot et al., 2015) model with a two-dimensional (2-D) non-linear least square fit on the backscattering coefficients. We also establish the empirical formulae relating the statistical parameters of the quasi-Gaussian sea slope PDF with wind speed, which may be used for ocean Ku-band radar application.
   The proposed empirical formulae are compared to the Cox and Munk (1954) - CM slope parameter model: the results confirm that the slope variance in upwind and crosswind directions as well as the skewness coefficients exhibit intermediate values between the CM slope parameters of clean surface and slick surface cases. The coefficients of peakedness are just in the range of the CM slope peakedness parameter values.
   The impacts of wave conditions (swell or wind sea) on slope PDF parameters are also studied. The results show that in most wind speed conditions, the presence of swell increases the skewness coefficients, while it decreases the peakedness coefficients.

AB Peatlands cover very large extents in northern regions and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by functioning as a carbon sink. Large-scale satellite based monitoring systems, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), are necessary to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems respond to climate change by providing verifiable land products. For instance, satellite-based land product validation approaches can benefit from airborne hyperspectral imagery and in-situ data, which provide higher spatial and spectral resolution baselines, ideal for measuring vegetation changes (e.g. phenology, LAI) at local scales. Here, we assessed the short-term phenospectral dynamics (spectral changes indicated by specific spectral features as a function of phenology) of five ombrotrophic peatland vegetation physiognomies over four dates at the Mer Bleue bog in Canada. We took advantage of a unique remote sensing data acquisition campaign aiming to validate Sentinel-2A land products, and analyzed three spatially and spectrally distinctive datasets (i.e. field spectra, VISNIR airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Sentinel-2A imagery) over the first half of the 2016 growing season. By implementing a bottom-up approach, first we assessed the airborne HSI's capability to detect phenological changes as compared to in-situ acquired field spectroscopy measurements in a 10 ha area at Mer Bleue and evaluated the spectral features characteristic of these phenological changes. Second, over the entire Mer Bleue area (28,000 ha), we compared a series of four Sentinel-2A images to four airborne HSI mosaics (spatially and spectrally resampled to Sentinel-2A) to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A for detecting small spectral variations due to phenological changes (i.e. greening). In addition, for this second comparison, three spectral vegetation indices were derived from the Sentinel-2A images and the airborne HSI mosaics. The spectral comparisons between the airborne HSI and the field spectroscopy data revealed clear phenological changes from the airborne HSI. For instance, a closer agreement between reflectance measured by the field spectrometer and the airborne HSI spectral response was found in the visible region (450-680 nm). A greater difference however, was consistently seen in the near-infrared region (681-866 nm) across the four dates. Narrow spectral features in three regions of the visible range (global minima, red absorption, green peak), indicating changes in vegetation colour, were consistent for both datasets and with expected phenological patterns at Mer Bleue. At the landscape level, Sentinel-2A mirrored the spectral changes depicted by the resampled HSI data. However, band level, pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in reflectance for each band, with Sentinel-2A exhibiting higher reflectance values than the HSI for the first three dates. Only for the last date (June 23rd) did the airborne HSI have higher reflectance values or no significant difference with the Sentinel-2A data. Overall, our three datasets captured the short-term phenological changes at Mer Bleue and have provided promising results in terms of using the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor to monitor these changes at the landscape level.

AB Urban land use information is essential for a variety of urban-related applications such as urban planning and regional administration. The extraction of urban land use from very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remotely sensed imagery has, therefore, drawn much attention in the remote sensing community. Nevertheless, classifying urban land use from VFSR images remains a challenging task, due to the extreme difficulties in differentiating complex spatial patterns to derive high-level semantic labels. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great potential to extract high-level spatial features, thanks to its hierarchical nature with multiple levels of abstraction. However, blurred object boundaries and geometric distortion, as well as huge computational redundancy, severely restrict the potential application of CNN for the classification of urban land use. In this paper, a novel object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) is proposed for urban land use classification using VFSR images. Rather than Pixel-wise convolutional processes, the OCNN relies on segmented objects as its functional units, and CNN networks are used to analyse and label objects such as to partition within-object and between-object variation. Two CNN networks with different model structures and window sizes are developed to predict linearly shaped objects (e.g. Highway, Canal) and general (other non-linearly shaped) objects. Then a rule-based decision fusion is performed to integrate the class-specific classification results. The effectiveness of the proposed OCNN method was tested on aerial photography of two large urban scenes in Southampton and Manchester in Great Britain. The OCNN combined with large and small window sizes achieved excellent classification accuracy and computational efficiency, consistently outperforming its sub-modules, as well as other benchmark comparators, including the Pixel-wise CNN, contextual-based MRF and object-based OBIA-SVM methods. The proposed method provides the first object-based CNN framework to effectively and efficiently address the complicated problem of urban land use classification from VFSR images.

   APPORTIONMENT
AB Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations due to its spatially continuous observation. However, the coarse spatial resolutions (e.g., 3 km, 6 km, or 10 km) of the primary satellite AOD products have weakness to capture the characteristics of urban-scale PM2.5 patterns. Moreover, high-resolution (e.g., 1 km) PM2.5 estimations are still unable to be related to the urban landscape or to small geographical units, which is crucial for analyzing the urban pollution structure. In this study, the daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using the new AOD data with a 160 m spatial resolution retrieved by the Gaofen-1 (GF) wide field of view (WFV) along with the nested linear mixed effects model and ancillary variables from the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) meteorological simulation data. The experiment was conducted in Wuhan, Beijing, and Shanghai, which suffers from severe atmospheric fine particle pollution in recent years. The proposed model performed well for both GF and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with slight over-fitting and little spatial autocorrelation. Regarding to the GF PM2.5 estimation, model fitting yielded R-2 values of 0.96, 0.91 and 0.95 and mean prediction error (MPE) of 10.13, 11.89 and 7.34 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The site-based cross validation achieved R-2 values of 0.92, 0.88 and 0.89, and MPE of 13.69, 16.76 and 12.59 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The day-of-years based cross validation resulted in R-2 of 0.54, 0.58 and 0.50, and MPE of 30.46, 27.12 and 31.58 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that it was practicable to estimate the GF PM2.5 in the days without enough AOD-PM2.5 matchups. The ultrahigh resolution PM2.5 estimations offer substantial advantages for providing finer spatially resolved PM2.5 trends. Additionally, it offers new approaches to locate main PM2.5 emission sources, evaluate the local PM2.5 contribution proportion, and quantify the daily PM2.5 emission level via remote sensing techniques. Along with the joint observations via other high-resolution satellites, the temporal resolution of GF PM(2.5)will be further improved. In all, this study not only provides possibilities for further applications in the precise analysis of urban inner PM2.5 pollution patterns but also establishes a foundation for constructing a high-resolution satellite air monitoring network in China.

AB A novel approach to characterize the physiological conditions of plants from hyperspectral remote sensing data through the numerical inversion of a light version of the SCOPE model is proposed. The combined retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) was investigated exploiting high resolution spectral measurements in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. First, the retrieval scheme was evaluated against a synthetic dataset. Then, it was applied to very high resolution (sub-nanometer) canopy level spectral measurements collected over a lawn treated with different doses of a herbicide (Chlorotoluron) known to instantaneously inhibit both Photochemical and Non-Photochemical Quenching (PQ and NPQ, respectively). For the first time the full spectrum of canopy F, the fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)), as well as the main vegetation parameters that control light absorption and reabsorption, were retrieved concurrently using canopy-level high resolution apparent reflectance (rho*) spectra. The effects of pigment content, leaf/canopy structural properties and physiology were effectively discriminated. Their combined observation over time led to the recognition of dynamic patterns of stress adaptation and stress recovery. As a reference, F values obtained with the model inversion were compared to those retrieved with state of the art Spectral Fitting Methods (SFM) and SpecFit retrieval algorithms applied on field data. Phi(F) retrieved from rho* was eventually compared with an independent biophysical model of photosynthesis and fluorescence. These results foster the use of repeated hyperspectral remote sensing observations together with radiative transfer and biochemical models for plant status monitoring.

AB Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone.
   We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m(-2) h(-1)) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, chi = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = -17.6, chi = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below.

TI Hierarchical Bayesian space-time estimation of monthly maximum and

AB Surface air temperature (SAT) is a critical metric that is used to assess regional warming and cooling patterns, and maximum and minimum SATs are required to evaluate the model predictions of climate extremes. Since station SAT data are irregularly distributed, land surface temperature (LST) values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to estimate regional SAT by using linear regression methods. The deviations between SAT and LST are largely dependent on space and time, which hampers the estimation of linear regression, especially for the maximum SAT. To obtain accurate regional SAT estimates, a three-stage hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model is proposed that incorporates the MODIS LSTs as model covariates and specifies the deviations with structured dependence of MODIS LST fields. Sampling of model parameters and estimation of SAT values are implemented under the Bayesian paradigm using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Sensitivity analyses involving various model configurations and running processes are discussed to help build a robust HB model. The model's performance is evaluated using station measurements that are not used in the modeling process, with RMSEs of 2.15 K (0.75%) and 1.97 K (0.73%) for monthly maximum and minimum SATs, respectively. The evaluation indicates that HB modeling is an effective method to estimate SAT from MODIS LST. The verified HB model with the covariate inputs of both MODIS daytime and nighttime LSTs is used to reproduce monthly maximum and minimum SATs that are spatially continuous over the Qinghai province in Northwestern China for 2003-2011. From the comparison between MODIS LST and HB-estimated SAT, it is found that the spatial structure and warming patterns of LST and SAT show significant distinctions, implying that they cannot be substituted for one another when assessing the regional warming trends. The spatial heterogeneity of HB model estimation is able to provide thorough insights into regional SAT status changes that could otherwise be biased by station deployment.

AB Natural wetlands are the largest source of methane emissions, contributing 20-40% of global emissions and dominating the inter-annual variability. Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change.
   This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1-34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle.
   We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Parana River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Parana River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Nino Southern Oscillation activity.
   We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3-11.8 Tg yr(-1)) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Parana regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions.

AB Using a combination of Landsat, Pleiades and CORONA satellite imagery from 1967 to 2017, we map changes in the terminus position, ice surface velocity and surface elevation of Sabche Glacier, and report the first observations of surging behaviour in central Nepal. Our observations show that Sabche Glacier surged four times over the last 50 years. The three most recent surges occurred at 10 to 11-year cycles, which is one of the shortest surge cycles ever recorded. Detailed analysis of the most recent surge (2012 onwards), indicates that the glacier advanced 2.2 km and experienced maximum velocities of 1.6 +/- 0.10 m day(-1). During this surge, there was a surface elevation gain at the terminus of up to 90 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), with a corresponding surface lowering of between 10 +/- 6.19 and 60 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), 3 km up-glacier of the terminus. This transfer of mass amounted to a volume of similar to 2.7 x 10(7) +/- 0.1 x 10(7) m(3)a(-1). Sabche Glacier is the first surge-type glacier to be observed in the central Himalayas, but this is consistent with a previous global analysis which indicates that surge-type glaciers should exist in the region. We hypothesise that the surge is at least partially controlled by subglacial topography, whereby a major subglacial overdeepening and constriction 3 km up-glacier of the terminus provides resistance to glacier flow from the accumulation area to the ablation area. This overdeepening appears to store mass until a threshold is crossed, after which the glacier flows out of the subglacial depression and rapidly surges over a bedrock lip and down the valley. Thus, whilst the surges are likely to be facilitated by subglacial processes (e.g. changes in subglacial hydrology and/or basal thermal regime), the topographic setting of the glacier appears to be modulating both the timing and duration of each surge.

AB Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are flexible observation platforms suitable to cover inaccessible areas on demand. Accordingly, huge attention is deserved towards development of miniaturized sensing technologies compliant with UAV payload constrains and capable of providing high-resolution images of the region under test. As a contribution to this topic, the paper presents a prototype UAV system for radar imaging made by a commercial micro-UAV equipped with a miniaturized low power radar, whose imaging capabilities are enhanced by a properly designed data processing strategy. Such a strategy involves a processing step performed in time domain, which accounts for a procedure devoted to compensate flight altitude variation and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based noise filtering approach. After, the focused images of the surveyed scenario are obtained by using a microwave tomographic approach, which integrates data about UAV position and faces the imaging as a linear inverse scattering problem. A feasibility experiment, carried out to test the operational mode of the assembled system, is presented. The obtained results corroborate that the integration of GPS and flight altitude information into the microwave tomography approach allows valuable radar imaging capabilities in terms of target localization accuracy.

AB Sea surface concentrations of [nitrite + nitrate], [N + N], have been assessed successfully by remote sensing in the open oceans by utilizing its relationship to sea surface temperature (SST). A similar approach was not met with similar success in the river-influenced shelf waters in the northern South China Sea Shelf-sea (NoSoCS) where riverine inputs, in which the relationship between the concentration of [N + N] and SST was not straight forward, are significant. By considering river-influenced shelf waters as a mixture of open ocean water and riverine inputs and then combining SST with the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) at 412 nm, ag(412), which serves as an indicator of the riverine influence, an algorithm has been developed for remotely sensing the surface concentration of [N + N] in the NoSoCS. This satellite-derived concentration of [N + N] was validated by direct observations. In 16 match-up comparisons within a time window of +/- 24 h and concentrations of [N + N] ranging between 0.2 and 74 mu M, the uncertainty was +/- 40%. The climatological distributions of the derived concentration of [N + N] in the NoSoCS and surrounding waters between 2002 and 2014 are consistent with the reported distributions based on ship-board observations. Thus, as a result of riverine inputs, the concentration of [N + N] generally increases towards the coasts, varying by more than two orders of magnitude from about 0.5 mu M and near zero in the open northern South China Sea (NSCS) in January and July respectively to about 50 and 100 mu M at the mouth of the Pearl River. In the open NSCS where nutrient availability is controlled primarily by the enhanced winter convective overturn, the intraannual variations in the concentration of [N + N] follow a distinct seasonal cycle, reaching a minimum close to zero in the summer and a maximum, 0.7 mu M, in the winter. In the NoSoCS, as a result of the high riverine input of nutrients in the summer, in addition to the maximum in the winter, there is a secondary summer maximum, which becomes increasingly prominent towards the coast. This work represents a first attempt to characterize the distributions of the surface concentration of [N + N] in river-influenced shelf-seas from space. With appropriate regional tuning, a similar approach may be applicable to other river-influenced shelf-seas such as the Texas-Louisiana Shelf.

AB Satellite optical and thermal infrared (TIR) spectra are linked to vegetation properties and, therefore, carry valuable information needed for estimating vegetation functioning as expressed in canopy photosynthesis [gross primary production (GPP)] and evapotranspiration (ET). The joint effort is required to fully exploit this satellite spectral information and to demonstrate its capability to reveal ecosystem functioning in various environmental conditions. We investigated the relationship between Landsat (TM5 and ETM7) optical/thermal data and canopy daily functioning of annual C3 grasses at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) during a prolonged drought episode. By using the 'Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes' (SCOPE) model, reference GPP and ET were simulated via locally measured weather data, and then actual GPP and ET were simulated twice: first using the vegetation properties retrieved only from the optical bands, and second using information from both the optical and thermal bands. The outputs of last two simulations were compared to flux tower measurements. For the first simulation, we used the MODTRAN atmospheric model and the optical radiative transfer (RT) routine in SCOPE, RTMo, to perform atmospheric correction and retrieve vegetation properties [notably Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), leaf water content (C-w), leaf dry matter content (C-dm,), the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF) and the senescent material content (C-s] by model inversion through optimization. We used the optical bands of 20 Landsat images covering the period from January to August 2004. The model inversion performance was assessed by R-2 (0.86) and RMSE (0.13) between the retrieved and ground-measured LAI. All the retrieved vegetation properties were linearly interpolated over time and were used, together with locally measured weather variables, to simulate GPP and ET at half-hourly time steps with SCOPE. For the second simulation, we additionally used TIR information to retrieve the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance parameter (m) and soil surface and boundary resistances (r(ss) and r(bs),) by inversion of the energy balance and thermal radiative transfer routines of SCOPE, RTMt, through separate look-up tables. The comparison between simulations and measurements shows that most drought effects on ET, GPP and transpiration are "visible" in the Landsat optical bands. However, the accurate simulation of soil evaporation requires TIR information. The results from this study indicate that the integration of optical and TIR information has a great potential to capture the drought effects on the grass canopy in terms of reductions in daily GPP and ET.

AB Accurate classification of plant functional types (PFTs) reduces the uncertainty in global biomass and carbon estimates. Airborne small-footprint waveform lidar data are increasingly used for vegetation classification and above-ground carbon estimates at a range of spatial scales in woody or homogeneous grass and savanna ecosystems. However, a gap remains in understanding how waveform features represent and ultimately can be used to constrain the PFTs in heterogeneous semi-arid ecosystems. This study evaluates lidar waveform features and classification performance of six major PFTs, including shrubs and trees, along with bare ground in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA. Waveform lidar data were obtained with the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). From these data we derived waveform features at two spatial scales (1 m and 10 m rasters) by applying a Gaussian decomposition and a frequency-domain deconvolution. An ensemble random forest algorithm was used to assess classification performance and to select the most important waveform features. Classification models developed with the 10 m waveform features outperformed those at 1 m (Kappa (kappa) = 0.81-0.86 vs. 0.60-0.70, respectively). At 1 m resolution, lidar height features improved the PFT classification accuracy by 10% compared to the analysis without these features. However, at 10 m resolution, the inclusion of lidar derived heights with other waveform features decreased the PFT classification performance by 4%. Pulse width, rise time, percent energy, differential target cross section, and radiometrically calibrated backscatter coefficient were the most important waveform features at both spatial scales. A significant finding is that bare ground was clearly differentiated from shrubs using pulse width. Though the overall accuracy ranges between 0.72 and 0.89 across spatial scales, the two shrub PFTs showed 0.45-0.87 individual classification success at 1 m, while bare ground and tree PFTs showed high (0.72-1.0) classification accuracy at 10 m. We conclude that small-footprint waveform features can be used to characterize the heterogeneous vegetation in this and similar semi-arid ecosystems at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, waveform features such as pulse width can be used to constrain the uncertainty of terrain modeling in environments where vegetation and bare ground lidar returns are close in time and space. The dependency on spatial resolution plays a critical role in classification performance in tree-shrub co-dominant ecosystems.

AB Utility of data from autonomous profiling floats for the validation of satellite ocean colour products from current satellite ocean colour sensors was assessed using radiometric and chlorophyll a fluorescence data from bio-geochemical profiling floats (BGC-Argo) deployed in the subtropical gyre of the Indian Ocean. One of the floats was equipped with downward irradiance and upwelling radiance sensors, allowing the remote sensing reflectance, R-rs, to be determined. Comparisons between satellite and in situ R-rs, indicated good agreement for the shorter wavelengths, but weak relationships for both satellites for the 555 nm channel, and showed that radiometers deployed on multipurpose, off-the-shelf BGC-Argo floats can provide validation-quality measurements. About 300 chlorophyll a concentration match-ups were achieved within 18 months, which increased the number of validation data points available for the Indian Ocean as a whole by a factor of similar to 4 from the previous historical record. Generally, the satellite data agreed with the float-derived chlorophyll concentration within the uncertainty of +/- 35%, for the band-difference (OCI) and band-ratio (OC3) algorithms, but not for a semi analytical ocean colour model (GSM) that exhibited significantly higher chlorophyll values (> 100% mean difference). Our results indicate that autonomous float-based measurements provide substantial potential for improving regional validation of satellite ocean colour products in remote areas.

AB This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.

AB Savannahs and woodlands are among the most important biomes in Africa: they cover half of sub-Saharan Africa, provide vital ecosystem services to the rural communities, and play a major part in the carbon budget. Despite their importance and their fragility, they are much less studied than other ecosystems like rainforests. In particular, the distribution and amount of the above-ground woody biomass (AGB) is largely unknown. In this paper, we produce the first continental map of the AGB of African savannahs and woodlands at a resolution of 25 m. The map is built from the 2010 L-band PALSAR mosaic produced by JAXA, along the following steps: a) stratification into wet/dry season areas in order to account for seasonal effects, b) development of a direct model relating the PALSAR backscatter to AGB, with the help of in situ and ancillary data, c) Bayesian inversion of the direct model. A value of AGB and its uncertainty has been assigned to each pixel. This approach allows estimating AGB until 85 Mg.ha(-1) approximately, while dense forests and non-vegetated areas are masked out using the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset. The resulting map is visually compared with existing AGB maps and is validated using a cross-validation approach and a comparison with AGB estimates obtained from LiDAR datasets, leading to an RMSD of 8 to 17 Mg.ha(-1). Finally, carbon stocks for savannahs in Africa and in 50 countries are estimated and compared with estimates by FAO and from AGB maps available over Africa.

AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proposed the launch of a new space-borne sensor called HyspIRI (Hyperspectral and Infrared Imager) which will cover the spectral range from 0.4-12 mu m. Two instruments will be mounted on HyspIRl platform: 1) a hyperspectral instrument which can sense earth surface between 0.4 and 2.5 pm at 10 nm intervals and 2) a multispectral infrared sensor will acquire images between 3 and 12 pm in eight spectral bands (one in Mid infrared (MIR) and seven in Thermal Infrared (TIR)). The TIR spectral wavebands will be positioned based on their importance in various applications. This study aimed to identify HyspIRI optimal TIR wavebands position for earth compositional mapping. A Genetic Algorithm coupled with the Spectral Angle Mapper (GA-SAM) was used as a spectral bands selector. High dimensional HyTES (Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer) emissivity spectra comprised of 202 spectral bands of Cuprite and Death Valley regions were used to select meaningful subsets of bands for earth compositional mapping. The GA-SAM was trained for fifteen mineral classes and the algorithms were run iteratively 50 times. High calibration ( > 95%) and validation ( > 90%) accuracies were achieved with a limited number (seven) of spectral bands selected by GA-SAM. The knowledge of important band positions will help the scientists of the HyspIRI group to place spectral bands in regions where accuracies of earth compositional mapping can be enhanced.

TI Understanding land subsidence in salt marshes of the Venice Lagoon from

AB The existence of salt marshes and tidal morphologies is strictly connected to their elevation with respect to the mean sea level. Quantifying land subsidence of these high-valued transitional environments is therefore crucial to investigate their long-term possible survival, also in view of the expected climate changes. However, monitoring with a certain accuracy their movements has been challenging until now due to the peculiar features of these morphological forms: they are difficult to access, made of largely unconsolidated deposits, without anthropogenic structures, relatively far from anthropogenic facilities, and become submerged by the sea water twice a day. For these reasons, they have never be linked to traditional levelling and GPS networks, and also standard Interferometric SAR applications returned very poor results in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. An advanced Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique on a 5-year long stack of X-bandwidth SAR acquisitions of the Venice Lagoon is here presented. The regularity of the acquisitions, the short satellite revisiting time (11 days), the high image resolution (similar to 3 x 3 m), and the strategies used in the PSI application have allowed us to detect thousands of measurable persistent targets (PTs) in the Venice Lagoon salt marshes. The measured displacements range from small uplifts to subsidence rates of more than 20 mm/yr. The analyses of the observed displacements point out that land subsidence is much larger on man-made than natural salt marshes, with a significant negative correlation with the marsh age. In addition, land subsidence with the presence of halophytic vegetation species is generally smaller than on unvegetated marshes. Finally, at a few selected sites, the integration of the PSI outcome with local ground-based measurements, such as multi-depth benchmarks, feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables, has allowed quantifying the displacement variability versus depth and therefore developing a first conceptual model of the salt marsh consolidation and accretion processes.

AB This paper presents detailed elevation and volume analysis of 16 individual glaciers, grouped at four locations, spread across the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). The study makes use of newly available WorldView-2 satellite stereo imagery to exploit the previously untapped value of archival stereo aerial photography. High resolution photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) are derived to determine three-dimensional glacier change over an unprecedented time span of six decades with an unparalleled mean areal coverage of 82% per glacier. The use of an in-house robust surface matching algorithm ensured rigorous alignment of the DEMs to overcome inherent problems associated with processing archival photography, most notably the identification and correction of scale error in some datasets. The analysis provides insight into one of the most challenging and data-scarce areas on the planet by expanding the spatial extent north of the AP to include previously un-studied glaciers located in the South Shetland Islands. 81% of glaciers studied showed considerable loss of volume over the period of record. The mean annual mass loss for all glaciers yielded 0.24 +/- 0.08 m.w.e. per year, with a maximum mass loss of up to 62 m.w.e. and frontal retreat exceeding 2.2 km for Stadium Glacier, located furthest north on Elephant Island. Observed volumetric loss was broadly, though not always, correlated with frontal retreat. The combined mass balance of all 16 glaciers yielded- 1.862 +/- 0.006 Gt, which corresponds to- 0.005 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) over the 57 year observation period.

AB A thorough evaluation of the capability of modeling vegetation lidar returns is a critical aspect of deriving vegetation structure from lidar measurements. This study assesses the performance of the Analytical Clumped Two-Stream (ACTS) canopy radiative transfer model to simulate large-footprint lidar waveforms. Modeled lidar waveforms were compared to airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data collected in deciduous and conifer forests: Harvard Forest, MA; Bartlett Experimental Forest, NH; and Howland Experimental Forest, ME. The simulated and LVIS lidar waveforms have coefficients of determination R-2 > 0.9 and RMSE similar to 0.01 at both plot and stand level for most sites. The ACTS model also produces realistic multi-peak returns from vegetation for the multi-layer and multi-species canopies with R-2 similar to 0.79-0.86 and RMSE similar to 0.01 between the simulated and LVIS waveforms. This validation work lays the foundation to retrieve vegetation structure and above-ground biomass directly from lidar waveforms through model inversion with the ACTS model.

AB For over a decade, several research groups have been developing air-sea heat flux information over the global ocean, including latent (LHF) and sensible (SHF) heat fluxes over the global ocean. This paper aims to provide new insight into the quality and error characteristics of turbulent heat flux estimates at various spatial and temporal scales (from daily upwards). The study is performed within the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Heat Flux (OHF) project. One of the main objectives of the OHF project is to meet the recommendations and requirements expressed by various international programs such as the World Research Climate Program (WCRP) and Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR), recognizing the need for better characterization of existing flux errors with respect to the input bulk variables (e.g. surface wind, air and sea surface temperatures, air and surface specific humidities), and to the atmospheric and oceanic conditions (e.g. wind conditions and sea state). The analysis is based on the use of daily averaged LHF and SHF and the associated bulk variables derived from major satellite-based and atmospheric reanalysis products. Inter-comparisons of heat flux products indicate that all of them exhibit similar space and time patterns. However, they also reveal significant differences in magnitude in some specific regions such as the western ocean boundaries during the Northern Hemisphere winter season, and the high southern latitudes. The differences tend to be closely related to large differences in surface wind speed and/or specific air humidity (for LHF) and to air and sea temperature differences (for SHF). Further quality investigations are performed through comprehensive comparisons with daily-averaged LHF and SHF estimated from moorings. The resulting statistics are used to assess the error of each OHF product. Consideration of error correlation between products and observations (e.g., by their assimilation) is also given. This reveals generally high noise variance in all products and a weak signal in common with in situ observations, with some products only slightly better than others. The OHF LHF and SHF products, and their associated error characteristics, are used to compute daily OHF multiproduct-ensemble (OHF/MPE) estimates of LHF and SHF over the ice-free global ocean on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid. The accuracy of this heat multiproduct, determined from comparisons with mooring data, is greater than for any individual product. It is used as a reference for the anomaly characterization of each individual OHF product.

AB Remote sensing of chlorophyll-a concentration, [Chl-a], has been difficult in coastal waters like the Chesapeake Bay owing largely to terrestrial substances (such as minerals and humus) that are optically significant but do not covary with phytoplankton. Here we revisit the semi-analytical pathway of deriving [Chl-a] based on the light absorption coefficient of phytoplankton by introducing the generalized stacked-constraints model (GSCM) to partition satellite-derived total light absorption coefficient of water (with pure-water contribution subtracted), a(nw)(lambda), into phytoplankton, a(ph)(lambda), and non-phytoplankton components, where a(nw)(lambda) is derived from satellite remote -sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), using the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm. The GSCM-derived a(ph)(lambda) was compared with field matchups of [Chl-a]. We show that semi-analytical approaches can provide superior [Chl-a] product compared with reflectance-band-ratio algorithms when the accuracy of satellite-derived a(ph)(lambda) is sufficiently improved, in this case with the GSCM. However, the improvement is at the cost of significantly reduced data availability because the GSCM may provide no feasible solutions when input a(nw) (lambda) data are subject to large errors. This in turn highlights the needs for improved atmospheric correction and upstream models capable of preserving actual spectral shapes of R-rs(lambda) and a(nw) (lambda), respectively.

AB Surface water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) are key components of the water cycle and are important water resources. Water level and storage vary greatly under the impacts of climate change and human activities. Due to sparse in-situ monitoring networks, a comprehensive national-scale monitoring dataset of surface water bodies in China is not available. Over the last two decades, satellite altimetry has been used successfully for inland water monitoring. Here, we use CryoSat-2 radar altimetry to monitor water level variations of large lakes, reservoirs and rivers across China and demonstrate its potential to complement available in-situ monitoring datasets for the country.
   In this study, over 1000 lakes and reservoirs, and 6 large rivers are investigated. The results show that surface water varied greatly over the past 6 years, e.g. in the Tibetan Plateau, the Junggar Basin, the Northeast China Plain, and the central Yangtze River basin. Estimated changes in volume indicate that surface water variation contributes significantly to terrestrial storage variation, especially in the Qaidam Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. CryoSat-2 is capable of measuring regional-scale river level at high spatial resolution and competitive accuracy as demonstrated by comparison with available in-situ gauging data. The results are encouraging with RMSE values ranging from 0.24 to 0.35 m for the Heilongjiang-Amur River, 0.22 to 0.6 m for the Yellow River and 0.22 to 0.5 m for the Songhua River. Comparatively, accuracy is much lower over the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers (RMSE similar to 2.6 m and similar to 3.3 m), probably due to intensive inland waterway navigation. CryoSat-2 shows great potential for monitoring surface water at national scale in China.

AB Ecosystem services of tidal wetlands depend upon hydrology and vegetation, which in turn vary with elevation differences on the order of centimeters. Variability on such a fine scale is not captured in digital elevation models prepared from conventionally acquired LiDAR data products that generally have a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 m and vertical uncertainties up to 15 cm. Until recently, capturing critical fine scale features required laborious, hands-on field surveys that took days to collect data and time limitations usually required surveys to be restricted to selected areas of a wetland. Using Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and a small unmanned aerial vehicle, precise three-dimensional point clouds, digital surface models (DSM) and color orthomosaics were produced for three salt marshes in Eastern Canada. Vertical and horizontal measurements from the SfM photogrammetry compared favorably to those taken with a Differential Global Positioning System DGPS). Average horizontal displacements of 1.0-2.9 cm were found across the three salt marshes with an average elevation difference of 2.7 cm (+/- 1.7 cm) in comparison to DGPS. Analysis of the relationship of elevation between points taken with the DGPS and extracted from the SfM DSM gave an R-2 of 0.99. With a ground sampling distance of 23 cm our SfM photogrammetry generated models captured variations in topography associated with geomorphic features such as creeks, ponds, channel edges, and logs not visible in the DSM prepared from LiDAR of the same sites. SfM photogrammetry enables mapping of important hydrological features, such as creeks carrying drainage from upland watersheds or connectivity of ponds on the wetland surface. The former are important for transport of contaminants or diadromous fish, and the latter is important for resident fish, water birds, and mosquito larvae. Using SfM to distinguish vegetation structure that may indicate vegetation composition will enable more informed analyses of elevational controls on plant distribution and better prediction of their fate with sea level rise.

AB Satellite-based drought indices have been proved to be effective and convenient in detecting drought conditions at regional and global scales. However, most current drought indices are based on the visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing, which might be influenced greatly by cloud, atmospheric water content and rain-fall. Microwave sensors can overcome the shortages of visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing and show to be another important approach for drought monitoring due to its all-weather working advantages. But to date, the application of microwave vegetation drought indices in drought monitoring has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, for the first time we constructed a microwave derived Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) - MTVDI based on the theory of optical TVDI using the brightness temperatures (Tb) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard Aqua satellite. Firstly, we built a new land surface temperature (Ts) inversion model based on the AMSR-E 18.7 GHz horizontal, 23.8 GHz and 89.0 GHz vertical polarized Tb, and then developed the Microwave Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI) from the AMSR-E 23.8 GHz Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI). After that, we constructed three versions of MTVDI: original MTVDI using Ts and MNDVI; Imp-MTVDI (Improved MTVDI) using the Ts-T-air (the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature) to replace the Ts; and NonL-MTVDI (Nonlinear MTVDI) using non-linear equation to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively. Finally, we used precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and P/PET (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) to validate the performances of MTVDI, Imp-MTVDI, NonL-MTVDI, MODIS derived TVDI and MIDI (improved TVDI). The time-series drought assessments across China from 2003 to 2010 indicated that the trends of the proposed MTVDI showed the most negative correlations with the variations of precipitation, P/PET and SM, and showed best performances of significance test in most regions of China. Moreover, the MTVDI could better separate the drought levels in different degrees than MODIS-derived TVDI. However, the proposed MTVDI still has some uncertainties in regions widely covered by desert, Gobi and large water surfaces. In addition, this paper mainly focuses on large spatial scale and long term drought monitoring and only uses satellite data for model validation. Further studies are needed to develop a higher spatial- and temporal-resolution MTVDI for short-term and small spatial-scale drought monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), one of the largest, northernmost peatlands on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, is underlain by a thick water-logged organic soil layer (peat) made up of dead and decaying plant material. The peatland functions as a main sink for a large amount of soil derived organic carbon. The disturbance of this wetland has negatively impacted the ecosystem and contributed to climate change through the release of the stored greenhouse gases. Surface water level and soil moisture conditions are critical information about peatlands, but monitoring these hydrologic changes has been a challenging task. With a lack of in situ soil moisture measurements, we first explored yearlong Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data to find the close relationship (R-squared value: 0.80) between soil moisture and groundwater table from March 2015 to March 2016. Based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering returns and interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase measurements from C-band Radarsat-1 and L-band ALOS PALSAR datasets, we then analyzed the hydrologic changes in the peatlands. We compared averaged C/L-band SAR backscattering intensity (mid 1998-early 2008 for Radarsat-1, late 2006-early 2011 for ALOS PALSAR) with groundwater level changes and found that the SAR backscattering is significantly responsive (R-squared value: 0.76 and 0.67 for Radarsat-1 and ALOS PALSAR, respectively) to soil moisture changes through a three-way correlated relationship of soil moisture, groundwater level, and SAR intensity. Using InSAR coherence observations, we delineated the inundated area (western and northern regions of GDS) during the wet season, subject to double-bounce backscattering. We measured the relative water level changes in the inundated areas through the InSAR phase measurements, and estimated the groundwater level changes corresponding to soil moisture changes using time-series InSAR analysis: Our comprehensive study has demonstrated that time-series SAR backscattering retums and InSAR analysis can be used to gauge soil moisture conditions and to monitor the hydrologic and vegetation changes in the GDS.

AB Innovative, open, and rapid methods to map crop types over large areas are needed for long-term cropland monitoring. We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250 m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use similarities and dissimilarities in crop type phenology derived from NDVI time-series data for the two approaches. The year-specific approach uses the training samples from one year and classifies crop types for that year only, whereas the generalized classification approach uses above-average, average, and below-average precipitation years for training to produce crop type maps for one or multiple years more robustly. We produced annual crop type maps using the generalized classification approach for 2001-2014 and the year-specific approach for 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The year-specific classification had overall accuracies >78%, while the generalized classifier had accuracies >75% for the conterminous U.S. for 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The generalized classifier enables automated and routine crop type mapping without repeated and expensive ground sample collection year after year. The resulting crop type maps for years prior to 2007 are new and especially important for long-term cropland monitoring and food security analysis because no other map products are currently available for 2001-2007.

AB Stereogrammetry applied to globally available high resolution spaceborne imagery (HRSI; <5 m spatial resolution) yields fine-scaled digital surface models (DSMs) of elevation. These DSMs may represent elevations that range from the ground to the vegetation canopy surface, are produced from stereoscopic image pairs (stereopairs) that have a variety of acquisition characteristics, and have been coupled with lidar data of forest structure and ground surface elevation to examine forest height. This work explores surface elevations from HRSI DSMs derived from two types of acquisitions in open canopy forests. We(1) apply an automated mass-production stereogrammetry workflow to along-track HRSI stereopairs, (2) identify multiple spatially coincident DSMs whose stereopairs were acquired under different solar geometry, (3) vertically co-register these DSMs using coincident spaceborne lidar footprints (from ICESat-GLAS) as reference, and (4) examine differences in surface elevations between the reference lidar and the co-registered HRSI DSMs associated with two general types of acquisitions (DSM types) from different sun elevation angles. We find that these DSM types, distinguished by sun elevation angle at the time of stereopair acquisition, are associated with different surface elevations estimated from automated stereogrammetry in open canopy forests. For DSM values with corresponding reference ground surface elevation from spaceborne lidar footprints in open canopy northern Siberian Larix forests with slopes <10 degrees, our results show that HRSI DSMs acquired with sun elevation angles >35 degrees and <25 degrees (during snow-free conditions) produced characteristic and consistently distinct distributions of elevation differences from reference lidar. The former include DSMs of near-ground surfaces with root mean square errors <0.68 m relative to lidar. The latter, particularly those with angles <10 degrees, show distributions with larger differences from lidar that are associated with open canopy forests whose vegetation surface elevations are captured. Terrain aspect did not have a strong effect on the distribution of vegetation surfaces. Using the two DSM types together, the distribution of DSM-differenced heights in forests (mu=6.0m, s=1.4 m) was consistent with the distribution of plotlevel mean tree heights (mu=6.5 m, s=1.2 m). We conclude that the variation in sun elevation angle at time of stereopair acquisition can create illumination conditions conducive for capturing elevations of surfaces either near the ground or associated with vegetation canopy. Knowledge of HRSI acquisition solar geometry and snow cover can be used to understand and combine stereogrammetric surface elevation estimates to co-register and difference overlapping DSMs, providing a means to map forest height at fine scales, resolving the vertical structure of groups of trees from spaceborne platforms in open canopy forests.

AB Environmental disturbance regimes are more frequently being altered by historically novel events and disturbance interactions, which may trigger reorganizations of new ecosystem states and processes. Here we examine synergies between emerging forest disease and wildfire to determine whether disease outbreak changes environmental drivers of burn severity using sudden oak death and the basin complex fire in California as a case study of novel disturbance interaction. We mapped the spatial distribution of sudden oak death tree mortality using a new object-based filter with 1.0 m resolution KOMPSAT-2 images. We integrated these data with a physical simulation model of burn severity informed by post-fire Landsat data. Model performance varied across stages of disease establishment (early, middle and late) with stronger relationships occurring during later stages of disease progression. Multiscale statistical analysis of environmental drivers of burn severity in diseased compared to healthy forests showed that sudden oak death tree mortality altered relationships between burn severity and the biophysical environment. Specifically, compared to the healthy forests, those affected by disease exhibited higher landscape heterogeneity at smaller spatial scales (e.g., 25 and 50 m), which has been associated with decreased burn severity in the literature. Our results showed the opposite pattern. That is, a disease-affected landscape comprising less connected patches and higher patch shape complexity was more likely to experience greater burn severity. This suggests that disease-caused increases in surface fuels may have reduced the landscape's resistance to fire and in turn increased burn severity in forest patches neighboring disease-impacted forests.

AB Forest resource assessments utilizing remotely sensed auxiliary data are becoming increasingly important due to their ability to provide precise estimates of forest parameters at low cost. In presenting results from such surveys, it is important to provide not only estimates of the target parameters, but also their confidence intervals, which provide the range of values wherein the true value is located with a certain level of confidence. If such an interval is narrow the point estimates from the survey can be considered very reliable. In estimating the confidence interval the variance of an estimator must first be estimated. Unbiasedness, i.e. that an estimator on average coincides with the true value, is an important property also for variance estimators. Another important property is that the variance estimator itself has low variance, not least in cases when the variance estimates obtained with the estimator may not be strictly positive. One such important case is when two-stage designs are used to first allocate sample clusters in the form of strips from which auxiliary data, such as metrics derived from airborne laser scanning, are obtained; field data are then derived from sample plots beneath each sample strip in a second stage. In this article we compare two variance estimators for such surveys. The first estimator is a standard estimator suggested in reference textbooks on model-assisted sampling. The second estimator is proposed by the authors, and utilizes the auxiliary data to a larger extent. Through Monte Carlo simulation we show that both variance estimators are approximately unbiased, but that the new estimator is more stable (i.e., has lower empirical variance) and provides empirical confidence interval coverage rates that coincide more closely with the nominal coverage rates.

AB Measurements of wave heights in marginal ice zones are limited to very few in situ data. Here we revisit the linear and quasilinear theories of Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging of waves in the particular case of waves in sea ice. Instead of only working with spectra, we have developed an iterative nonlinear algorithm to estimate phase-resolved deterministic maps of wave-induced orbital velocities, from which elevation spectra can be derived. Application of this algorithm to Sentinel lA wave mode images in the Southern Ocean shows that it produces reasonable results for swells in all directions except when they propagate at a few degrees off the range direction. The estimate of wave parameters is expected to work best when the shortest wave components, those which cause a pixel displacement of the order of the dominant wavelength in azimuth, can be neglected. Otherwise short waves produce a blurring of the image, increasing exponentially with the azimuthal wavenumber and reducing the estimated wave amplitude. Given the expected spatial attenuation of waves in ice-covered regions, our deterministic method should apply beyond a few tens of kilometers in the ice, without any correction for short wave effects. In situ data collected around the ice edge as part of the 2015 SeaState DRI cruise in the Beaufort confirm the progressive image blurring caused by such short waves, and the apparent reduction in the wave modulation. When short waves propagate from the open ocean towards the ice, this blurring can produce an unrealistic apparent increase of wave height, from the open ocean up to a few tens of kilometers inside the ice.

AB Crop biomass information is of great importance for a variety of applications, ranging from supporting farm management decisions to modeling the crop-environment system. Dimensionless spectral vegetation index values derived from satellite imagery are commonly used to derive crop biomass. However, the highly empirical nature of spectrally derived biomass estimates requires frequent and costly calibration with manually collected ground data. Recently, low cost, autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanners (ATLSs) have become available for near-surface applications. In contrast to the dimensionless nature of spectral index values, autonomous light detection and ranging (lidar) technology measures physical vegetation structure by recording the x, y, z coordinates of canopy components at very high spatial (<10 cm), and temporal (<2 days) resolution. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of an ATLS to i) monitor crop growth dynamics and ii) calibrate satellite imagery for estimating crop biomass. Wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) growth was monitored by acquiring hypertemporal (every 28 h for a full growing season) ATLS data at three different field sites across a range of experimentally manipulated crop growth conditions. The ATLS-derived crop height explained nearly three-quarters of the variability in destructively sampled wheat biomass (r(2) = 0.74, RMSE = 514.20 kg ha(-1)), showing a slightly stronger correlation to crop biomass than did leaf area index (LAI) measurements collected in the field using a LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 546 kg ha(-1)). Satellite-based crop biomass estimates calibrated with ATLS data captured the variability in wheat biomass throughout a farm field with a biomass error of 730.96 and 727.60 kg ha(-1) (RMSE) during the jointing (Development stage: Zadoks 37) and heading (Development stage: Zadoks 50) growth stages, respectively. These findings suggest that the hypertemporal lidar information provided via ATLS technology could constitute a major step forward in operational monitoring and mapping of crop biomass.

AB The development of tower-mounted automated multi-angular hyperspectral systems has brought new opportunities and challenges for the characterization of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) on a continuous basis. This study describes the deployment of one of these systems in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem (AMSPEC-MED), and proposes new approaches for modeling of directional effects. In this study, a Hemispherical-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function (HDRDF) was introduced in order to quantify the effect of diffuse radiation on the estimation of BRDF. The HDRDFs of the two covers of the ecosystem- trees and grasses were un-mixed using a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model of the observed scene. Up-scaling HDRDF estimates to MODIS BRDF product (r(2) is an element of [0.74, 0.86]) and down-scaling to hand held spectral measurements (r(2) = 0.88) achieved a reasonable accuracy (RMSE is an element of [1.81, 3.14]). Despite the uncertainties in the estimation of diffuse irradiance and the 3-D representation of the scene, HDRDF un-mixing demonstrates the potential of automated multi-angular proximal sensing to study vegetation properties in heterogeneous ecosystems and the correction of directional effects of different sources.

AB To address the problem of assessing large-scale urban dynamics from incompatible time series DMSP/OLS night-time light (NTL) data, this study proposed an Object-based Urban Thresholding method for NTL image data (i.e., NTL-OUT method) to estimate the optimal thresholds of urban objects in different NTL images. The optimal threshold for an urban object was determined by comparing the reference threshold with that of a target year through object-based normalization. Threshold normalization assumed the stability or limited change of NTL intensity over time for pseudo invariant pixels. An experiment was conducted in China to detect its urban areas in 2005 and 2010 from DMSP/OLS F152005 and F182010 NTL images by using the estimated object-based thresholds predicted from DMSP/OLS F152000 NTL data and reference urban data. Results showed that the proposed method can successfully relate thresholds among years. The estimated thresholds were highly correlated with the reference, with R-2 of 0.96 and 0.92 and RMSE of 2.9 and 4.1 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the object level, R-2 and RMSE of the estimated vs. the reference urban areas yielded 0.94 and 12.5 pixels and 0.88 and 21.2 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the provincial level, R-2 reached 0.94 and 0.91 with RMSE of 230.7 and 336.7 pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. The assessment of derived urban maps for 141 sample cities yielded an overall accuracy of 95.19% and 94.09% and Kappa of 0.56 and 0.53 in 2005 and 2010, respectively. The proposed method shows great potentials to update urban extents in a timely and cost-effective manner and to detect global urban dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a remote sensing-based method to efficiently derive multi-temporal landslide inventories over large areas, which allows for the spatiotemporal analysis of landslide activity, which is an important prerequisite in systematic regional landslide hazard and risk assessment. The developed method uses globally archived satellite remote sensing data for a retrospective systematic assessment of past multi-temporal landslide activity. Landslides are automatically identified as spatially explicit objects based on landslide-specific vegetation cover changes using temporal NDVI-trajectories and complementary relief-oriented parameters. To enable the long-term analysis of large areas with highest possible temporal resolution, the developed method facilitates the use of a large amount of optical multi-sensor time series data. The database of this study consists of 212 datasets that comprise freely available Landsat TM & ETM + data and SPOT 1 & 5, IRS1-C LISSIII, ASTER, and RapidEye data. These data were acquired between 1986 and 2013 and cover a landslide-prone area of 2500 km(2) in southern Kyrgyzstan. We identified 1583 landslide objects ranging in size between 50 m(2) and 2.8 km(2). Spatiotemporal analysis of the landslides that were detected during these 27 years reveals continuous landslide activity of varying intensity. The highest overall landslide rates occurred in 2003 and 2004, exceeding the long-term annual average rate of 57 landslides per year by more than a factor of five. The areas of highest landslide activity are also determined, whereas most of these areas were persistent over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global vegetation distribution is the result of environmental conditions and the genetic make-up of plants. In view of the intensive discussions on climate change and its effect on living organisms on earth, it has become necessary to develop new methods and strategies to monitor and follow the changes in global plant distribution. In this research, we focused on a vegetation analysis using spectral reflectance profiles linked to biochemical concentrations. We performed the spectroscopic measurements of Pistacia species at canopy and leaf levels. Concomitant chemical analyses of leaf and bark materials enabled the development of remote sensing (RS) indices of structure-related biochemicals and pigments. We developed RS indices for cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin and wax. Since the wax was the least studied in this context and due to the fact that it is the first layer of the plant surface that interacts with the incident light, it deserved special attention and was assumed to affect the spectral reflectance and, in combination with the other biochemicals, to contribute to better species identification.
   In the modeling process, we showed that apart from the major energy absorption spectral bands related to a given biochemical, there were supplementary bands that had a significant effect on the accuracy of the biochemical content estimation. Another factor affecting the accuracy of the biochemical estimation was the season. Thus, we divided the biochemical content estimation models into seasonal groups of spring, summer and fall. The RS indices developed in this work, together with literature-reported RS indices, were used for Pistacia classification. The accuracy (69%) of species classification was significantly higher in spring at an early vegetation stage than in summer (50%), and fall (37%). As a proof of concept, the same sets of RS indices were also used for classifying the genera and families of various plants in the Mediterranean forest using EO1 Hyperion images. The accuracy of the classification maps was 79%, when the full set of RS indices developed in this work was used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite based human settlement extraction at medium resolution (30 m) with supervised classification has been widely carried out. However, adequate training sample collection and mapping accuracy are two hindering factors over large regions. Here we propose a new framework for efficient human settlement extraction from Landsat images over large areas. First, an inventory-based training set is adopted to obtain some statistical parameters required to build a non-settlement mask. The mask can not only reduce unnecessary computation but also reduce the impact of background noise. Thereafter, for the un-masked areas we calculate the similarity of each image pixel to pre-collected sample points, and only those within certain threshold are treated as the settlement class. This approach is very fast and has been applied to three rapidly developing regions in China. Accuracy assessment indicates that the mean overall accuracies are 87%, 89% and 89% for Jing-Jin-Ji region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, respectively. This work may be applied to human settlement extraction at even broader spatial scales. (C)2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Inland lakes, important water resources, play a crucial role in the global water cycle and are sensitive to climate change and human activities. There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations of lakes at global and continental scales. The recent operation of Landsat 8 extends the unprecedented Landsat record to over 40 years, allowing long-term, large-scale lake dynamics mapping at high resolutions. Using our circa 2000 lake product derived from Landsat 7 images as a reference, this research produces a circa-2015 map of representative lake extents and distributions, and addresses seasonal and inter-annual lake area variability using Landsat 8 images acquired in lake stable seasons at a continental scale. Oceania is chosen here as a case study as it contains a large group of salt lakes that exhibit high area variability and has the most intensive image coverage during the first 2.5-year operation of Landsat 8. Accordingly, this paper describes an adaptive algorithm to automate lake mapping for various surface conditions using images acquired during lake stable seasons and a compositing scheme in the vector domain to generate a representative continental mosaic of lake extents from multi-temporal mapping. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods produce a highly reliable and representative composite of highly-variable lake extents across Oceania, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale lake mapping projects using multi-temporal data.

AB Remotely sensed imagery of rivers has long served as a means for characterizing channel properties and detection of planview change. In the last decade the dramatic increase in the availability of satellite imagery and processing tools has created the potential to greatly expand the spatial and temporal scale of our understanding of river morphology and dynamics. To date, the majority of GIS and automated analyses of planview changes in rivers from remotely sensed data has been developed for single-threaded meandering river systems. These methods have limited applicability to many of the earth's rivers with complex multi-channel planforms. Here we present the methodologies of a set of analysis algorithms collectively called Spatially Continuous Riverbank Erosion and Accretion Measurements (SCREAM). SCREAM analyzes planview river metrics regardless of river morphology. These algorithms quantify both the erosion and accretion rates of riverbanks from binary masks of channels generated from imagery acquired at two time periods. Additionally, the program quantifies the area of change between river channels and the surrounding floodplain and area of islands lost or formed between these two time periods. To examine variations in erosion rates in relation to local channel attributes and make rate comparisons between river systems of varying sizes, the program determines channel widths and bank curvature at every bank pixel. SCREAM was developed and tested on rivers with diverse and complex planform morphologies in imagery acquired from a range of observational platforms with varying spatial resolutions. Validation and verification of SCREAM-generated metrics against manual measurements show no significant measurement errors in determination of channel width, erosion, and bank aspects. SCREAM has the potential to provide data for both the quantitative examination of the controls on erosion rates and for the comparison of these rates across river systems ranging broadly in size and planform morphology.

AB To evaluate the performance of ocean-colour retrievals of total chlorophyll-a concentration requires direct comparison with concomitant and co-located in situ data. For global comparisons, these in situ match-ups should be ideally representative of the distribution of total chlorophyll-a concentration in the global ocean. The oligotrophic gyres constitute the majority of oceanic water, yet are under-sampled due to their inaccessibility and under-represented in global in situ databases. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) is one of only a few programmes that consistently sample oligotrophic waters. In this paper, we used a spectrophotometer on two AMT cruises (AMT19 and AMT22) to continuously measure absorption by particles in the water of the ship's flow-through system. From these optical data continuous total chlorophyll-a concentrations were estimated with high precision and accuracy along each cruise and used to evaluate the performance of ocean-colour algorithms. We conducted the evaluation using level 3 binned ocean-colour products, and used the high spatial and temporal resolution of the underway system to maximise the number of match-ups on each cruise. Statistical comparisons show a significant improvement in the performance of satellite chlorophyll algorithms over previous studies, with root mean square errors on average less than half (similar to 0.16 in logio space) that reported previously using global datasets (similar to 0.34 in logio space). This improved performance is likely due to the use of continuous absorption based chlorophyll estimates, that are highly accurate, sample spatial scales more comparable with satellite pixels, and minimise human errors. Previous comparisons might have reported higher errors due to regional biases in datasets and methodological inconsistencies between investigators. Furthermore, our comparison showed an underestimate in satellite chlorophyll at low concentrations in 2012 (AMT22), likely due to a small bias in satellite remote-sensing reflectance data. Our results highlight the benefits of using underway spectrophotometric systems for evaluating satellite ocean-colour data and underline the importance of maintaining in situ observatories that sample the oligotrophic gyres.

AB Nearly two decades ago, the idea of the 'spectral invariants theory' was put forth as a new tool to model the shortwave radiation absorbed or scattered by vegetation. The theory states that the amount of radiation absorbed by a canopy should to a great accuracy depend only on the wavelength and a wavelength-independent parameter describing canopy structure. The revolutionary idea behind this theory was that it would be possible to approximate vegetation canopy absorptance, transmittance and reflectance based on only the optical properties of foliage elements and the spectrally invariant parameter(s). This paper explains how this so-called spectral invariant is related to photon recollision probability and to canopy structural variables. Other spectral invariants were later introduced to quantify the directionality of canopy scattering. Moreover, the paper reviews the advances in the theoretical development of the photon recollision probability (p) concept and demonstrates some of its applications in global and local monitoring of vegetation using remote sensing data.

AB Sargassum washing ashore on the beaches of the Caribbean Islands since 2011 has caused problems for the local environments, tourism, and economies. Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFA1 signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0-22 degrees N, 63-38 degrees W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000 km(2), or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.

AB We present an improved water vapor scaling (WVS) model for atmospherically correcting MODIS thermal infrared (TIR) bands in the temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm. TES is used to retrieve the land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) from MODIS TIR bands 29, 31, and 32. The WVS model improves the accuracy of the atmospheric correction parameters in TES on a band-by-band and pixel-by-pixel basis. We used global atmospheric radiosondes profiles to generate view angle and day-night-dependent WVS coefficients that are valid for all MODIS scan angles up to 65. We demonstrate the effects of applying the improved WVS model on the retrieval accuracy of MODIS-TES (MODTES) LST&E using a case study for a granule over the southwest USA during very warm and moist monsoonal atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, a comprehensive validation of the MODTES LST&E retrieval was performed over two sites at the quartz-rich Algodones Dunes in California and a grassland site in Texas, USA using three full years of MODIS Aqua data. Results from the case study showed that absolute errors in the emissivity retrieval for the three MODIS TIR bands were reduced on average from 1.4% to 0.4% when applying the WVS method. A Radiance-based method was used to validate the MODTES LST retrievals for and the results showed that application of the WVS method with the MODTES algorithm led to significant reduction in both bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of the LST retrievals at both sites. When the WVS model was applied, LST RMSE's were reduced on average from 1.3 K to 1.0 K at the Algodones Dunes site, and from 1.2 K to 0.7 K at the Texas Grassland site. This study demonstrated that the WVS atmospheric correction model is critical for retrieving MODTES LST with <1 K accuracy and emissivity with <1% consistently for a wide range of challenging atmospheric conditions and land surface types.

AB We use sea surface salinity (SSS) from ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA's Aquarius/Satelite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC)-D missions to study seasonal and interannual variations of SSS in the Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi River outflow during 2010-2014. A seasonal cycle is clearly observed in SSS, with an SSS maximum during December April and an SSS minimum in July August. The averaged magnitude of the seasonal variation is about 4 pss. Interannual changes are also observed, with the lowest SSS in summer 2011 and the highest SSS in summer 2012 and a difference of 4.2 pss. Therefore, the magnitude of interannual changes can be comparable to that of the seasonal cycle. Our analysis suggests that the seasonal variations of SSS near the Mississippi River mouth are consistent with variations in Mississippi River discharge. Evaporation minus precipitation and ocean dynamics play a minor role. River discharge also contributes to the interannual variation of SSS, especially during summer 2011 and to some extent the highest summer minimum in 2012 in terms of timing, but not magnitude. For the latter, ocean dynamics and E-P also contribute. The implications of the findings to ocean modeling and hypoxic zone monitoring are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Abrupt changes in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperatures, such as those produced by land/sea/ice transitions and Radio -Frequency Interference (RFI) sources, produce artificial rippling patterns (i.e. the so-called Gibbs-like contamination) that propagate through the SMOS-reconstructed image. A nodal sampling technique, focused on the reduction of this kind of contamination by sampling at the points where the perturbation cancels, was introduced by Gonzalez-Gambau et al. (2015). In this work we show that the quality of nodal sampling can be largely improved by refining the determination of the nodal grid. In addition, we have carried out an extensive validation of the resulting data over the ocean. Nodal sampling reduces sidelobe levels and ripples in the reconstructed images leading to brightness temperatures in better agreement with the theoretically modeled ones. Validation of the salinity retrievals against close-to-surface Argo salinity observations shows that nodal sampling leads to improved salinity retrievals in open ocean, while close to the coast land sea contamination seems to deteriorate the quality. Besides, spectral analysis shows that nodal sampled salinities become closer to what is geophysically expected without loss of effective spatial resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Land surface phenology derived from remotely sensed satellite data can substantially improve our macroecological knowledge and the representation of phenology in earth system models. We characterized the baseline phenology of the vegetation at the global scale from the GEOCLIM climatology of leaf area index (LAI) estimated from 1-km SPOT-VEGETATION time series for 1999-2010. The phenological metrics were calibrated over an ensemble of ground observations of the timing of leaf unfolding and autumnal colouring of leaves. The start and end of season were best identified using respectively 30% and 40% threshold of LAI amplitude values. The accuracy of the derived phenological metrics, evaluated using available ground observations for birch forests over Europe (and lilac shrubs over North America), improved as compared to those derived from MODIS-EVI and produced an overall root mean square error of 7 days (19 days) for the timing of the start of season, 15 for the end of season, and 16 for the length of season. The spatial patterns of the derived LAI phenology agreed well with those from MODIS-EVI and -NDVI, although the timing of the start, end, and length of season differed by about one month at the global scale, with higher uncertainties in areas of limited seasonality of the satellite signal and systematic biases due to the differences in the methodologies and datasets. The baseline LAI phenology was spatially consistent with the global distributions of climatic drivers and biome land cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A variety of evidence suggests that the boreal forests of Canada are responding to climate change. Specifically, several studies have inferred that widespread browning trends detected in time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) reflect the response of boreal forests to longer growing seasons, increased summer drought stress, and higher frequency of fires. Data from the Thematic Mapper (TM5) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors onboard Landsat 5 and 7, respectively, span essentially the same time period as the AVHRR record, but provide data with substantially higher radiometric and spatial fidelity, and by extension, a much improved basis for evaluating decadal-scale trends in spectral vegetation indices such as the NDVI. However, detection of trends, which are often subtle, requires careful attention to ensure that artifacts associated with the quality and stability of inter and intra-sensor calibration do not lead to spurious conclusions in results from time series analyses. In this paper, we use time series of TM5 and ETM+ images for fifteen sites distributed across the Canadian boreal forest zone to explore if and how sensor geometry and inter- and intra-sensor calibration affect trends in spectral vegetation indices derived from multi-decadal Landsat time series. To do this, we created annual cloud-free composites for each Landsat spectral band based on peak summer NDVI at each site from 1984 to 2011 using all available TM5 and ETM+ data. To distinguish trends arising from long term climate change from those related to disturbance, we isolated areas within each site that were undisturbed during the Landsat record, and used these locations to analyze sources of variance in time series of red reflectance, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, the NDVI, and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Our results highlight the challenges involved in distinguishing trends in surface properties from data artifacts caused by undetected atmospheric effects, changes in sensor view angles, and subtle radiometric differences between the TM5 and ETM+ sensors. In particular, differences in sensor view geometry across adjacent overlapping Landsat scenes cause vegetated pixels in the eastern portion of Landsat scenes to have higher reflectances in the red and NIR bands (by 5 and 6 percent, respectively) than pixels in the western portion of scenes. While this effect does not significantly change NDVI values, it does affect EVI values. We also found modest, but potentially significant, differences between the red band reflectance of each sensor, with TM5 data having 14 percent higher red reflectance on average for vegetated pixels, which can introduce spurious trends in time series that combine TM5 and ETM+ data. More generally, the results from this work demonstrate that while the 30 + year Landsat archive provides unprecedented opportunities for studying changes to the Earth's terrestrial biosphere over the last three decades, care must be taken when inferring trends in these data without considering how sources of variance unrelated to surface processes affect the integrity of Landsat time series.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been demonstrated to be an excellent source of auxiliary information for increasing the precision of estimating stand-level attributes in forest inventories. It has also been proposed to use ALS for estimating biomass and carbon stocks under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD). The benefits of REDD depend among other facts on the cost-efficiency of the carbon accounting systems, which should be economically feasible and highly accurate. Acquiring full-coverage ALS data would provide highly accurate estimates but might be too expensive for limited inventory budgets. As an alternative, the ALS data might be collected as a sample by acquiring data from a portion of the area of interest. However, in surveys involving complex multi-phase and multi-stage systematic sampling designs, the efficiency of ALS-based estimates is hampered by the ability of estimating the sampling variability correctly. It has been demonstrated recently that the precision of such complex analytical estimators may be largely underestimated. In order to make an informed decision, simulated sampling from artificial populations generated from empirical data may provide a means for assessing the cost-efficiency of various sampling strategies when analytical approaches fail. This study presents a simulation based assessment of sampling strategies employing ALS with focus on large-area (27,400 km(2)) biomass estimation. Simulated sampling mimicking the two contrasting cases "wall-to-wall" and two-phase ALS-aided surveys is exemplified using Norwegian National Forest Inventory data for creating an artificial population. The main results indicated that (1) the gain in precision (10%) when using "wall-to-wall" ALS data may not be worth the very high inventory costs, (2) using variance estimators based on higher-order successive differences produced correct confidence intervals for two-phase systematic sampling, and (3) two-phase ALS-aided systematic surveys are cost-efficient solutions for large-area biomass estimation.

AB In the infrared region, the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals critically depends on the cloud detection scheme. More than 5 million matchups, where the surface and top of atmosphere measurements are available, have been carefully analyzed to understand clouds related errors and to develop the advanced cloud detection scheme for improvement of satellite SST quality. The effectiveness of a Bayesian cloud detection (BCD) scheme, operationally implemented at the NOAA Office of Satellite Product Operations (OSPO) for the GOES-Imager, has been examined using an experimental filter and it is found that this scheme is not optimal. Thus, a new algorithm for cloud and error masking (CEM) scheme is proposed for physical SST retrievals. This is based on a quasi-deterministic approach combined with an approximated radiative transfer model and the functional spectral differences at pixel level. Although, traditionally the validation of cloud detection algorithms have often been reported qualitatively using visual inspection of imagery, we have made a quantitative validation of the cloud algorithm for its intended purpose by determining the quality of satellite SST retrievals against in situ data. Results show that CEM can reduce the root mean square error in SST by an average of 22% while increasing the data coverage by an average of 38% compared to the operationally implemented BCD at OSPO, as assessed over a period of fifty months.

AB The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) satellite mission, candidate of ESA's 8th Earth Explorer program, is explicitly optimized for detecting the sun-induced fluorescence emitted by plants. It will allow consistent measurements around the O-2-B (687 nm) and O-2-A (760 nm) bands, related to the red and far-red fluorescence emission peaks respectively, the photochemical reflectance index, and the structural-chemical state variables of the canopy. The sun-induced fluorescence signal, overlapped to the surface reflected radiance, can be accurately retrieved by employing the powerful spectral fitting technique. In this framework, a set of fluorescence retrieval algorithms optimized for FLEX are proposed in this study. Two main retrieval approaches were investigated: i) the optimization of the spectral fitting for retrieving fluorescence at the oxygen absorption bands; ii) the extension of the spectral fitting to a broader spectral window to retrieve the full fluorescence spectrum in the range from 670 to 780 nm. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms is assessed by employing atmosphere-surface radiative transfer simulations obtained by coupling SCOPE and MODTRAN5 codes. The simulated dataset considers more realistic conditions because it includes directional effects, and the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra are resampled to the current specifications of the FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) planned to serve as the primary instrument aboard FLEX. The retrieval accuracy obtained at the O-2-A band is strongly affected by directional effects, and better performance is found in cases where directional effects are lower. However, the best performing algorithms tested provided similar performance, the RMSE (RRMSE) is 0.044 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) (6.2%) at the O-2-A band, 0.018 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) (2.9%) at the O-2-B band, and 6225 mW m(-2) sr(-1) (6.4%) for the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission. The promising results achieved open new perspectives extending fluorescence studies not only in limited absorption bands, but its spectral behavior in relation to different plant species, photosynthetic rates and stress occurrences.

AB Vegetation indices are important remotely sensed metrics for ecosystem monitoring and land surface process assessment, among which Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been most widely used. The newly launched Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, together with its predecessor Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), provides continuous earth observations with an 8-day interval. The design improvements of the new sensor, including narrower near-infrared waveband, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and greater radiometric sensitivity highlight the need for investigating the land surface observation properties, especially its consistency with data from its predecessors and other satellite sensors. This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of Landsat 8 OLI-derived NDVI against Landsat 7 ETM + by cross-comparison and by comparing with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)-derived NDVIs as well as in-situ NDVI measurements. Simulations of Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface reflectance of broadleaf trees and water were conducted for Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 7 ETM +, and MODIS in order to evaluate the impact of band pass difference on NDVI calculation. Four consecutive pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + data over China and Korea were examined, and NDVIs derived from TOA reflectance and surface reflectance by three atmospheric correction methods were evaluated. Both simulations and comparisons showed that NDVIs derived from atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance had good consistency, while the simulation showed that the agreement varied with atmospheric characteristics. The four pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + NDVI had a mean bias error within +/- 0.05, and R-2 from 0.84 to 0.98. Vegetated land cover types were found to have better NDVI agreement than non-vegetated land cover types. Especially, Landsat 8 OLI consistently generated lower NDVI values in water area than Landsat 7 ETM +, which resulted from higher aerosol optical thickness in atmosphere. Landsat 8 OLI-derived NDVI showed better agreement with MODIS and GOCI NDVI than Landsat 7 ETM +, mainly on vegetated surfaces. Both Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM + surface reflectance-derived NDVI agreed well with in-situ light emitting diode (LED) NDVI measurements at a homogeneous deciduous forest site. Landsat 8 OLI was also found to produce higher spatial variability of NDVIs than Landsat 7 ETM + at vegetated and urban areas, but lower variability on water area. The overall good agreement between Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and Landsat 7 ETM +, MODIS and GOCI NDVIs as well as in-situ measurements ensures that it is reliable to integrate the new sensor observations with those from the multiple satellite sensors, given that the same atmospheric correction methods are applied. Furthermore, the greater NDVI contrast between vegetated areas and water areas, and the higher spatial variability of Landsat 8 OLI NDVI indicated that the new sensor has better capability in land surface process monitoring, such as land cover mapping, spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation growth, and drought assessment.

AB The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical input parameter in many climate and ecological models. The accuracy of satellite FAPAR products directly influences estimates of ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10%, or 0.05, for many applications. It is important to evaluate satellite FAPAR products and understand differences between the products to effectively use them in carbon cycling models. In this study, five global FAPAR products, namely MODIS, MISR, MERIS, SeaWiFS, and GEOV1 are intercompared over different land covers and directly validated with ground-based measurements at VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERO and AmeriFlux sites. Intercomparison results show that MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 agree well with each other and so do MERIS and SeaWiFS, but the difference between these two groups can be as large as 0.1. The temporal trends of these products agree better with each other in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. The trends in the Northern Hemisphere are similar to those globally. However, the conclusions from the northern hemispheric scale could not be extended to the global scale for land covers such as savannahs and broadleaf evergreen forests. The differences between the products are consistent throughout the year over most of the land cover types, except over the forests, because of the different assumptions in the retrieval algorithms and the differences between green and total FAPAR products over forests. Direct validation results show that MERIS, MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 FAPAR products have an uncertainty of 0.14 when validating with total FAPAR measurements, and 0:09 when validating with green FAPAR measurements. Overall, current FAPAR products are close to, but have not fulfilled, the accuracy requirement, and further improvements are still needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite data are increasingly used to provide observation-based estimates of the effects of aerosols on climate. The Aerosol-cci project, part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (Ca), was designed to provide essential climate variables for aerosols from satellite data. Eight algorithms, developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties using data from AATSR (4), MERIS (3) and POLDER, were evaluated to determine their suitability for climate studies. The primary result from each of these algorithms is the aerosol optical depth (ADD) at several wavelengths, together with the Angstrom exponent (AE) which describes the spectral variation of the ADD for a given wavelength pair. Other aerosol parameters which are possibly retrieved from satellite observations are not considered in this paper. The AOD and AE (AE only for Level 2) were evaluated against independent collocated observations from the ground-based AERONET sun photometer network and against "reference" satellite data provided by MODIS and MISR Tools used for the evaluation were developed for daily products as produced by the retrieval with a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 km(2) (Level 2) and daily or monthly aggregates (Level 3). These tools include statistics for 12 and 12 products compared with AERONET, as well as scoring based on spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper we describe their use in a round robin (RR) evaluation of four months of data, one month for each season in 2008. The amount of data was restricted to only four months because of the large effort made to improve the algorithms, and to evaluate the improvement and current status, before larger data sets will be processed. Evaluation criteria are discussed. Results presented show the current status of the European aerosol algorithms in comparison to both AERONET and MODIS and MISR data. The comparison leads to a preliminary conclusion that the scores are similar, including those for the references, but the coverage of AATSR needs to be enhanced and further improvements are possible for most algorithms. None of the algorithms, including the references, outperforms all others everywhere. AATSR data can be used for the retrieval of AOD and AE over land and ocean. PARASOL and one of the MERIS algorithms have been evaluated over ocean only and both algorithms provide good results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fire products derived from coarse (500 m to 1 km) spatial resolution satellite data have become an important source of information for the fire science and applications communities. There is however a demand for moderate (30 m) spatial resolution burned area data sets, systematically generated at regional to global scale, that to date has been only partially met. This paper presents a methodology to fuse multi-temporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM +) data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire detections to map systematically burned areas at 30 m resolution. A multistage mapping approach is used with an initial per-pixel change detection based on spectral-rule based pre-classification of Landsat 30 m time series to identify candidate burned areas. The candidate burned area objects are then either retained or discarded by comparison with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detections. The methodology is demonstrated for 1.9 million km(2) over the Western United States using all the Landsat 7 ETM+ data and Terra MODIS active fire detections acquired in 2002. Systematic evaluation conducted by per-pixel and per-burned area object comparison with the burned area perimeters provided by the USGS Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project is presented, and shows a good agreement in the identification of burning patterns but a likely underestimation of the total area burned. Future research to refine and further test the methodology is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluating EO-based canopy water stress from seasonally detrended NDVI

AB Satellite remote sensing of vegetation parameters and stress is a key issue for semi-arid areas such as the Sahel, where vegetation is an important part of the natural resource base. In this study we examine if additional information can be obtained on intra-seasonal short term scale by using the Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index (SIWSI) as compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We perform a spatio-temporal evaluation of NDVI and SIWSI using geostationary remote sensing imagery from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). The indices and their seasonally detrended anomalies are evaluated using a gridded rainfall product (RFE2) and modeled actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the Senegal River basin in 2008. Daily NDVI and SIWSI were found spatially highly correlated to ETa with r = 0.73 for both indices, showing the importance of the north/south vegetation gradient in the river catchment. The hypothesis that short term evolution of index anomalies are related to canopy water status was tested by comparing 10-day averages of ETa with short term changes in daily NDVI and SIWSI anomalies, and moderate to strong coefficients of determination where found when anomaly variations where aggregated by Land Cover Classes (LCCs) with R-2 values of 0.65 for savanna, 0.60 for grassland, 0.72 for shrubland, and 0.58 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. This is higher than for the same method applied to NDVI anomalies, with R-2 values of 0.57 for savanna, 0.50 for grassland, 032 for shrubland, and 0.57 for barren or sparsely vegetated areas. The approach of detrending NIR/SWIR based indices and spatially aggregating the anomalies do offer improved detection of intra-seasonal stress. However, quite coarse spatial aggregation is found necessary for a significant analysis outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The coastal zones are the most inhabited areas of the world and are therefore strongly affected by humans, leading to undesirable environmental changes that may alter the ecosystems, such as eutrophication. In order to evaluate changes in the environment an effective water quality monitoring system for the coastal zones must be in place. The chlorophyll-a concentration is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and as indicator for eutrophication and it can be retrieved from ocean colour remote sensing data. Several operational monitoring systems based on remote sensing are in place to monitor the open sea and, to some extent, the coastal zones. However, evaluations of coastal monitoring systems based on satellite data are scarce. This paper compares the chlorophyll-a concentrations retrieved from an operational satellite system based on MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer) data with ship-based monitoring for the productive seasons in 2008 and 2010, in a coastal area in the Baltic Sea. The comparisons showed that the satellite-based monitoring system is reliable and that the estimations of chlorophyll-a concentration are comparable to in situ measurements in terms of accuracy and quantitative retrieval. A very strong correlation was found between measurements from satellite-derived chlorophyll-a compared to in situ measurements taken close in time (0-3 days), with RMSE of 64% and a MNB of 17%. The comparison of the monthly means showed improved RMSE and a MNB of only 8%. Furthermore, this study shows that MERIS is better at capturing spatial dynamics and the extent of phytoplankton blooms than ship-based monitoring, since it has a synoptic view and higher temporal resolution. Satellite-based monitoring also increases the frequency of chlorophyll-a observations considerably, where the degree of improvement is dependent on the sampling frequency of the respective monitoring programme. Our results show that ocean colour remote sensing can, when combined with field sampling, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring and management of the coastal zone. These results are important for eutrophication assessment and status classifications of water basins and can be applied to a larger extent within national and international agreements considering the coastal zones, e.g. the European Commission's Water Framework Directive.

AB The launch of several new satellites such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, HyspIRI, EnMAP and PRISMA in the very near future, opens new perspectives for the inland and coastal water community. The monitoring of the water quality closer to the coast, within estuaries or small lakes with satellite data will become feasible. However for these inland and nearshore coastal waters, adjacency effects may hamper the correct retrieval of water quality parameters from remotely sensed imagery. Here, we present a sensor-generic adjacency pre-processing method, SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC). The correction algorithm estimates the contribution of the background radiance based on the correspondence with the Near-INfrared (NIR) similarity spectrum. The performance of SIMEC was tested on MERIS FR images both above highly reflecting waters with high SPM loads, as well as dark lake waters with high CDOM absorption. The results show that SIMEC has a positive or neutral effect on the normalized remote sensing reflectance above optically-complex waters, retrieved with the MERIS MEGS or UR processor.

AB The contribution of understory vegetation especially to the reflectance of boreal forest landscapes cannot be ignored. In this letter, we identify the most suitable angular configuration for accurate retrieval of the understory signal. We use a new high angular resolution bidirectional reflectance factor data set with accompanying in situ measurements of understory reflectance in two RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) mature stands in Jarvselja, Estonia. Our results are pertinent towards the ultimate goal of achieving more reliable estimates of biophysical properties of the tree layer through separating the effect of understory on forest reflectance.

AB Differentiation of forest growth stages through classification of single date or time-series of Landsat sensor data is limited because of insensitivity to their three-dimensional structure. This study therefore evaluated the benefits of integrating the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) L-band HH and HV polarisation response from the woody components of vegetation with Landsat-derived foliage projective cover (FPC). Focus was on 12 regional ecosystems (REs) distributed across the Brigalow Belt Bioregion (BRB) of Queensland, Australia, where different stages of growth dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) were widespread. From remnant areas of brigalow-dominated forests mapped previously for each RE by the Queensland Herbarium through field visits and interpretations of aerial imagery, frequency distributions of all three channels were extracted and compared to those of image segments generated using FPC and PALSAR data. For woody vegetation (with an FPC threshold of >= 9%) outside of the remnant areas, mature (non-remnant) forests were associated with segments where the HH and HV backscatter thresholds were within one standard deviation of the mean extracted for remnant forest. Early-stage regrowth was differentiated using an L-band HH threshold of < - 14 dB, common for all REs because of similarities in structure at this stage. The early-stage included forests regrowing over several decades and often occurred in areas recovering from recent clearing events. Objects falling between the early and mature stages were considered to be intermediate regrowth and/or degraded forest. All areas with an FPC <9% were mapped as non-forest.
   Within the BRB, the Queensland Herbarium established that forests with brigalow as a dominant or subdominant component originally occupied over 73 million ha but were reduced to 586,364 ha by 2009, with 460,499 ha (78.5%) having brigalow as the dominant component Using the Landsat FPC and ALOS PALSAR data, an additional 722,686 ha of brigalow-dominated regrowth forest were identified giving a total forested area (brigalow-dominated remnant and secondary forest) of 1,183,185 ha or 17.2% of the area of the 12 REs. Within this area, the greater proportion of regrowth (368,473 ha or 31.1%) was mapped as early stage primarily because of recovery following recent clearance events. 230,551 (19.5%) ha and 123,662 ha (10.5%) were mapped as intermediate and mature (non-remnant) stages respectively and the remainder (38.9%) was remnant forest. Users' and producers' accuracies were, respectively, 81% and 69% for early regrowth and 71% and 89% for mature and intermediate stage forests combined. The mapping, which used Queensland Herbarium's RE data to delineate brigalow extent, provided a structural, rather than age-based classification of growth stage, as is typically retrieved using time-series comparison of optical imagery. The regional estimates of growth/degradation stage generated for the BRB provide a basis for optimising the use and recovery of these threatened brigalow ecosystems with benefits for biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

AB The transformation of natural forest to non-forest cover is a dominant phenomenon in tropical regions; this creates unprecedented pressure to climate, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Owing to persistent clouds and other atmospheric effects in the region, forest managers are facing difficulties in mapping and monitoring the forest cover changes consistently. This article presents an automated mapping method and examines the potentials of ALOS PALSAR data for characterizing natural forest cover in the tropics. Several scenes of high-resolution PALSAR data with HH and HV polarizations were processed to cover Sumatra Island. The mapping method applied image segmentation and threshold techniques to discriminate land covers. Non-forest land covers were separated using HH backscatter thresholds, while forest cover was based on HV thresholds. Twenty-two thematic maps derived at different HV backscatter thresholds were evaluated by comparing the land cover classes of the reference data. Sampling theory was used to determine the required sample size and geographic locations of the reference data. Among the resulting maps, a map with a threshold of 115 dB HV backscatter was found to be more sensitive for portraying the spatial patterns of land covers in the study area. The overall mapping accuracy at this threshold was 79.34%. Regardless of the data size, this automated mapping approach yielded decent spatial patterns of land covers and proved to be applicable for high-resolution wall-to-wall mapping and monitoring of natural forest cover in wider tropical areas.

AB In this study, we examined the uncertainty of aboveground live biomass (AGB) estimates based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements distributed across a low-biomass vegetation structure gradient from forest to non-forest in boreal-like ecosystems. The conifer-dominant structure gradient was compiled from ground data amassed from multiple field expeditions in central Maine (USA), Aurskog (Norway), and across central Siberia (Russia). Single variable empirical models were built to model AGB from remote sensing metrics. Using these models, we calculated a root mean square error (RMSE) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RMSE from the difference between the remote sensing AGB predictions and the ground reference AGB estimates within AGB intervals across a 0-100 Mg ha(-1) boreal forest structure gradient. The results show that the error in AGB predictions (RMSE) and the error uncertainty (the CI) from LiDAR and SAR change across a forest gradient. The errors of airborne LiDAR and SAR metrics and spaceborne LiDAR platforms show a general trend of reduced relative errors as AGB magnitudes increase, particularly from 0 to 60 Mg ha(-1). Empirical models relating spaceborne metrics to AGB and estimates of spaceborne LiDAR error uncertainty demonstrate the difficulty of characterizing differences in AGB at the site-level with current spaceborne sensors, particularly below 80 Mg ha(-1) with less than 50-100% error.

AB Regional operational modeling systems that support forecasters for the real-time warning of flash flood events often suffer from lack of adequate real-time surface air temperature data to force their accumulation and ablation snow model. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) product from MODIS, which provides four instantaneous readings per day, was tested for its feasibility to be used in real-time to derive spatially distributed surface air temperature (T-a) forcing for the operational snow model. The study was conducted in the Southeast region of Turkey using an atypically dense network of hourly T-a, daily snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), and rainfall datasets for the period: October 2002-September 2010. A comparison between the T-a and the corresponding LST grid-cell data indicated close associations that are different in nature for periods with and without snow on the ground. The LST-derived T-a was compared with that obtained from on-site gauge-based interpolation procedures and climatological time series. The LST-derived T-a was found inferior only to the T-a derived from the interpolation of the dense gauge network (31-gauges). Snow-pack simulations using estimated T-a time series were compared to simulations that were forced by the observed T-a at each site of 18 sites. The 1ST-derived T-a performed well in simulating snow mass and maximum SWE magnitude, while it did not represent well the timing of the annual peak of SWE and the duration of spring melt. Our study concluded that the MODIS/LST product can be a valuable additional source of real time forcing data for regional operational snow models, especially in remote mountainous areas with sparse telemetric data.

AB The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MODIS Collection 5 land cover product (MCD12Q1) provides annually updated global land cover maps since 2001. This time series product has become an essential data source for the generation of many other land surface products and for a variety of regional and global studies. However, classification errors are inherent in the land cover product, which can misrepresent land cover transitions. In particular, land cover transitions are illogical if they contradict ecological rules and are unlikely to be observed. In this study, we evaluated the MODIS land cover product by analyzing the nature and magnitude of its illogical land cover transitions using annual MCD12Q1 land cover maps from 2001 to 2010. Our analysis revealed that illogical transitions exist in the product for all consecutive years, and are distributed most commonly in several regions over the world. To enhance the MODIS land cover product, we applied a spatial-temporal modeling algorithm that incorporates expert knowledge to reduce illogical transitions on five such "hotspot" tiles. The results showed substantial improvements in both accuracy and consistency of the land cover product using the spatial-temporal modeling algorithm. The percentage of illogical transitions in each of the five tiles was significantly reduced among consecutive years and across the entire time series. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the spatial-temporal modeling algorithm for producing high quality time series of land cover maps, and also highlights the importance of temporal consistency in land cover mapping.

AB We present a novel algorithm for detecting seasonal soil freezing processes using L-band microwave radiometry. L-band is the optimal choice of frequency for the monitoring of soil freezing, due to the inherent high contrast of the microwave signature between the frozen and thawed states of the soil medium. Dual-polarized observations of L-band brightness temperature at a range of observation angles were collected from a tower-based instrument, and evaluated against ancillary information on soil and snow properties over four winter seasons. During the first three winter periods the measurement site was located over mineral soil on a forest clearing, for the fourth winter the instrument was moved to a wetland site. Both sites are located in Sodankyla, Northern Finland. The test sites represent two environments typical for the northern boreal forest zone. The data were applied to derive an empirical relation between the onset and progress of soil freezing and the observed passive L-band signature. A retrieval algorithm was developed using the observations at the forest opening site. The algorithm exploits the perceived change in brightness temperature and the change in the relative difference between the signatures at horizontal and vertical polarization. With the collected experimental dataset, these features were linked optimally to the progress of soil freezing by choice of observation angle, polarization and temporal averaging. The wetland site observations provided the first opportunity for demonstrating the developed algorithm over a different soil type, giving a first estimate of the algorithm performance over larger heterogeneous targets. The future objective is to adapt the algorithm to L-band satellite observations. The present study is highly relevant for the development of freeze-thaw algorithms from current and future L-band satellite missions such as SMOS and SMAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The wind speed (WS) provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used to initialize the retrieval process of WS and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) obtained by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This process compensates for the lack of onboard instrument providing a measure of ocean surface WS independent of the L-band radiometer measurements. The SMOS-retrieved WS in the center of the swath (+/- 300 km) is adjusted regarding to its a priori estimate. The quality of the SMOS-retrieved SSS (SSSsmos) is better at the center of the swath than at the edge of the swatch because the larger number of brightness temperature measurements available at the center of the swath reduces the effects of noise and because the greater variety of incidence angles provides more scope for adjusting the WS. This highlights the advantage of using a multi-parameter retrieval with respect to a SSS-only retrieval in which the WS would be entirely prescribed. Systematic inconsistencies between the atmospheric WS modeled using ECMWF and the WS sensed by radiometers are observed. These inconsistencies in the WS are reduced by the retrieval scheme but they still lead to residual biases in the SSSsmos, especially in the eastern equatorial Pacific ocean if the ECMWF WS is used as an a priori estimate.(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The spatial and temporal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) is examined using daily, cloud-free Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) reconstructions during 2003-2012. The utility of the DINEOF SST and Chl-a is demonstrated through direct comparisons with buoy- and ship-based observations. EOF analyses of cloud-free products are further used to quantify the SST and Chl-a variability on seasonal to inter-annual timescales. The first mode of SST is dominated by an annual cycle in response to net surface heat flux, with SST lagging surface flux by similar to 57 days. The second mode of SST underscores interactions between GOM, the Scotian Shelf, and the slope sea in response to the basin scale atmospheric forcing represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation. The third mode correlates well with the evolution of Scotian Shelf-slope frontal displacement. The first EOF mode of Chl-a is dominated by a winter-spring bloom and a fall bloom, with a spatial distribution modified by the tidal mixing that facilitates nutrient delivery from the deep ocean. The second EOF mode is likely associated with a winter bloom in the warm slope sea, where the low-frequency variations of second modes of SST and Chl-a are in phase, suggesting a possible coupling between physical and biological responses to atmospheric forcing. The third mode of the Chl-a is likely associated with freshening events associated with advection of the Scotian Shelf Water, which enhance stratifications in the eastern GOM.

AB The middle reaches of Yarlung-Zangbo River (YZR) and its two tributaries (Lhasa River and Nianchu River) is a main agricultural region in central Tibet Autonomous Region. Soil water deficit (SWD) estimation has significant relevance to local crop growth monitoring, crop yield assessment and disaster monitoring. It also has great theoretical importance for understanding the local energy and water balance status. In this paper, AVHRR and MODIS data on 14 April 2003, 16 October 2003 under nearly clear weather conditions are selected as the spring and autumn cases. Land surface parameters, such as land surface temperature, surface albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and emissivity, have been derived from different algorithms for AVHRR and MODIS data. In combination with meteorological data, the soil water deficit index is determined by applying Surface Energy Balance System. The R square values between SWDI and AMSR-E soil moisture are ranging from 0.457 to 0.607, with spring SWD being much more severe than that in autumn. The limited river runoff (less than 5% of the annual total) is the dominant factor for spring SWD. This study also reveals that the derived spring SWD from AVHRR and MODIS data is quite different on the same day. This phenomenon is caused by different satellite overpass times which influence the melting frozen soil. This also confirms that the soil moisture may have diurnal variations. The spatial variations of SWD conditions in the middle reaches of YZR and its two tributaries have been clearly identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Tree species classification accuracy at the individual tree crown (ITC) level depends on many factors, among which in this paper we analyzed: i) the remote sensing data used for the ITC delineation process carried out prior to the classification, and ii) the pixels considered inside each ITC during the classification process. These two factors were analyzed on the ITC level classification accuracy of boreal tree species (Pine, Spruce and Broad-leaves), considering two remote sensing data types: hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS). ITCs were delineated automatically on ALS and on hyperspectral data. A manual ITC delineation was used as reference in the analysis. The pixel level classification was performed on the hyperspectral bands using a non-linear support vector machine. The classification at ITC level was obtained by applying a majority voting rule to the classified pixels confined by each ITC. The results showed that ITCs automatically delineated from hyperspectral data were usually smaller than those from ALS, and the tree detection rate for hyperspectral data was much lower compared to ALS data (28.4 versus 48.5%). Regarding the classification results, using only manually delineated ITCs a kappa accuracy of 0.89 was obtained, while using only automatically delineated ITCs from hyperspectral or ALS data reduced the kappa values to 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Slightly different results were achieved using semi-automatic approaches based on both manual and automatically delineated ITC (0.81 and 0.74, respectively). A selection of only certain pixels inside each ITC improved the classification accuracy from 1 to 7 percentage points. A selection based on the spectral values of the pixels was found more influential than the one based on the ALS-derived canopy height model. The best results were obtained after a selection based on the spectral values in the bands in the blue region of the spectrum using either the Otsu method or an ad-hoc percentile-based thresholding method.

AB Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) data determine the amount of net longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface and are therefore critical variables for studying a variety of surface-atmosphere processes over land such as evapotranspiration, land cover change, and surface composition. Because emissivity is an intrinsic property of the surface, multispectral thermal infrared emissivity data have the potential for enhancing our ability to monitor landscape changes in environmentally sensitive zones beyond what is currently possible from standard practices used today. The most common of these practices is the use of visible to short-wave infrared data, in particular the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Two algorithms are currently used to generate the LST&E products from MODIS data, but studies have identified several issues with both these algorithms that limit their usefulness for land cover change detection. These issues have been recently addressed by applying the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm to MODIS thermal infrared data to generate LST and a dynamically varying multispectral emissivity product for bands 29, 31, and 32 at 1-km resolution. The new product (MOD21) will be released with MODIS Collection 6 during fall 2013. This study demonstrates the utility of the dynamic MOD21 multispectral emissivity product to detect land cover changes over a broad range of different Earth surface domains including land degradation in dryland regions, snow melt characteristics on glaciers and ice sheets, extreme ecosystem disturbances, and agricultural activities. The MOD21 spectral emissivity provided increased sensitivity to land cover change in a more consistent manner than is currently possible with other emissivity products and, depending on the application, standard visible to near infrared (VNIR) data. The results suggest that synergistic use of thermal and VNIR data will help us to better identify and understand changes in the Earth surface system, and reduce uncertainties in estimating their magnitudes and trends.

AB Near surface soil moisture is being estimated from space-borne passive microwave observations through inverting a physically-based radiative transfer model (RTM), the land surface microwave emission model (LSMEM) at Princeton University for the past several years. The existing retrieval scheme utilizes only the horizontal (H) polarization measurement from a single channel (10.65 GHz). This physically-based approach requires a relatively large number of parameters, and it generally suffers from large biases/errors due to the difficulty in determining the correct parameters. This study characterizes these errors in order to improve the retrieval performance. Through model sensitivity analysis, this study finds that a dual polarization approach (using both horizontal and vertical polarizations) is needed to infer the correct vegetation opacity and correct polarization mixing measured by the space-borne sensor. Revisions are then made to the LSMEM formulations and soil moisture retrieval algorithm by 1) combining two vegetation parameters and one roughness parameter into one effective vegetation optical depth (VOD) value; and 2) providing an additional model equation that estimates the effective VOD from both polarizations and an initial guess of soil moisture value. The new retrieval algorithm is implemented to produce a daily 0.25 degrees gridded soil moisture dataset based on observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E). Validations are performed globally against land surface model simulations and at local/point scale against in-situ data within the continental United States. The new retrievals are shown to have good and robust performance over most parts of the world in terms of reproducing the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture.

AB Ground, airborne and spaceborne data were collected for a 450 ha prescribed fire implemented on 18 October 2011 at the Henry W. Coe State Park in California. The integration of various data elements allowed near-coincident active fire retrievals to be estimated. The Autonomous Modular Sensor-Wildfire CAMS) airborne multispectral imaging system was used as a bridge between ground and spaceborne data sets providing high-quality reference information to support satellite fire retrieval error analyses and fire emissions estimates. We found excellent agreement between peak fire radiant heat flux data (<1% error) derived from near-coincident ground radiometers and AMS. Both MODIS and GOES imager active fire products were negatively influenced by the presence of thick smoke, which was misclassified as cloud by their algorithms, leading to the omission of fire pixels beneath the smoke, and resulting in the underestimation of their retrieved fire radiative power (FRP) values for the burn plot, compared to the reference airborne data. Agreement between airborne and spaceborne FRP data improved significantly after correction for omission errors and atmospheric attenuation, resulting in as low as 5% difference between Aqua/MODIS and AMS. Use of in situ fuel and fire energy estimates in combination with a collection of AMS, MODIS, and GOES FRP retrievals provided a fuel consumption factor of 0.261 kg MJ(-1), total energy release of 14.5e + 06 MJ, and total fuel consumption of 3.8e + 06 kg. Fire emissions were calculated using two separate techniques, resulting in as low as 15% difference for various species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated fifteen algorithms representing four major categories of retrieval algorithms for aquatic colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM): empirical, semi-analytical, optimization, and matrix inversion methods. The specific goal here was to evaluate (and understand) the strengths and limits of these algorithms in predicting CDOM dynamics along a gradient of varying water quality in a large, freshwater ecosystem. The data were collected in May and October of 2012 from the estuarine areas of the Kawkawlin and Saginaw Rivers, and Lake Huron. Algorithms were evaluated through comparisons to in-situ CDOM measurements, such that the analysis of these field measurements showed that CDOM levels in these areas displayed a range of CDOM absorption coefficients a(CDOM)(440) (0.1-8.5 m(-1)). In general, the majority of the algorithms underestimated high CDOM waters(a(CDOM)(440)>2 m(-1)) and overestimated low CDOM scenarios (<0.5 m(-1)). Six algorithms that performed consistently better compared with the other models (overall RMSE of <0.45) in estimating in-situ CDOM levels were three empirical, two semi-analytical, and one MIM algorithms. Our analysis identified a set of parameters for the matrix inversion methods (MIM) that allow them to work effectively across a broad range of CDOM levels. Analysis of our results indicated that the most effective wavelengths/band locations for estimating CDOM could vary depending on the levels of spectral interference from high concentrations of particulate matter in the water column. In addition, our results suggest that including wavelengths > 600 nm in the algorithms improves CDOM estimation accuracy significantly, particularly for complex freshwater environments.

AB Accurate mapping of both elevation and plant distributions in salt marshes is important for management and conservation goals. Although light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is effective at measuring surface elevations, laser penetration is limited in dense salt marsh vegetation. In a previous study, we found that LIDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) error varied with vegetation cover. We derived cover-class-specific correction factors to reduce these errors, including separate corrections for three different height classes of Spartina alterniflora, the dominant macrophyte in southeastern U.S. salt marshes. In order to apply these cover class-specific corrections, it is necessary to have information on the distribution of cover classes in a LIDAR-derived DEM. Hyperspectral imagery has been shown to be suitable for the separation of salt marsh vegetation species by spectral signatures, and can be used to determine cover classes; however, there is persistent confusion both among the different height classes of S. alterniflora and between plants and mud (the Spartina problem). This paper presents a method to overcome the respective limitations of MAR and hyperspectral imagery through the use of multisensor data. An initial classification of hyperspectral imagery based on the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used in a decision tree in combination with elevation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the hyperspectral imagery to map nine salt marsh cover classes. The derision tree appreciably reduced the Spartina problem by reassigning classes using these ancillary data and resulted in a final overall classification accuracy of 90%, with a quantity disagreement of 1% and an allocation disagreement of 9%. The resulting hyperspectral image classification was then used as the basis for applying cover class-specific elevation correction factors to the LIDAR-derived DEM. Applying these correction factors greatly improved the accuracy of the DEM: overall mean error decreased from 0.10 +/- 0.12 (SD) to -0.003 +/- 0.10 m, and root mean squared error from 0.15 to 0.10 m. Our results suggest that the use of decision trees to combine elevation and spectral information can aid both hyperspectral image classification and DEM elevation mapping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study provides a baseline quality check on provisional Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) products as generated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center using Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software. Characterization of the Landsat SR products leveraged comparisons between aerosol optical thickness derived from LEDAPS and measured by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), as well as reflectance correlations with field spectrometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Results consistently indicated similarity between LEDAPS and alternative data products in longer wavelengths over vegetated areas with no adjacent water, while less reliable performance was observed in shorter wavelengths and sparsely vegetated areas. This study demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the atmospheric correction methodology used in LEDAPS, confirming its successful implementation to generate Landsat SR products.

AB Foliage profiles retrieved from a scanning, terrestrial, near-infrared (1064 nm), full-waveform lidar, the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI), agree well with those obtained from an airborne, near-infrared, full-waveform, large footprint lidar, the Lidar Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). We conducted trials at 5 plots within a conifer stand at Sierra National Forest in August, 2008. Foliage profiles retrieved from these two lidar systems are closely correlated (e.g., r = 0.987 at 100 m horizontal distances) at large spatial coverage while they differ significantly at small spatial coverage, indicating the apparent scanning perspective effect on foliage profile retrievals. Also we noted the obvious effects of local topography on foliage profile retrievals, particularly on the topmost height retrievals. With a fine spatial resolution and a small beam size, terrestrial lidar systems complement the strengths of the airborne lidars by making a detailed characterization of the crowns from a small field site, and thereby serving as a validation tool and providing localized tuning information for future airborne and spaceborne lidar missions.

AB Lake Bogoria is a saline-alkaline lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley, known for supporting dense blooms of cyanobacteria and large flocks of up to 1 million Lesser Flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor). An algorithm for the remote sensing of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass, has been developed using a time series of Landsat images and in situ measurements. In situ measured reflectance spectra were resampled to Landsat bands, and the near infrared (NIR) band, R-535, was found to be well represented by a linear relationship to Chl-a (R-2 = 0.847; Standard error, SE = 55 mu g l(-1); Samples, N = 14) for concentrations up to 800 lig l(-1). The band ratio R-835/R-660 also showed a strong linear relationship with Chl-a (R-2 = 0.811; SE = 61 mu g l(-1), N = 14). Similar relationships were derived using Landsat satellite imagery and monthly in situ Chl-a data for the period Nov 2003-Feb 2905. The NIR:Red ratio gave a better fit to Chl-a than a single NIR band algorithm when applied to satellite imagery, and the ratio performed best when based on TOA reflectance rather than atmospherically corrected data. Hence an algorithm for Chl-a was derived based on the TOA Landsat reflectance ratio, R-835/R-660, which showed a strong fit against Chl-a (R-2 = 0.801; SE = 69 mu g l(-1), N = 33) despite the limitations of time coincidence for the available satellite-in situ matches (less than 8 days). Lesser Flamingos feed on cyanobacteria in saline-alkaline lakes, therefore the algorithm can be used to monitor changes in their food supply, providing valuable information for their future conservation. The study also allowed characterisation of the optical properties in Lake Bogoria and provides insight into the changes occurring during cyanobacterial bloom and die-off events.

AB Vegetation is a fundamental element in urban ecosystems, and vegetation mapping is critical for urban and landscape planning and management. While remote sensing has increasingly been used for vegetation mapping, this spatially explicit approach can be challenging due to the spectral similarity between various vegetation types and the presence of complex features in the urban environment. The objective of this study is to develop a method that can help improve vegetation mapping in urban areas from medium-resolution remote sensor imagery. Central to our method is the combined use of stratified classification and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) techniques. Specifically, we firstly partition the entire landscape into rural and urban subsets using road network density so that each subset can be processed independently to minimize the spectral confusion between some urban features and agricultural land covers. Secondly, we carefully extract all vegetation covers at the sub-pixel level for the urban subset by using the MESMA technique in order to account for small, fragmented vegetation patches that would be classified as non-vegetated classes otherwise. Thirdly, we adopt a separate supervised classification protocol to the rural subset and the vegetation covers extracted from the urban subset. Finally, we combine the classified outcomes from the two subsets to produce a complete map. We have implemented this method to produce a land cover map including various vegetation types from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image covering a large metropolitan area. It is found that this method has substantially outperformed two related ones that use the same supervised protocol to the entire area directly or to the rural subset and the urban subset without being MESMA processed. The advantage of our method is that it has extended the capability of sub-pixel analysis beyond vegetation abundance estimation and into the area of mapping thematic vegetation types in urban areas.

AB The use of satellites to monitor the color of the ocean requires effective removal of the atmospheric signal. This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties to the visible from the near-infra-red (NIR) spectral region assuming that seawater is totally absorbent in this latter part of the spectrum, the so-called black pixel assumption. While this assumption is verified for most phytoplankton dominated waters, it is invalid in turbid waters. Consequently, for the past ten years, several algorithms have been developed on alternative assumptions. Studies comparing these algorithms are of great interest for further improvement in water leaving radiance (L-w(lambda)) retrievals from satellite images explaining the focus of the present research. Four published atmospheric correction algorithms for MODIS-Aqua are compared: (1) the standard NIR algorithm of NASA, (2) the NIR similarity spectrum algorithm, (3) the NIR-SWIR algorithm and (4) an Artificial Neural Network algorithm. The MODIS-Aqua estimated normalized L-w(lambda) are validated with AERONET-Ocean Color data and cruise measurements presenting moderately to highly turbid waters. Based on a match-up exercise, the former three algorithms show the best results in the green region of the spectrum (relative error, RE, between 11 and 20%) and the largest errors in the blue and red region of the spectrum (RE exceeding 30%). In contrast, the Artificial Neural Network algorithm performs better in the red band (RE of 22%). The latter tends to overestimate the normalized L-w(lambda) at all wavelengths while the NIR similarity spectrum algorithm tends to underestimate it. Retrievals of aerosol products, such as the Angstrom coefficient, alpha(531,869), and the optical thickness, iota(869), present RE above 44% and 72%, respectively.
   The performance of the algorithms is also investigated as a function of water types. For water masses mainly dominated by phytoplankton, the standard NIR algorithm performs better. In contrast, for water masses mainly dominated by detrital and mineral material, the neural network-based algorithm shows the best results. The largest errors are encountered above water masses dominated by high phytoplankton and CDOM concentrations. This work conducted to a number of perspectives for improving the atmospheric correction algorithms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Amazon River floodplain is subject to large seasonal variations in water level and flood extent, due to the large size and low relief of the basin, and the large amount of precipitation in the region. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can be used to map flooded area in these wetlands, given its ability to provide continuous information without being heavily affected by cloud cover. As part of JAXA's Kyoto & Carbon Initiative, extensive wide-swath, multi-temporal SAR coverage of the Amazon basin has been obtained using the ScanSAR mode of ALOS PALSAR This study presents a method for monitoring flood extent variation using ALOS ScanSAR images, tested at the Curuai Lake floodplain, in the lower Amazon River, Brazil. Twelve ScanSAR scenes were acquired between 2006 and 2010, including seven during the 2007 hydrological year. Water level records, field photographs, optical images (Landsat-5/TM and MODIS/Ferra and Aqua) and topographic data were used as auxiliary information. A data mining algorithm allowed the implementation of a hierarchical, object-based classification algorithm, able to map land cover types and flooding status in the study area for all available dates. land cover based on the entire time series (classification levels 1 and 2) had overall accuracies of 90% and 83%, respectively. Level 3 classifications (one map per image date) were validated only for the lowest and highest water stages, with overall accuracies of 76% and 78%, respectively. Total flood extent (Level 4) was mapped with 84% and 94% accuracies, for the low and high water stages, respectively. Regression models were fitted between mapped flooded area and water levels at the Curuai gauge to predict flood extent. A polynomial model had R-2=0.95 (p<0.05) and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 241 km(2), while a logistic model had R-2=0.98 (p<0.05) and RMSE = 127 km(2). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Self-calibrated evaporation-based disaggregation of SMOS soil moisture:

AB A disaggregation algorithm is applied to 40 km resolution SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) surface soil moisture using 1 km resolution MODIS (MODerature resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), 90 m resolution ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer), and 60 m resolution Landsat-7 data. DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) distributes high-resolution soil moisture around the low-resolution observed mean value using the instantaneous spatial link between optical-derived soil evaporative efficiency (ratio of actual to potential evaporation) and near-surface soil moisture. The objective is three-fold: (i) evaluating DISPATCH at a range of spatial resolutions using readily available multi-sensor thermal data, (ii) deriving a robust calibration procedure solely based on remotely sensed data, and (iii) testing the linear or nonlinear behavior of soil evaporative efficiency. Disaggregated soil moisture is compared with the 0-5 cm in situ measurements collected each month from April to October 2011 in a 20 km square spanning an irrigated and dry land area in Catalunya, Spain. The target downscaling resolution is set to 3 km using MODIS data and to 100 m using ASTER and Landsat data. When comparing 40 km SMOS, 3 km disaggregated and 100 m disaggregated data with the in situ measurements aggregated at corresponding resolution, results indicate that DISPATCH improves the spatio-temporal correlation with in situ measurements at both 3 km and 100 m resolutions. A yearly calibration of DISPATCH is more efficient than a daily calibration. Assuming a linear soil evaporative efficiency model is adequate at kilometric resolution. At 100 m resolution, the very high spatial variability in the irrigated area makes the linear approximation poorer. By accounting for non-linearity effects, the slope of the linear regression between disaggregated and in situ measurements is increased from 0.2 to 0.5. Such a multi-sensor remote sensing approach has potential for operational multi-resolution monitoring of surface soil moisture and is likely to help parameterize soil evaporation at integrated spatial scales.

AB The use of spaceborne medium resolution imaging spectrometers with neural network algorithms has proven a large potential for application with optically complex inland waters. We make use of this approach to investigate the bio-physical dynamics in a eutrophic lake, applying three different neural networks to a dataset of 16 images acquired in June through August 2011. Concurrent in-situ data are measured by means of automatically deployed instruments from a moored platform, resolving the vertical distribution of various parameters at sub-daily temporal resolution. Phytoplankton blooms occur in different stratification layers, allowing the assessment of their influence on remote sensing estimates. A qualitative synopsis of the biophysical processes in the lake is given, but parameterization with in-situ attenuation profiles and accurate IOP estimates is needed to significantly enhance quantitative matchup comparisons. Recommendations on the combination of in-situ and satellite measurements are therefore given as an outlook. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current operational approaches to ocean color remote sensing tend to be least accurate in coastal regions with waters rich in terrigenous material. Semi-analytical models can be used to retrieve the absorption and backscattering properties of dissolved and suspended materials unique to these environments, and subsequently biogeochemical parameters such as total suspended material (TSM) and chlorophyll (Chl). In this study, optical data collected over several years are used to select and optimize a semi-analytical ocean color algorithm for the dynamic and optically complex Long Island Sound estuary. The most successful algorithm requires a red reflectance channel between 600 and 650 nm, which is not included in many current ocean color sensors, but is essential in highly scattering waters. Regional optimization including the use of a dynamic, spectrally variable f/Q a value related to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), results in an approximately five-fold decrease in retrieval bias in highly backscattering, sediment-laden waters near river outflows. Retrievals of dissolved and particulate spectral absorption, backscattering, dissolved and detrital absorption coefficients and total suspended matter obtained from the optimized algorithm agree well with field observations (r(2) >= 0.90). These parameters are useful for assessing riverine discharge, mixing and residence times of surface waters, as well as assessing the turbidity and light penetration in this estuary. Estimation of Chl remains challenging (r(2) = 0.59) due to the stepwise nature of the algorithm and the relatively high proportion of dissolved and non-algal constituents masking phytoplankton absorption (generally <20% of total absorption at 440 nm). Moreover, diverse phytoplankton assemblages throughout the region create variability between spectral absorption and chlorophyll and highlight the benefits of increased spectral resolution of ocean color satellites going forward.

AB The objectives of this study were to estimate above ground forest biomass and identify areas disturbed by selective logging in a 1000 ha Brazilian tropical forest in the Antimary State Forest (FEA) using airborne lidar data. The study area consisted of three management units, two of which were unlogged, while the third unit was selectively logged at a low intensity (approximately 10-15 m(3) ha(-1) or 5-8% of total volume). A systematic random sample of fifty 0.25-ha ground plots were measured and used to construct lidar-based regression models for above ground biomass (AGB). A lidar model-assisted approach was used to estimate AGB for the logged and unlogged units (using both synthetic and model-assisted estimators). Two lidar explanatory variables, computed at a spatial resolution of 50 m x 50 m, were used in these predictions: 1) the first quartile height of all above ground returns (P25); and, 2) variance of the height above ground of all returns (VAR). The model-assisted AGB estimator (total 231,589 Mg +/- 5,477 SE; mean 231.6 Mg ha(-1) +/- 5.5 SE; +/- 2.4%) was more precise than plot-only simple random sample estimator (total 230,872 Mg +/- 10,477 SE; mean 230.9 Mg ha(-1) +/- 10.5 SE; +/- 4.5%). The total and mean AGB estimates obtained using the synthetic estimator (total 231,694 Mg; mean 231.7 Mg ha(-1)) were nearly equal those obtained using the modelassisted estimator. In a second component of the analysis lidar metrics were also computed at 1 m x 1 m resolution to identify areas impacted by logging activities within the selectively harvested management unit. A high-resolution canopy relative density model (RDM) was used in GIS to identify and delineate roads, skidtrails, landings and harvested tree gaps. The area impacted by selective logging determined from the RDM was 58.4 ha or 15.4% of the total management unit. Using these two spatial resolutions of lidar analyses it was possible to identify differences in AGB in selectively logged areas that had relatively high levels of residual overstory canopy cover. The mean AGB obtained from the synthetic estimator was significantly lower in impacted areas than in undisturbed areas of the selectively logged management unit (p = 0.01). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A spatially continuous field of landscape fractional covers of tree, grass and bare soil is required at regional and continental scales for earth system modeling and environmental monitoring. Climate and its variability drive vegetation fractional cover over time and space. For savanna ecosystems, precipitation plays the main role in shaping vegetation composition. In this study, we estimate land cover fraction at a satellite pixel scale by employing an existing 'Mean-Sensitivity Unmixing Algorithm' (MSUA), which is based on a state space defined by two key variables: (1) mean pixel values (referring to mean vegetation states), and (2) inter-annual sensitivity of pixel values to precipitation (referring to vegetation sensitivity to precipitation). We define these two variables through a multi-sensor assessment of three vegetation remote sensing datasets, namely (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the visible and near-infrared bands from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR); (ii) backscatter coefficients (dB) from the NASA QuikSCAT active-microwave scatterometer; and (iii) Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) based on NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) passive-microwave radiometry measurements. A merged satellite-gauge precipitation dataset from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) version 3B42V6 is used. The three remote sensing datasets show generally similar but distinctive performances in characterizing the two key variables over various land cover types. NDVI and VOD perform better than dB in characterizing land cover variation based on mean pixel values; while dB represents more reliable and robust vegetation sensitivity to precipitation. By using NDVI for mean vegetation states and dB for inter-annual variability of vegetation to precipitation, we develop an improved fractional cover product. We find that our product agrees well with the tree fraction derived from high-resolution images for natural vegetation regions, and can reproduce the distinctive land cover pattern of grass and bare soil in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product. For cropland-mixed regions, our tree fraction is overestimated since human impacts (e.g. irrigation) have not been accounted for in the MSUA. The improved performance from our approach is achieved by the synergistic use of the three vegetation remote sensing datasets, and their physical interpretations have been discussed to support the validity of this approach.

AB The identification of tree species is an important issue in forest management. In recent years, many studies have explored this topic using hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR data. In this study we analyzed two multi-sensor set-ups: 1) airborne high spatial resolution hyperspectral images combined with LiDAR data; and 2) high spatial resolution satellite multispectral images combined with LiDAR data. Two LiDAR acquisitions were considered: low point density (approx. 0.48 points per m(2)) and high point density (approx. 8.6 points per m(2)). The aims of this work were: i) to understand what level of classification accuracy can be achieved using a high spectral and spatial resolution multi-sensor data set-up (very high spatial and spectral resolution airborne hyperspectral images integrated with high point density LiDAR data), over a mountain area characterized by many species, both broadleaf and coniferous; ii) to understand the implications of a downgrading of the data characteristics (in terms of spectral resolution of spectral data and point density of LiDAR data), on species separability, with respect to the previous set-up; and iii) to understand the differences between high- and low-point density LiDAR acquisitions on tree species classification. The study region was a mountain area in the Southern Alps characterized by many tree species (7 species and a "non-forest" class), either coniferous or broadleaf. For each set-up a specific processing chain was adopted, from the pre-processing of the raw data to the classification (two classifiers were used: support vector machine and random forest). Different class definitions were tested, including general macro-classes, forest types, and finally single tree species. Experimental results showed that the set-up based on hyperspectral data was effective with general macro-classes, forest types, and single species, reaching high kappa accuracies (93.2%, 82.1% and 76.5%, respectively). The use of multispectral data produced a reduction in the classification accuracy, which was sharp for single tree species, and still high for forest types. Considering general macro-classes, the multispectral set-up was still very accurate (85.8%). Regarding LiDAR data, the experimental analysis showed that high density LiDAR data provided more information for tree species classification with respect to low density data, when combined with either hyperspectral or multispectral data.

AB The estimation of water storage variations in lakes is essential for water resource management activities in a region. In areas of ungauged or poorly gauged water bodies, satellite altimetry acts as a powerful tool to measure changes in surface water level. Remote sensing provides images of temporal coastline variations, and a combination of both measurement techniques can indicate a change in water volume. In this study variations of the water level of the Aral Sea were computed for the period 2002-2011 from the combination of radar and laser satellite altimetry data sets over the lake. The estimated water levels were analyzed in combination with coastline changes from Landsat images in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the lake water changes. In addition to these geometrical observations temporal changes of water storage in the lake and its surrounding were computed from GRACE satellite gravimetry. With respect to its temporal evolution the GRACE results agree very well with the geometrical changes determined from altimetry and Landsat. The advancing desiccation until the beginning of 2009 and a subsequent abrupt gain of water in 2009-2010 due to exceptional discharge from Amu Darya can clearly be identified in all data sets.

AB The interest in the joint use of remote sensing data from multiple sensors has been remarkably increased for environmental applications. This is because a combined use is supposed to improve the results of e.g. forest modeling tasks compared to single-data use. To explore the ability of combined airborne 2D and 3D information to describe the forest structure in local level, we employed various height/intensity metrics from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and original reflectance, indices, and linear transformations of airborne hyperspectral HyMap data to build spatial models of stem density, above ground total biomass, and biomass of coniferous species in a temperate forest site in Germany. The study area was stratified into coniferous, deciduous and mixed strata using the plot information from forest inventory data. Combinations of data sources were tested, and an evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to tailor the numerous predictor variables to final parsimonious sets. Most Similar Neighbor (MSN) approach based on variance-weighted canonical correlations were used to make simultaneous single-Nearest Neighbor (NN) models of the attributes, where NN was searched either within the whole geographical domain or within the restricted forest strata. Results were evaluated by leave-one-out cross validations on 1000 bootstrap resample data. They showed that the LiDAR height metrics (descriptive statistics and percentiles) provided the most effective information amongst the entire data source combinations, while the HyMap metrics contributed only slightly to describe the variation beyond those explained by ALS data. Furthermore, restricted NN search improved the performance and returned approximately unbiased models of all the responses. The GA-screened HyMap predictors corresponded well to the atmospheric windows in visual and NIR domains, as well as to the mean reflectance curve of Scots Pine across the study area. It is concluded that GA-screened models featuring 9-12 predictors containing LiDAR height metrics and few HyMap original channels can be suggested for timely-efficient, unbiased modeling of area-based forest structural attributes.

AB Understory trees in multilayered stands are often ignored in forest inventories. Information about them would benefit silviculture, wood procurement, and biodiversity management. Cost-efficient inventory methods are needed and airborne LiDAR is a promising addition to fieldwork. The overstory, however, obstructs wall-to-wall sampling of the understory using LiDAR, because transmission losses affect echo-triggering probabilities and intensity (peak amplitude) observations. We examined the potential of LiDAR in mapping of understory trees in pine (Pinus sylvestris L) stands (62 degrees N, 24 degrees E), using careful experimentation. We formulated a conceptual model for the transmission losses and illustrated that loss normalization is highly ill-posed, especially for vegetation. The losses skew the population of targets that produce a subsequent echo. Losses up to 10-15% can occur even if an overstory echo is not triggered. In LiDAR sensors, quantized intensity values start from binary zero, but actually should include an offset, the noise level. We estimated these empirically. Constraining to low-loss pulses and ground data, we estimated parameters for compensation models that were based on the radar equation and employed the geometry of the pulse, as well as the overstory intensity observations as predictors. Intensity variation of second-return data was reduced, but, the intensity data were deemed of low value in species discrimination. Our results highlight differences between sensors in near-ground echo-triggering and height data. Area-based LiDAR height metrics from the understory had reasonable correlation with the density and mean height of the understory trees, whereas tree species seemed out of reach even if the transmission losses were compensated for. We conclude that transmission losses are a general impediment for radiometric analysis of multi-echo pulses in discrete-return and waveform LiDAR data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sediment loading is one of the primary threats to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. We have developed a high resolution (250 m) ocean color satellite tool to monitor sediment concentrations in the Bay. In situ optical and sediment sampling is used to develop a total suspended matter (TSM) algorithm for the Chesapeake Bay. The Coastal Optical Characterization Experiment (COCE) is part of an ongoing effort to optically characterize processes and to develop regional remote sensing ocean color algorithms in the coastal waters. The goal is to characterize sediment concentrations and to develop a tool to track plumes cascading down the Bay following heavy rainfall events. Background TSM concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed can also be characterized. The plumes can have potentially devastating effects on the Chesapeake Bay's fragile ecosystem by increasing nutrient loads, depositing sediments, and decreasing salinity and light levels. Sampling took place throughout 2006 to 2008 in the upper and mid portions of the Chesapeake Bay. Measurements of TSM, chlorophyll a (Chl), and hyperspectral optics were collected. The optical measurements included above water surface irradiance (E-s(lambda)), in-water downwelling irradiance (E-d(lambda)) and in-water upwelling radiance (L-u(lambda)). These optical data were used to analyze the performance and utility of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Band 1 (645 nm) for use as a TSM monitoring tool. From the optical measurements we have derived a 3rd order polynomial regression of TSM to normalized water-leaving radiance (r(2) = 0.79) to form an algorithm that quantitatively relates TSM to the MODIS 250 m resolution band 1 (645 nm). The algorithm performance was validated (a mean percent difference of -4.2%) against 270 total suspended solids samples collected by the Chesapeake Bay Program during routine water quality monitoring of the Chesapeake Bay environment. The TSM algorithm tool is then used to demonstrate monitoring of significant runoff events that occurred in June, 2006 and March, 2008. In addition, the utility of the Chesapeake Bay TSM product is demonstrated by describing regional and seasonal variations in sediment concentrations throughout the Chesapeake Bay for 2009. Mean concentrations ranged from 11.55 mg/l in the upper Chesapeake Bay winter season to 6.37 mg/l in the middle Chesapeake Bay spring season. These remote sensing tools can be valuable instruments in the detection and tracking of runoff events and background concentration for monitoring the health and recovery of the Chesapeake Bay.

AB Time series of satellite data provide unparalleled information on the response of vegetation to climate variability. Detecting subtle changes in vegetation over time requires consistent satellite-based measurements. Here, the impact of sensor degradation on trend detection was evaluated using Collection 5 data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua platforms. For Terra MODIS, the impact of blue band (Band 3.470 nm) degradation on simulated surface reflectance was most pronounced at near-nadir view angles, leading to a 0.001-0.004 yr(-1) decline in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) under a range of simulated aerosol conditions and surface types. Observed trends in MODIS NDVI over North America were consistent with simulated results, with nearly a threefold difference in negative NDVI trends derived from Terra (17.4%) and Aqua (6.7%) MODIS sensors during 2002-2010. Planned adjustments to Terra MODIS calibration for Collection 6 data reprocessing will largely eliminate this negative bias in detection of NDVI trends. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For remote sensing of aerosol over the ocean, there is a contribution from light scattered under water. The brightness and spectrum of this light depends on the biomass content of the ocean, such that variations in the color of the ocean can be observed even from space. Rayleigh scattering by pure sea water, and Rayleigh-Gans type scattering by plankton, causes this light to be polarized with a distinctive angular distribution. To study the contribution of this underwater light polarization to multiangle, multispectral observations of polarized reflectance over ocean, we previously developed a hydrosol model for use in underwater light scattering computations that produces realistic variations of the ocean color and the underwater light polarization signature of pure sea water. In this work we review this hydrosol model, include a correction for the spectrum of the particulate scattering coefficient and backscattering efficiency, and discuss its sensitivity to variations in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and in the scattering function of marine particulates. We then apply this model to measurements of total and polarized reflectance that were acquired over open ocean during the MILAGRO field campaign by the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Analyses show that our hydrosol model faithfully reproduces the water-leaving contributions to RSP reflectance, and that the sensitivity of these contributions to Chlorophyll a concentration [Chl] in the ocean varies with the azimuth, height, and wavelength of observations. We also show that the impact of variations in CDOM on the polarized reflectance observed by the RSP at low altitude is comparable to or much less than the standard error of this reflectance whereas their effects in total reflectance may be substantial (i.e. up to >30%). Finally, we extend our study of polarized reflectance variations with [Chl] and CDOM to include results for simulated spaceborne observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimating snow mass at continental scales is difficult, but important for understanding land-atmosphere interactions, biogeochemical cycles and the hydrology of the Northern latitudes. Remote sensing provides the only consistent global observations, but with unknown errors. We test the theoretical performance of the Chang algorithm for estimating snow mass from passive microwave measurements using the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow microwave emission model. The algorithm's dependence upon assumptions of fixed and uniform snow density and grainsize is determined, and measurements of these properties made at the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) Colorado field site in 2002-2003 used to quantify the retrieval errors caused by differences between the algorithm assumptions and measurements. Deviation from the Chang algorithm snow density and grainsize assumptions gives rise to an error of a factor of between two and three in calculating snow mass. The possibility that the algorithm performs more accurately over large areas than at points is tested by simulating emission from a 25 km diameter area of snow with a distribution of properties derived from the snow pit measurements, using the Chang algorithm to calculate mean snow-mass from the simulated emission. The snow mass estimation from a site exhibiting the heterogeneity of the CLPX Colorado site proves only marginally different than that from a similarly-simulated homogeneous site. The estimation accuracy predictions are tested using the CLPX field measurements of snow mass, and simultaneous SSM/I and AMSR-E measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of armed conflict on ecosystems are complex and difficult to assess due to restricted access to affected areas during wartime making satellite remote sensing a useful tool for studying direct and indirect effects of conflict on the landscape. The Imatong Central Forest Reserve (ICFR) in South Sudan together with the nearby Dongotana Hills and the Agoro-Agu Forest Reserve (AFR) in Northern Uganda share a boundary and encompass a biologically diverse montane ecosystem. This study used satellite data combined with general human population trends to examine the impact of armed conflict and its outcome on similar forest ecosystems both during and after hostilities have occurred. A Disturbance Index (DI) was used to investigate the location and extent of forest cover loss and gain in three areas for two key time periods from mid-1980s to 2001 and 2003 to 2010. Results indicate that the rate of forest recovery was significantly higher than the rate of disturbance both during and after wartime in and around the ICFR and the net rate of forest cover change remained largely unchanged for the two time periods. In contrast, the nearby Dongotana Hills experienced relatively high rates of disturbance during both periods; however, post war period losses were largely offset by some gains in forest cover. For the AFR in Uganda, the rate of forest recovery was much higher during the second period, coinciding with the time people began leaving overcrowded camps. The diversity and merging of floristic regions in a very narrow band around the lmatong Mountains makes this area biologically distinct and of outstanding conservation importance; therefore, any future loss in forest cover is important to monitor - particularly in South Sudan where large numbers of people continue to return following the 2005 peace agreement and the 2011 Referendum on Independence.

AB The increasing availability of the Landsat image archive and the development of approaches to make full use of these data provide novel insights into the drivers and dynamics of land use systems change. Focusing on Romania, we asked how the drastic institutional and socio-economic transformation after the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe affected forestry. We used an annual time series of Landsat images to investigate how three phases of forest restitution affected forest disturbances (due to both, natural events and forest management). We employed the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) set of change detection algorithms to perform temporal segmentation and fitting of the Landsat time series, and derived annual disturbance maps (95.72% overall accuracy) along with recovery dynamics. Our change map suggested that forest disturbances increased substantially since the collapse of socialism in 1989, with 75,000 ha of disturbed forest land (4.5% of the total studied forest area). Whereas the late socialist years were characterized by relatively low disturbance levels (12% of all detected disturbances), disturbances increased especially after each of the restitution laws were passed in 1991, 2000, and 2005 (34%, 21% and 32% respectively). Non-state ownership regimes (i.e. private owners vs. public property of local communities) and species composition of restituted forests were two important factors determining disturbance levels. The widespread disturbances we found also raise concerns about timber overexploitation in many areas of the Romanian Carpathians. Our study demonstrates the value of the temporal depth of the Landsat archive and highlights that trajectory-based change detection approaches can be highly beneficial for gaining insights on the effect of institutional shocks on land use patterns.

AB A generalized coccolithophore bloom classifier has been developed for use with ocean color imagery. The bloom classifier was developed using extracted satellite reflectance data from SeaWiFS images screened by the default bloom detection mask. In the current application, we extend the optical water type (OWT) classification scheme by adding a new coccolithophore bloom class formed from these extracted reflectances. Based on an in situ coccolithophore data set from the North Atlantic, the detection levels with the new scheme were between 1,500 and 1,800 coccolithophore cells/mL and 43,000 and 78,000 liths/mL The detected bloom area using the OWT method was an average of 1.75 times greater than the default bloom detector based on a collection of SeaWiFS 1 km imagery. The versatility of the scheme is shown with SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua, CZCS and MERIS imagery at the 1 km scale. The OWT scheme was applied to the daily global SeaWiFS imagery mission data set (years 1997-2010). Based on our results, average annual coccolithophore bloom area was more than two times greater in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere with values of 2.00 x 10(6) km(2) and 0.75 x 10(6) km(2), respectively. The new algorithm detects larger bloom areas in the Southern Ocean compared to the default algorithm, and our revised global annual average of 2.75 x 10(6) km(2) is dominated by contributions from the Southern Ocean.

AB Mega cities, the largest category of urban agglomerations, attract considerable attention because of their population size, economic, socio-cultural, environmental and political influence and geographical complexity. Until 1975 there were just three mega cities in the world: New York, Tokyo and Mexico City - today there are 27 cities having more than the defined 10 million inhabitants. This paper presents a straight forward, application-oriented approach using multi-temporal remotely sensed data to systematically monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of the world's urban giants. Object-oriented and pixel-based classification image analysis techniques are applied to Landsat as well as to TerraSAR-X data in order to define urbanized areas of the mega cities at different points of time. Subsequently post-classification change detection is performed on urban footprint level. With time intervals of about 10 years almost 40 years of urbanization are monitored, showing different dimensions, dynamics and patterns across the analyzed cities. The generated urban footprint products show accuracies consistently higher than 80%, allowing for further applications in fields such as urban planning, risk management, or population assessment.

AB Lidars have the unique ability to make direct, physical measurements of forest height and vertical structure in much denser canopies than is possible with passive optical or short wavelength radars. However the literature reports a consistent underestimate of tree height when using physically based methods, necessitating empirical corrections. This bias is a result of overestimating the range to the canopy top due to background noise and failing to correctly identify the ground.
   This paper introduces a method, referred to as "noise tracking", to avoid biases when determining the range to the canopy top. Simulated waveforms, created with Monte-Carlo ray tracing over geometrically explicit forest models, are used to test noise tracking against simple thresholding over a range of forest and system characteristics. It was found that noise tracking almost completely removed the bias in all situations except for very high noise levels and very low (<10%) canopy covers. In all cases noise tracking gave lower errors than simple thresholding and had a lower sensitivity to the initial noise threshold.
   Finite laser pulses spread out the measured signal, potentially overriding the benefit of noise tracking. In the past laser pulse length has been corrected by adding half that length to the signal start range. This investigation suggests that this is not always appropriate for simple thresholding and that the results for noise tracking were more directly related to pulse length than for simple thresholding. That this effect has not been commented on before may be due to the possible confounding impacts of instrument and survey characteristics inherent in field data. This method should help improve the accuracy of waveform lidar measurements of forests, whether using airborne or spaceborne instruments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial resolution of passive microwave observations from space is of the order of tens of kilometers with currently available instruments, such as the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). The large field of view of these instruments dictates that the observed brightness temperature can originate from heterogeneous land cover, with different vegetation and surface properties.
   In this study, we assess the influence of freshwater lakes on the observed brightness temperature of AMSR-E in winter conditions. The study focuses on the geographic region of Finland, where lakes account for 10% of the total terrestrial area. We present a method to mitigate for the influence of lakes through forward modeling of snow covered lakes, as a part of a microwave emission simulation scheme of space-borne observations. We apply a forward model to predict brightness temperatures of snow covered sceneries over several winter seasons, using available data on snow cover, vegetation and lake ice cover to set the forward model input parameters. Comparison of model estimates with space-borne observations shows that the modeling accuracy improves in the majority of examined cases when lakes are accounted for, with respect to the case where lakes are not included in the simulation. Moreover, we present a method for applying the correction to the retrieval of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in lake-rich areas, using a numerical inversion method of the forward model. In a comparison to available independent validation data on SWE, also the retrieval accuracy is seen to improve when applying the influence of snow covered lakes in the emission model.

AB Tree species classification is still solved at insufficient reliability in airborne optical data. The variation caused by directional reflectance anisotropy hampers image-based solutions. In addition, trees show considerable within-species variation in reflectance properties. We examined these phenomena at the single-tree level, using the Leica ADS40 line sensor and XPro software, which constitute the first photogrammetric large-format multispectral system to provide target reflectance images. To analyze the influence of illumination conditions in the canopy, we developed a method in which the crown shape as well as between-tree occlusions and shading were modeled, using dense LiDAR data. The precision of the ADS40 reflectance images in well-defined surfaces was 5% as coefficient of variation when 1-4-km image data were fused. The range of reflectance anisotropy was +/- 30% for trees near the solar principal plane, with differences between bands and species. Because of the anisotropy differences observed, the spectral separability of the tree species in different bands is dependent on the view-illumination geometry. The within-species variation was high; the coefficient of variation was 13-31%. The contribution of tree and stand variables to anisotropy-normalized reflectance variation was examined. The effects of the species composition of adjacent trees were substantial in NIR and this variation hampers spectral classification in mixed stands. We also studied species- and band-specific intracrown brightness patterns, and we suggest their use as high-order image features in species classification. A species classification accuracy of up to 80% was obtained using 4-km data, which showed the high potential of the ADS40. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil characteristics provide important support for understanding transformations that occur in environmental systems. Physical characteristics and chemical compositions of soils controlled by pedogenetic processes, climatic changes and land use imply different types of environmental transformations. Reflectance spectroscopy is an alternative soil mapping technique that uses spectral absorption features between visible (VIS) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (0.3-2.5 mu m) for determining soil mineralogy. Soil analysis by means of reflectance spectroscopy and orbital optical sensors have provided favorable results in mapping transformation processes in environmental systems, particularly in arid and semiarid climates in extra-tropical terrains. In the case of inter-tropical environments, these methods cannot be readily applied due to local factors such as lack of exposed regolith, high amounts of soil moisture and the presence of dense vegetation. This study uses Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and reflectance spectroscopy data to map mineral components of soils covering a part of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which could be linked to key aspects of environmental transformations in this tropical area (e.g., climate change, shifts in agriculture fronts, ph, and soil characteristics). We collected forty-two (42) soil samples at a depth of 0-20 cm, considering that this superficial layer corresponds to the highest correlation with soil properties detected by the ASTER sensor. These samples were measured using a FieldSpec FR spectrometer, and the derived spectra were interpreted for mineral composition. Interpretation was supported by X-ray diffraction analysis on the same samples. The spectral signatures were re-sampled to ASTER VNIR (AST1 -4: 0.52-0.86 mu m) and SWIR (AST5-9: 1.60-2.43 mu m) spectral bandwidths and validated by comparing reflectance spectra of field samples with those extracted from atmospherically corrected and calibrated ASTER pixels. The agreement between spectral signatures measured from soil samples and those derived from ASTER imagery pixels proved plausible, with R-2 correlation values ranging from 0.6493 to 0.7886. This signifies that diagnostic spectral features of key minerals in tropical soils can be mapped at the spectral resolution of 9-band ASTER VNIR through SWIR reflectance. We used these spectral signatures as end-members in hyperspectral routine classifications adapted for use with ASTER data. Results proved possible the identification and remote mapping of minerals such as kaolinite, montmorillonite and gibbsite, as well as the distinction between iron-rich and iron-poor soils.

AB Diagnostic carbon cycle models depend on parameterization to establish model sensitivity to climate variables and site factors. Here we acquired meteorological and carbon flux data from a diverse set (N = 18) of eddy covariance (EC) flux towers, along with MODIS data on FPAR (the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation that is absorbed by the plant canopy) at the sites, and used the data to develop a parameter set for the application of a diagnostic carbon cycle model over North America. The parameter optimization approach relied on goodness of fit between model simulations and tower estimates of gross primary production and net ecosystem production (NEP). Parameters such as light use efficiency CLUE) and base rate of heterotrophic respiration varied widely between sites representing different plant functional types (PFTs), thus supporting the value of stratification by PFT when parameterizing the model. Where multiple EC sites were available within a PFT, overall prediction error and bias in mean NEP was reduced by cross-site optimization as opposed to reliance on a single site. Optimization with the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) instead of MODIS FPAR resulted in a similar goodness of fit, however, LUE values were pushed to levels that were not physiologically realistic when using EVI. The increasing availability of gap-filled EC tower data is rapidly improving the opportunities for direct coupling of satellite and ground observational data for parameterizing of diagnostic carbon flux models.

AB A transformation defined on the near-infrared (NIR) and middle-infrared (MIR) space is presented that allows deriving a new coordinate system appropriate for vegetation and burned area discrimination. The transformation is based on the difference between MIR and NIR in conjunction with the distance from a convergence point in the MIR/NIR space, representative of a totally burnt surface. One of the derived coordinates presents a small scatter for pixels associated to vegetated surfaces (strict scale) whereas the other one covers a wide range of values (large scale) that suggest its use as a proxy of water content of vegetation. The strict scale character of the first coordinate together with the large scale character of the second one make the coordinate system especially adequate to discriminate vegetated surfaces and rank them according to the water content, from green and dry to burned vegetation. The performance of the new coordinate system is then assessed against than traditional ratio or modified ratio indices (namely the Vegetation Index, the Burned Area Index and the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, modified to the MIR/NIR space) and it is shown that the new coordinate system provides better information than traditional indices, opening interesting perspectives for burned area discrimination and other applications like drought monitoring.

AB Remote estimation of water constituent concentrations in case II waters has been a great challenge, primarily due to the complex interactions among the phytoplankton, tripton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and pure water. Semi-analytical algorithms for estimating constituent concentrations are effective and easy to implement, but two challenges remain. First, a dataset without a sampling bias is needed to calibrate estimation models; and second, the semi-analytical indices were developed based on several specific assumptions that may not be universally applicable. In this study, a semi-analytical model-optimizing and look-up-table (SAMO-LUT) method was proposed to address these two challenges. The SAMO-LUT method is based on three previous semi-analytical models to estimate chlorophyll a, tripton and CDOM. Look-up tables and an iterative searching strategy were used to obtain the most appropriate parameters in the models. Three datasets (i.e., noise-free simulation data, in situ data and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data) were collected to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the SAMO-LUT method yields error-free results for the ideal simulation dataset; and is able also to accurately estimate the water constituent concentrations with an average bias (mean normalized bias, MNB) lower than 9% and relative random uncertainty (normalized root mean square error, NRMS) lower than 34% even for in situ and MERIS data. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm to accurately monitor inland and coastal waters based on satellite observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Technological advances have opened the possibility to have Earth observation imagery combining both high spatial resolution with high revisit frequency. The monitoring of land surface processes will greatly benefit from this type of data if biophysical variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) can be retrieved from it. However, the large amounts of data that will become available call for methods satisfying constraint of (i) portability across different landscapes, (ii) independence from field measurements and (iii) computational efficiency. Currently, the most suitable technique to approach this objective is neural network inversion of radiative transfer. This paper quantifies the performance of such approach for a specific crop (winter wheat) all along the growing season. By re-defining the retrieved biophysical variable as Green Area Index (GAI) and correcting the typical saturation effect that affects the estimation of higher values, this study shows that physically-based retrieval can yield similar results to those obtained by empirical methods such as stepwise linear regression (with an relative RMSE of 24.7% and 22.8% respectively). The research further shows how a trained neural network for a specific sensor can produce a GAI map from imagery acquired from different viewing conditions without a significant loss in accuracy.

AB Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense (similar to annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington. USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth.

AB Donana National Park wetlands, in South West Spain, undergo yearly cycles of inundation and drying out. During the hydrological year 2006-2007, 43 ASAR/Envisat images of Donana, mostly in HH and VV polarizations, were acquired with the aim to monitor the flood extent evolution during an entire flooding cycle. The images were ordered in the seven ASAR incidence angles, also referred to as swaths, to achieve high observation frequency.
   In this study, backscattering temporal signatures of the main land cover types in Donana were obtained for the different incidence angles and polarizations. Plots showing the sigma degrees HH/sigma degrees VV ratio behavior were also produced. The signatures were analyzed with the aid of miscellaneous site data in order to identify the effect of the flooding on the backscattering. Conclusions on the feasibility to discriminate emerged versus flooded land are derived for the different incidence angles, land cover types and phenological stages: intermediate incidence angles (ASAR IS3 and IS4) came up as the most appropriate single swaths to discriminate open water surface from smooth bare soil in the marshland deepest areas. Flood mapping in pasture lands, the most elevated regions, is feasible at steep to mid incidence angles (ASAR IS1 to IS4). In the medium elevation zones, colonized by large helophytes, shallow incidence angles (ASAR IS6 and IS7) enable more accurate flood delineation during the vegetation growing phase.
   Since Donana land covers require different observation swaths for flood detection, the composition of different incidence angle images close in time provides the optimum flood mapping. Such composition is possible four times per ASAR 35-day orbit cycle, using pairs of 12-h apart IS1/IS6 and IS2/IS5 Donana images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Height and intensity information derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) was used to obtain a quantitative vertical stratification of vegetation in a multi-layered Mediterranean ecosystem. A new methodology for the separation of different vegetation strata was implemented using supervised classification of a two-dimensional feature space spanned by ALS return height (terrain corrected) and intensity. The classification was carried out using Gaussian mixture models tuned on a control plot. The approach was validated using extensive field measurements from treated plots, ranging from single vegetation strata to a more complex multi-layered ecosystem. Plot-level canopy profiles derived from ALS and from a geometric reconstruction based on field measurements were in very good agreement, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 (for complex, 3-layered) to 0.96 (simple, single-layered). In addition, it was possible to derive plot-level information on layer height, vertical extent and coverage with absolute accuracies of some decimetres (simple plots) to a meter (complex plots) for both height and vertical extent and about 10 to 15% for layer coverage. The approach was then used to derive maps of the layer height, vertical extent and percentage of ground cover for a larger area, and classification accuracy was evaluated on a per-pixel basis. The method performed best for single-layered plots or dominant layers on multi-layered plots, obtaining an overall accuracy of 80 to 90%. For subdominant layers in the more complex plots, accuracies obtained were as low as 48%.
   Our results demonstrate the possibility of deriving qualitative (presence and absence of specific vegetation layers) and quantitative, physical data ( height, vertical extent and ground cover) describing the vertical structure of complex multi-layered forest ecosystems using ALS-based height and intensity information.

ID LAND-COVER; CLASSIFICATION; MOUNDS; SCALE
AB Bubonic plague, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, persists as a public health problem in many parts of the world, including central Kazakhstan. Bubonic plague occurs most often in humans through a flea bite, when a questing flea fails to find a rodent host. For many of the plague foci in Kazakhstan the great gerbil is the major host of plague, a social rodent well-adapted to desert environments. Intensive monitoring and prevention of plague in gerbils started in 1947, reducing the number of human cases and mortalities drastically. However, the monitoring is labour-intensive and hence expensive and is now under threat due to financial constraints. Previous research showed that the occupancy rate of the burrow systems of the great gerbil is a strong indicator for the probability of a plague outbreak. The burrow systems are around 30 m in diameter with a bare surface. This paper aims to demonstrate the automatic classification of burrow systems in satellite images using object-oriented analysis. We performed field campaigns in September 2007 and May and September 2008 and acquired corresponding QuickBird images of the first two periods. User's and producer's accuracy values of the classification reached 60 and 86%, respectively, providing proof of concept that automatic mapping of burrow systems using high-resolution satellite images is possible. Such maps, by better defining great gerbil foci, locating new or expanding foci and measuring the density of great gerbil burrow systems could play a major role in a renewed monitoring system by better directing surveillance and control efforts. Furthermore, if similar analyses can separate occupied burrow systems from empty ones, then very-high-resolution images stand to play a crucial role in plague surveillance throughout central Asia.

AB Semi-analytical remote sensing applications for eutrophic waters are not applicable to oligo- and mesotrophic lakes in the perialpine area, since they are insensitive to chlorophyll concentration variations between 1 and 10 mg/m(3). The neural network based Case-2-Regional algorithm for MERIS was developed to fill this gap, along with the ICOL adjacency effect correction algorithm. The algorithms are applied to a collection of 239 satellite images from 2003-2008, and the results are compared to experimental and official water quality data collected in six perialpine lakes in the same period. It is shown that remote sensing estimates can provide an adequate supplementary data source to in situ data series of the top 5 m water layer, provided that a sufficient number of matchups for a site specific maximum temporal offset are available.

AB A new model of chlorophyll a fluorescence emission by plant leaves, FluorMODleaf, is presented. It is an extension of PROSPECT, a widely used leaf optical properties model that regards the leaf as a pile of N absorbing and diffusing elementary plates. In FluorMODleaf, fluorescence emission of an infinitesimal layer of thickness dx is integrated over the entire elementary plate. The fluorescence source function is based on the excitation spectrum of diluted isolated thylakoids and on the emission spectra of isolated photosystems, PSI and PSII, which are the main pigment-protein complexes involved in the initial stages of photosynthesis. Scattering within the leaf is produced by multiple reflections within and between elementary plates. The input variables of FluorMODleaf are: the number of elementary plates N, also called leaf structure parameter, the total chlorophyll content C-ab, the total carotenoid content C-cx, the equivalent water thickness C-w, and the dry matter content C-m (or leaf mass per area), as in the new PROSPECT-5, plus the sigma(II)/sigma(I), ratio referring to the relative absorption cross section of PSI and PSII, and the fluorescence quantum efficiency of PSI and PSII, tau(I) and tau(II), that are introduced here as mean fluorescence lifetimes. The model, which considers the reabsorption of emitted light within the leaf, allows good quantitative estimation of both upward and downward apparent spectral fluorescence yield (ASFY) at different excitation wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm. It also emphasizes the role of scattering in fluorescence emission by leaves having high chlorophyll content. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A Dorsiventral Leaf Model (DLM) is presented to simulate leaf radiative transfer. DLM was conceived as a plate model with a stochastic distribution of different groups of layers. Leaf asymmetry was modeled by assigning non-uniform distributions of pigments, water and dry matter to palisade and mesophyll layers and by simulating different amounts of light diffusion for adaxially and abaxially incident light. Surface reflections are based on micro-facets theory enabling the simulation of directional-hemispherical reflectance and a range of bidirectional reflectance factors. Adaxial and abaxial optical properties could be accurately simulated for a variety of leaf types with an overall error in reflectance and transmittance below 1.3%. Sensitivity analysis focused on optimizing model inversion schemes improves parameter estimation accuracy. Different inversion schemes were compared for two independent datasets. Results underpin most of the propositions of the sensitivity analysis: (i) masking the near-infrared wavelengths (band weighting) to account for variability in the dry matter composition consistently increased predicted accuracies for dry matter content, (ii) white reflectance measurements (reflectance with a 100% diffusely reflecting background) provided results superior to other optical measurements, making it a valuable and fast alternative and (iii) combining reflectance and transmittance into absorptance however did not result in improvements. Comparisons of DLM with the PROSPECT 5 model indicate an almost equal performance in content estimations. Improvements were thus not related to differences in model structure but to techniques that reduce the impact of leaf structure and compensate for sampling errors and variations in specific absorption spectra. DLM has important potential in the study of leaf radiative transfer and in the integration with canopy radiative transfer models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used 268 cloud-free Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2003 and 2005-2007 to study the seasonal evolution of supra-glacial lakes in three different regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Lake area estimates were obtained by developing an automated classification method for their identification based on 250 m resolution MODIS surface reflectance observations. Widespread supra-glacial lake formation and drainage is observed across the ice sheet, with a 2-3 week delay in the evolution of total supra-glacial lake area in the northern areas compared to the south-west. The onset of lake growth varies by up to one month inter-annually, and lakes form and drain at progressively higher altitudes during the melt season. A positive correlation was found between the annual peak in total lake area and modelled annual runoff. High runoff and lake extent years are generally characterised by low accumulation and high melt season temperatures, and vice versa. Our results indicate that, in a future warmer climate [Meehl, G.

AB Tracking features between pairs of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using image cross-correlation methods is a powerful tool for defining regions of image movement such as ice flow of Antarctic glaciers. Unlike optical images, processed SAR images have various instrumental effects such as view angle distortions and lateral displacement errors caused by slant range mapping. Co-registration issues are problematic and need to be addressed if there are few/no suitable stationary tie points at or near sea level within the images. Methods are presented that use Radarsat ScanSAR images to reliably measure sub-pixel displacements with errors of less than or similar to +/- 0.25 pixels but this estimate is target dependent. The techniques and issues are illustrated using examples from a long-term study of the Mertz Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica. For image pairs only a few days apart, this extensive structure forms an excellent grid-like test pattern which provides up to 5000 valid correlation matches. Images separated by 100's of days can then be processed in the same way to reveal many subtle and some large changes over time. The technique described is robust and may be widely applicable.

AB Epiphylls - lichens, fungi, liverworts, etc. infesting leaf surfaces - are found throughout humid forests of the world. It is well understood that epiphylls inhibit light interception by host plants, but their effect on remote sensing of colonized forests has not been examined. Incorporating leaf-level spectra from Terra Firme (primary forest) and Amazonian Caatinga (woodlands/forest growing on nutrient-deficient sandy soils), we used the GeoSAIL model to propagate leaf-level measurements to the canopy level and determine their effect on commonly used vegetation indices. In Caatinga, moderate infestations (50% leaf area epiphyll cover), lowered simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values by 6.1% and 20.4%, respectively, largely due to near infrared dampening. Heavy infestation (100% cover) simulations exhibited decreases 1.5-2 times greater than those of moderate infestations. For Terra Firme, which are generally less affected by epiphylls, moderate (20% leaf area) and heavy infestations (40%) lowered EVI by 4.4% (S.D. 0.8%) and 8.1% (S.D. 1.5%), respectively. Near infrared and green reflectance were most affected at the canopy level, showing mean decreases of 10.6% (S.D. 2.25%) and 9.5% (S.D. 3.49%), respectively, in heavy Terra Firme infestations. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data corroborated the modeling results, suggesting a degree of coupling between epiphyll cover and the EVI and NDVI. These results suggest that, without explicit consideration of the presence of epiphylls, remote sensing-based methodologies may underestimate leaf area index, biomass and productivity in humid forests.

AB The delta of the Colorado River in Mexico supports a rich mix of estuarine, wetland and riparian ecosystems that provide habitat for over 350 species of birds as well as fish, marine mammals, and other wildlife. An important part of the delta ecosystem is the riparian corridor, which is supported by agricultural return flows and waste spills of water originating in the U.S. and Mexico. These flows may be curtailed in the future due to climate change and changing land use practices (out-of-basin water transfers, increased agricultural efficiency, and more optimal management of dams) in the U.S. and Mexico, and resource managers need to monitor the effects of their water management practices on these ecosystems. We developed ground-validated, remote sensing methods to monitor the vegetation status, habitat value, and water use of wetland and riparian ecosystems using multi-temporal, multi-resolution images. The integrated methodology allowed us to project species composition, leaf area index, fractional cover, habitat value, and evapotranspiration over seasons and years throughout the delta, in response to variable water flows from the U.S. to Mexico. Waste spills of water from the U.S. have regenerated native cottonwood and willow trees in the riparian corridor and created backwater and marsh areas that support birds and other wildlife. However, the main source of water supporting the riparian vegetation is the regional aquifer recharged by underflow from U.S. and Mexico irrigation districts. Native trees have a short half-life in the riparian zone due to human-set fires and harvesting for timber. Active management, monitoring, and restoration programs are needed to maintain the habitat value of this ecosystem for the future. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents the retrieval method L-APOM which aims at characterizing the microphysical and optical properties of aerosol plumes from hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution The inversion. process is divided into three steps: estimation of the ground reflectance below the plume, characterization of the standard atmosphere (gases and background aerosols) and estimation of the plume aerosols properties. As using spectral information only is not sufficient to insure uniqueness of solutions, original constraints are added by assuming slow spatial variations of particles properties within the plume. The whole inversion process is validated on a large set of simulated images and reveals to remain accurate even in the worst cases of noise: relative estimation errors of aerosol properties remain between 10% and 20% in most cases. L-APCM is applied on a real AVIRIS hyperspectral image of a biomass burning plume for which in situ measurements are available. Retrieved properties appear globally consistent with measurements.

AB NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) has been widely used to monitor vegetation changes since the early eighties. On the other hand, little use has been made of land surface temperatures (LST), due to their sensitivity to the orbital drift which affects the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) platforms flying AVHRR sensor. This study presents a new method for monitoring vegetation by using NDVI and LST data, based on an orbital drift corrected dataset derived from data provided by the GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies) group. This method, named Yearly Land Cover Dynamics (YLCD), characterizes NDVI and LST behavior on a yearly basis, through the retrieval of 3 parameters obtained by linear regression between NDVI and normalized LST data. These 3 parameters are the angle between regression line and abscissa axis, the extent of the data projected on the regression line, and the regression coefficient. Such parameters characterize respectively the vegetation type, the annual vegetation cycle length and the difference between real vegetation and ideal cases. Worldwide repartition of these three parameters is shown, and a map integrating these 3 parameters is presented. This map differentiates vegetation in function of climatic constraints, and shows that the presented method has good potential for vegetation monitoring, under the condition of a good filtering of the outliers in the data.

AB The management of crop residues (non-photosynthetic vegetation) in agricultural fields influences soil erosion and soil carbon sequestration. Remote sensing methods can efficiently assess crop residue cover and related tillage intensity over many fields in a region. Although the reflectance spectra of soils and crop residues are often similar in the visible, near infrared, and the lower part of the shortwave infrared (4001900 nm) wavelength region, specific diagnostic chemical absorption features are evident in the upper shortwave infrared (1900-2500 nm) region. Two reflectance band height indices used for estimating residue cover are the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) and the Lignin-Cellulose Absorption (LCA) index, both of which use reflectances in the upper shortwave infrared (SWIR). Soil mineralogy and composition will affect soil spectral properties and may limit the usefulness of these spectral indices in certain areas. Our objectives were to (1) identify minerals and soil components with absorption features in the 2000 nm to 2400 nm wavelength region that would affect CAI and LCA and (2) assess their potential impact on remote sensing estimates of crop residue cover. Most common soil minerals had CAI values <= 0.5, whereas crop residues were always >0.5, allowing for good contrast between soils and residues. However, a number of common soil minerals had LCA values>0.5, and, in some cases, the mineral LCA values were greater than those of the crop residues, which could limit the effectiveness of LCA for residue cover estimation. The LCA of some dry residues and live corn canopies were similar in value, unlike CAI. Thus, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or similar method should be used to separate out green vegetation pixels. Mineral groups, such as garnets and chlorites, often have wide ranges of CAI and LCA values, and thus, mineralogical analyses often do not identify individual mineral species required for precise CAI estimation. However, these methods are still useful for identifying mineral soils requiring additional scrutiny. Future advanced multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing platforms should include CAI bands to allow for crop residue cover estimation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Aboveground dry biomass was estimated for the 1.3 M km(2) forested area south of the treeline in the eastern Canadian province of Quebec by combining data from an airborne and spaceborne LiDAR, a Landsat ETM+ land cover map, a Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, ground inventory plots, and vegetation zone maps. Plot-level biomass was calculated using allometric relationships between tree attributes and biomass. A small footprint portable laser profiler then flew over these inventory plots to develop a generic airborne LiDAR-based biomass equation (R-2=0.65, n=207). The same airborne LiDAR system flew along four portions of orbits of the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). A square-root transformed equation was developed to predict airborne profiling LiDAR estimates of aboveground dry biomass from GLAS waveform parameters combined with an SRTM slope index (R-2=0.59, n = 1325). Using the 104,044 quality-filtered GLAS pulses obtained during autumn 2003 from 97 orbits over the study area, we then predicted aboveground dry biomass for the main vegetation areas of Quebec as well as for the entire Province south of the treeline. Including cover type covariances both within and between GLAS orbits increased standard errors of the estimates by two to five times at the vegetation zone level and as much as threefold at the provincial level. Aboveground biomass for the whole study area averaged 39.0 +/- 2.2 (standard error) Mg ha(-1) and totalled 4.9 +/- 0.3 Pg. Biomass distributions were 12.6% northern hardwoods, 12.6% northern mixedwood, 38.4% commercial boreal, 13% non-commercial boreal, 14.2% taiga, and 9.2% treed tundra. Non-commercial forests represented 36% of the estimated aboveground biomass, thus highlighting the importance of remote northern forests to C sequestration. This study has shown that space-based forest inventories of northern forests could be an efficient way of estimating the amount, distribution, and uncertainty of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks at large spatial scales.

AB This study utilized spaceborne multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) data to document spatial relationships of surface sediments over time in a modern depositional environment associated with dust emissions, Soda Lake playa, Mojave Desert, United States. The approach employed here involved time-series TIR data acquired from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and a linear spectral mixture analysis. An automated algorithm was applied to derive emissivity image endmembers. Evaluation of the chosen endmembers revealed that they can be categorized into five major spectra classes based on diagnostic absorption features. Each spectrum has been identified in relation to mineral abundance and soil arrangement that are common in playa settings: A, "clayey silt-rich crust"; B, "intermediate-salt crust"; C, "quartz-rich deposit"; D, "salt-rich rough crust"; E, "sulfate-rich crust". Spectral classes A-B-C-D yielded the lowest RMS errors (0-0.025) over time in the iterative deconvolution algorithm between the measured and modeled spectra. The produced fractional abundance images show high areal concentrations for clayey silt-rich crust, salt-rich rough crust, and quartz-rich deposit, as the first surficial mapping of Soda Lake. Significant changes in the spatial relationships of the major surface sediments in Soda Lake were observed after a flooding event (2005) and a relatively dry period (2006). The approach utilized in this study can be advantageous for continuous monitoring of environments characterized by a small area and a complex surface, which may enable a better understanding of their responses to climate changes and potential for dust emissions.

AB Four seasons (2004-2007) of snow surveys across the boreal forest of northern Manitoba were utilized to determine relationships between vertically polarized Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures (T-B) and ground measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE). Regression analysis identified moderate strength, yet statistically significant relationships between SWE and T-B differences (36.5-18.7; 36.5-10.7; 18.7-10.7) for individual seasons. When multiple seasons were considered collectively, however, the 36.5-18.7 and 36.5-10.7 differences were insignificant because the seasonal linear relationships shifted from year to year over the same T-B range regardless of SWE. This inter-seasonal consistency in T-B was explained through significant correlations with vegetation density as characterized by a MODIS-derived forest transmissivity dataset. More encouraging results were found for the 18.7-10.7 difference: the relationship with SWE remained statistically significant when multiple years were considered together, and the 18.7-10.7 difference was not significantly associated with vegetation density. Additional snow survey data from the Northwest Territories (2005-2007) were used to verify the 18.7-10.7 relationship with SWE across the northern boreal forest. These results suggest use of the 18.7-10.7 T-B difference, rather than the traditional 36.5-18.7 T-B difference, is necessary to capture inter-seasonal SWE variability across forested regions.

AB This paper presents a method to monitor the dynamics of herbaceous vegetation in the Sahel. The approach is based on the assimilation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data acquired by the VEGETATION instrument on board SPOT 4/5 into a simple sahelian vegetation dynamics model. The study region is located in the Gourma region of Mali. The vegetation dynamics model is coupled with a radiative transfer model (the SAIL model). First, it is checked that the coupled models allow for a realistic simulation of the seasonal and interannual variability of NDVI over three sampling sites from 1999 to 2004. The data assimilation scheme relies on a parameter identification technique based on an Evolution Strategies algorithm. The simulated above-ground herbage mass resulting from NDVI assimilation is then compared to ground measurements performed over 13 study sites during the period 1999-2004. The assimilation scheme performs well with 404 kg DM/ha of average error (n=126 points) and a correlation coefficient of r=0.80 (to be compared to the 463 kg DM/ha and r=0.60 of the model performance without data assimilation). Finally, the sensitivity of the herbage mass model estimates to the quality of the meteorological forcing (rainfall and net radiation) is analyzed thanks to a stochastic approach.

AB Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) has never been observed from space. The SSS from planned satellite missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius is a key to better understanding how ocean circulation is related to water cycle and how both these systems are changing through time.
   The Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) presented in this paper has been carried out with an ocean forecasting system developed within the French oceanographic Mercator Ocean context. They consist in hindcast experiments assimilating an operational dataset (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), in-situ profiles of temperature and salinity and Sea Level Anomalies (SLA)) and various simulated SMOS and Aquarius Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data. These experiments use an eddy permitting model (1/3 degrees) covering the North Atlantic from 20 degrees S to 70 degrees N. The new generation of fully multivariate assimilation system referred to as SAM2v1 which is being developed from the SEEK (Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman) algorithm is used. This scheme is a Reduced Order Kalman Filter using a 3D multivariate modal decomposition of the forecast error covariance.
   The OSSEs enabled us to show the positive impact of SSS assimilation on the Mercator Ocean operational forecasting system. These experiments particularly show the importance to specify appropriated observation errors and the impact of having and/or combining different observing system. Several conclusions can be highlighted such as the importance of the space/time scales consistency between the data products and our ocean prediction systems. This study has to be considered as an important step for assimilation of SSS measured from space. Further studies have to be conducted with other simulated data, other oceanic configurations and other improved assimilation schemes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Time series of snow covered area (SCA) estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were merged with a spatially explicit snowmelt model to reconstruct snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Rio Grande headwaters (3419 kin). A linear optimization scheme was used to derive SCA estimates that preserve the statistical moments of the higher spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) ETM+ data and resolve the superior temporal signal (i.e. similar to daily) of the MODIS data. It was found that merging the two SCA products led to an 8% decrease and an 18% increase in the basinwide SWE in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared to the SWE estimated from ETM+ only. Relative to SWE simulations using only ETM+ data, the hybrid SCA estimates reduced the mean absolute SWE error by 17 and 84% in 2001 and 2002, respectively; errors were determined using intensive snow survey data and two separate methods of scaling snow survey field measurements of SWE to the 1-km model pixel resolution. SWE bias for both years was reduced by 49% and skewness was reduced from -0.78 to 0.49. These results indicate that the hybrid SWE was closer to being an unbiased estimate of the measured SWE and errors were distributed more normally. The accuracy of the SCA estimates is likely dependent on the vegetation fraction. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a key input parameter for almost all terrestrial ecosystem models, but the spatial resolution of current PAR products is too coarse to satisfy regional application requirements. In this paper, we present an operational system for PAR retrieval from MODIS data that is based on an idea proposed by [Liang, S., Zheng, T., Liu, R., Fang, H., Tsay, S. -C., & Running, S. (2006). Estimation of incident photosynthetically active radiation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. Journal of Geophysical Research, I 11, D15208. doi:10.1029/2005fDO06730]. However, the operational system for PAR retrieval described here contains several improvements. The algorithm utilizes MODIS 113 data combining MODIS land surface products and BRDF model parameters products to directly estimate diffuse PAR, direct PAR and total PAR. Times-series data interpolation removes the noise and cloud contamination of land surface reflectance. PAR is retrieved by searching look-up tables calculated using a radiative transfer model. The system can automatically process MODIS 113 data to generate instantaneous and daily PAR. The instantaneous PAR products are compared with observational data from seven ChinaFLUX stations, and daily total PAR estimates are compared with those estimates of global radiation from 98 meteorological stations over China. The results indicate that this approach can produce reasonable PAR estimates, although this method overestimates PAR for low values of PAR. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Initiated in 1972, the Landsat program has provided a continuous record of earth observation for 35 years. The assemblage of Landsat spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, over a reasonably sized image extent, results in imagery that can be processed to represent land cover over large areas with an amount of spatial detail that is absolutely unique and indispensable for monitoring, management, and scientific activities. Recent technical problems with the two existing Landsat satellites, and delays in the development and launch of a successor, increase the likelihood that a gap in Landsat continuity may occur. In this communication, we identify the key features of the Landsat program that have resulted in the extensive use of Landsat data for large area land cover mapping and monitoring. We then augment this list of key features by examining the data needs of existing large area land cover monitoring programs. Subsequently, we use this list as a basis for reviewing the current constellation of earth observation satellites to identify potential alternative data sources for large area land cover applications. Notions of a virtual constellation of satellites to meet large area land cover mapping and monitoring needs are also presented. Finally, research priorities that would facilitate the integration of these alternative data sources into existing large area land cover monitoring programs are identified. Continuity of the Landsat program and the measurements provided are critical for scientific, environmental, economic, and social purposes. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Landsat; there are no other systems in orbit, or planned for launch in the short-term, that can duplicate or approach replication, of the measurements and information conferred by Landsat. While technical and political options are being pursued, there is no satellite image data stream poised to enter the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive should system failures occur to Landsat-5 and -7.

AB In a previous paper, we described a procedure to correct the directional effects in AVHRR reflectance time series. The corrected measurements show much less high frequency variability than their original counterparts, which makes them suitable to study vegetation dynamics. The time series are used here to estimate the start and ending dates of the growing season for 18 years from 1982 to 1999. We focus on the interannual variations of these phenological parameters.
   A database of in situ phenology observations is used to quantify the accuracy of the satellite-based estimates. Although based on a limited sampling of the Northern mid and high latitudes, the comparison indicates that i) the satellite phenological product contains meaningful information on interannual onset anomalies; ii) there is a higher degree of consistency over regions covered by Broadleaf Forests, Grasses and cereal Crops than over those covered by Needleleaf Forests or Savannas; and iii) the satellite phenological product is of lower quality in regions with mountainous terrain. In favorable conditions, interannual variations of the onset are captured with an accuracy of a few days.
   As this satellite-derived product captures the interannual onset variability at ground-truth sites, we confidently use it to larger scales studies. Mapped at a continental scale, the onset anomalies show coherent patterns at the regional (approximate to 1000 km) scale for the mid and high latitudes of the Northern hemisphere, which is consistent with a meteorological forcing. In the tropics, there is larger spatial heterogeneity, which suggests more complex controls of the phenology. The relation between vegetation phenology and climate is further investigated over Europe by comparing the variability of the satellite-derived vegetation onset and that of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, at a fine spatial scale. The strong correlations observed confirm that this climate forcing parameter explains most of the onset variability over a large fraction of Northern Europe (earlier onsets for positive winter NAO), with lower impact towards the south and opposite effects around the Mediterranean basin. The NAO has a predictive character as the January-February NAO index is strongly correlated with the vegetation onset that occurs around April in Northern Europe. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a new formulation to derive evaporative fraction (EF) and evapotranspiration (ET) maps from remotely sensed data without auxiliary relationships or site-specific relationships. This formulation is based on Granger's complementary relationship and Priestley-Taylor's equation. The proposed model eliminates the wind function and resistance parameters commonly applied to ET calculation by including a relative evaporation parameter (ET/Epot). By combining this relative evaporation parameter, Granger's complementary relationship and Priestley-Taylor equation, we obtain a simple equation to estimate ET. We tested and validated the proposed formulation over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States for seven clear sky days during March-October 2003. MODIS Atmospheric and Land products were the only source of data used in this study. Estimates of ET show an overall root mean square error and bias of 33.89 and - 10.96 Wm(-2), respectively. Our results suggest that the proposed approach is robust and valid for a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the lessons learned from analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land-Surface Temperature/Emissivity (LST) products in the current (W) and previous versions, and presents eight new refinements for V5 product generation executive code (PGE 16) and the test results with real Terra and Aqua MODIS data. The major refinements include considering surface elevation when using the MODIS cloudmask product, removal of temporal averaging in the I km daily level-3 LST product, removal of cloud-contaminated LSTs in level-3 LST products, and the refinements for the day/night LST algorithm. These refinements significantly improved the spatial coverage of LSTs, especially in highland regions, and the accuracy and stability of the MODIS LST products. Comparisons between V5 LSTs and in-situ values in 47 clear-sky cases (in the LST range from - 10 degrees C to 58 degrees C and atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.5 cm) indicate that the accuracy of the MODIS LST product is better than 1 K in most cases (39 out of 47) and the root of mean squares of differences is less than 0.7 K for all 47 cases or 0.5 K for all but the 8 cases apparently with heavy aerosol loadings. Emissivities retrieved by the day/night algorithm are well compared to the surface emissivity spectra measured by a sun-shadow method in two field campaigns. The time series of V5 MODIS LST product over two sites (Lake Tahoe in California and Namco lake in Tibet) in 2003 are evaluated, showing that the quantity and quality of MODIS LST products depend on clear-sky conditions because of the inherent limitation of the thermal infrared remote sensing.

AB During spring and summer 2004, intensive field bio-optical campaigns were conducted in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea to assess the mechanisms regulating the ocean color variability in a complex coastal environment. The bio-optical properties of the sampled waters span a wide range of variability, due to the various biogeochemical and physical processes occurring in this area. In-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs) were acquired simultaneously with measurements of optically significant parameters at 93 stations. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis indicates that 74% of the total variance of R-rs is partly explained by particulate backscattering (b(bp)), while particulate and dissolved absorption only explain 15% of the ocean color variability. These results confirm, for the first time from in situ backscattering measurements, previous studies performed in other coastal environments. Whereas the amplitude factors of the first EOF mode are well correlated (r=0.75) with the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbP), the highest correlation (r=0.83) is found with the particulate backscattering ratio (b(bp)/b(p)). This result highlights the fundamental role of the nature of the bulk particulate assemblage in the ocean color variability. An unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis applied to our data set of normalized Rrs spectra, leads to five spectrally distinct classes. We show that the class-specific mean Rrs spectra significantly differ from one another by their bio-optical properties. Three classes particularly stand out: one class corresponds to a Phaeocystis globosa bloom situation, whereas the two others are associated with water masses dominated by mineral and non-living particles, respectively. Among the different bio-optical parameters, the particulate backscattering ratio, the chlorophyll concentration, and the particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll ratio, are the most class-specific ones. These different results are very encouraging for the inversion of bio-optical parameters from class-specific algorithms. 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a systematic procedure for recognizing corrugated asbestos-cement roofing sheets and evaluating their deterioration status related to the asbestos fiber air dispersion that can cause lung cancer. To develop this procedure, we made field and laboratory measurements and gathered airborne MIVIS data covering two industrial test areas in Italy.
   Laboratory analyses of asbestos-cement samples representing various levels of deterioration allowed for: (a) recognizing dominant minerals using XRD and FTIR instruments, (b) identifying their optical characteristics using portable field spectrometers (ASD and mu FTIR), (c) assessing the abundance of surfacing asbestos fibers using a high resolution scanner.
   Based on the spectral analyses, two linear regression lines were identified by relating optical asbestos-cement material characteristics (i.e. band-depth ratio of the continuum removed calculated for the two asbestos diagnostic bands at 2.32 mu m and at 9.44 mu m) to the relative percentage of surfacing asbestos fibers related to AC deterioration status.
   Suitable MIVIS spectral regions were used in a spectral classification procedure to map asbestos-cement roofs. The detected roofs were further analyzed using the obtained linear regression lines to estimate surfacing asbestos fiber abundance, using the MIVIS TIR range at 9.44 mu m, selected by means of the asbestos-cement detection limit analysis.
   The results showed that a hyperspectral scanner with suitable operational characteristics allows for good clustering of AC roofs as a function of their deterioration status. Therefore, this technique can furnish government authorities with an efficient, rapid and. repeatable environmental mapping procedure that can provide information about the location of hazardous AC roofing sheets.

AB In this paper, uncertainties in the retrieval of satellite surface chlorophyll concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea have been evaluated using both regional and global ocean colour algorithms. The rationale for this effort was to define the most suitable ocean colour algorithm for the reprocessing of the entire SeaWiFS archive over the Mediterranean region where standard algorithms were demonstrated to be inappropriate. Using a large dataset of coincident in situ chlorophyll and optical measurements, covering most of the trophic regimes of the basin, we validated two existing regional algorithms [Bricaud, A., E. Bosc, and D. Antoine, 2002. Algal biomass and sea surface temperature in the Mediterranean Basin - Intercomparison of data from various satellite sensors, and implications for primary production estimates. Remote Sensing of Environment, 81(2-3), 163-178.; D'Ortenzio, F., S. Marullo, M. Ragni, M. R. d'Alcala, and R. Santoleri, 2002. Validation of empirical SeaWiFS algorithms for chlorophyll-alpha retrieval in the Mediterranean Sea - A case study for oligotrophic seas. Remote Sensing of Environment, 82(1), 79-94.] and the global algorithm OC4v4 used for standard NASA SeaWiFS products. The results of our analysis confirmed that the OC4v4 performs worse than the two existing regional algorithms. Nonetheless, these two regional algorithms do show uncertainties dependent on chlorophyll values. Then, we introduced a better tuned algorithm, the MedOC4. Using an independent set of in situ chlorophyll data, we quantified the uncertainties in SeaWiFS chlorophyll estimates using the existing and new regional algorithms. The results confirmed that MedOC4 is the best algorithm matching the requirement of unbiased satellite chlorophyll estimates and improving the percentage of the satellite uncertainty, and that the NASA standard chlorophyll products are affected by an uncertainty of the order of 100%. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the poor quality of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll in the Mediterranean is not due to the atmospheric correction term but to peculiarities in the optical properties of the water column. Finally the observed discrepancy between the global and the regional bio-optical algorithms has been discussed analysing the differences between the two in situ datasets used for tuning the algorithms (SeaBASS versus ours). The main results are that methodological differences in the two datasets cannot play a major role and the inherent bio-optical properties of the basin can explain the observed discrepancy. In particular the oligotrophic water of the Mediterranean Sea is less blue (30%) and greener (15%) than the global ocean. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method for simultaneously retrieving aerosol and surface parameters from ground-based and satellite observations collocated in space and time. We show that a combination of down and up-looking observations provides sufficient measurement constraints for characterizing both aerosol and surface properties with minimal assumptions. In order to employ this concept in AERONET processing, the standard inverse algorithm [Dubovik, O. & King, M. D. (2000), A flexible inversion algorithm for retrieval of aerosol optical properties from sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 20673-20696] has been modified to retrieve surface reflectance in addition to aerosol parameters when co-incident satellite measurements are available.
   The method was applied to observations of smoke and desert dust over the Mongu (Zambia) and Solar Village (Saudi Arabia) AERONET sites respectively. The AERONET data were complemented by available observations from the MISR, MODIS, and POLDER-2 satellite sensors. The retrieved bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and surface albedo comparison shows good agreement between results obtained using observations from different satellites.
   The robustness of the method is tested by analyzing surface albedo time series retrieved during periods of high aerosol optical depth variability and low seasonal changes in surface reflectance. The analysis shows that the performance of retrieval algorithm is stable under different aerosol loadings. It is shown that much of the observed surface albedo temporal variability could be attributed mostly to the combined uncertainty in satellite radiometric calibration and aerosol vertical distribution for Mongu and to differences in satellite angular sampling on different days for Solar Village.
   The sensitivity of surface retrievals to assumptions on aerosol vertical distribution and aerosol particle shape are analyzed. It is found that the maximum error in retrieved surface albedo at 0.44 mu m is 0.035 for aerosol optical depth 0.85 at 0.44 mu m. For aerosol optical depths lower than -0.7 the error in retrieved surface albedo is less than 0.02. Analysis of particle shape assumptions on surface retrievals showed that aerosol particle non-sphericity significantly affects the angular shape of BRF, but not the surface albedo.
   Finally, the sensitivity of AERONET aerosol retrievals to uncertainty in assumed surface reflectance is analyzed by comparing aerosol retrievals obtained with different surface assumptions. It is found that the uncertainty in surface reflectance model employed in the version I AERONET operational algorithm is larger than was previously assumed in [Dubovik, O., Smimov, A., Holbert, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, 1. (2600), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806] and may have more significant effect on the retrieved aerosol properties than was documented in that work. In particular, larger errors were encountered for the real part of the refractive index (-0.05-0.07 increase) and maximum of the particle size distribution (similar to 20% decrease) retrievals for the Mongu case, when the aerosol optical depth was relatively small (similar to 0.4 at 0.44 mu m). The retrieved single scattering albedo uncertainties were within the error bars (0.03) estimated in [Dubovik, O., Smimov, A., Holbert, B. N., King, M. D., Kaufman, Y. J., Eck, T. F., & Slutsker, I. (2000), Accuracy assessment of aerosol optical properties retrieved from AERONET sun and sky radiance measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, 9791-9806], with the exception of the 0.44 mu m retrievals for the desert dust case when they increased by - 0.09 and 0.07 for low and high aerosol loadings respectively.

AB Using Landsat images acquired since early 1970s, we have mapped the forest cover and change between 1989 and 2000, and estimated forest area in 1973 in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest Ecoregion (PAFE). The results revealed that as of 1973, 73.4% of the PAFE region was covered by forest. Since then, the proportion of forested area was quickly reduced to 40.7% by 1989 and further down to 24.9% by 2000. Two competing deforestation processes contributed to this rapid forest loss, with the first being driven by settlers and the second by large private land owners. During the 1989-2000 period, 80% of deforested areas were cleared by private land owners and 20% by the settlers. Protected areas slowed down forest loss within their boundaries, but not in their surrounding areas. The average percent forest loss in the area within 5 km from the boundary of Paraguay's major forested protected areas was 39% during the 1989-2000 period, which was essentially the same as that for the entire PAFE region during the same period. The high rates of forest loss in the areas surrounding the protected areas not only left the protected areas highly isolated as ecological "islands", they may also be precursors to rapid forest loss within the protected areas. These protected areas are critical to the conservation of many species endemic or limited to the PAFE region and surrounding areas, and should be continuously monitored using recent and future satellite observations.

AB The spatial and spectral variability Of urban environments present fundamental challenges to deriving accurate remote sensing products for urban areas. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) is a technique that potentially addresses both challenges. MESMA models spectra as the linear sum of spectrally pure endmembers that vary on a per-pixel basis. Spatial variability is addressed by mapping sub-pixel components of land cover as a combination of endmembers. Spectral variability is addressed by allowing the number and type of endmembers to vary from pixel to pixel. This paper presents an application of MESMA to map the physical components of urban land cover for the city of Manaus, Brazil, using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery.
   We present a methodology to build a regionally specific spectral library of urban materials based on generalized categories of urban land-cover components: vegetation, impervious surfaces, soil, and water. Using this library, we applied MESMA to generate a total of H 37 two-, three-, and four-endmember models for each pixel; the model with the lowest root-mean-squared (RMS) error and lowest complexity was selected on a per-pixel basis. Almost 97% of the pixels within the image were modeled within the 2.5% RMS error constraint. The modeled fractions were used to generate Continuous maps of the per-pixel abundance of each generalized land-cover component. We provide an example to demonstrate that land-cover components have the potential to characterize trajectories of physical landscape change as urban neighborhoods develop through time. Accuracy of land-cover fractions was assessed using high-resolution, geocoded images mosaicked from digital aerial videography. Modeled vegetation and impervious fractions corresponded well with the reference fractions. Modeled soil fractions did not correspond as closely with the reference fractions, in part due to limitations of the reference data. This work demonstrates the potential of moderate-resolution, multispectral imagery to map and monitor the evolution of the physical urban environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Properties of multi-temporal ERS-1/2 tandem coherence in boreal forests and retrieval accuracy of forest stem volume have been investigated mostly for small, managed forest areas. The clear seasonal trends and the high accuracy of the retrieval are therefore valid for specific types of forest and question is if these findings extend to large areas with different forest types in a similar manner. Using multi-temporal ERS-1/2 coherence data and extensive sets of inventory data at stand level at seven forest compartments in Central Siberia we confirm that the trend of coherence as a function of stem volume is mainly driven by the environmental conditions at acquisition. In addition, we have now found that the variability of the coherence for a given stem volume are due to spatial variations of the environmental conditions, strong topography (slope > 10 degrees), small stand size (< 3-4 ha) and low relative stocking (< 50%). Further deviations can be related to errors in the ground data. Stein volume retrieval behaves consistently under stable winter frozen conditions. For stands larger than 3-4 ha and relative stocking of at least 50%, a. relative RMSE of 20-25% can be considered the effective retrieval error achievable in Siberian boreal forest. Combined with previous experience from managed test forests in Sweden and Finland, C-band ERS-1/2 tandem coherence observations acquired under stable winter conditions with a snow cover and an at least moderate breeze can be considered so far the most suitable spacebome remote sensing observable for the estimation of forest stem volume in homogeneous forest stands throughout the boreal zone.

AB Monitoring the locations and distributions of land-cover changes is important for establishing links between policy decisions, regulatory actions and subsequent land-use activities. Past studies incorporating two-date change detection using Landsat data have tended to be performance limited for applications in biologically complex systems. This study explored the use of 250 in multi-temporal MODIS NDVI 16-day composite data to provide an automated change detection and alarm capability on a 1 year time-step for the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System (APES) region of the US. Detection accuracy was assessed for 2002 at 88%, with a reasonable balance between change commission errors (21.9%), change omission errors (27.5%), and Kappa coefficient of 0.67. Annual change detection rates across the APES over the study period (20022005) were estimated at 0.7% per annum and varied from 0.4% (2003) to 0.9% (2004). Regional variations were also readily apparent ranging from 1.6% to 0.1% per annum for the tidal water and mountain ecological zones, respectfully. This research included the application of an automated protocol to first filter the MODIS NDVI data to remove poor (corrupted) data values and then estimate the missing data values using a discrete Fourier transformation technique to provide high-quality uninterrupted data to support the change detection analysis. The methods and results detailed in this article apply only to non-agricultural areas. Additional limitations attributed to the coarse resolution of the NDVI data included the overestimation of change area that necessitated the application of a change area correction factor.

AB Many satellite images have a coarser spatial resolution than the extent of land cover patterns on the ground, leading to mixed pixels whose composite spectral response consists of responses from multiple land cover classes. Spectral unmixing procedures only determine the fractions of such classes within a coarse pixel without locating them in space. Super-resolution or sub-pixel mapping aims at providing a fine resolution map of class labels, one that displays realistic spatial structure (without artifact discontinuities) and reproduces the coarse resolution fractions. In this paper, existing approaches for super-resolution mapping are placed within an inverse problem framework, and a geostatistical method is proposed for generating alternative synthetic land cover maps at the fine (target) spatial resolution; these super-resolution realizations are consistent with all the information available.
   More precisely, indicator coKriging is used to approximate the probability that a pixel at the fine spatial resolution belongs to a particular class, given the coarse resolution fractions and (if available) a sparse set of class labels at some informed fine pixels. Such Kriging-derived probabilities are used in sequential indicator simulation to generate synthetic maps of class labels at the fine resolution pixels. This non-iterative and fast simulation procedure yields alternative super-resolution land cover maps that reproduce: (i) the observed coarse fractions, (ii) the fine resolution class labels that might be available, and (iii) the prior structural information encapsulated in a set of indicator variogram models at the fine resolution. A case. study is provided to illustrate the proposed methodology using Landsat TM data from SE China. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM) was used to analyze the distribution of NDVI and phytomass in the Arctic, providing data for understanding arctic vegetation patterns, assessing change, and calibrating models. The dominant trend in the analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was a decrease from south to north, correlating with bioclimate subzones and vegetation units. NDVI also decreased at higher elevations and with higher substrate pH. In the coldest bioclimate subzone, increased elevation was not correlated with decreased NDVI. In the warmest tundra bioclimate subzone, especially in Alaska, NDVI did not decrease with the first several hundred meters of elevation. NDVI in this subzone varied more by region than by elevation or substrate chemistry, and was lowest in recently glaciated areas such as the Canadian Shield. Phytomass (above-ground plant biomass) was calculated from NDVI using a relationship derived from ground clip-harvest data. Phytomass for the tundra bioclimate subzone was estimated at 2.5 x 10(12) kg, with most of this in the warmest subzone, at the lowest elevations, and on acidic substrates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite remote sensing is a promising technique to estimate global or regional evapotranspiration (ET) or evaporative fraction (EF) of the surface total net radiation budget. The current methods of estimating the ET (or EF) from the gradient between land surface temperature (T-s) and near surface air temperature are very sensitive to the retrieval errors of T-s and the interpolation errors of air temperature from the ground-based point measurements. Two types of methods have been proposed to reduce this sensitivity: the thermal inertia method and the T-s-nonnalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (T-s-NDVI) spatial variation method. The former is based on the temporal difference between T-s retrievals, and the latter uses the spatial information of Ts. Another approach is proposed here that combines the advantages of the two types of methods and uses day-night T-s difference-NDVI (A T-s-NDVI). Ground-based measurements collected by Energy Balance Bowen Ratio systems at the 11 enhanced facilities located at the Southern Great Plains of the United States from April 2001 to May 2005 were analyzed to identify parameterization of EF. Delta T-s-NDVI spatial variations from the Aqua and Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global daily products, at 1 km resolution were used to estimate EF. Ground-based measurements taken during 16days in 2004 were used to validate the MODIS EF retrievals. The EFs retrieved from the spatial variations of Delta T-s-NDVI show a distinct improvement over that retrieved from the Delta T-s-NDVI. The EF can be retrieved with a mean relative accuracy of about 17% with the proposed AT,-NDVI spatial variations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Reducing soil evaporation (E) is an important way to increase water use efficiency for agriculture and sustainable water use. To achieve this goal, an accurate estimate of soil evaporation at the macro-scale level is necessary. By including the surface temperature of dry soil, the three temperatures model (3T model) was proposed as an estimate of E, and its temperature term was defined as the soil evaporation transfer coefficient (h(a)). Although it has been primarily shown that h(a) determines the boundaries of E, further studies of its properties are necessary because h(a) has the application potential for remote sensing. The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the relationships between h(a) and those parameters that are important for E estimation but are not able to be remotely measured (aerodynamic resistance, soil surface resistance (r(s)), and cumulative evaporation (E-c)); and (2) discuss the possibility for remote sensing application. Two experiments were carried out for these purposes: one in an open field and the other one in a closed growth chamber at constant temperature, humidity, and radiation. The following results were obtained: (1) Given the boundaries of 0 <= h(a) <= 1, E was determined between its maximum value (potential evaporation rate) and minimum value (zero); (2) During the period when evaporation is controlled by r a linear relation between h(a) and log (r(s)) is observed with a coefficient of determination r(2)=0.76. Because h(a) and r(s) are independent variables with significant differences in properties and magnitudes, these results indicate that h(a) and r(s) are well related to each other; (3) During stage 1 of evaporation, cumulative evaporation (E-c) increased with time while h(a) remained constant. Afterwards, ha linearly increased with E-c. The relationships among h(a), E-c, r(a), and r(s) would be useful for estimation of evapotranspiration by remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The position of the inflexion point in the red edge region (680 to 780 nm) of the spectral reflectance signature, termed the red edge position (REP), is affected by biochemical and biophysical parameters and has been used as a means to estimate foliar chlorophyll or nitrogen content. In this paper, we report on a new technique for extracting the REP from hyperspectral data that aims to mitigate the discontinuity in the relationship between the REP and the nitrogen content caused by the existence of a double-peak feature on the derivative spectrum. It is based on a linear extrapolation of straight lines on the far-red (680 to 700 nm) and NIR (725 to 760 nm) flanks of the first derivative reflectance spectrum. The REP is then defined by the wavelength value at the intersection of the two lines. The output is a REP equation, REP=-(c(1)-c(2))/(m(1) - m(2)), where c(1) and c(2), and m(1) and m(2) represent the intercepts and slopes of the far-red and NIR lines, respectively. Far-red wavebands at 679.65 and 694.30 nm in combination with NIR wavebands at 732.46 and 760.41 nm or at 723.64 and 760.41 mn were identified as the optimal combinations for calculating nitrogen-sensitive REPs for three spectral data sets (rye canopy, and maize leaf and mixed grass/herb leaf stack spectra). REPs extracted using this new technique (linear extrapolation method) showed high correlations with a wide range of foliar nitrogen concentrations for both narrow and wider bandwidth spectra, being comparable with results obtained using the traditional linear interpolation, polynomial and inverted Gaussian fitting techniques. In addition, the new technique is simple as is the case with the linear interpolation method, but performed better than the latter method in the case of maize leaves at different developmental stages and mixed grass/herb leaves with a low nitrogen concentration.

AB The strength of a texture-based classification lies in the fact that it detects spatial patterning as a function of spectral variation within a particular facies class, as opposed to spectral consistency which drives standard probability-driven image classifiers. Following this premise, the Moran's I spatial autocorrelation metric was proven to return values which differed significantly for areas characterised by dense interlocking thickets of the coral Acropora cervicornis versus areas populated by a sparse mixed coral assemblage dominated by Montastrea annularis. The different behaviour of the metric was sufficient to facilitate spatial discrimination of the two assemblages using a supervised classifier with accuracies that surpass the level of prediction offered by standard spectral-based methods. Discrimination was optimum when autocorrelation was evaluated within a moving window with side-lengths ranging between circa. 30-70 in. The discrimination ability is postulated to be linked to intrinsic differences in the spatial-patterning of the two assemblages at scales of tens of metres. The observed patterning can be further related to the growth form and architecture of the differing coral assemblages. The study demonstrates the potential of using kemel-based autocorrelation metrics in unison with satellite data and offers a pertinent tool for monitoring ecologically important coral assemblages that are statistically indistinct using traditional spectral methods.

We used Multiple Segmenting Method (MSM), which is well suited to analyze scaling behaviour in short time series, and the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), which permits the detection of persistent properties in nonstationary signal fluctuations. Our findings point out to the characterization of Mediterranean ecosystems as governed by persistent mechanisms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to determine spatio-temporal variations of water volume over inundated areas located in large river basins using combined observations from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), the Topex/poseidon (T/P) altimetry satellite, and in-situ hydrographic stations. Ultimately, the goal is to quantify the role of floodplains for partitioning water and sediment fluxes over the great fluvial basins of the world. SAR images are used to identify the type of surface (open water, inundated areas, forest) and, hence, the areas covered with water. Both radar altimetry data and in-situ hydrographic measurements yield water level time series. The basin of the Negro River, the tributary which carries the largest discharge to the Amazon River, was selected as a test site. By combining area estimates derived from radar images classification with changes in water level, variations of water volume (focusing on a seasonal cycle) have been obtained. The absence of relationship between water volume and inundated area, reflecting the diverse and widely dispersed floodplains of the basin, is one of the main result of this study.

AB Methods for chlorosis detection and physiological condition monitoring in Vitis vinifera L. through accurate chlorophyll a and b content (C-ab) estimation at leaf and canopy levels are presented in this manuscript. A total of 24 vineyards were identified for field and airborne data collection with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer (ROSIS) and the Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS-7915) hyperspectral sensors in 2002 and 2003 in northern Spain, comprising 103 study areas of 10 x 10 m in size, with a total of 1467 leaves collected for determination of pigment concentration. A subsample of 605 leaves was used for measuring the optical properties of reflectance and transmittance with a Li-Cor 1800-12 Integrating Sphere coupled by a 200 gm diameter single mode fiber to an Ocean Optics model USB2000 spectrometer. Several narrow-band vegetation indices were calculated from leaf reflectance spectra, and the PROSPECT leaf optical model was used for inversion using the extensive database of leaf optical properties. Results showed that the best indicators for chlorophyll content estimation in V vinifera L. leaves were narrow-band hyperspectral indices calculated in the 700-750 nm spectral region (r(2) ranging between 0.8 and 0.9), with poor performance of traditional indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Results for other biochemicals indicated that the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) were more sensitive to carotenoids Cx+c and chlorophyll-carotenoid ratios C-ab/Cx+c than to chlorophyll content Cab. Chlorophyll a and b estimation by inversion of the PROSPECT leaf model on V vinifera L. spectra was successful, yielding a determination coefficient of r(2)=0.95, with an RMSE=5.3 mu g/cm(2). The validity of leaf-level indices for chlorophyll content estimation at the canopy level in V vinifera L. was studied using the scaling-up approach that links PROSPECT and rowMCRM canopy reflectance simulation to account for the effects of vineyard structure, vine dimensions, row orientation and soil and shadow effects on the canopy reflectance. The index calculated as a combination of the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI), and the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) in the form TCARI/OSAVI was the most consistent index for estimating Cab on aggregated and pure vine pixels extracted from 1 m CASI and ROSIS hyperspectral imagery. Predictive relationships were developed with PROSPECT-rowMCRM model between Cab and TCARI/OSAVI as function of LAI, using field-measured vine dimensions and image-extracted soil background, row-orientation and viewing geometry values. Prediction relationships for C-ab content with TCARI/OSAVI were successfully applied to the 103 study sites imaged on 24 fields by ROSIS and CASI airborne sensors, yielding r(2)=0.67 and RMSE=11.5 mu g/cm(2).

AB Thermal infrared data from recently launched satellite instruments provide an opportunity to address key scientific questions and develop new applications, which could not be addressed or developed with data from earlier instruments. The satellite instruments that provide these data include ASTER, Landsat ETM+, and MODIS, and this study demonstrates bow data from them can be used to map upwelling and circulation associated with the transport of heat, solutes, and particles in lakes. Upwelling in a density-stratified water body such as a lake or reservoir results from a surface wind stress being balanced by a horizontal pressure gradient, causing denser water to rise at the upwind lake boundary. Upwellings are considered partial when intermediate-depth water reaches the surface and total when bottom water surfaces. Upwellings are an important part of ecosystem functioning, since they transport nutrients from deeper in the lake, where they accumulate, to the surface layer, where they facilitate phytoplankton growth. Thermal infrared images acquired by ASTER, ETM+, and MODIS can be used to observe partial upwelling events in lakes and provide insight into their spatial variability and horizontal distribution, information totally lacking from conventional in situ measurements. At Lake Tahoe, partial upwellings were found to occur every few days throughout the spring and summer, transporting water from 10-30 in below the surface to the surface layer. They commonly display a jet-like appearance, traveling from the upwind to the downwind side of the lake, with current speeds of 12-17 cm/s. Partial upwellings were found to generally decrease lake clarity, although deeper upwelling events can increase clarity. Sinking zones, other convergence areas, and divergence areas were also observed. The temperature variability associated with upwelling, which could be clearly mapped in the thermal infrared satellite images, illustrates the advantage of synoptic thermal infrared satellite measurements over in situ point measurements alone for detecting upwelling events, since, depending on location, an in situ instrument might not capture an upwelling event. The spatial information conveyed by the synoptic satellite measurements can be used to help improve monitoring of the clarity and general water quality of Lake Tahoe. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB An original integrated monitoring method is designed to infer an accurate and reliable figure of regional land displacements in coastal areas where the presence of internal waters, wetlands, farmlands, urban and industrial centers usually reduces the efficiency of single ground-based and satellite-based measuring techniques. Five different methods, i.e. spirit leveling, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), Continuous GPS (CGPS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and Interferometric Point Target Analysis (fPTA), are integrated into a Subsidence Integrated Monitoring System (SIMS) to overcome the limits characterizing each technique. The SIMS has been used over the past decade to provide a new image of the land displacements in the Venice region. The result exhibits a resolution never obtained before. The central lagoon, including the city of Venice, shows a general stability while the northern and southern lagoon extremities and their related catchment sectors sink with serious rates averaging 3 to 5 mm/year. The sinking rates increase up to 10 - 15 mm/year in the coastland south of the lagoon. Relatively small uplifts (less than 1 mm/year) are observed at the Alpine foothills and in a wide area comprised between the Euganean Hills and the lagoon. The observed land displacements have been associated to the geological features of the study region, i.e. tectonics, seismicity, differential consolidation of the middle-upper Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and to anthropogenic activities, such as land reclamation and groundwater withdrawal.

AB This paper analyses the relationship between the interannual variations of snow depth and snowmelt date and river discharge measurements in the Ob river basin. The snow parameters are derived from passive microwave remote sensing measurements by SSM/I during the time period 1989-2001. We find a significant correlation between the snowmelt date and the runoff in May (correlation coefficient R=-0.92) and between the winter snow depth and the runoff in June (R=0.61) measured at the Ob estuary. These results validate the methods used to derive the interannual variability of the snow parameters, particularly the snow depth. In such vast and remote regions, this is fundamental for monitoring and predicting snow related flood events. Furthermore, the results obtained can be very useful to improve the description of the snow-runoff relationship in global hydrological models. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global mapping of the vegetation clumping index is attempted for the first time using multi-angular POLDER I data based on a methodology that has been demonstrated to be applicable to Canada's landmass. The clumping index quantified the level of foliage grouping within distinct canopy structures, such as tree crowns, shrubs, and row crops, relative to a random distribution. Vegetation foliage clumping significantly alters its radiation environment and therefore affects vegetation growth as well as water and carbon cycles. The clumping index is useful in ecological and meteorological models because it provides new structural information in addition to the effective LAI retrieved from mono-angle remote sensing and allows accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in the canopy. The relationship between an angular index (normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot) and the clumping index is explored using a geometrical optical model named "4-Scale". A simplified version of the mechanistic hotspot model used in 4-Scale is developed to derive the hotspot reflectance from multi-angle measurements for mapping purposes. An accurate clumping map for areas with significant tree (shrub) covers has been achieved, although further research is required to reduce topographic effects. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB A Markov random field (MRF) based method using both contextual information and multiscale fuzzy line process for classifying remotely sensed imagery is detailed in this paper. The study area known as Elkhorn Stough is an important natural reserve park located in the central California coast, USA. Satellite imagery such as IKONOS panchromatic and multispectral data provides a convenient way for supporting the monitoring process around this area. Within the proposed classification mechanism, the panchromatic image, benefited from its high resolution, mainly serves for extracting multiscale line features by means of wavelet transform techniques. The resulting multiscale line features are merged through a fuzzy fusion process and then incorporated into the MRF model accompanied with multispectral imagery to perform contextual classification so as to restrict the over-smooth classification patterns and reduce the bias commonly contributed by those boundary pixels. The MRF model parameter is estimated based on the probability histogram analysis to those boundary pixels, and the algorithm called maximum a posterior margin (MPM) is applied to search the solution. The results show that the proposed method, based on the MRF model with the multiscale fuzzy line process, successfully generates the patch-wise classification patterns, and simultaneously improved the accuracy and visual interpretation.

AB Our interest in this paper is on the choice of spatial and categorical scale, and their interaction, in creating classifications, of land cover from remotely sensed measurements. We note that in discussing categorical scale, the concept of spatial scale naturally arises, and in discussing spatial scale, the issue of aggregation of measurements must be considered. Therefore, and working towards an ultimate goal of producing multiscale, multigranular characterizations of land cover, we address here successively and in a cumulative fashion the topics of (1) aggregation of measurements across multiple scales, (2) adaptive choice of spatial scale, and (3) adaptive choice of categorical scale jointly with spatial scale. We show that the use of statistical finite mixture models with groups of original pixel-scale measurements, at successive spatial scales, offers improved pixel-wise classification accuracy as compared to the commonly used technique of label aggregation. We then show how a statistical model selection strategy may be used with the finite mixture models to provide a data,adaptive choice of spatial scale, varying by location (i.e., multiscale), from which classifications at least as accurate as those any single spatial scale may be achieved. Finally, we extend this paradigm to allow for jointly adaptive selection of spatial and categorical scale. Our emphasis throughout is on the empirical quantification of the role of the various elements above, and it comparison of their performance with standard methods, using various artificial landscapes. The methods proposed in this paper should be useful for I variety of scale-related land cover classification tasks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study systematically evaluated linear predictive models between vegetation indices (VI) derived from radionnetrically corrected airborne imaging spectrometer (HyMap) data and field measurements of biophysical forest stand variables (n = 40). Ratio-based and soil-line-related broadband VI were calculated after HyMap reflectance had been spectrally resampled to Landsat TM channels. Hyperspectral VI involved all possible types of two-band combinations of ratio VI (RVI) and perpendicular VI (PVI) and the red edge inflection point (REIP) computed from two techniques, inverted Gaussian Model and Lagrange Interpolation. Cross-validation procedure was used to assess the prediction power of the regression models. Analyses were performed on the entire data set or on subsets stratified according to stand age. A PVI based on wavebands at 1088 run and 1148 nm was linearly related to leaf area index (LAI) R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.69 m(2) m(-2) (21% of the mean); after removal of one forest stand subjected to clearing measures: R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.54 m(2) m(-2) (17% of the mean). A PVI based on wavebands at 885 run and 948 nm was linearly related to the crown volume (VOL) (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE 0,52). VOL was derived from measured biophysical variables through factor analysis (varimax rotation). The study demonstrates that for hyperspectral image data, linear regression models can be applied to quantify LAI and VOL with good accuracy. For broadband multispectral data, the accuracy was generally lower. It can be stated that the hyperspectral data set contains more information relevant to the estimation of the forest stand variables LAI and VOL than multispectral data. When the pooled data set was analysed, soil-line-related VI performed better than ratio-based VI. When age classes were analysed separately, hyperspectral VI performed considerably better than broadband VI. Best hyperspectral VI in relation with LAI were typically based on wavebands related to prominent water absorption features. Such VI are related to the total amount of canopy water; as the leaf water content is considered to be relatively constant in the study area, variations of LAI are retrieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB While many (and more on the way) ocean color satellite sensors presently provide routine observations of ocean biological processes, limited concrete effort has taken place to demonstrate bow these data can be used together in any systematic way. One obvious way is to merge these data streams together to provide robust merged climate data records with measurable uncertainty bounds. Here, we present and implement a formalism for merging global satellite ocean color data streams to produce uniform data products. Normalized water-leaving radiances (L-wN(lambda)) from SeaWiFS and MODIS are used together in a semianalytical ocean color merging model to produce global retrievals of 3 biogeochemically relevant variables (chlorophyll, combined dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient, particulate backscattering coefficient). The model-based merging approach has various benefits over techniques that blend end products, such as chlorophyll concentrations; (1) merging at the level of water-leaving radiance ensures simultaneity and consistency of the retrievals, (2) it works with single or multiple data sources regardless of their specific bands, (3) it exploits band redundancies and band differences, (4) it can account for the uncertainties of the incoming L-wN(lambda) data streams and, (5) it provides confidence intervals for the derived products. These features are illustrated through several examples of ocean color data merging using SeaWiFS and MODIS Terra and Aqua L-wN(lambda) imagery. Compared to each of the original data source, the products derived from the merging procedure show enhanced global daily coverage and lower uncertainties in the retrieved variables.

AB The spectral and directional reflection proper-ties of pine forest understory in Suonenjoki, Finland were measured using a newly developed transportable field goniospectrometer under direct sunlight or plant lamp. The samples represent the most typical types in Finnish forests. Large differences between species were found. Wax-leaved shrubs such as lingonberry and blueberry proved to be strong forward scatterers, whereas lichen and soft-leaved dwarf shrubs such as heather were strong backscatterers. The measured moss showed both forward and backscattering features; There were variations among the samples of the same species, but many typical features appeared consistent and reproducible. Both "pure" and mixed samples were measured, the latter showing smoother behavior than the former, that is, the strongest forward and backward features are downscaled. The results provide a starting point for an empirical understory model and a basis for development and validation of a theoretical model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale (1:3000) color aerial images of a population of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) were collected in the early spring of 1997, 1998, and 1999. An automated spatial segmentation procedure was developed to identify and measure individual population objects or blobs within the forest population. To ensure the comparability of multiyear segmentation maps, an automated blob reconciliation procedure was also developed to make certain that no hemlock pixels were assigned to different blobs in different years. The automated segmentation and reconciliation procedures were applied to a population of naturally occurring hemlock. Following spatial segmentation, a large majority of hemlock blobs (similar to66-71%) were found to be closely associated with ground referenced, manually delineated individual hemlock crowns. The remaining blobs consisted of spatially distinct parts of a crown or closely clumped multiple crowns. Similar overall classification accuracies (similar to63-72%) were found following the reconciliation of multitemporal image pairs. The development of these spatially explicit multitemporal population data sets should prove useful to further investigations of the dynamics of and environmental influence on plant populations.

AB Spectral matching algorithms can be used for the identification of unknown spectra based on a measure of similarity with one or more known spectra. Two popular spectral matching algorithms use different error metrics and constraints to determine the existence of a spectral match. Multiple endmember spectral Mixture analysis (MESMA) is a linear mixing model that uses a root mean square error (RMSE) error metric. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) compares two spectra using a spectral angle error metric. This paper compares two endmember MESMA and SAM using a spectral library containing six land cover classes. RMSE and spectral angle for models within each land cover class were directly compared. The dependence of RMSE on the albedo of the modeled spectrum was also explored. RMSE and spectral angle A were found to be closely related, although not equivalent, due to variations in the albedo of the modeled spectra. Error constraints applied to both models resulted in large differences in the number of spectral matches. Using MESMA, the number of spectra modeled within the error constraint increased as the albedo of the modeled spectra decreased. The value of the error constraint used was shown to make a much larger difference in the number of spectra modeled than the choice of spectral matching algorithm. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Spatial scaling is of particular importance in remote sensing applications to terrestrial ecosystems where spatial heterogeneity is the norm. Surface parameters derived at different resolutions can be considerably different even though they are derived using the same algorithms. This article addresses issues related to spatial scaling of net primary productivity (NPP). The main objective is to develop algorithms for spatial scaling of NPP using subpixel information. NPP calculations were performed using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). The area of interest is near Fraserdale, Ontario, Canada. It is found from this investigation that lumped (coarse resolution) calculations can be considerably biased (by +14.9% on average) from the distributed (fine resolution) case. Based on these results, algorithms for removing these biases in lumped NPP are developed using subpixel land cover type information. The correlation between the distributed NPP and lumped NPP is improved from r(2)=0. 16 to r(2)=0.59 after the correction. In addition, subpixel leaf area index (LAI) information is used to reduce the remaining biases. After the LAI correction, the correlation is further improved to r(2)=0.90. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Cloud detection is the first step in studying the role of polar clouds in the global climate system with satellite data. In this paper, the cloud detection algorithm for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is evaluated with model simulations and satellite data collocated with radar/lidar observations at three Arctic and Antarctic stations. Results show that the current MODIS cloud mask algorithm performs well in polar regions during the day but does not detect more than 40% of the cloud cover over the validation sights at night. Two new cloud tests utilizing the 7.2 mum water vapor and 14.2 mum carbon dioxide bands, one new clear-sky test using the 7.2 mum band, and changes to the thresholds of several other tests are described. With the new cloud detection procedure, the misidentification of cloud as clear decreases from 44.2% to 16.3% at the two Arctic stations, and from 19.8% to 2.7% at the Antarctic station.
