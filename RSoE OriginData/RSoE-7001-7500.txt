AB Remote sensing of forest vertical structure is possible with lidar data, but lidar is not widely available. Here we map tropical dry forest height (RMSE =0.9 m, R-2 = 0.84, range 0.6-7 m), and we map foliage height profiles, with a time series of Landsat and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) imagery on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, substituting time for vertical canopy space. We also simultaneously map forest disturbance type and age. We map these variables in the context of avian habitat studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland's Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red-green-blue composites of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age. Our results strongly support current Landsat Program production of co-registered imagery, and they emphasize the value of seamless time series of cloud-cleared imagery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The crop developmental stage represents essential information for irrigation scheduling/fertilizer management, understanding seasonal ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, and evaluating crop productivity. In this study, we devised an approach called the Two-Step Filtering (TSF) for detecting the phenological stages of maize and soybean from time-series Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations. The TSF method consists of a Two-Step Filtering scheme that includes: (i) smoothing the temporal WDRVI data with a wavelet-based filter and (ii) deriving the optimum scaling parameters from shape-model fitting procedure. The date of key crop development stages are then estimated by using the optimum scaling parameters and an initial value of the specific phenological date on the shape model, which are preliminary defined in reference to ground-based crop growth stage observations. The shape model is a crop-specific WDRVI curve with typical seasonal features, which were defined by averaging smoothed, multi-year WDRVI profiles from MODIS 250-m data collected over irrigated maize and soybean study sites.
   In this study, the TSF method was applied to MODIS-derived WDRVI data over a 6-year period (2003 to 2008) for two irrigated sites and one rainfed site planted to either maize or soybean as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program (CSP) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A comparison of satellite-based retrievals with ground-based crop growth stage observations collected by the CSP over the six growing seasons for these three sites showed that the TSF method can accurately estimate the date of four key phenological stages of maize (V2.5: early vegetative stage, R1: silking stage, R5: dent stage and R6: maturity) and soybean (V1: early vegetative stage, R5: beginning seed, R6: full seed and R7: beginning maturity). The root mean square error (RMSE) of phenological-stage estimation for maize ranged from 2.9 [R1] to 7.0 [R5] days and from 32 [R6] to 6.9 [R7] days for soybean, respectively. In addition, the TSF method was also applied for two years (2001 and 2002) over eastern Nebraska to test its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of these key phenological stages over a larger geographic area. The MODIS-derived crop phenological stage dates agreed well with the statistical crop progress data reported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for eastern Nebraska's three crop agricultural statistic districts (ASDs). At the ASD-level, the RMSE of phenological-stage estimation ranged from 1.6 [R1] to 5.6 [R5] days for maize and from 2.5 [R7] to 5.3 [R5] days for soybean. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been investigated to determine the relationship between burn severity and interferometric coherence at three sites affected by forest fires in a hilly Mediterranean environment. Repeat-pass SAR images were available from the TerraSAR-X, ERS-1/2, Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR sensors. Coherence was related to measurements of burn severity (Composite Burn Index) and remote sensing estimates expressed by the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index. In addition, the effects of topography and weather on coherence estimates were assessed. The analysis for a given range of local incidence angle showed that the co-polarized coherence increases with the increase of burn severity at X- and C-band whereas cross-polarized coherence was practically insensitive to burn severity. Higher sensitivity to burn severity was found at L-band for both co- and cross-polarized channels. The association strength between coherence and burn severity was strongest for images acquired under stable, dry environmental conditions. When the local incidence angle is accounted for the determination coefficients increased from 0.6 to 0.9 for X- and C-band. At L-band the local incidence angle had less influence on the association strength to burn severity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eutrophication and cyanobacterial algal blooms present an increasing threat to the health of freshwater ecosystems and to humans who use these resources for drinking and recreation Remote sensing is being used increasingly as a tool for monitoring these phenomena in inland and near-coastal waters This study uses the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) to view Zeekoevlei, a small hypertrophic freshwater lake situated on the Cape Flats in Cape Town, South Africa, dominated by Microcystis cyanobacteria. The lake's small size, highly turbid water, and covariant water constituents present a challenging case for both algorithm development and atmospheric correction. The objectives of the study are to assess the optical properties of the lake, to evaluate various atmospheric correction procedures, and to compare the performance of empirical and semi-analytical algorithms in hypertrophic water. In situ water quality parameter and radiometric measurements were made simultaneous to MERIS overpasses. Upwelling radiance measurements at depth 0 66 m were corrected for instrument self-shading and processed to water-leaving reflectance using downwelling irradiance measurements and estimates of the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance, K-u, generated from a simple bio-optical model estimating the total absorption, a(lambda), and backscattering coefficients, b(b)(lambda). The normalised water-leaving reflectance was used for assessing the accuracy of image-based Dark Object Subtraction and 6S Radiative Transfer Code atmospheric correction procedures applied to MERIS Empirical algorithms for estimating chlorophyll a (Chl a), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Secchi Disk depth (z(SD)) and absorption by CDOM (a(CDOM)) were derived from simultaneously collected in situ and MERIS measurements. The empirical algorithms gave high correlation coefficient values, although they have a limited ability to separate between signals from covariant water constituents. The MERIS Neural Network algorithms utilised in the standard Level 2 Case 2 waters product and Eutrophic Lakes processor were also used to derive water constituent concentrations. However, these failed to produce reasonable comparisons with in situ measurements owing to the failure of atmospheric correction and divergence between the optical properties and ranges used to train the algorithms and those of Zeekoevlei. Maps produced using the empirical algorithms effectively show the spatial and temporal variability of the water quality parameters during April 2008 On the basis of the results it is argued that MERIS is the current optimal sensor for frequent change detection applications in inland waters. This study also demonstrates the considerable potential value for simple TOA algorithms for hypertrophic systems. It is recommended that regional algorithm development be prioritized in southern Africa and that remote sensing be integrated Into future operational water quality monitoring systems (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB In order to obtain high quality data, the correction of atmospheric perturbations acting upon land surface reflectance measurements recorded by a space-based sensor is an important topic within remote sensing. For many years the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (65) radiative transfer model and the Simplified Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) codes have been used for this atmospheric correction, but previous studies have shown that in a number of situations the quality of correction provided by the SMAC is low. This paper describes a method designed to improve the quality of the SMAC atmospheric correction algorithm through a slight increase in its computational complexity. Data gathered from the SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) is used to validate the additions to SMAC, both by comparison to simulated data corrected using the highly accurate 6S method and by comparison to in-situ and 6S corrected SEVIRI data gathered for two field sites in Africa. The additions to the SMAC are found to greatly increase the quality of atmospheric correction performed, as well as broaden the range of atmospheric conditions under which the SMAC can be applied. When examining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the relative difference between SMAC and in-situ values decreases by 1.5% with the improvements in place. Similarly, the mean relative difference between SMAC and 6S reflectance values decreases by a mean of 13, 14.5 and 8.5% for Channels 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, the processing speed of the SMAC is found to remain largely unaffected, with only a small increase in the time taken to process a full SEVIRI scene. Whilst the method described within this paper is only applicable to SEVIRI data, a similar approach can be applied to other data sources than SEVIRI, and should result in a similar accuracy improvement no matter which instrument supplies the original data.

AB We present a model-based investigation of the effect of discrete-return lidar system and survey characteristics on the signal recorded over young forest environments. A Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) model of canopy scattering was used to examine the sensitivity of model estimates of lidar-derived canopy height, h(lidar) to signal triggering method, canopy structure, footprint size, sampling density and scanning angle, for broadleaf and conifer canopies of varying density. Detailed 3D models of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens) were used to simulate lidar response, with minimal assumptions about canopy structure. Use of such models allowed the impact of lidar parameters on canopy height retrieval to be tested under a range of conditions typically not possible in practice. Retrieved h(lidar) was generally found to be an underestimate of 'true' canopy height, h(canopy), but with exceptions. Choice of signal triggering method caused h(lidar), to underestimate h(canopy) by similar to 4% for birch and similar to 7% for pine (up to 66% in extreme cases). Variations in canopy structure resulted on average in underestimation of h(canopy) by 13% for birch and between 29 and 48% for pine depending on age, but with over-estimates in some cases of up to 10%. Increasing footprint diameter from 0.1 to 1 m increased retrieved h(lidar) from significant underestimates of h(canopy) to values indistinguishable from h(canopy). Increased sampling density led to slightly increased values of h(lidar) to close to h(canopy), but not significantly. Increasing scan angle increased h(lidar) by up to 8% for birch, and 19% for pine at a scan angle of 30 degrees. The impact of scan angle was greater for conifers as a result of large variation in crown height. Results showed that interactions between physically modelled (hypothetical) within canopy returns are similar to findings made in other studies using actual lidar systems, and that these modelled returns can depend strongly on the type of canopy and the lidar acquisition characteristics, as well as interactions between these properties. Physical models of laser pulse/canopy interactions may provide additional information on pulse interactions within the canopy, but require validation and testing before they are applied to actual survey planning and logistics.

AB This study evaluated the synergistic use of high spatial resolution multispectral imagery (i.e., QuickBird, 2.4 m) and low-posting-density LIDAR data (3 m) for forest species classification using an object-based approach. The integration of QuickBird multispectral imagery and LIDAR data was considered during image segmentation and the subsequent object-based classification. Three segmentation schemes were examined: (1) segmentation based solely on the spectral image layers; (2) segmentation based solely on MAR-derived layers; and (3) segmentation based on both the spectral and LIDAR-derived layers. For each segmentation scheme, objects were generated at twelve different scales in order to determine optimal scale parameters. Six categories of classification metrics were generated for each object based on spectral data alone, LIDAR data alone and the combination of both data sources. Machine learning decision trees were used to build classification rule sets. Quantitative segmentation quality assessment and classification accuracy results showed the integration of spectral and LIDAR data, in both image segmentation and object-based classification, improved the forest classification compared to using either data source independently. Better segmentation quality led to higher classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (Kappa 91.6%) was acquired when using both spectral- and LIDAR-derived metrics based on objects segmented from both spectral and LIDAR layers at scale parameter 250, where best segmentation quality was achieved. Optimal scales were analyzed for each segmentation-classification scheme. Statistical analysis of classification accuracies at different scales revealed that there was a range of optimal scales that provided statistically similar accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing plays an important role in delivering accurate and timely information on the location and area of major crop types with important environmental, economic, and policy considerations. The purpose of this paper is to report on an unsupervised signal processing algorithm called Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to temporally decompose MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to automatically map major crop types in three agricultural regions covering parts of Kansas and Nebraska in the US and a third in northwestern Turkey. The approach proposed here is based on the premise that the temporal profiles of individual crops are observed as mixtures with a moderate-resolution sensor when cultivated fields are smaller than the spatial resolution of the observing sensor. The purpose of ICA is to decompose these mixed observations by a remote sensor into individual crop signals, using only the mixed observations without the aid of information about the crop signatures and the mixing process. Results using both synthetic data and real observations suggest that the ICA approach can successfully separate generalized, landscape-level cropping patterns using only available temporal measurements. There is very little need to use complicated indices or derivative spectral products to map crop types using ICA: availability of high temporal observations, either as raw spectral bands or simple vegetation indices is sufficient to identify crop types at the scale of landscapes. Results also suggest that crop map predictions aggregated to coarser resolutions have better accuracy than at native resolution when compared to maps made from fine-scale observations used as ground truth. These accuracies range from RMSE of 15-30% at 500 m to less than 10% at 2000 m. The success of the initial results presented here to automatically map crop distributions across large areas using MODIS data is particularly encouraging given the existing and planned worldwide observations of agriculturally important regions. However, the use of ICA for operational crop monitoring will require algorithms that will take into account prior information on crop growth curves, constrained estimation of independent components, and scaling of mixing vectors to obtain physically possible ranges.

AB Characterizing forest structure is an important part of any comprehensive biodiversity assessment. However, current methods for measuring structural complexity require a laborious process that involves many logistically expensive point based measurements. An automated or semi-automated method would be ideal. In this study, the utility of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR; Light Detection and Ranging) for characterizing the ecological structure of a forest landscape is examined. The innovation of this paper is to use different laser pulse return properties from a full waveform LiDAR to characterize forest ecological structure. First the LiDAR dataset is stratified into four vertical layers: ground, low vegetation (0-1 m from the ground), medium vegetation (1-5 m from the ground) and high vegetation (>5 m). Subsequently the "Type" of LiDAR return is analysed: Type I (singular returns); Type 2 (first of many returns); Type 3 (intermediate returns); and Type 4 (last of many returns). A forest characterization scheme derived from LiDAR point clouds is proposed. A validation of the scheme is then presented using a network of field sites that recorded commonly used metrics of biodiversity. The proposed forest characterization categories allow for quantification of gaps (above bare ground, low vegetation and medium vegetation), canopy cover and its vertical density as well as the presence of various canopy strata (low, medium and high). Regression analysis showed that LiDAR derived variables were good predictors of field recorded variables (R(2) = 0.82, P < 0.05 between LiDAR derived presence of low vegetation and field derived LAI for low vegetation). The proposed scheme clearly shows the potential of full waveform LiDAR to provide information on the complexity of habitat structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The utility of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products is limited by cloud cover which causes gaps in the daily snow-cover map products. We describe a cloud-gap-filled (CGF) daily snow-cover map using a simple algorithm to track cloud persistence, to account for the uncertainty created by the age of the snow observation. Developed from the 0.05 degrees resolution climate-modeling grid daily snow-cover product, MOD10C1, each grid cell of the CGF map provides a cloud-persistence count (CPC) that tells whether the current or a prior day was used to make the snow decision. Percentage of grid cells "observable" is shown to increase dramatically when prior days are considered. The effectiveness of the CGF product is evaluated by conducting a suite of data assimilation experiments using the community Noah land surface model in the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework. The Noah model forecasts of snow conditions, such as snow-water equivalent (SWE). are updated based on the observations of snow cover which are obtained either from the MOD10C1 standard product or the new CGF product. The assimilation integrations using the CGF maps provide domain-averaged bias improvement of similar to 11%, whereas such improvement using the standard MOD10C1 maps is similar to 3%. These improvements suggest that the Noah model underestimates SWE and snow depth fields, and that the assimilation integrations contribute to correcting this systematic error. We conclude that the gap-filling strategy is an effective approach for increasing cloud-free observations of snow cover. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET), the sum of evaporation from soil and transpiration from vegetation, is of vital importance in the hydrologic cycle and must be taken into consideration in assessments of the water resources of any region. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor offers a promising opportunity for estimating daily ET with a 1 km spatial resolution, but is hampered by frequent cloud contamination or data gaps from other factors. In this study, 1) a stand-alone ET model was applied and tested during clear or partial cloudy sky conditions using MODIS-based inputs of land surface and atmospheric data and 2) meteorological simulations by using Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA) system between MODIS and the 5th Generation Meso-scale Meteorological Model (MM5) was used in cloudy conditions to facilitate continuous daily ET estimates. The MODIS ET algorithm modified from Mu et al. (2007) is based on the Penman-Monteith equation and was applied to predict ET at flux measurement sites. This algorithm considers both the effects of surface energy partitioning processes and environmental constraints on ET. We devised gap-filling approaches for MODIS aerosol and albedo data that were identified as bottlenecks to determine retrieval rates of insolation and ET. MODIS-derived input variables (i.e., meteorological variables and radiation components) for estimating ET showed a good agreement with flux tower observations at each site. The retrieval rate of MODIS ET doubled at four flux measurement sites after gap-filling with negligible compensation was undertaken for accuracy. In spite of the high accuracy of MODIS-derived input variables, MODIS ET showed meaningful errors at the four flux measurement sites. These errors were mainly associated with errors in the estimated canopy conductance. During clear sky conditions, MODIS was used to calculate ET, while the MODIS-MM5 FDDA system provided input variables for the calculation of ET under cloudy sky conditions. The performance of the MODIS-MM5 FDDA system was evaluated by comparing ET based on MODIS, which showed a good agreement with the MODIS Er for various land cover types. Our results indicate that MODIS can be applied to monitor the land surface energy budget and ET with reasonable accuracy and that MODIS-MM5 FDDA has the potential to provide reasonable input data of ET estimation under cloudy conditions.

AB We investigated spatial and temporal migration of the Solimoes, the Japura, and the Aranapu River channels in western Brazilian Amazonia with Landsat TM imagery over a 21-year period. Additionally. we classified band monitored how channel migrations affect the distribution of pioneer vegetation and old-growth forest. The cloud-free study area was 153,032 ha - open water plus 3 km inland on each margin. The channel migration rates, expressed as percent dislocation of the open water body of the river year(-1), were lowest in the Japura River (1.2%), and highest in the Aranapu channel (2.5%), the point bars at river confluence being the most affected landforms subject to geomorphic changes. Annual rates of lateral erosion and accretion of vegetated land along the three rivers were well-balanced. They averaged 0.79 and 0.83% of the cloud-free channel area over the 21 years. The Solimoes River was more dynamic than the Japura River, which can be traced to higher water discharge and sediment load. During the 21 years, the area covered by pioneer vegetation increased by 5.8% of the study area, while late-succession areas decreased by a similar amount (5.5%). According to local biomass estimates of the different vegetation types, these values suggest that C-releases by alluvial erosion would be much higher than C-sequestration caused by the creation of areas suitable for colonization by pioneer vegetation at our study site.

AB The objective of this study was to identify candidate features derived from airborne laser scanner (ALS) data suitable to discriminate between coniferous and deciduous tree species. Both features related to structure and intensity were considered. The study was conducted on 197 Norway spruce and 180 birch trees (leaves on conditions) in a boreal forest reserve in Norway. The ALS sensor used was capable of recording multiple echoes. The point density was 6.6 m(-2). Laser echoes located within the vertical projection of the tree crowns. which were assumed to be circular and defined according to field measurements, were attributed to three categories: "first echoes of many", "single echoes", or "last echoes of many echoes". They were denoted FIRST SINGLE, and LAST respectively. In tree species classification using ALS data features should be independent of tree heights. We found that many features were dependent on tree height and that this dependency influenced selection of candidate features. When we accounted for this dependency, it was revealed that FIRST and SINGLE echoes were located higher and LAST echoes lower in the birch crowns than in spruce crowns. The intensity features of the FIRST echoes differed more between species than corresponding features of the other echo categories. For the FIRST echoes the intensity values tended to be higher for birch than spruce. When using the various features for species classification, maximum overall classification accuracies of 77% and 73% were obtained for structural and intensity features, respectively. Combining candidate features related to structure and intensity resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 88%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the "Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques". This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on the fast detection of fires, biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product. A special focus will also be placed on the fire occurrence within NPAs of Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used daily MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery obtained over a five-year period to analyze the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) for the Southern Old Aspen (SOA) flux tower site located near the southern limit of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. To obtain the spectral characteristics of a standardized land area to compare with tower measurements, we scaled up the nominal 500 m MODIS products to a 2.5 km x 2.5 kin area (5 x 5 MODIS 500 m grid cells). We then used the scaled-up MODIS products in a coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model, PROSAIL-2, to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) by the part of the canopy dominated by chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)) versus that by the whole canopy (FAPAR(canopy)). Using the additional information provided by flux tower-based measurements of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident PAR, we determined 90-minute averages for APAR and LUE (slope of GEP:APAR) for both the physiologically active foliage (APAR(chl), LUEchl) and for the entire canopy (APAR(canopy), LUEcanopy).
   The flux tower measurements of GEP were strongly related to the MODIS-derived estimates of APAR(chl), (r(2)=0.78) but only weakly related to APAR(canopy) (r(2)=0.33). Gross LUE between 2001 and 2005 for LUEchl was 0.0241 mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD whereas LUEcanopy 6% lower. Time series of the 5-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to estimate the average length of the core growing season as days of year 152-259. Inter-annual variability in the core growing season LUEchl (mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD) ranged from 0.0225 in 2003 to 0.0310 in 2004. The five-year time series of LUEchl corresponded well with both the seasonal phase and amplitude of LUE from the tower measurements but this was not the case for LUEcanopy. We conclude that LUE,h, derived from MODIS observations could provide a more physiologically realistic parameter than the more commonly used LUEcanopy as an input to large-scale photosynthesis models.

AB Accurate estimations of burn severity and its distribution in post fire scenarios are critical for short-term mitigation and rehabilitation treatments. The use of remote sensing techniques, coupled with radiative transfer models (RTMs) can improve the accuracy, precision (in terms of number of classes) and cost-effectiveness of burn severity assessment. In this paper, an improved simulation model that combines PROSPECT and GeoSail to estimate burn severity from satellite data was tested in three Mediterranean forest fires. The determination of burn severity was based on a new version of the CBI index (named GeoCBI), that takes into account the vegetation fraction cover (FCOV) to compute burn severity of the total plot. Model inversion results showed accurate estimations of GeoCBI values (RMSE between 0.18 and 0.21) and a uniform performance in all three sites (107 field plots in total) throughout the full GeoCBI range (0-3).

AB The sensitivity of TerraSAR-X radar signals to surface soil parameters has been examined over agricultural fields, using HH polarization and various incidence angles (26 degrees, 28 degrees, 50 degrees, 52 degrees). The results show that the radar signal is slightly more sensitive to surface roughness at high incidence (50 degrees-52 degrees) than at low incidence (26 degrees-28 degrees). The difference observed in the X-band, between radar signals reflected by the roughest and smoothest areas, reaches a maximum of the order of 5.5 dB at 50 degrees-52 degrees, and 4 dB at 26 degrees-28 degrees. This sensitivity increases in the L-band with PALSAR/ALOS data, for which the dynamics of the return radar signal as a function of soil roughness reach 8 dB at HH38 degrees. In the C-band, ASAR/ENVISAT data (HH and VV polarizations at an incidence angle of 23 degrees) are characterised by a difference of about 4 dB between the signals backscattered by smooth and rough areas.
   Our results also show that the sensitivity of TerraSAR-X signal to surface roughness decreases in very wet and frozen soil conditions. Moreover, the difference in backscattered signal between smooth and rough fields is greater at high incidence angles. The low-to-high incidence signal ratio (Delta sigma degrees=sigma(26 degrees-28 degrees)/sigma(50 degrees-52 degrees)) decreases with surface roughness, and has a dynamic range, as a function of surface roughness, smaller than that of the backscattering coefficients at low and high incidences alone. Under very wet soil conditions (for soil moistures between 32% and 41%), the radar signal decreases by about 4 dB. This decrease appears to be independent of incidence angle, and the ratio Delta sigma degrees is found to be independent of soil moisture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat complexity plays a major role in determining the distribution and structure of fish assemblages in the aquatic environment. These locations are critical for ecosystem function and have significant implications for conservation and management. In this study, we evaluated the utility of remotely sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data for deriving substrate rugosity (a measure of habitat complexity) on a coral reef in Hawaii. We also assessed the potential application of lidar data for examining the relationship between habitat complexity and Hawaiian reef fish assemblage characteristics. Lidar-derived rugosity (4 m grid size) was found to be highly correlated with in-situ rugosity and was concluded to be a viable method for measuring rugosity in analogous coral reef environments. We established that lidar-derived rugosity was a good predictor of fish biomass and demonstrated a strong relationship with several fish assemblage metrics in hard bottom habitat at multiple spatial resolutions. This research demonstrates (i) the efficacy of lidar data to provide substrate rugosity measures at scales commensurate with the resources and their environment (ii) the applicability of lidar-derived rugosity for examining fish-habitat relationships on a coral reef in Hawaii and (iii) the potential of lidar to provide information about the seascape structure that can ultimately be used to prioritize areas for conservation and management.

AB Insects and disease affect large areas of forest in the U.S. and Canada. Understanding ecosystem impacts of such disturbances requires knowledge of host species distribution patterns on the landscape. In this study, we mapped the distribution and abundance of host species for the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) to facilitate landscape scale planning and modeling of outbreak dynamics. We used multitemporal, multi-seasonal Landsat data and 128 ground truth plots (and 120 additional validation plots) to map basal area (BA), for 6.4 million hectares of forest in northern Minnesota and neighboring Ontario. Partial least-squares (PLS) regression was used to determine relationships between ground data and Landsat sensor data. Subsequently, BA was mapped for all forests, as well as for two specific host tree genera (Picea and Abies). These PLS regression analyses yielded estimates for overall forest BA with an R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 4.67 m(2) ha(-1) (20% of measured BA), white spruce relative BA with an R-2 of 0.88 (RMSE = 12.57 m(2) ha-(1) [20% of measured]), and balsam fir relative BA with an R-2 of 0.64 (RMSE=6.08 m(2) ha-(1) [33% of measured]). We also used this method to estimate the relative BA of deciduous and coniferous species, each with R-2 values of 0.86 and RMSE values of 9.89 m(2) ha(-1) (23% of measured) and 9.78 m(2) ha-1 (16% of measured), respectively. Of note, winter imagery (with snow cover) and shortwave infrared-based indices - especially the shortwave infrared/visible ratio - strengthened the models we developed. Because ground measurements were made largely in forest stands containing spruce and fir, modeled results are not applicable to stands dominated by non-target conifers such as pines and cedar. PLS regression has proven to be an effective modeling tool for regional characterization of forest structure within spatially heterogeneous forests using multi-temporal Landsat sensor data.

AB A SWE retrieval algorithm developed in-situ using passive microwave Surface based radiometer data is applied to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation System (AMSR-E). Snow water equivalent is predicted from two pixels located in Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES) overwintering study area in Franklin Bay, N.W.T., Canada. Results show that the satellite SWE predictions are statistically valid with measured in-situ snow thickness data in both smooth and rough ice environments where predicted values range from 15 to 25 mm. Stronger correlation between measured and predicted data is found over smooth ice with R-2 value of 0.75 and 0.73 for both pixels respectively. Furthermore, a qualitative study of sea ice roughness using both passive and active microwave satellite data shows that the two pixels are rougher than the surrounding areas, but the SWE predictions do not seem to be affected significantly.

AB Mapping human settlements from remotely sensed data at regional and global scales has attracted increasingly attention but remains a challenge. The thresholding technique is a common approach for settlement mapping based on the DMSP-OLS data. However, this approach often omits the areas with small proportional settlements such as towns and villages and overestimates urban extents, resulting in information loss of spatial patterns, This paper explored an integrated approach based on a combined use Of Multiple remotely sensed data to map settlements in southeastern China. Human settlements for selected sites were mapped from Landsat ETM+ images with a hybrid approach and they were used as reference data. The DMSP-OLS and Terra MODIS NDVI data were combined to develop a settlement index image. This index image was used to map a pixel-based settlement image with expert rules. A regression model was established to estimate fractional settlements at the regional scale, which the DMSP-OLS and MODIS NDVI data were used as independent variables and the settlement data derived from ETM+ images were used as a dependent variable. This research indicated that a combination of DMSP-OLS and NDVI variables provided a better estimation performance than single DMSP-OLS or NDVI variable, and the integrated approach for settlement mapping at the regional scale was promising. Compared to the results from the traditional thresholding technique, the estimated fractional settlement image in this paper greatly improved the spatial patterns of settlement distribution and accuracy of settlement areas. This paper provided a rapid and accurate approach to estimate fractional settlements from coarse spatial resolution images at the regional scale by combining a limited number of medium Spatial resolution images. This research is especially valuable for timely updating settlement databases at regional and global scales with limited time, labor, and cost. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface velocity estimates from wind and altimeter data, together with satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, were used to explore the advection patterns and environmental conditions using a simple Lagrangian model. Although the model is generic (only considering the physical transport), the results are of particular interest for sardine (Sardina pilchardus) early life stages, due to the spawning dynamics of the species off Iberia and NW Africa. Particles were released on the shelf of the Iberian and northern African Atlantic coasts every five days from 1998 to 2004 and advected for 27-days. Trajectories were computed using combinations of three surface velocity constituents: Ekman velocity, geostrophic velocity derived from sea level anomaly maps and mean geostrophic velocity derived from two mean dynamic topographies. Daily time series of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and water depth where constructed for each particle trajectory. The results showed strong regional and seasonal dependence of the transport due to wind, with average seasonal cycles of the percentage of particles found in the shelf reflecting the anticipated effect of the seasonal north-south migration of the trade wind belt. The addition of the geostrophic transport led to the attenuation of seasonal cycles and higher mean/maximum values in the probability of retention within the shelf This increased capacity for retention even during strong upwelling conditions seems to have been overlooked by theories aiming to describe the reproductive strategies of pelagic fish and understand recruitment dynamics based primarily on wind variability. On the other hand, the average surface chlorophyll values indicated a distribution area with higher primary production for particles that never leave the shelf, in comparison to those that return to it or are found in the open sea a month after release, which is in agreement with existing hypotheses that offshore advection is detrimental to larval survival mainly due to the higher risk of starvation. Finally, the exchange between adjacent shelf areas was generally small (less than 5%) within the study period, with the exception of the Gulf of Cadiz. In the latter area, up to 50% of particles released in the southern Iberian shelf reached the Moroccan shelf in several events, contradicting previous suggestions that the Strait of Gibraltar acts as a physical barrier that promotes genetic differentiation among neighbouring sardine populations in the Atlantic. Overall, these results Provide useful insights for the study of sardine dynamics in the northeast Atlantic but the unexpectedly high sensitivity of summary metrics (namely retention probability) to the choice of surface velocity field preclude firm conclusions and indicate alternative routes for future studies.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing has great potential for accurate retrieval of forest biochemical parameters. In this paper, a hyperspectral remote sensing algorithm is developed to retrieve total leaf chlorophyll content for both open spruce and closed forests, and tested for open forest canopies. Ten black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)) stands near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, were selected as study sites, where extensive field and laboratory measurements were carried out to collect forest structural parameters, needle and forest background optical properties, and needle biophysical parameters and biochemical contents chlorophyll a and b. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery was acquired, within one week of ground measurements, by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) in a hyperspectral mode, with 72 bands and half bandwidth 4.25-4.36 nm in the visible and near-infrared region and a 2 m spatial resolution. The geometrical-optical model 4-Scale and the modified leaf optical model PROSPECT were combined to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the CASI imagery. Forest canopy reflectance was first estimated with the measured leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra, forest background reflectance, CASI acquisition parameters, and a set of stand parameters as inputs to 4-Scale. The estimated canopy reflectance agrees well with the CASI measured reflectance in the chlorophyll absorption sensitive regions, with discrepancies of 0,06%-1.07% and 0.36%-1.63%, respectively, in the average reflectances of the red and red-edge region. A look-up-table approach was developed to provide the probabilities of viewing the sunlit foliage and background, and to determine a spectral multiple scattering factor as functions of leaf area index, view zenith angle, and solar zenith angle. With the look-up tables, the 4-Scale model was inverted to estimate leaf reflectance spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. Good agreements were obtained between the inverted and measured leaf reflectance spectra across the visible and near-infrared region, with R-2 =0.89 to R-2 = 0.97 and discrepancies of 0.02%-3.63% and 0.24%-7.88% in the average red and red-edge reflectances, respectively. Leaf chlorophyll content was estimated from the retrieved leaf reflectance spectra using the modified PROSPECT inversion model, with R-2 = 0.47, RMSE =4.34 mu g/cm(2), and jackknifed RMSE of 5.69 mu g/cm(2) for needle chlorophyll content ranging from 24.9 mu g/cm(2) to 37.6 mu g/cm(2). The estimates were also assessed at leaf and canopy scales using chlorophyll spectral indices TCARI/OSAVI and MTCI. An empirical relationship of simple ratio derived from the CASI imagery to the ground-measured leaf area index was developed (R-2=0.88) to map leaf area index. Canopy chlorophyll content per unit ground surface area was then estimated, based on the spatial distributions of leaf chlorophyll content per unit leaf area and the leaf area index.

AB Binary discriminant functions are often used to identify changed area through time in remote sensing change detection studies. Traditionally, a single change-enhanced image has been used to optimize the binary discriminant function with a few (e.g., 5-10) discrete thresholds using a trial-and-error method. Im et al. [Im, J., Rhee, J., Jensen, J. R., & Hodgson, M. E. (2007). An automated binary change detection model using a calibration approach. Remote Sensing of Environment, 106, 89-105] developed an automated calibration model for optimizing the binary discriminant function by autonomously testing thousands of thresholds. However, the automated model may be time-consuming especially when multiple change-enhanced images are used as inputs together since the model is based on an exhaustive search technique. This paper describes the development of a computationally efficient search technique for identifying optimum threshold(s) in a remote sensing spectral search space. The new algorithm is based on "systematic searching." Two additional heuristic optimization algorithms (i.e., hill climbing, simulated annealing) were examined for comparison. A case study using QuickBird and IKONOS satellite imagery was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed systematic search technique reduced the processing time required to identify the optimum binary discriminate function without decreasing accuracy. The other two optimizing search algorithms also reduced the processing time but failed to detect a global maxima for some spectral features. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest disturbance and recovery are critical ecosystem processes, but the spatial pattern of disturbance has never been mapped across North America. The LEDAPS (Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System) project has assembled a wall-to-wall record of stand-clearing disturbance (clearcut harvest, fire) for the United States and Canada for the period 1990-2000 using the Landsat satellite archive. Landsat TM and ETM+ data were first converted to surface reflectance using the MODIS/6S atmospheric correction approach. Disturbance and early recovery were mapped using the temporal change in a Tasseled-Cap "Disturbance Index" calculated from the early (similar to 1990) and later (similar to 2000) images. Validation of the continental mapping has been carried out using a sample of biennial Landsat time series from 23 locations across the United States. Although a significant amount of disturbance (30-60%) cannot be mapped due to the long interval between image acquisition dates, the biennial analyses allow a first-order correction of the decadal mapping. Our results indicate disturbance rates of up to 2-3% per year are common across the US and Canada due primarily to harvest and forest fire. Rates are highest in the southeastern US, the Pacific Northwest, Maine, and Quebec. The mean disturbance rate for the conterminous United States (the "lower 48" states and District of Columbia) is calculated as 0.9 +/-0.2% per year, corresponding to a turnover period of 110 years.

AB This paper evaluates the performances of a neural network approach to estimate LAI from CYCLOPES and MODIS nadir normalized reflectance and LAI products. A data base was generated from these products over the BELMANIP sites during the 2001-2003 period. Data were aggregated at 3 km x 3 km, resampled at 1/16 days temporal frequency and filtered to reject outliers. VEGETATION and MODIS reflectances show very consistent values in the red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands. Neural networks were trained over part of this data base for each of the 6 MODIS biome classes to retrieve both MODIS and CYCLOPES LAI products.
   Results show very good performances of neural networks to estimate the original LAI products with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) around 0.5 for MODIS LAI from both MODIS and CYCLOPES normalized reflectances and a RMSE ranging between 0.12 (CYCLOPES reflectances) and 0.29 (MODIS reflectances) for CYCLOPES LAI. A drop of 15% of performance was found by training MODIS biome dependant algorithm by a single network over all the classes at the same time. More detailed analyses show that CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI values are very consistent for grasses and crops. Conversely, other biomes including shrubs, savanna, needleleaf and broadleaf forests show significant discrepancies, mainly due to differences between LAI definitions used between CYCLOPES (closer to effective LAI) and MODIS (closer to true LAI). However, products derived from the original CYCLOPES LAI products show a better agreement with both effective and true LAI ground measurements values. MODIS LAI products show more instability, partly because of the slightly shorter temporal resolution as compared to CYCLOPES.
   These results confirm the interest and versatility of neural networks for operational algorithms. This approach could be extended to other products or sensors, and may constitute a step forward for the fusion of data from several sensors, hence contributing to develop 'virtual constellations'.

AB Habitat distribution models have a long history in ecological research. With the development of geospatial information technology, including remote sensing, these models are now applied to an ever-increasing number of species, particularly those located in areas in which it is logistically difficult to collect habitat data in the field. Many habitat studies have used data acquired by multi-spectral sensor systems such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), due mostly to their availability and relatively high spatial resolution (30 m/pixel). The use of data collected by other sensor systems with lower spatial resolutions but high frequency of acquisitions has largely been neglected, due to the perception that such low spatial resolution data are too coarse for habitat mapping. In this study we compare two models using data from different satellite sensor systems for mapping the spatial distribution of giant panda habitat in Wolong Nature Reserve, China. The first one is a four-category scheme model based on combining forest cover (derived from a digital land cover classification of Landsat TM imagery acquired in June, 200 1) with information on elevation and slope (derived from a digital elevation model obtained from topographic maps of the study area). The second model is based on the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) of a time series of weekly composites of WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) images derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - 250 m/pixel) for 2001. A series of field plots was established in the reserve during the summer-autumn months of 2001-2003. The locations of the plots with panda feces were used to calibrate the ENFA model and to validate the results of both models. Results showed that the model using the seasonal variability of MODIS-WDRVI had a similar prediction success to that using Landsat TM and digital elevation model data, albeit having a coarser spatial resolution. This suggests that the phenological characterization of the land surface provides an appropriate environmental predictor for giant panda habitat mapping. Therefore, the information contained in remotely sensed data acquired with low spatial resolution but high frequency of acquisitions has considerable potential for mapping the habitat distribution of wildlife species.

AB A 34 year time series (1972-2006) of Landsat imagery for a portion of Snohomish and King Counties, Washington (the Snohomish Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA)) was analyzed to estimate the amount of land that was converted into impervious surface as a result of urban and residential development. Spectral unmixing was used to determine the fractional composition of vegetation, open, and shadow for each pixel. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were then used to derive preliminary land cover snaps for each time period. Digital orthophotos were used to create agricultural, forest management, high elevation, and riparian masks. In conjunction with established Urban Growth Areas (UGAs), these masks were utilized for the application of spatial rules that identified impervious surface as a surrogate for urban and residential development. Temporal rules, that minimized classification error, were developed based on each pixel's classified trajectory over the time series of imagery. Overall cross-date classification accuracy for impervious v. non-impervious surface was 95%. The results of the analysis indicate that the area of impervious surface in the Snohomish WRIA increased by 255% over 34 years, from 3285 ha in 1972 to 11,652 ha in 2006. This approach demonstrates the unique value of the 35 year Landsat archive for monitoring impervious surface trends in rapidly urbanizing areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A simple method to identify turbid, sediment-loaded, waters within satellite ocean color imageries was recently proposed (A. Morel and S. Belanger, Remote Sensing of Environment, 102, (2006), 237-249). Systematic application of this method to the level-3 composites obtained from three ocean color sensors shows that the "turbid" flag is often raised in the open ocean, especially in the sub-tropical oligotrophic gyres, where turbidity is unlikely. In addition these flagged zones migrate with season, and clearly follow the sun declination course. The combination of low chlorophyll waters with a residual sun-glint is at the origin of this artifact. Simple approaches for eliminating such a misleading detection are proposed. The identification and elimination of the bias are also needed in particular for an unambiguous detection of the presence of calcite (coccolithophores) in open waters.

AB Comparisons to ground-based surface soil moisture estimates are necessary to evaluate the capability of remote sensors to determine Soil moisture and its spatiotemporal variability. Soil moisture can be especially variable in regions of complex terrain which exhibit large variations in vegetation, soil properties and hydrologic conditions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in a mountainous basin in northwestern Mexico. Soil moisture estimates from ground sampling over a topographic transect and high resolution retrievals from the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer are compared during a two week period in August 2004 as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004. Results indicate that the soil moisture estimates exhibit similar variability with mean water content. Statistical analysis, however, reveals clear differences in soil moisture in the basin, in particular for wet periods and high elevations. Despite these differences, the temporal persistence of soil moisture from the estimates agrees well and indicates locations that capture the basin-averaged conditions. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal soil moisture characteristics from the two products are linked to terrain attributes. As a result, a hypsometric technique is shown to improve comparisons between basin-averaged values derived from ground data and remote sensing, as compared to arithmetic averaging. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to evaluate PSR/CX retrievals with respect to ground observations over a region of high topographic and vegetation variability using statistical, time-stability and terrain analysis techniques.

AB Water and energy fluxes at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere are strongly depending on the surface soil moisture content which is highly variable in space and time. The sensitivity of active and passive microwave remote sensing data to surface soil moisture content has been investigated in numerous studies. Recent satellite home mission concepts, as e.g. the SMOS mission, are dedicated to provide global soil moisture information with a temporal frequency of 1-3 days to capture it's high temporal dynamics. Passive satellite microwave sensors have spatial resolutions in the order of tens of kilometres. The retrieved soil moisture fields from that sensors therefore represent surface information which is integrated over large areas. It has been shown that the heterogeneity within an image pixel might have considerable impact on the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave data.
   The paper investigates the impact of land surface heterogeneity on soil moisture retrievals from L-band passive microwave data at different spatial scales between 1 km and 40 km. The impact of sensor noise and quality of ancillary information is explicitly considered. A synthetic study is conducted where brightness temperature observations are generated using simulated land surface conditions. Soil moisture information is retrieved from these simulated observations using an iterative approach based on multiangular observations of brightness temperature. The soil moisture retrieval uncertainties resulting from the heterogeneity within the image pixels as well as the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge of surface temperature data and due to sensor noise, is investigated at different spatial scales. The investigations are made for a heterogeneous hydrological catchment in Southern Germany (Upper Danube) which is dedicated to serve as a calibration and validation site for the SMOS mission.

   ANALYSIS
AB A detailed sensitivity analysis investigating the effect of woody elements introduced into the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model on the nadir bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for a simulated Norway spruce canopy was performed at a very high spatial resolution (modelling resolution 0.2 m, output pixel size 0.4 m). We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i.e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different canopy Closures (CC=50-95%, in steps of 5%), 25 leaf area index (LAI=3.0-15.0 m(2) m(-2), in steps of 0.5 m(2) m(-2)), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured Airborne Imaging Spectroradiorrieter (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0.4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model.
   The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i.e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4% in the near-infrared (NIR), 2% in the red edge (RE) and less than 1% in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2%. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution.

AB This study focuses on the determination of the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover) based on the inversion of a four-parameter model combining the reflectances in the Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR) domains. This model is semi-empirical since it is based on radiative transfer modeling, but requires parameter calibration related to SAIL simulations (Verhoef). As shown by Yoshioka et al., if the multiple soil/vegetation interactions are smaller than the first order ones then the fCover isolines can be approximated by straight lines in the (Red, Near Infrared) plane. Each isoline is completely defined by its slope alpha and its intersection point gamma (with the soil line), that have been related to fCover using SAIL simulations and optimization either by the Simplex (local optimization) or the SCE-UA (global optimization) algorithms. The results are compared to classical vegetation indices for both simulated and actual data. The method shows an improvement in most of cases. Moreover, when using the SCE-UA algorithm, our approach proves its robustness relative to high noise level. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two physical phenomena by which satellite remotely sensed ocean color data are contaminated by sea ice at high latitudes are described through simulations and observations: (1) the adjacency effect that occurs along sea ice margins and (2) the sub-pixel contamination by a small amount of sea ice within an ocean pixel. The signal at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) was simulated using the 6S radiative transfer code that allows modeling of the adjacency effect for various types of sea ice surrounding an open water area. In situ sea ice reflectance spectra used in the simulations were measured prior to and during the melt period as part of the 2004 Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES). For sub-pixel contamination, the TOA signal was simulated for various surface reflectances obtained by linear mixture of both sea ice and water-leaving reflectances (rho(w)). The standard atmospheric correction algorithm was then applied to the simulated TOA spectra to retrieve rho(w) spectra from which chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL) and inherent optical properties (IOps) were derived. The adjacency effect was associated with large errors (> 0.002) in the retrieval of rho(w) as far as 24 km from an ice edge in the blue part of the spectrum (443 nm). Therefore, for moderate to high CHL (> 0.5 mg m(-3)), any pixel located within a distance of similar to 10-20 km from the ice edge were unreliable. It was also found necessary to consider the adjacency effect when the total absorption coefficient (a(t)) was to be retrieved using a semi-analytical algorithm. a(t)(443) was underestimated by more than 35% at a distance of 20 km from an ice edge for CHL > 0.5 mg m(-3). The effect on the retrieval of the particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) was important only for clear waters (CHL similar to 0.05 mg m(-3)). In contrast, sub-pixel contamination by a small amount of sea ice produced systematic underestimation of rho(w) in the blue because of incorrect interpretation of enhanced reflectance in the near infrared that is attributed to higher concentrations of atmospheric aerosols. In general, sub-pixel contamination was found to result in overestimations of CHL and at, and underestimations of bbp. A simple method was proposed to flag pixels contaminated by adjacency effect.

AB Obtaining detailed information about the amount of forest cover is an important issue for governmental policy and forest management. This paper presents a new approach to update the Flemish Forest Map using IKONOS imagery. The proposed method is a three-step object-oriented classification routine that involves the integration of 1) image segmentation, 2) feature selection by Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and 3) joint Neural Network (NN) based object-classification. The added value of feature selection and neural network combination is investigated. Results show that, with GA-feature selection, the mean classification accuracy (in terms of Kappa Index of Agreement) is significantly higher (p<0.01) than without feature selection. On average, the summed output of 50 networks provided a significantly higher (p<0.01) classification accuracy than the mean output of 50 individual networks. Finally, the proposed classification routine yields a significantly higher (p<0.01) classification accuracy as compared with a strategy without feature selection and joint network output. In addition, the proposed method showed its potential when few training data were available. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospheric correction for the ocean color products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) uses two near-infrared (NIR) bands centered at 748 and 869 nm for identifying aerosol type and correcting aerosol contributions at the MODIS visible wavelengths. The ocean is usually assumed to be black for open oceans at these two NIR bands with modifications for the productive waters and aerosols are assumed to be non- or weakly absorbing. For cases with strongly absorbing aerosols and cases with the significant NIR ocean contributions, the derived ocean color products will have significant errors, e.g., the derived MODIS normalized water-leaving radiances are biased low considerably. Both cases lead to a significant drop of the sensor-measured radiance at the short visible wavelengths, and they both have similar and indistinguishable radiance characteristics at the short visible wavelengths. To properly handle such cases, the strongly absorbing aerosols and turbid waters need to be identified. Therefore, an appropriate approach (different from the standard procedure) may be carried out. In this paper, we demonstrate methods to identify the turbid waters and strongly absorbing aerosols using combinations of MODIS-measured radiances at the short visible, NIR, and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. The algorithms are based on the fact that for the turbid waters the ocean has significantly large contributions at the NIR bands, whereas at the SWIR bands the ocean is still black due to much stronger water absorption. With detection of the turbid waters, the strongly absorbing aerosols can then be identified using the MODIS measurements at the short visible and NIR bands. We provide results and discussions for test and evaluation of the algorithm performance with various examples in the coastal regions for the turbid waters and for various absorbing aerosols (e.g., volcano ash plumes, dust, smoke). The proposed algorithms are efficient in the data processing, and can be carried out prior to the atmospheric correction procedure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Various studies have been presented within the last 10 years on the possibilities for predicting forest variables such as stand volume and mean height by means of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. These have usually considered tree stock as a whole, even though it is tree species-specific forest information that is of primary interest in Finland, for example. We will therefore concentrate here on prediction of the species-specific forest variables volume, stem number, basal area, basal area median diameter and tree height, applying the non-parametric k-MSN method to a combination of ALS data and aerial photographs in order to predict these stand attributes simultaneously for Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees as well as total characteristics as sums of the species-specific estimates. The predictor variables derived from the ALS data were based on the height distribution of vegetation hits, whereas spectral values and texture features were employed in the case of the aerial photographs. The data covered 463 sample plots in 67 stands in eastern Finland, and the results showed that this approach can be used to predict species-specific forest variables at least as accurately as from the current stand-level field inventory for Finland. The characteristics of Scots pine and Norway spruce were predicted more accurately than those of deciduous trees. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although they correspond to an important fraction of the total area of mountain glaciers (33,000 km(2) out of 546,000 km(2)), Himalayan glaciers and their mass balance are poorly sampled. For example, between 1977 and 1999, the average area surveyed each year on the field was 6.8 km(2) only. No direct mass balance measurement is available after 1999. To contribute to fill this gap, we use remote sensing data to monitor glacier elevation changes and mass balances in the Spiti/Lahaul region (32.2 degrees N, 77.6 degrees E, Himachal Pradesh, Western Himalaya, India). Our measurements are obtained by comparing a 2004 digital elevation model (DEM) to the 2000 SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) topography.
   The 2004 DEM is derived from two SPOT5 satellite optical images without any ground control points. This is achieved thanks to the good onboard geolocation of SPOT5 scenes and using SRTM elevations as a reference on the ice free zones. Before comparison on glaciers, the two DEMs are analyzed on the stable areas surrounding the glaciers where no elevation change is expected. Two different biases are detected. A long wavelength bias affects the SPOT5 DEM and is correlated to an anomaly in the roll of the SPOT5 satellite. A bias is also observed as a function of altitude and is attributed to the SRTM dataset. Both biases are modeled and removed to permit unbiased comparison of the two DEM on the 915 km(2) ice-covered area digitized from an ASTER image.
   On most glaciers, a clear thinning is measured at low elevations, even on debris-covered tongues. Between 1999 and 2004, we obtain an overall specific mass balance of -0.7 to -0.85 m/a (water equivalent) depending on the density we use for the lost (or gained) material in the accumulation zone. This rate of ice loss is twice higher than the long-term (1977 to 1999) mass balance record for Himalaya indicating an increase in the pace of glacier wastage. To assess whether these ice losses are size-dependant, all glaciers were classified into three samples according to 2 their areal extent. All three samples show ice loss, the loss being higher for glaciers larger than 30 kin. In the case of the benchmark Chhota Shigri glacier, a good agreement is found between our satellite observations and the mass balances measured on the field during hydrological years 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Future studies using a similar methodology could determine whether similar ice losses have occurred in other parts of the Himalaya and may allow evaluation of the contribution of this mountain range to ongoing sea level rise.

AB Future Satellite Imagers are expected to improve current ones on environmental and meteorological applications. In this study, an automatic classification scheme using radiance measurements with a clustering method is applied in an attempt to compare the capability on cloud classification by different sensors: AVHRR/3, the current GOES-12 Imager, SEVIRI, VIIRS, and ABI. The MODIS cloud mask is used as the initial classification. The results are analyzed with the help of true color and RGB composite images as well as other information about surface and cloud types. Results indicate that the future sensors (ABI and VIIRS) provide much better overall cloud classification capabilities than their corresponding current sensors (the current GOES-12 Imager and AVHRR/3) from the two chosen demonstration cases. However, for a specific class, it is not always true that more spectral bands result in better classification. In order to optimally use the spectral information, it is necessary to determine which bands are more sensitive for a specific class.

AB The capability of the non-linear Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model to 1) accurately fit a large variety of Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) fields and 2) return parameter values of interest for land surface applications motivate the development of a computer efficient inversion package. The present paperdescribes such a package based on the 3 and 4 parameter versions of the RPV model. This software environment implements the adjoint code, generated using automatic differentiation techniques, of the cost function. This cost function itself balances two main contributions reflecting 1) the a priori knowledge on the model parameter values and, 2) BRF uncertainties together with the requirement to minimize the mismatch between the measurements and the RPV simulations. The individual weights of these contributions is specified notably via covariance matrices of the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge on the model parameters and the observations. This package also reports on the probability density functions of the retrieved model parameter values that thus permit the user to evaluate the a posteriori uncertainties on these retrievals. This is achieved by evaluating the Hessian of the cost function at its minimum. Results from a variety of tests are shown in order to document and analyze software performance against complex synthetic BRF fields simulated by radiation transfer models as well as against actual MISR-derived surface BRF products.

AB Accurate estimates of vegetation biophysical variables are valuable as input to models describing the exchange of carbon dioxide and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere and important for a wide range of applications related to vegetation monitoring, weather prediction, and climate change. The present study explores the benefits of combining vegetation index and physically based approaches for the spatial and temporal mapping of green leaf area index (LAI), total chlorophyll content (TCab), and total vegetation water content (VWC). A numerical optimization method was employed for the inversion of a canopy reflectance model using Terra and Aqua MODIS multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and multi-angle reflectance observations to aid the determination of vegetation-specific physiological and structural canopy parameters. Land cover and site-specific inversion modeling was applied to a restricted number of pixels to build multiple species- and environmentally dependent formulations relating the three biophysical properties of interest to a number of selected simpler spectral vegetation indices (VI). While inversions generally are computationally slow, the coupling with the simple and computationally efficient VI approach makes the combined retrieval scheme for LAI, TCab, and VWC suitable for large-scale mapping operations. In order to facilitate application of the canopy reflectance model to heterogeneous forested areas, a simple correction scheme was elaborated, which was found to improve forest LAI predictions significantly and also provided more realistic values of leaf chlorophyll contents.
   The inversion scheme was designed to enable biophysical parameter retrievals for land cover classes characterized by contrasting canopy architectures, leaf inclination angles, and leaf biochemical constituents without utilizing calibration measurements. Preliminary LAI validation results for the Island of Zealand, Denmark (57 degrees N, 12 degrees E) provided confidence in the approach with root mean square (RMS) deviations between estimates and in-situ measurements of 0.62, 0.46, and 0.63 for barley, wheat, and deciduous forest sites, respectively. Despite the independence on site-specific in-situ measurements, the RMS deviations of the automated approach are in the same range as those established in other studies employing field-based empirical calibration.
   Being completely automated and image-based and independent on extensive and impractical surface measurements, the retrieval scheme has potential for operational use and can quite easily be implemented for other regions. More validation studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness and limitations of the approach for other environments and species compositions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An environmental consequence of urbanization is the urban heat island effect, a situation where urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas. The urban heat island phenomenon results from the replacement of natural landscapes with impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt and is linked to adverse economic and environmental impacts. In order to better understand the urban microclimate, a greater assessment of the overall urban thermal pattern, including an analysis of the thermal properties of individual land covers, is needed. This study examines the surface thermal pattern by means of thermal land cover response for the Salt Lake City, Utah, study area at two scales: 1) the community level, and 2) the regional or valleywide level. Airborne ATLAS (Advanced Thermal and Land Applications Sensor) data, a high spatial resolution (10-meter) dataset appropriate for an environment containing a concentration of diverse land covers, are used for both land cover and thermal analysis at the community level. The ATLAS data consist of 15 channels covering the visible, near-IR, mid-IR and thermal-IR wavelengths. At the regional level Landsat TM data are used for land cover analysis while the ATLAS channel 13 data are used for the thermal analysis.
   Results show that a ground-level heat island is evident at both the community and the valleywide level where there is an abundance of impervious surfaces. ATLAS data perform well in community level studies in terms of land cover and thermal exchanges, but other, more coarse-resolution data sets are more appropriate for large-area thermal studies. Thermal response per land cover is consistent at both levels, which suggests potential for comparison with more coarse spatial resolution studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urban environmental conditions are strongly dependent on the biophysical properties and radiant thermal field of the land cover elements in the urban mosaic. Observations of urban reflectance and surface temperature provide valuable constraints on the physical properties that are determinants of mass and energy fluxes in the urban environment. Consistencies in the covariation of surface temperature with reflectance properties can be parameterized to represent characteristics of the surface energy flux associated with different land covers and physical conditions. Linear mixture models can accurately represent Landsat ETM+ reflectances as fractions of generic spectral endmembers that correspond to land surface materials with distinct physical properties. Modeling heterogeneous land cover as mixtures of rock and/or soil Substrate, Vegetation and non-reflective Dark surface (SVD) generic endmembers makes it possible to quantify the dependence of aggregate surface temperature on the relative abundance of each physical component of the land cover, thereby distinguishing the effects of vegetation abundance, soil exposure, albedo and shadowing. Comparing these covariations in a wide variety of urban settings and physical environments provides a more robust indication of the global variability in these parameter spaces than could be inferred from a single study area. A comparative analysis of 24 urban areas and their non-urban peripheries illustrates the variability in the urban thermal fields and its dependence on biophysical land surface components. Contrary to expectation, moderate resolution intra-urban variations in surface temperature are generally as large as regional surface heat island signatures in these urban areas. Many of the non-temperate urban areas did Dot have surface heat island signatures at all. However, the multivariate distributions of surface temperature and generic endmember fractions reveal consistent patterns of thermal fraction covariation resulting from land cover characteristics. The Thermal-Vegetation (TV) fraction space illustrates the considerable variability in the well-known inverse correlation between surface temperature and vegetation fraction at moderate (< 100 m) spatial resolutions. The Thermal-Substrate (TS) fraction space reveals energetic thresholds where competing effects of albedo, illumination and soil moisture determine the covariation of maximum and minimum temperature with illuminated substrate fraction. The dark surface endmember fraction represents a fundamental ambiguity in the radiance signal because it can correspond to either absorptive (e.g. low albedo asphalt), transmissive (e.g. deep clear water) or shadowed (e.g. tree canopy shadow) surfaces. However, in areas where dark surface composition can be inferred from spatial context, the different responses of these surfaces may still allow them to be distinguished in the thermal fraction space.

AB Monitoring and management of forest fires is very important in countries like India where 55% of the total forest cover is prone to fires annually. The present study aims at effective monitoring of forest fires over the Indian region using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime satellite data and to evaluate the active fire detection capabilities of the sensor. Nightly DMSP-OLS fire products were generated from February to May 2005 (peak fire season) and analyzed to study the occurrence and behavior of fires over different forest physiognomies in Indian region. Fire products generated from DMSP-OLS were validated with ground observations of fire records from state forest departments to evaluate the accuracy of fire products. Further, inter-comparison of the DMSP-OLS derived fire products with contemporary fire products from Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (both daytime and nighttime products) in addition to fires and burnt areas derived from Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data has been done to analyze spatial agreement of fire locations given by the above sensors.
   Results from the DMSP-OLS fire products (derived from February to May 2005) over Indian region showed high forest fires in southern dry deciduous forests during February-March; central Indian dry and mixed deciduous forests during March-April; northeastern tropical forests during February-April and northern pine forests during May. Spatial pattern in fires showed a typical seasonal shift in fire activity from the southern dry deciduous forests to the northern pine forests and temperate forests as the fire season progressed. Statistical evaluation of DMSP-OLS fire products with ground observations showed an over all accuracy of 98%. Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with consecutive MODIS and AWiFS derived fires for individual days indicated that 69% of the fires continued from current day (DMSP-OLS pass around similar to 7pm to similar to 10pm local time) to the next day (MODIS and AWiFS pass similar to 10:30am local time). Comparison of DMSP-OLS derived fires with burnt areas estimated from AWiFS showed that 98% of DMSP-OLS derived fires on the current day fell within the burnt area of AWiFS on subsequent day. Since the worst forest fires are those that extend from the current to the consecutive days, DMSP-OLS derived fires provide a valuable augmentation to the fires derived from other sensors operating in daytime.

AB The tundra-taiga transition zone stretches around the northern hemisphere separating boreal forest to the south from treeless tundra to the north. Tree cover and height are important variables to characterize this vegetation transition. Accurate continuous fields of tree cover and height would enable the delineation of the forest extent according to different criterion and provide useful data for change detection of this climatically sensitive ecotone. This study examined if multiangular remote sensing data has potential to improve the accuracy of the tree cover and height estimates in relation to nadir-view data. The satellite data consisted of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 275 m and 1.1 km resolutions. The study area was located in the Fennoscandian tundra-taiga transition zone, in northernmost Finland. The continuous fields of tree cover and height were estimated using neural networks, which were trained and assessed by high-resolution biotope inventory data. The spectral-angular data together produced lower estimation errors than single band nadir, multispectral nadir or single band multiangular data alone. RMSE of the tree cover estimates reduced from 7.8% (relative RMSE 67.4%) to 6.5% (56.1%) at 275 m resolution, and from 5.4% (49.2%) to 4.1% (36.9%) at 1.1 km resolution, when multispectral nadir data were used together with multiangular data. RMSE of the tree height estimates reduced from 2.3 m (44.3%) to 2.0 m (37.6%) and from 1.8 m (35.4%) to 1.3 m (25.4%), respectively. The largest estimation errors occurred in mires and in areas of dense shrub cover, but the use of multiangular data also reduced estimation errors in these areas. The results suggest that directional information has potential to improve the tree cover and height estimates, and hence the accuracy of the land cover change detection in the tundra-taiga transition zone.

AB On-board detection of cryospheric change in sea ice, lake ice, and snow cover is being conducted as part of the Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE), using classifiers developed for the Hyperion hyper-spectral visible/infrared spectrometer on-board the Earth Observing-1 (EO-I) spacecraft. This classifier development was done with consideration for the novel limitations of on-board processing, data calibration, spacecraft targeting error and the spectral range of the instrument. During on-board tests, these algorithms were used to measure the extent of cloud, snow, and ice cover at a global suite of targets. Coupled with baseline imaging, uploaded thresholds were used to detect cryospheric changes such as the freeze and thaw of lake ice and the formation and break-up of sea ice. These thresholds were used to autonomously trigger follow-up observations, demonstrating the capability of the technique for future planetary missions where downlink is a constrained resource and there is high interest in data covering dynamic events, including cryospheric change. Before upload classifier performance was assessed with an overall accuracy of 83.3% as measured against manual labeling of 134 scenes. Performance was further assessed against field mapping conducted at Lake Mendota, Wisconsin as well as with labeling of scenes that were classified during on-board tests. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sudden Oak Death is a new and virulent disease affecting hardwood forests in coastal California. The spatial-temporal dynamics of oak mortality at the landscape scale are crucial indicators of disease progression. Modeling disease spread requires accurate mapping of the dynamic pattern of oak mortality in time through multi-temporal image analysis. Traditional mapping approaches using per-pixel, single-date image classifications have not generated consistently satisfactory results. Incorporation of spatial-temporal contextual information can improve these results. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporally explicit algorithm to classify individual images using the spectral and spatial-temporal information derived from multiple co-registered images. This algorithm is initialized by a spectral classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for each individual image, Then, a Markov Random Fields (MRF) model accounting for ecological compatibility is used to model the spatial-temporal contextual prior probabilities of images. Finally, an iterative algorithm, Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM), is used to update the classification based on the combination of the initial SVM spectral classifications and MRF spatial-temporal contextual model. The algorithm was applied to two-year (2000, 2001) ADAR (Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration) images, from which three classes (bare, dead, forest) are detected. The results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved significantly better results (Year 2000: Kappa=0.92; Year 2001: Kappa=0.91), compared to traditional pixel-based single-date approaches (Year 2000: Kappa=0.67; Year 2001: Kappa=0.66). The improvement from the contributions of spatial-temporal contextual information indicated the importance of spatial-temporal modeling in multi-temporal remote sensing in general and forest disease modeling in particular.

AB Quantifying the carbon storage, distribution, and change of urban trees is vital to understanding the role of vegetation in the urban environment. At present, this is mostly achieved through ground study. This paper presents a method based on the satellite image time series, which can save time and money and greatly speed the process of urban forest carbon storage mapping, and possibly of regional forest mapping. Satellite imagery collected in different decades was used to develop a regression equation to predict the urban forest carbon storage from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed from a time sequence (1985-1999) of Landsat image data. This regression was developed from the 1999 field-based model estimates of carbon storage in Syracuse, NY. The total carbon storage estimates based on the NDVI data agree closely with the field-based model estimates. Changes in total carbon storage by trees in Syracuse were estimated using the image data from 1985, 1992, and 1999. Radiometric correction was accomplished by normalizing the imagery to the 1999 image data. After the radiometric image correction, the carbon storage by urban trees in Syracuse was estimated to be 146,800 tons, 149,430 tons, and 148,660 tons of carbon for 1985, 1992, and 1999, respectively. The results demonstrate the rapid and cost-effective capability of remote sensing-based quantitative change detection in monitoring the carbon storage change and the impact of urban forest management over wide areas.

AB Characteristics of the land surface including soil moisture, vegetation cover, and soil roughness among others influence the microwave emissivity and brightness temperature of the surface as observed from space. Knowledge of the variability of microwave signatures of vegetation and soil roughness is necessary to separate these influences from those of soil moisture for remote sensing applications to global hydrology and climate. We describe here a characterization of vegetation and soil roughness at the frequencies and spatial resolution of the EOS Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). A single parameter has been used to approximate the combined effects of vegetation and roughness. AMSR-E data have been analyzed to determine the frequency dependence of this parameter and to generate a global vegetation/roughness map and an estimate of seasonal variability. A physical model is used for the analysis with approximations appropriate to the AMSR-E footprint scale and coefficients calibrated empirically against the AMSR-E data. The spatial variabilities of roughness and vegetation cannot be estimated independently using this approach, but their temporal dynamics allow separation of predominantly static roughness effects from time-varying vegetation effects using multitemporal analysis. Global signals of time-varying vegetation water content derived from this analysis of AMSR-E data are consistent with time-varying biomass estimates obtained by optical/infrared remote sensing techniques.

AB We present an automatic classification method based on topological neural network algorithms to retrieve aerosol optical properties from multi-spectral ocean-color satellite imagery. The first step of the method consisted in an unsupervised classification of a large set of clear-sky top of the atmosphere reflectance spectra measured by the sensor. We used the so-called Kohonen map which aggregates similar spectra into a reduced set of pertinent groups. The second step consisted in labeling these groups by clustering them with synthetic TOA reflectance spectra whose optical properties (i.e., aerosol type or optical thickness) are known. These synthetic spectra have been computed using a radiative transfer model. In the present study, we dealt with five aerosol types (maritime, coastal, tropospheric, oceanic and mineral) and several aerosol optical thickness values ranging from 0.05 to 0.8. These simulated spectra were then projected onto the Kohonen map to label each group of the map. The last step consisted in applying this method to the SeaWiFS imagery of the Mediterranean region for the years 1999 and 2000. The Kohonen map was "educated" from pixels randomly extracted during the year 1999 in this region. We accounted for the viewing geometry of the sensor by clustering the simulated spectra into ten groups of similar geometries, as defined by both scattering and sun zenith angles. The analysis of SeaWiFS images was performed pixel-by-pixel by selecting the suitable labeling (in terms of viewing geometry), then by identifying the closest spectrum in the Kohonen map, which finally gives the aerosol optical properties. This method led to accurate and coherent results, as shown by the comparison with in situ aerosol measurements provided by the AERONET station at Lampedusa and by the study of two aerosol events over the Mediterranean. One of the major advantages of this method is that it enables us to automatically identify the aerosol type and to retrieve the aerosol optical properties with a better accuracy than classical methods such as those used by SeaWifs. It gives accurate results for optical thickness values larger than 0.35 and is able to retrieve dust aerosols such as African dust aerosol (absorbing aerosol). These should ensure a more precise inversion of ocean-color imagery where the knowledge of atmospheric optical parameters is essential. Moreover the method is able to give probabilities for the estimate values of aerosol properties. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Young moraines less than 100 years old are considered as key areas for monitoring the effects of climate change since the end of the Little Ice Age. One way of documenting this change is by recognizing and characterizing the different plant colonization stages and trends that occur on these relatively new environments. Previous studies have shown that remotely sensed data alone are not sufficient to map the vegetation over these types of landscapes because the most significant part of the radiometric information is related to mineral landscape components. Therefore, the authors used an indirect approach which consisted in the following steps.
   1. An optimized sampling procedure was used to collect georeferenced vegetation plot data. A multivariate analysis was then used to define vegetation types that could be related to different colonization stages and environmental contexts.
   2. Color infrared aerial photographs were then used to produce a baseline vegetation map. This map was then integrated into a data base along with other environment factors known to control,plant colonization processes, such as climate (wind, temperature), physical landscape components (habitat characteristics) and morphodynamic processes (runoff).
   3. A Bayesian model using conditional probabilities was used to identify the primary environmental habitats corresponding to the different vegetation types.
   This protocol was tested on the fore field of the Midre Lovenbreen (Svalbard) glacier where several vegetation belts correspond to well defined stages of deglaciation and corresponding local conditions such as microtopography, microclimate and runoff dynamics.

AB In this paper, we present a theoretical and modeling framework to estimate the fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegetation canopy (FAPAR(canopy)), leaf (FAPAR(leaf)), and chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)), respectively. FAPAR(canopy) is an important biophysical variable and has been used to estimate gross and net primary production. However, only PAR absorbed by chlorophyll is used for photosynthesis, and therefore there is a need to quantify FAPAR(chl). We modified and coupled a leaf radiative transfer model (PROSPECT) and a canopy radiative transfer model (SAIL-2), and incorporated a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (the Metropolis algorithm) for model inversion, which provides probability distributions of the retrieved variables. Our two-step procedure is: (1) to retrieve biophysical and biochemical variables using coupled PROSPECT+SAIL-2 model (PROSAIL-2), combined with multiple daily images (five spectral bands) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor; and (2) to calculate FAPAR(canopy), FAPAR(leaf) and FAPAR(chl) with the estimated model variables frorn the first step. We evaluated our approach for a temperate forest area in the Northeastern US, using MODIS data from 2001 to 2003. The inverted PROSAIL-2 fit the observed MODIS reflectance data well for the five MODIS spectral bands. The estimated leaf area index (LAI) values are within the range of field measured data. Significant differences between FAPAR(canopy) and FAPAR(chl) are found for this test case. Our study demonstrates the potential for using a model such as PROSAIL-2, combined with an inverse approach, for quantifying FAPAR(chl), FAPAR(leaf), FAPAR(canopy), biophysical variables, and biochemical variables for deciduous broadleaf forests at leaf- and canopy-levels over time.

AB Spectral measurements made in the Mordor Pound, NT, Australia study area using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), in the laboratory and in situ show dominantly Al-OH and ferric-iron VNIR-SWIR absorption features in felsic rock spectra and ferrous-iron and Fe,Mg-OH features in the mafic-ultramafic rock spectra. ASTER ratio images, matched-filter, and spectral-angle mapper processing (SAM) were evaluated for mapping the lithologies. Matched-filter processing in which VNIR+SNVIR image spectra were used for reference resulted in 4 felsic classes and 4 mafic-ultramafic classes based on Al-OH or Fc.Mg-OH absorption features and, in some, subtle reflectance differences related to differential weathering and vegetation. These results were similar to those obtained by match-filter analysis of HyMap data from a previous study, but the units were more clearly demarcated in the HyMap image.
   ASTER TIR spectral emittance data and laboratory emissivity measurements document a wide wavelength range of Si-O spectral features, which reflect the lithological diversity of the Mordor ultramafic complex and adjacent rocks. SAM processing of the spectral emittance data distinguished 2 classes representing the mafic-ultramafic rocks and 4 classes comprising the quartzose to intermediate composition rocks. Utilization of the complementary attributes of the spectral reflectance and spectral emittance data resulted in discrimination of 4 mafic-ultramafic categories; 3 categories of alluvial-colluvial deposits; and a significantly more completely mapped quartzite unit than could be accomplished by using either data set alone.

AB Shadows are being used more frequently to estimate plant canopy biophysical characteristics. Typically, a zero value is assumed or a threshold value is derived from histogram analysis of imagery to determine the shadow endmember (EM). Here, two distinct shadow EMs were measured in situ for use in spectral mixture analysis of a cotton canopy on five dates in 2003. The four EMs used in the analysis were: sunlit green leaf, sunlit dry soil, self-shadowed leaf, shadowed dry soil. This 4-EM model was compared to a 3-EM model where a zero-value shade EM was used for unmixing with the two sunlit EMs. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to allow EM composition to vary across each scene. The analysis and EMs were applied to fine-scale hyperspectral image data collected in the wavelength range, 440 to 8 10 nm. Ground data collected included percent cover, height, SPAD (a measure of leaf greenness), and chlorophyll a concentration. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was also compared to the unmixing results. Regression analysis showed that NDVI was equal to the 4-EM model for estimation of percent cover (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 6.6) although the NDVI y-intercept was closer to zero. The 4-EM model was best for estimating height (r(2) = 0.79, PMSE=0.07 in) and chlorophyll a concentration (r(2) = 0.46, RMSE=7.0 mu g/cm(2)). The 3-EM model and NDVI per-formed poorly when estimating chlorophyll a concentration. Inclusion of two distinct shadow EMs in the model improved relationships to crop biophysical parameters and was better than assuming one, zero-value shade EM. Since MESMA operates at the pixel level and allows variable EM assignment to each pixel, mapping the spatial variability of shadows and other variables of interest is possible, providing a powerful input to canopy and ecosystem models as well as precision fanning.

AB An experimental site was set up in a large, flat and homogeneous area of rice crops for the validation of satellite derived land surface temperature (LST). Experimental campaigns were held in the summers of 2002-2004, when rice crops show full vegetation cover. LSTs were measured radiometrically along transects covering an area of 1 km(2). A total number of four thermal radiometers were used, which were calibrated and inter-compared through the campaigns. Radiometric temperatures were corrected for emissivity effects using field emissivity and downwelling sky radiance measurements. A database of ground-based LSTs corresponding to morning, cloud-free overpasses of Envisat/ Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is presented. Ground LSTs ranged from 25 to 32 degrees C, with uncertainties between +/-0.5 and +/-0.9 degrees C. The largest part of these uncertainties was due to the spatial variability of surface temperature. The database was used for the validation of LSTs derived from the operational AATSR and MODIS split-window algorithms, which are currently used to generate the LST product in the L2 level data. A quadratic, emissivity dependent split-window equation applicable to both AATSR and MODIS data was checked as well. Although the number of cases analyzed is limited (five concurrences for AATSR and eleven for MODIS), it can be concluded that the split-window algorithms work well, provided that the characteristics of the area are adequately prescribed, either through the classification of the land cover type and the vegetation cover, or with the surface emissivity. In this case, the AATSR LSTs yielded an average error or bias of - 0.9 degrees C (ground minus algorithm), with a standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C. The MODIS LST product agreed well with the ground LSTs, with differences comparable or smaller than the uncertainties of the ground measurements for most of the days (bias of +0.1 degrees C and standard deviation of 0.6 degrees C, for cloud-free cases and viewing angles smaller than 60 degrees). The quadratic split-window algorithm resulted in small average errors (+'0.3 degrees C for AATSR and 0.0 degrees C for MODIS), with differences not exceeding +/-1.0 degrees C for most of the days (standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C for AATSR and 0.5 degrees C for MODIS).

AB Space-time anomalies of Earth's emitted radiation in the thermal infrared spectral range (TIR) measured from satellite months to weeks before the occurrence of earthquakes, have been interpreted, by several authors, as pre-seismic signals. The claimed connection of TIR emission with seismic activity has been considered, up to now, with some caution by the scientific community mainly for the insufficiency of the validation data-sets and the scarce importance attached by those authors to other causes (e.g. meteorological) that, rather than seismic activity, could be responsible for the observed TIR signal fluctuations.
   In this paper, a robust satellite data analysis technique is described which pen-nits us to identify anomalous space-time TIR signal transients even in very variable observational (satellite view angle, land topography and coverage, etc.) and natural (e.g. meteorological) conditions. A statistically well-founded definition of TIR anomaly is given and proposed as a suitable tool for satellite TIR surveys in seismically active regions. Eight years of Meteosat TIR observations have been analyzed in order to characterize the TIR signal behavior at each specific observation time and location. Space-time TIR signal transients have then been analyzed, both in the presence (validation) and in the absence of (confutation) seismic events, looking for possible space-time relationships. The devastating earthquake which occurred in Turkey (Izmit.. August 17, M-S similar to 7.8) in 1999 has been considered as a test case for validation, relatively unperturbed periods (no earthquakes with M > 5) were taken for confutation purposes. Quite intense (S/N > 3.5) and rare, spatially extensive and time persistent, TIR signal transients were identified appearing eight days before the Izmit main shock in Greece, moving to Turkey on August 13 and disappearing, moving back to Greece, some days after. Possible implications of such results, together with present limitations of the proposed technique, will also be discussed in the light of the improved performances expected by its extension to other existing or future satellite packages.

AB Aboveground biomass (AGB; Mg/ha) is defined in this study as a biomass of growing stock trees greater than 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) for stands >5 years and all trees taller than 1.3 in for stands <5 years. Although AGB is an important variable for evaluating ecosystem function and structure across the landscape, such estimates are difficult to generate without high-resolution satellite data. This study bridges the application of remote sensing techniques with various forest management practices in Chequamegon National Forest (CNF), Wisconsin, USA by producing a high-resolution stand age map and a spatially explicit AGB map. We coupled AGB values, calculated from field measurements of tree dbh, with various vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ data through multiple regression analyses to produce an initial biomass map. The initial biomass map was overlaid with a land-cover map to generate a stand age map. Biomass threshold values for each age category (e.g., young, intermediate, and mature) were determined through field observations and frequency analysis of initial biomass estimates by major cover types. We found that AGB estimates for hardwood forests were strongly related to stand age and near-infrared reflectance (r(2)=0.95) while the AGB for pine forests was strongly related to the corrected normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIc; r(2)=0.86). Separating hardwoods from pine forests improved the AGB estimates in the area substantially, compared to overall regression (r(2)=0.82). Our AGB results are comparable to previously reported values in the area. The total amount of AGB in the study area for 2001 was estimated as 3.3 million metric tons (dry weight), 76.5% of which was in hardwood and mixed hardwood/pine forests. AGB ranged from 1 to 358 Mg/ha with an average of 70 and a standard deviation of 54 Mg/ha. The AGB class with the highest percentage (16.1%) was between 81 and 100 Mg/ha. Forests with biomass values >200 Mg/ha accounted for less than 3% of the study area and were usually associated with mature hardwood forests. Estimated AGB was validated using independent field measurements (R-2=0.67, p<0.001). The AGB and age maps can be used as baseline information for future landscape level studies such as quantifying the regional carbon budget, accumulating fuel, or monitoring management practices.

AB Satellite images reveal the geomorphology and geometry of an active fault associated with an earthquake that caused over 40,000 deaths in southeast Iran. This earthquake, of moment magnitude (Mw) 6.6, occurred at 01:56:52 (UTC) on December 26, 2003 near the towns of Bam and Baravat. An active fault that ruptured during the earthquake can be seen on three-dimensional (3D) pre- and post-earthquake images generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible and near infrared (VNIR) data. The interpretation and analysis of satellite images suggest that a dextral fault extends for 65 km through the Bam-Baravat region. It strikes north-northwest and steps leftward at a segment boundary between two towns. Transpressional stress at this step-over (bend) probably triggered the 2003 earthquake rupture, as suggested also by source mechanism solution of the Bam earthquake and by landforms observed in the field. In the past 2000 years, Bam has had no earthquake as destructive as the one in 2003. The potential for this catastrophe could have been identified through a combination of satellite remote sensing technique and field reconnaissance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Phase II of the Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) has provided NASA investigators access to data from four different satellite and airborne data sources. the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land discipline team (MODLAND) sought to utilize these data in support of land product validation activities with a focus on the EOS Land Validation Core Sites. These sites provide a globally distributed network of sites where field, aircraft, and satellite data are being collected. As much as possible, uniform data sets useful for validation are being made available for the core sites. The globally consistent, high-resolution imagery available from IKONOS are being used for their geolocation accuracy and ability to characterize the landscape at the 1- to 4-m spatial resolution. This paper provides an overview of the MODIS Land Team's validation strategy to incorporate high-resolution imagery and presents three case studies as examples of the use of IKONOS data for MODIS land validation activities. We conclude that the globally consistent data from IKONOS, available through NASA's SDP, have supplied critical validation data sets at a reasonable cost. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Amazonia is one of the most important ecosystems of the planet, containing the largest extent of contiguous tropical rain forest on earth, over 5 million square kilometers. While most of the region remains forested, rapid development has led, over the past two decades, to the destruction of over 589,000 km(2) of forests in Brazil alone. Forest clearing can alter the transport of sediments, organic matter and associated nutrients to the rivers. In this article, we present the results of an integrated analysis of the landscape characteristics, including soil properties, river network, topography, and land use/cover of a tropical meso-scale river. This physical template was developed as a comprehensive tool, based on Remote Sensing and GIS, to support the understanding of the biogeochemistry of surface waters of the Ji-Parana river basin, State of Rondonia, Western Amazonia. Our primary objective was to demonstrate how this tool can help the understanding of complex environmental questions, such as the effects of land-use changes in the biogeochemistry of riverine systems. River sites and basin characteristics were calculated using the data sets compiled as layers in Arc-Info GIS. A land-use/cover map for 1999 was produced from a digital classification of Landsat 7-ETM+ images. To test the effects of the landscape characteristics on river water chemistry, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis. Average slope, river network density, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and proportion of pasture were treated as independent variables. River water electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl- and PO43- concentrations were the dependent variables. Spatially, higher values of all ions were associated with areas dominated by pasture, with the highest concentrations found in the central part of the basin, where pasture areas are at a maximum. As the river enters the lower reaches, forests dominate the landscape, and the concentrations drop. The percentage of the basin area covered by pasture was consistently the best predictor of EC (r(2) = 0.872), PO43- (r(2) = 0.794), Na+ (r(2) =0.754), Cl- (r(2) = 0.692) and K+ (r(2) = 0.626). For Ca2+, both ECEC (r(2) = 0.538) and pasture (r(2) = 0.502) explained most of the observed variability. The same pattern was found for Mg2+ (r(2) = 0.498 and 0.502, respectively).

AB This study analyzed the relationships between soil fertility and remotely sensed measures over three pasture chronosequence sites in the state of Rondonia, in the western Brazilian Amazon region. Remotely sensed measures included shade, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green vegetation (GV) and soil (derived from spectral mixture analysis), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These were correlated against soil fertility parameters such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and base saturation. In temporal analysis, it was observed that NPV dominated the spectral responses of pasture canopies and tended to increase with pasture age as well. The increase of NPV appeared to be related to the decline of soil fertility, but soil texture variation also played a role. In the correlation analysis, soil P, known as the most limiting nutrient for pasture productivity, showed the highest correlation with remotely sensed measures, followed by soil K and base saturation. However, this result was not observed at the sites where nutrient availability was very low. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use multispectral MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) data collected at Mt. Rainier, Washington (USA) to map spatial covariance between snowpack properties and to evaluate techniques for quantitative estimation of reflectance, grain size, and temperature. The late-August MASTER images reveal a distinct pattern of snow contaminant content, grain size, and temperature related to a recent snowfall and late-summer melting. Spatial correlation between grain size and temperature patterns suggests that rapid destructive metamorphism of the fresh snow occurred when temperatures were near 0 degreesC. We use 10 specific locations to evaluate hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), grain size, and temperature retrievals. We map relative snow contaminant content using visible (0.4-0.8 gm) HDRF spectra. Atmospheric correction and topographic modeling limit the accuracy of HDRF estimates. We use MASTER-derived spectra near 1.8 and 2.2 mum to estimate optical grain size (by comparison to modeled layers of ice spheres) and physical grain size (by comparison to measured spectra with known physical grain size and by correlation to ground measurements). Estimated physical grain sizes were less than estimated optical grain sizes. Differing definitions of optical and physical grain sizes could contribute to this discrepancy. Limitations at 1.8 and 2.2 mum, including reduced discrimination between larger grain radii (> similar to 500 mum physical, > similar to 200 mum optical) and low signal-to-noise ration with atmospheric effects and decreasing solar irradiance, suggest that grain size retrieval may be improved at other wavelengths (e.g., 1.1 mum). Accounting for uncertainty in emissivity, atmospheric correction, and detector noise, we estimate systematic errors in our radiant temperatures at < 1.8 degreesC. This study shows both strengths and limitations for coregistered visible, short-wave infrared, and thermal infrared images to estimate snowpack properties and reveal their spatial coherence.

ID RETRIEVAL; BEHAVIOR
AB The feasibility of interferometric SAR (INSAR) coherence observations for stem volume (biomass) retrieval is investigated by applying coherence data determined from 14 ERS-1 and ERS-2 C-band SAR image pairs. The image set covers a single forested test area in Finland, and both summer (snow-free) and winter conditions are represented. The data set enabled (a) the study of stem volume retrieval performance under vaning conditions, (b) the analysis of the seasonal behavior of interferometric coherence, and (c) the determination of the accuracy characteristics of empirical (nonlinear) coherence modeling. Additionally, a new technique to estimate forest stem volume from WSAR data was developed based on constrained iterative inversion of the applied empirical model. The results indicate that the usability of winter images with snow-covered terrain is superior to that of images obtained under summer conditions. The applied empirical model appears to be adequate for describing the stand-wise coherence of boreal forest. Hence, a practical stem volume estimation method can be established based on it. The highest correlation coefficient between the estimated stem volume and the ground truth stem volume showed values as high as r = 0.9 and a relative RMSE level of 48% was obtained, respectively.

AB The relation between satellite measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), cumulated over the growing season, and inventory estimates of forest woody biomass carbon is estimated statistically with data from 167 provinces and states in six countries (Canada, Finland, Norway, Russia and the USA for a single time period and Sweden for two periods). Statistical tests indicate that the regression model can be used to represent the relation between forest biomass and NDVI across spatial, temporal and ecological scales for relatively long time scales. For the 1.42 billion ha of boreal and temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere, the woody biomass carbon pools and sinks are estimated at a relatively high spatial resolution (8 x 8 km). We estimate the carbon pool to be 61 +/- 20 gigatons (10(9)) carbon (Gt C) during the late 1990s and the biomass sink to be 0.68 +/- 0.34 Gt C/year between the 1982 and 1999. The geographic detail of carbon sinks provided here can contribute to a potential monitoring program for greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

AB The general capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for monitoring forest ecosystems is well documented. However, the majority of SAR studies of forest dynamics use only imagery acquired by one SAR system and are thus limited to the lifecycle of a particular satellite. The synergistic analysis of SAR data from one of the earliest spaceborne SAR missions, the SEASAT mission, with the Japanese JERS-1 satellite-borne SAR is presented. Biophysical parameters frequently retrieved from SAR are tree biomass using backscatter and tree height from the interferometric phase. One potential application that has not been thoroughly examined is mapping of incremental tree growth from SAR backscatter changes. Tree growth measures biomass changes over time, and is correlated to the amount of carbon sequestered by the trees. This paper examines the retrieval of tree growth from multitemporal spaceborne L-band SAR. A SEASAT SAR image from 1978 and a JERS-1 SAR image from 1997 over Thetford forest, UK are used to retrieve tree growth of Corsican Pine stands. Incremental growth was estimated from the changes in backscatter coefficient, and compared to the expected tree growth from general yield class models used by the UK Forestry Commission. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithm depends on the minimum forest stand size included in the analysis. For managed forest plantations, multitemporal L-band SAR has some potential for detecting incremental biomass to support sustainable forest management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The features of the 1997-1998 El Nino event were analyzed by Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) statistical methods applied to the remotely sensed sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) measured by AVHRR radiometers; anomalies of water circulation derived from sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) measured by TOPEX/Poseidon radar altimeter; and meteorological information (air temperature, upwelling index, and wind stress curl). EOF statistics demonstrated the features of an El Nino event during the second half of 1997 and the first half of 1998, with sea level elevated along the coast and with SSHA gradients, indicating a retarding of both the equatorward California Current and the alongshore poleward Southern California Countercurrent. The positive SST anomaly developed first in the Southern California Bight and then in the zone of upwelling to the north of Point Conception. The anomalies of upwelling index and the wind stress curl pattern also changed during the El Nino event, but these changes occurred later than hydrographic variations and were too weak to explain the observed changes in SSTA and SSRA. We conclude that off central and southern California oceanic teleconnection (i.e., the consequences of propagation northward of coastally trapped downwelling waves) was responsible for the 1997-1998 El Nino event.

AB Nineteen years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature (AVERR MCSST) data were used to calculate monthly averages of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for a large region of the Southern Ocean centred on Macquarie Island. Between October and February, the MCSST data were a reliable source of SSTs north of 60degreesS, but their quality (i.e. spatial and temporal density) was degraded severely at higher latitudes. Between April and August, the interpolated MCSST data were found to be unreliable in the study area, even at latitudes as low as 45degreesS. A specific problem has been identified to the west of Tasmania in the winter interpolated climatology which is likely an artefact of interpolation of sparse data. The poor coverage of valid MCSSTs during this time limits the data's application for many uses. Although the limitations of the MCSST data set are well recognised, the possibilities for ecological applications of these data remain largely unexplored and unquantified. The potential exists to maximize the information available from this and other similar data sets by determining the appropriate spatial and temporal scales at which they are best applied to biophysical models.

TI Designing a spectral index to estimate vegetation water content from
   remote sensing data -: Part 2.: Validation and applications
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) was developed to retrieve vegetation water content from local to global scale rapidly and reliably using SPOT-VEGETATION data. This paper validates the GVMI with field measurements of vegetation water content measured over four different ecosystems in Senegal. Two of the sites show exact concordance between GVMI-derived and field-measured water content. The remaining two sites show differences in value but provide identical evolution over time. Comparison between ecosystems illustrates that GVMI-derived water content is consistent with field measurements of water content expressed as a quantity of water per unit area. Additional study shows that GVMI is not related to the vegetation moisture content expressed as a percentage of water per quantity of biomass. Comparison between the GVMI and NDVI methods also illustrates that the NDVI provides different information (vegetation greenness), which is not directly related to the quantity of water in the vegetation. Potential applications of the new GVMI are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The IKONOS 2 satellite was launched in late 1999 and carries the first commercial multispectral instrument to achieve 4 in spatial resolution. The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored. IKONOS data are unlikely to identify deterioration in coral reefs directly because changes in community structure cannot be resolved spectrally from the satellite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Since April 1998, the VEGETATION/SPOT-4 sensor has provided global reflectances on a daily basis. Its large field-of-view makes the observations strongly dependent on the Sun-target-sensor geometry. This paper presents the "BiDirectional Compositing" (BDC) method we designed for the VEGETATION operational line to normalise directional effects in 10-day global syntheses. For each spectral band and each pixel, BDC results every 10 days in one nadir view datum derived from the observations acquired at every orbit pass. BDC is based on two main ideas. Firstly, the length of the time window devoted to Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) retrieval is conceived as a variable in such a way that a constant number of cloud-free data is always available to fit the BRDF model. Secondly, BRDF retrieval is separated from data normalisation and compositing, which operates only on 10-day windows before the date of syntheses in order to keep the reflectances level of the most recent observations. As a reliable BRDF is always available from VEGETATION data, BDC is fully productive at a 10-day step. It allows to use one single method to derive global syntheses, which can be easily adapted for any large field-of-view optical sensor. Using VEGETATION data sets acquired on four regions of the world, we finally compare 10-day syntheses obtained by BDC to the ones derived with two versions of Maximum Value Compositing (MVC) differing by the performance in detection of clouds and aerosols. The seasonal and spatial coherence of reflectances and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are much larger on BDC than on MVC syntheses, both at a regional and pixel (km(2)) scale. Compared to the version of MVC that is presently used in the VEGETATION operational line, BDC smoothes 10-day fluctuations of reflectances and NDVI time series by a factor 2.8 on average.

ID MODEL; FLUXES; PARAMETERIZATION
AB Issues related to thermal infrared radiative transfer modelisation and retrieval of component temperatures from directional remote sensing measurements are addressed in this paper. We compare five models and assess their accuracy in direct mode (directional radiative temperature simulations) and inverse mode (soil and leaf temperature retrievals), for a large set of simulations, We write all models using a single pattern, and we propose a unique inversion scheme based on this pattern. In this context, some precisions are given regarding previous parameterizations and results. Two new efficient and simple models appear to successfully compare to the reference model. The relation between radiative temperature and soil moisture is also examined using a coupled process-radiative transfer model and it is shown that directional measurements dramatically improve the soil moisture detection capability in the thermal infrared.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID ABSORPTION
AB We describe a new algorithm to derive columnar water vapour under cloud-free conditions over land from backscattered solar radiation in the near-infrared. The algorithm will be used in ESA's Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) ground processor. It is based on radiative transfer simulations, where the radiance ratio between the MERIS channels 15 (900 nm) and 14 (885 nm) is used in an inversion procedure based on regressions. The theoretical accuracy of the algorithm is about 1.7 kg/m(2). We discuss and quantify possible error sources using radiative transfer simulations. These error sources are variable aerosol optical thickness, type, and vertical distribution, spectral variations in land surface reflectance, deviations between the actual and nominal bandsetting of the MERIS, sensor noise, variations in surface pressure, and temperature variations. For validation, we re-calibrate the algorithm to the bandsettings of the Modular Optoelectronical Scanner (MOS), which has been flown on the Indian IRS platform since 1996. Comparisons of the retrieved water vapour path (WVP) with colocated radiosoundings for 239 cases in the period 1996-1999 show a RMSE of 2.49 kg/m(2) with a BIAS component of 0.04 kg/m(2).

AB The 1997- 1998 fires impacted upon huge areas of forests in Indonesia. Remotely sensed data have played an important role in both monitoring and publicizing the unfolding environmental tragedy and in postburn assessments of fire damage. This paper examines the potential of an active satellite system (European Radar Satellite [ERS]-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar [SARI) to monitor the pr-oneness of a range of vegetation types in East Kalimantan to burn, using a fire-related, daily drought index (DDI) as a proxy. The results indicate significant correlations between the C-band SAR backscatter and DDI values For a range of modified vegetation types, including dipterocarp forest with low to moderate disturbance. A deterministic relationship between backscatter and the fire-related DDI may thus exist, which implies that backscatter data could be used to monitor real-time changes in the proneness of vegetation to fire. A drought correlation map provides a synoptic view in the study area of differences in proneness of vegetation to fire. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science inc. All rights reserved.

AB Waveform-recording laser altimeter observations of vegetated landscapes provide a time-resolved measure of laser pulse backscatter energy from canopy surfaces and the underlying ground. Airborne laser altimeter waveform data was acquired using the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery (SLICER) for a successional sequence of four, closed-canopy, deciduous forest stands in eastern Maryland. The four stands were selected so as to include a range of canopy structures of importance to forest ecosystem function, including variation in the height and roughness of the outermost canopy surface and the vertical organization of canopy stories and gaps. The character of the SLICER backscatter signal is described and a method is developed that accounts for occlusion of the laser energy by canopy surfaces, transforming the backscatter signal to a canopy height profile (CHP) that quantitatively represents the relative vertical distribution of canopy surface area. The transformation applies increased weighting to the backscatter amplitude as a function of closure through the canopy and assumes a horizontally random distribution of the canopy components. SLICER CHPs, averaged over areas of overlap where altimeter ground tracks intersect, are shown to be highly reproducible. CHP transects across the four stands reveal spatial variations in vegetation, at the scale of the individual 10-m-diameter laser footprints, within and between stands. Averaged SLICER CHPs are compared to analogous height profile results derived from ground-based sightings to plant intercepts measured on plots within the four stands. The plots were located on the segments of the altimeter ground tracks from which averaged SLICER CHPs were derived, and the ground observations were acquired within 2 weeks of the SLICER data acquisition to minimize temporal change. The differences in canopy structure between the four stands is similarly described by the SLICER and ground-based CHP results. However, a chi-square test of similarity documents differences that are statistically significant. The differences are discussed in terms of measurement properties that define the smoothness of the resulting CHPs and canopy properties that may vertically bias the CHP representations of canopy structure. The statistical differences are most likely due to the more noisy character of the ground-based CHPs, especially high in the canopy where ground-based sightings are rare resulting in an underestimate of canopy surface area and height, and to departures from assumptions of canopy uniformity, particularly regarding lack of clumping and vertically constant canopy reflectance, which bias the CHPs. The results demonstrate that the SLICER observations reliably provide a measure of canopy structure that reveals ecologically interesting structural variations such as those characterizing a successional sequence of closed-canopy, broadleaf forest stands.

TI Using SIR-C SAR data and the AMAP model for forest attributes retrieval
   and 3-D stand simulation
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and the plant architectural model AMAP are new tools, currently under development and validation, for the retrieval and mapping of forest parameters through a Geographical Information System (GIS). On one hand L-band SAR data are useful for the retrieval of some forest attributes such as age and woody volume. On the other hand, validated growth model of free architecture allows retrieval of many forest parameters at tree level and simulation of virtual 3-D views both at the tree and stand levels. To this aim, a methodology is proposed using L-KV SIR-C SAR data or AMAP alone or their coupling through a GIS for forest attributes retrieval and 3-D stand simulation. This approach is illustrated on a simple forest ecosystem, an Austrian pine forest over hilly terrain in southern of France. Results show the potentialities and interests in using such tools when retrieval bole volume is limited to 300 m(3)/ha; AMAP allowed estimation according to tree (compartment) partitioning as a function of growth stage. The coupling approach gives realistic 3-D stand visualization when it is exercised with GIS data sets and error sources are pointed out toward future improvement and generalization.

AB The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) signals collected by statellites in the solar spectrum are modified by scattering and absorption by gases and aerosols while traveling through the atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the sensor. When and how to correct the atmospheric effects depend un the remote sensing and atmospheric data available, the information desired and the analytical methods used to extract the information In many applications involving classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary as long as the training data and the data to be classified nl-e in the same relative scale. In other circumstances, corrections al-e mandatory to put multitemporal data on the same radio-metric scale in order to monitor terrestrial surfaces over time. A multitemporal dataset consisting of seven Land-sat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988 to 1996 of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China was used to compare sewn absolute and one relative atmospheric correction algorithms with uncorrected raw data. Based on classification and change detection results all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries-Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lend to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification, and change detection applications.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing techniques have been successfully used to obtain spatial and multitemporal surface soil moisture data over large areas. Measurement of fine-resolution soil physical properties over large areas are, however, rarely available. In this study, we explore the possibility of inferring soil physical properties from a multitemporal remotely sensed brightness temperature and soil moisture maps. We construct two Artificial Neural Network models based on physical linkages among space-time distribution of brightness temperature, soil moisture, and soil media properties. Using a sequence of remotely data from Washita '92 experiment, we show that it is possible to infer soil texture from multitemporal brightness temperature and soil moisture data.

AB The aim of this study is the development of tools dedicated to fuzzy partition evaluation in the field of satellite image classification. While a traditional crisp partition only provides qualitative information, a fuzzy partition represents a large amount of quantitative information. However, such a partition is often evaluated after "defuzzification" (i.e., it is reduced to a crisp partition). The analysis of a traditional confusion matrix, describing the similarities between the computed crisp partition and a control partition, can then be performed. This approach is rather drastic and is far from satisfactory because the qualitative information is lost after the defuzzification. Some methods do not adequate to evaluate nonprobabilistic fuzzy partitions (i.e., fuzzy partitions such that the sum of the membership degrees is not necessarily equal to 1). To solve these issues, we consider the evaluation of any fuzzy partition mu as the evaluation of a still fuzzy new partition: the plausibilistic closure of mu. This approach comes from the theory of evidence. It allows definition of a set of original tools (plausibility matrices, credibility matrices, and overlap degrees) dedicated to fuzzy partition evaluation. A concrete application illustrates our theoretical work and a tutorial is provided in appendix. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Spectral imaging data acquired with Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer over Point Dume (Los Angeles County, CA, USA) were used to assess the ability of hyperspectral reflectance data to estimate canopy Relative Water Content (RWC) at the landscape level. The study was performed on 23 vegetation stands comprised of three characteristic chaparral plant communities, with contrasting phenological stages and canopy cover. Several estimates of water content based on the near-infra-red (SWIR) water absorption bands were compared to measurements of vegetation structure and water content made on the ground. The Water Index (WI) and Normalized Difference Water index (NDWI), reflectance indices formulated from the NIR water absorption bands, were the best indicators of canopy RWC estimated from combining leaf relative water content with measures of canopy structure. A stepwise multiple regression revealed that canopy structure explained 36% and 41% of the variation in WI and NDWI, respectively. The explained variance in WI and NDWI increased to 44% and 48% when leaf relative water content was included in the model. By contrast, the inclusion of leaf relative water content did not contribute significantly to the explained variance in indices formulated using SWIR water absorption bands and in those based on water thickness. The relationship between WI and the canopy RWC significantly improved when only data from plots with green vegetation cover >70% were considered (r(2)=0.88, p<0.001). All the indices studied had an important structural component (as indicated by the strong correlation with NDVI), yet only the indices WI and NDWI additionally responded to water content. These results indicate that the WI and NDWI are sensitive to variations in canopy relative water content at the landscape scale. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the ocean surface have potential use for various remote sensing purposes. Some possibilities are measurements of surface roughness characteristics from which wave height, wind speed, and direction could be determined. For this paper; GPS-reflected signal measurements collected at aircraft altitudes of 2 km to 5 km with delay-Doppler mapping GPS receiver are used to explore the possibility of determining wind speed. To interpret the GPS data, a theoretical model has been developed that describes the power. of the reflected CPS signals for different time delays and Doppler frequencies as a function of geometrical and environmental parameters. The results indicate a good agreement between the measured and the modeled normalized signal power waveforms during changing surface wind conditions. The estimated rr,ind spc en using surface-reflected GPS data, obtained by comparing actual and modeled waveforms, shows good ;agreement (within 2 m/s) with delta obtained from a nearby buoy and independent wind speed measurements derived from the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetric satellite.

AB This is the first of two articles which explore thr combined use of coarse and fine resolution data in land cover studies. It describes the development and evaluation of an objective procedure to select a representative sample of tiles of high resolution images that complements a coarse coverage of an entire region of interest. The second article explores that use of the procedure for an accurate estimation of cover type composition at the regional scale. The Purposive Selection Algorithm (PSA) assumes that a relationship exists between land cover compositions at the two spatial scales. It selects one tile at a time, seeking the sample which most closely resembles the composition of the coarse resolution map. Two selection criteria were used, fraction of cover types and contagion index. PSA was evaluated using two land cover maps for a 288 kmx165 km area in central Saskatchewan, Canada derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper images (30 m pixels) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, 1000 m pixels), each divided into 64 tiles. The performance of an intermediate sensor (480 m pixels) was assessed by resampling the TM map. When using cover type composition alone, it was found that the procedure rapidly converges on a representative set of tiles with land cover composition very similar to the full coverage. The match between the domain and sample cover type fractions was very close, with errors less than 0.002% once about 1/5 to 1/3 of the tiles were selected and no discernible bias in the selected sample. Compared to the TM whole area coverage, samples selected with AVHRR classification were as representative as those obtained using the TM map. The performance of samples selected by a combination of cover composition and contagion index responded to the characteristics of individual tiles in terms of the selection criteria. A rigorous application of the algorithm with spatial heterogeneity measures such as the contagion index is computationally very demanding. It is concluded that PSA provides an efficient and effective tool to select a representative sample for land cover studies in which both large area coverage and local detail are desired.

AB Using AVHRR imagery, the effects urbanization on surface microclimate during a 7-year period in San Jose Costa Rica and its surroundings are expressed as changes in fractional vegetation cover scaled surface temperature, surface wetness, and surface evapotranspiration. Scatterplots of fractional vegetation cover versus scaled surface temperature depict elongated clusters along which pixels undergoing urbanization migrate toward lower vegetation cover higher surface temperature, less evapotranspiration, and generally dryer surfaces. This urbanization occurred largely in response to pasture and low-density urban areas changing to high-density urban areas. The evolution in surface microclimate accompanying these changes differs considerably for the various types of urban surfaces, but ultimately the pixels become virtually indistinguishable from one another as urbanization becomes advanced. On the other hand deforestation, which occurred as trees were replaced by crops, did not result in large changes in surface temperature and wetness and may have produced increases with time in evapotranspiration.

AB The potential to measure indices of forest vigor from foliar spectral reflectance was assessed in a range of balsam fir conditions achieved through stand manipulations. In order of increasing vigor, treatments consisted of root pruning, control, thinning, and thinning in combination with fertilization. Concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen increased significantly from the low to high vigor plots, and shoot lengths increased by more than three times. Balsam fir shoots front each treatment were measured for reflectance under laboratory conditions by a portable spectroradiometer with a spectral range front 3.50 nm to 2500 nm. Reflectance decreased consistently with vigor throughout the spectral region analyzed. Most wavebands showed significant effects of the treatments, with the most significant wavebands in the region of chlorophyll absorption between 500 nm and 740 nm. Foliage age class and sample date also affected reflectance in these wavebands. Reflectance indices, defined as the ratio and normalized difference of the most significant waveband at 711 nm and the least significant waveband at 913 nm, were affected by the treatments (P<0.0001). The normalized difference index correlated strongly with concentrations of chlorophyll a (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.75), chlorophyll b (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.66), nitrogen (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.52), and shoots lengths (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.69), thereby comprising a spectral index of balsam fir vigor that integrates several aspects of forest physiological condition.

AB A simple two-term model of the radar backscattering coefficient of crops, designed Sor the retrieval of the amount of water in the canopy, is described and analyzed. The principle of the method is to calibrate the simple model front the simulations of a discrete first-order radiative transfer model during crop development. The canopy structure is taken into account in the discrete model to compute the relationships between a) the vegetation direct contribution to backscattering sigma(v)(o) and the optical depth tau and b) the optical depth tau and the amount of water in the canopy. The two-term model is tested against C-band radar data acquired over a soy bean crop during the whole vegetation cycle. The simulations correlate well with the measurements and the retrieval of the amount of water it the canopy Wc (kg/m(2)) can be carried out. Accurate temporal information on the crop growth could be derived from the radar data. Ancillary information about soil moisture are required, but it is found that rough estimates on a 4-5 day basis are sufficient. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB In this investigation, the inversion of a forest reflectance model (FLIM) was tested, along with two spectral vegetation indices (NDVI ans SAVI) for a boreal forest site, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. At the measurement plot scale, model inversions could not provide accurate information on cover or crown transmittance (a function of leaf area index, LAI) using only single-date TM data. A primary limitation was due to variations in other stand characteristics that could not be taken into account in the inversion process; including the background spectral signatures, stand structure, and spatial distribution of trees. A single value of a given parameter derived from inversion was associated with multiple values of that parameter as measured on the ground. The remote sensing derived parameters were grouped into classes based on homogeneous plot characteristics. From analysis of variance of the grouped data, the coverages derived by inversion, the NDVI, and the SAVI were found to be related to measured coverage at the 0.01 level. Crown transmittances derived from inversion were related to measured transmittances at the 0.01 level, although the indices were not found to be related to measured transmittance. The results indicate that the FLIM performs in a similar way to a physically based, nonlinear spectral index. Further work is needed to develop methods for incorporating additional inventory and remote sensing information into the inversion process. Work is also needed to investigate methods to relate the biophysical information derived from remote sensing to routine forest inventory variables, which are required in forest management.

AB In early 1999 about when this article win hit the press. NASA is scheduled to launch its first Earth Observing satellite System (EOS) with array of instructions for precise, scientific, remote sensing of the Earth land ocean, and atmospheres. One of the main instruments, MODIS, will monitor daily vegetation dynamics with seven specially selected and highly characterized and calibrated spectral channels in the solar spectrum, with spatial resolution from 250 m to 500 m. These MODIS data, together with multiangular observations from the MISR instrument (also on EOS), will generate a much better picture of vegetation dynamic than previous satellite data records. But studying changes on, the Earth surface takes years and decades. To do it in our scientific lifetime, there is a need to be able to develop a data series that combines the traditional NDVI-AVHRR data sets that was used to monitor vegetation dynamics with the new MODIS data with its narrower channels. Here we propose that due to spectral differences between the AVHRR and MODIS, a combination of the MODIS red and green channels should be used to represent the AVHRR red channel in such long term data series, to avoid a step in the NDVI of delta NDVI of up to 0.05. We use both leaf spectra and full canopy spectra to develop and test this optimization. Optimization of the MODIS sensitivity for monitoring the dynamics of vegetation chlorophyll content is also discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Transitions from grassland to shrubland through woody plant encroachment result in potentially significant shifts in savanna ecosystem function. Given high resolution imagery, a textural index could prove useful for mapping woody plant densities and monitoring woody plant encroachment across savanna landscapes. Spatial heterogeneity introduced through mixtures of herbaceous and woody plants challenges quantitative assessments of changing woody plant density using remotely sensed imagery. Moreover woody plant encroachment occurs across decadal time scales, restricting remote sensing analyses to historical aerial photograph records. Heterogeneity in vegetation structure has a significant influence on local pixel variance in high resolution images. We scanned black and white aerial photographs for 18 sites of valuing woody plant density, producing images of 2-m grain size. Omnidirectional variograms derived from these images had ranges of approximately 10 m and sills highly sensitive to woody plant density, prompting us to use a textural index to indicate landscape variation in woody plant density. For validation purposes, we measured several woody overstory structural parameters in the field a factor analysis revealed woody stem count as the best correlate with image texture. Significance of the regression of image texture on woody stem count declined as grain size of the 2-m images was coarsened to simulate that of SPOT and Landsat satellite sensors. At 10-m resolution, our textural index proved a significant indicator of woody plant density. We mosaicked sequential aerial photographs scanned at 10-m resolution and then applied oar textural filter, producing maps of historical woody plant distribution that reflected patterns in, soil and vegetation type More accurate maps of canopy structure and structural change are needed to explore potential effects of woody plant encroachment on biophysical and biogeochemical processes at large scales.

ID GOES IMAGES; CLOUD
AB The visible infrared spin scan radiometer (VISSR) common to many geostationary satellites produces visible wavelength data contaminated with stripes. The stripes affect the usefulness of the data in quantitative studies. This paper briefly reviews the cause of the striping and then develops a tapered window finite impulse response (FIR) filter and a constrained least squares FIR filter Both filters minimize the stripes in the visible data and simultaneously minimize any distortion in the filtered data. These new filters are also designed to minimize ringing near cloud edges-a problem often associated with earlier FIR filter designs used to remove striped noise in satellite data. Finally, the results obtained by using these new filtering methods are quantitatively compared with those produced by other destriping methods. Results from geostationary operational environment satellite (GOES-7) and the geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS-5) scenes show that both filters are superior to the other methods evaluated. Moreover, they are computationally efficient because they are implemented in. the spatial domain. Significant differences between the noise structure of GOES-7 and GMS-5 visible data also are discussed these differences appear not to be in the open literature. The new FIR filter designs can also be adapted for use with data taken with the improved VISSR-like instruments an the GOES-8 and GOES-9 satellites. The importance of proper destriping of geostationary satellite data for geophysical applications is discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB An error matric is frequently employed to organize and display information used to assess the thematic accuracy of a land-cover map, and numerous accuracy measures have been proposed for summarizing the information contained in this error matrix. No one measure is universally best for all accuracy assessment objectives, and different accuracy measures may lead to conflicting conclusions because the measures do not represent accuracy in the same way Choosing appropriate accuracy measures that address objectives of the mapping project is critical. Characteristics of some commonly used accuracy measures are described, and relationships among these measures are provided to aid the user in choosing an appropriate measure. Accuracy measures that are directly interpretable as probabilities of encountering certain. types of misclassification errors or correct classifications should be selected in preference to measures not interpretable as such. User's and producer's accuracy and the overall proportion of area correctly classified are examples of accuracy measures possessing the desired probabilistic interpretation. The kappa coefficient of agreement does not possess such a probabilistic interpretation because of the adjustment for hypothetical chance agreement incorporated into this measure, and the strong dependence of kappa on the marginal proportions of the error matrix makes the utility Of kappa for comparisons suspect. Normalizing ng an error matrix results in estimates that are not consistent for accuracy parameters of the ?nap being assessed, so that this procedure is generally not warranted for most applications.

On average, the laser transmitted 1350-1910 poises per stand and recorded 505-1070 canopy hits with corresponding estimates of canopy height. Ground truth stand volume was regressed against mean stand height, the mean height of all laser pulses within a stand, and canopy cover density as determined from the laser data.

ID THEMATIC MAP ACCURACY; REMOTELY SENSED DATA
AB Cluster sampling is a viable sampling design for collecting reference data for the purpose of conducting an accuracy assessment of land-cover classifications obtained from remotely sensed data. The formulas for estimating various accuracy parameters such as the overall proportion of pixels correctly classified, the kappa coefficient of agreement, and user's and producer's accuracy are the same under cluster sampling and simple random sampling, but the formulas for estimating standard errors differ between the two designs. If standard error formulas appropriate for cluster sampling are not employed in an accuracy assessment based on this design, the reported variability of map accuracy statistics is likely to be grossly misleading. The proper standard error formulas for common map accuracy statistics are derived for one-stage cluster sampling. The validity of these standard error formulas is verified by a small simulation study, and the standard errors computed according to the usual simple random sampling formulas are shown to underestimate the true cluster sampling standard errors by 20-70% if the intracluster correlation is moderate.

AB A modification of the so-called ''Simplified Method'' used to obtain the integrated daily evapotranspiration from surface radiant temperature over variable vegetation cover is proposed. Mathematically, the simplified equation takes the form

   where Rn-24 and LE(24) are, respectively, the integrated net radiation and evapotranspiration over a 24-h period and T-013 and Ta-13 are, respectively, the surface radiant and the 50-m air temperatures at 1300 local time. B and n are pseudo constants given as functions of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), expressed as a scaled index N*. Both N* and T-a13 are obtained with the aid of remotely determined measurements, which are viewed on scatterplots of T-013 versus NDVI.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Washita'92 was a large-scale study of remote sensing and hydrology conducted on the Little Washita watershed in southwest Oklahoma. Data collection during the experiment included passive microwave observations using an L-band electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) and surface soil moisture observations at sites distributed over the area. Data were collected on 8 days over a 9-day period in June 1992. The watershed was saturated with a great deal of standing water at the outset of the study. During the experiment there was no rainfall and surface soil moisture observations exhibited a drydown pattern over the period. Significant variations in the level and rate of change in surface soil moisture were noted over areas dominated by different soil textures. ESTAR data were processed to produce brightness temperature maps of a 740 sq, km, area on each of the 8 days. These data exhibited significant spatial and temporal patterns. Spatial patterns were clearly associated with soil textures and temporal patterns with drainage and evaporative processes. Relationships between the ground-sampled soil moisture and the brightness temperatures were consistent with previous results. Spatial averaging of both variables was analyzed to study scaling of soil moisture over a mixed landscape. Results of these studies showed that a strong correlation is retained at these scales, suggesting that mapping surface moisture for large footprints may provide important information for regional studies.

ID RADIATION; CANOPIES
AB The development of digital videography has generated interest in the use of these instruments to estimate vegetation variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and light intercepted (fIPAR) by shrubs in shrublands and open forest canopies. The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between the percentage of scene classified as foliage in color digital videography acquired in the field, and LAI and fIPAR by canopies of two shrub species, bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula). There was a positive linear relationship between the combined percentage of scene occupied by sunlit leaves, shaded leaves, and shaded background as the dependent variable, and fIPAR (R(2) = 0.66 manzanita, and 0.61 bitterbrush). A logarithmic relationship was observed between the combined percentage of scene occupied by sunlit leaves, shaded leaves, and shaded background, and the independent variable LAI (R(2) = 0.88 man zanita, and 0.65 bitterbrush). A green/red ratio was useful for classification of video scene components into illuminated and shaded leaves, and illuminated and shaded background. This study demonstrates that color digital videography may be suitable for field estimates of fIPAR and low LAIs in open shrublands.

AB This paper presents progress toward a geophysical and biophysical information processor for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This processor operates in a sequential fashion to first classify terrain according to structural attributes and then apply class-specific retrievals for geophysical and biophysical properties. Structural and electrical attributes control the radar backscattering from terrain. Experimental data and theoretical results illustrate the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar to structural properties, such as surface roughness and canopy architecture, to soil moisture and to the aboveground biomass of vegetation. and its moisture status. Accurate land-cover classification is of great value in many types of regional- to global-scale modeling, and is also an essential precursor to many techniques for extracting geophysical and biophysical information from SAR data. The sensitivity of SAR to the structural features of terrain leads to landcover classification into simple and easily interpreted structural classes. Knowledge-based, hierarchical classifiers require no a priori information or statistical understanding of a local scene, and are found to yield overall accuracy in excess of 90%. Classification using existing data fron the orbital ERS-1 and JERS-1 SARs yield unambiguous land-cover categorizations at greater accuracy and resolution than that afforded by an unsupervised classification of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as derived from multitemporal AVHRR data. Level I of the SAR terrain classifier differentiates three structural classes; surfaces, short vegetation, and tall vegetation. These classes can be quantized, averaged over the appropriate grid scab and used directly as roughness inputs to general circulation models. Level II of the classifier differentiates vegetation classes on the basis of growth form and leaf type. This level of structural classification is essential in order to improve the performance of semiempirical approaches for retrieving near-surface soil moisture and aboveground biomass.

TI MAPPING HEAT-LOSS ZONES FOR PERMAFROST PREDICTION AT THE NORTHERN ALPINE
   LIMIT OF THE BOREAL FOREST USING HIGH-RESOLUTION C-BAND SAR
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Lack of thermal insulation of the ground by snow cover. is the prime factor causing permafrost to occur in the alpine tundra areas near Schefferville (55 degrees N, 67 degrees W). Lack of protection by seasonal snow cover is also the prime factor suppressing the growth of brush vegetation that is omnipresent elsewhere. The sensitivity of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to slight variations in an already sparse vegetation cover permits areas of shallow snow cover and thus strong wintertime heat loss, to be identified. The map of such heat loss zones produced from a high-resolution HH-polarized C-band SAR-image imaged by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing in early June 1991, compares favorably with previous permafrost maps produced by the Iron Ore Company of Canada.

ID OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; OCEAN; CALIBRATION
AB This article presents a method for using the short wave bands of the AVHRR imaging sensor on the NOAA series of weather satellites for real-time mapping of the intense plankton blooms (''red tide'' events) that occur in the coastal waters Of many parts of the world. A similar method has been used in the open ocean to detect the highly reflective blooms due to coccolithophores, but the capabilities of the AVHRR for detecting other events in which surface waters are significantly brightened appear to have been overlooked. The article describes how real-time processing of data from a local receiving station may be used in a ''red tide watch'' for the frequent and rapid monitoring of large areas. The advantages and limitations of the processing algorithm are described, and sample data are discussed.

TI NOCTURNAL EFFECTS IN THE RETRIEVAL OF LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURES FROM
   SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The determination of accurate land surface temperatures from infrared satellite measurements is difficult because of variations in atmospheric water vapor and in land surface emissivity. Here we show that under certain conditions (viz. when the atmosphere near the surface is warmer than the surface), there is a cancellation between absorbed and emitted radiation. This often occurs during clear nights when intense nocturnal cooling of the surface causes inversions in the temperature and water vapor profiles. We demonstrate that a reasonable estimate of the land surface temperature can be made from a single channel-infrared measurement in these conditions.

TI ESTIMATING SNOW GRAIN-SIZE USING AVIRIS DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECTRAL ALBEDO; SCATTERING; MODEL
AB Estimates Of snow grain size for the near-surface snow layer were calculated for the Tioga Pass region and Mammoth Mountain in the Sierra Nevada, California, using an inversion technique and data collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). The inversion method takes advantage of the sensitivity Of near-infrared snowpack reflectance to snow grain size. The Tioga Pass and Mammoth Mountain single-band AVIRIS radiance images were atmospherically corrected to obtain surface reflectance. Given the solar and viewing geometry for the time and location of each AVIRIS overflight, a discrete-ordinate model was used to calculate directional reflectance as a function Of snowpack grain size, for a wide range Of snow grain radii. The resulting radius vs. reflectance curves were each fit using a nonlinear least-squares technique which provided a means of transforming surface reflectance in each AVIRIS image to optically equivalent grain size on a per-pixel basis. This inversion technique has been validated using a combination of ground-based reflectance measurements and grain size measurements derived from stereologic analysis of snow samples for a wide range of snow grain sizes. The model results and grain size estimates derived from the AVIRIS data show that, for solar incidence angles between 0-degrees and 300, the technique provides good estimates of grain size. Otherwise, the local angle of solar incidence must be known more exactly. This work provides the first quantitative estimates for grain size using data acquired from an airborne remote sensing instrument and is an important step in improving our ability to retrieve snow physical properties independent of field measurements.

AB Remote spectral measurements of light reflected or emitted from terrestrial scenes is commonly integrated over areas sufficiently large that the surface comprises more than one component. Techniques have been developed to analyze multispectral or imaging spectrometer data in terms of a wide range of mixtures of a limited number of components. Spectral mixture analysis has been used primarily for visible and near-infrared images, but it may also be applied to thermal infrared data. Two approaches are reviewed: binary mixing and a more general treatment for isothermal mixtures of a greater number of components.

AB Visible and infrared wavenumber spectra were examined for two AVHRR images (256 x 256 pixels; 1.1 km resolution) of single layer, shallow-cumuliform clouds from off the east coast of North America. For each image, both spectra are almost identical in form for scales between 2 and 256 km. For scales greater than approximately 5 km, spectral slopes can vary widely between cloud types, but for smaller scales they follow approximately k-3 in constancy with previous results. It is argued that abrupt scaling changes are to be expected at about typical cloud cell size, thus implying that satellite radiance variability is scale dependent. Furthermore, it is argued that application of existing generalized scale invariance techniques to satellite imagery should avoid crossing over the scale associated with typical cloud cell size. Monte Carlo methods of photon transport were used to demonstrate the similarities between spectral slopes for a cloud's vertical integral of optical depth tau(upsilon) and its corresponding reflected and emitted radiation fields. This suggests that the k-3 radiance spectra for shallow cumuliform clouds derives from cloud optical depths varying as approximately k-3 also. This, in turn, implies that if in shallow cumulus liquid water content (LWC) variability is isotropic, spectra of LWC transects should be close to k-2, as is often the case. Despite the spectral similarities, it is shown that the many-to-many relation between reflected radiance and tau(upsilon) can be quite pronounced, thus making inference of tau(upsilon) difficult.

AB A large number of previous studies have investigated the possibility of estimating absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from spectral reflectance of plant canopies. An important factor not considered in these studies is the case of horizontally heterogeneous plant stands where the ground cover is usually less than 100%. We investigated the relationship between spectral indices and fraction of absorbed PAR in horizontally heterogeneous vegetation canopies with the aid of a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. Canopy reflection at optical wavelengths and PAR absorption was simulated using this model. The errors incurred in using a ID model for calculating the radiation regime of spatially heterogeneous canopies are shown to be significant. Our analysis indicates that the leaf area index of a canopy is less of an instructive parameter than ground cover and clump leaf area index for these canopies. The relationship between normalized difference vegetation index and fraction of absorbed PAR is found to be almost linear and independent of spatial heterogeneity. However, this relationship is sensitive to the reflectance of the soil or background.

The reflectance values R660 and R710 at 660 nm and 710 nm, respectively, the infrared-red ratio R760/R660, the position lambda-re of the inflection point of R(lambda) at the red edge, the chromaticity point, and the initial and steady-state ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 685 nm and 730 nm are shown to indicate the degree of damage.  A quantitative comparison between the data obtained from the reflectance spectrum and the fluorescence measurements demonstrate that both methods provide a similar capability to distinguish between the trees of different damage classes.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIELECTRIC NEEDLES; SCATTERING
AB We have developed a discrete microwave scattering model, describing the radar backscattering coefficient from two treatments (burned and unburned) of tall prairie grass canopies at VV (electric field vector of the transmitted and received signals are vertically oriented) and HH (electric field vector of the transmitted and received signals and horizontally oriented) polarizations, based on the physical, biophysical, and geometrical characteristics of such canopies.  Grass blades are modeled as thin and finite dielectric ellipsoids with arbitrary orientations.  Scattering by an individual grass blade is formulated using a generalization of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation with a quasistatic solution for the expansion of the interior field.  By associating, with each grass blade, various appropriate distribution functions, the relative orientation, location, height, cross section, and permittivity of each grass blade is taken into account.  This makes for a more realistic overall description of the canopy.  Kirchhoff's surface scattering is used to model the backscatter from the soil surface.  An incoherent summation of the effect of grass blades and soil surface is adopted to obtain the total canopy backscattering coefficient, taking into account the attenutaion experienced by the signal as it travels through the canopy.  The results of this model are given for 1.5, 5, and 10 GHz (L-, C-, and X-band).  Although for the shorter wavelengths (X-band) the Rayleigh-Gans criteria is not totally satisfied, nevertheless, the limited available measured X-band data compare relatively well with the results of this model both quantitatively and qualitatively.

AB The Monte Carlo technique for estimating model parameters is presented.  The bidirectional reflectance factor is calculated by the Monte Carlo method of solving the integral equation of radiation transfer in plant canopies.  A general inversion technique for the estimation of canopy parameters is considered.  The method of calculating derivatives of the bidirectional reflectance factor with respect to unknown parameters using the same photon trajectories as in the solution of the direct problem is developed.  The leaf dimensions are taken into account using a new extinction coefficient.  Finally, numerical results for estimating three optical canopy parameters (coefficients of leaf reflectance, transmittance, and soil albedo) and four geometrical canopy parameters (leaf area index, two parameters of leaf angle distribution functions, and leaf size parameter) are briefly discussed.

AB The retrieval of continuous leaf area index (LAI) in space and time from remote sensing is beneficial for cropland monitoring and management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the advantages of all-weather operation and fine spatial resolutions has been utilized in various agricultural applications. Although the water cloud model (WCM) has been extensively used for LAI estimation over croplands, it is modified for application to crop canopies with large gaps. The requirement of prior information on soil moisture is also a hinderance for the model application. In this study, WCM is theoretically modified to consider the correlation of active microwave propagation through the canopy in downward and upward directions. Such a modification is particularly important for sparse vegetation with large gaps between crop plants in the early stage of the growing season. A parameter with explicit physical meaning, i.e. the full-vegetation backscattering coefficient, was defined to simplify our model scheme and make the model applicable for the whole growing season. In addition, a physicsbased SAR data processing scheme is developed to entangle the influences of LAI and soil moisture on SAR backscatter by taking advantage of the multiple polarizations of RADARSAT-2 (R2) SAR data. In this way, LAI was estimated using modified WCM without the prior knowledge of soil moisture. To evaluate LAI retrieved from the R2 datasets (R2 LAI), ground-based LAI measurements were made at the experimental area of SMAPVEX16MB in Canada with twenty approximately 800 m. 800 m plots in soybeans and corn. R2 LAI was well correlated to these ground-based LAI (n = 15, R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.99 m(2)center dot m-(2) for soybeans; n = 5, R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 1.20 m(2)center dot m(-2) for corn). LAI was also retrieved from optical data acquired by Sentinel-2/MSI (S2), denoted as S2 LAI. The R2 LAI and S2 LAI are well correlated and achieved coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and 0.71 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 1.1 and 1.4 m(2)center dot m(-2) for soybeans and corn, respectively. The seasonal variations of R2 LAI and S2 LAI are generally similar except at the end of the growing season when S2 LAI is considerably larger than R2 LAI. S2 LAI followed the trend of the reduction in leaf chlorophyll content, while R2 LAI reduced only slightly due to the decrease in leaf water content near the end the growing season. R-2 LAI represents the total standing leaf area useful for surface energy balance estimation, while S2 LAI responds to green leaf area useful for crop productivity modeling.

AB A number of global surface soil moisture (SM) datasets have been retrieved from the L-band frequency Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions to study the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. This paper presents the performance of the recently developed 9 km global SMAP product (hereafter SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX, SMAP-IB9). The product retrieves SM from the 9 km SMAP radiometric products using the forward model (L-MEB, L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) of SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) and SMOS L2 algorithms. We inter-compared SMAP-IB9 with two other products with a similar grid resolution (similar to 10 km): the SMAP Enhanced Level-3 SM dataset (SMAP-E) and the enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European reanalysis (ERA5-Land) with the main objective of assessing the discrepancy in accuracy between remotely sensed and model SM datasets. We found that ERA5-Land and SMAP-IB9 SM had the overall highest correlations (R = 0.62(+/- 0.15) for ERA5-Land vs. 0.60 (+/- 0.17) for SMAP-IB9 and 0.50(+/- 0.15) for SMAP-E) by comparing with the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in-situ measurements from 22 networks. ERA5-Land showed better performances in the forest areas where SMAP-IB9 and SMAP-E still showed high potential in detecting the time variations of the observed SM, particularly in terms of median correlation values (0.62(+/- 0.18) for SMAP-IB9 vs. 0.66(+/- 0.16) for ERA5-and). The discrepancy in R between satellite and model SM products that were reported in some past studies has decreased to statistically insignificant levels over time. For instance, in the non-forest areas, we found that the latest versions of the SMAP SM products (SMAP-E and SMAP-IB9) had relatively comparable performances with ERA5-Land with regard to median ubRMSE (0.07(+/- 0.02) m(3)/m(3) for both SMAP-E and ERA5-Land) and R (0.59 (+/- 0.16) for SMAP-IB9 vs. 0.61(+/- 0.15) for ERA5-Land), respectively.

AB The estimation of forest attributes representing aspects of structural biodiversity from vast areas is difficult not only because of the lack of agreement on what constitutes a structurally diverse forest, but also due to difficulties in the detection of small trees. However, a structurally diverse forest should have large variation in tree size (i.e., height and diameter), as well as some clustering of trees, as regular tree pattern is typical for managed forests. In this work we developed a framework for building structurally representative tree maps using airborne laser scanning data and a limited number of ground measurements using data from two locations in Finland. In the proposed method, an individual tree detection algorithm is optimized so that the number of undetected trees and false detections is minimized. The ground measurements are then used to train models for predicting the number and location of undetected trees and false detections by resampling the attributes of undetected trees in the training data. This model can then be applied to other areas in the proximity of the ground measurements to build tree maps, with the location, height, and diameter for each tree. The methodology was shown to reproduce the number of trees, the height distribution, and the spatial pattern of the trees with sufficient accuracy for practical use in large-scale mapping of forest attributes. For example, the individual tree detection could find at best about 54% of the trees with an additional 7% of false detections, resulting in a bias of approximately -30%, while with the new method the bias was reduced to +/- 10% of the stem density. Further research is needed on how to account for tree species when building tree maps.

AB This paper analyses the performance of SAR-based results to support emergency management operations during the volcanic crisis of La Palma island. Tajogaite eruption began on September 19th 2021 affecting a high populated area and the surrounding farmland, used for different agricultural purposes. SAR datasets obtained from Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMED, PAZ-TerraSAR-X and Capella satellites, were processed to calculate amplitude, coherence and differential interferograms. These results have permitted to map the morphology of the volcanic cone, the evolution of lava flows and the regional displacements. The comparison of the results obtained with the different satellites has been useful to understand their performance during an emergency scenario triggered by a volcanic eruption. COSMO-SkyMED has provided the most useful information for the analysis of the cone morphology and the lava flows. Sentinel-1 showed the best performance for regional displacements monitoring, whereas PAZ results was the second best option for all the retrieved products.

AB The distributed scatterer (DS) interferometry (DSI) technology is a powerful geodetic tool for measuring the deformation over abundant land covers. As a state-of-the-art DSI technology, the SqueeSAR approach considered the statistical behavior of the decorrelated DS and proposed the phase triangulation algorithm (PTA) as the pioneering implementation of the phase linking (PL) theory to estimate the equivalent single-reference (ESR) phases from all interferometric combinations. Subsequently, many advanced estimators of the systematic phase series have been introduced. Interestingly, this paper has demonstrated that the utilization of weakly coherent interferometric pairs is not conducive to the theoretical accuracy improvement of the PL theory in case of the fast decorrelation scenario. Moreover, the reduction of the small baseline scales will worsen the positive definite degree of the time series coherence matrix, which makes the ill-posed solution problem more serious. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel adaptive PL (AdpPL) method integrating the following two innovations for mapping surface deformation: 1) in terms of the interferometric pair selection optimization (IPSO), this paper performs the homogeneity measure-based IPSO (HoMeIPSO) method to remove the lowly coherent candidate subset progressively and select the moderate interferometric pairs adaptively; 2) in terms of the robust parameter estimation, an adaptive regularization (AdpReg) approach suggests selecting an optimal damping factor according to the minimum fitting error of all interferogram observables. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can restore the systematic phase series more clearly and detect the deformation area with spatially highly dynamic characteristics successfully.

AB Lakes comprise the largest element of terrestrial surface liquid freshwater bodies, playing an indispensable part in the Earth's water cycle and alleviating floods and droughts. The seasonal variation of lake water level (LWLsv) and storage (LWSsv) reflects the periodic hydrologic fluctuations and related driving forces of the water balances at the basin scale. China, a vastly diverse country that descends from the "Roof of the World" to monsoonal coast zones, hosts a wide distribution of lakes with diverse hydro-climatological and topographic features. Most previous studies focused on monitoring long-term changes of lakes in China, while the seasonality (mostly regarding the lake area) of lake hydrologic dynamics was only investigated for typical lakes or local basins/zones due to the limited spatial coverage and temporal resolution of various observation data. Benefiting from the finer footprints and increased beams of ICESat-2 laser altimeter, we examined the seasonal variations of LWLsv of Chinese lakes (3473 lakes historically larger than 1 km2 during the 1980s-2010s) on a national scale from 2019 to 2021. Then, the machine learning algorithm termed the extreme gradient boosting tree was employed to model the LWLsv of the lakes that were not monitored by ICESat-2. We further quantized the national-scale LWSsv by combining the LWLsv estimates and lake area data. Results show that the mean LWLsv of the 1255 lakes observed by ICESat-2 during 2019-2021 is 0.44 & PLUSMN; 0.07 m. Among them, 1167 lakes have the LWLsv <1 m, and 12 lakes have the LWLsv exceeding 3 m. The accuracy evaluation indicates that the XGBoost model performs well in predicting LWLsv results for unobserved lakes, with the coefficient of determination of 0.76, the mean absolute error of 0.14 m, and the root mean square error of 0.03 m. Overall, the predicted LWLsv of unobserved lakes has a similar spatial pattern to that of the observed lakes. The LWSsv is estimated at 77.29 & PLUSMN; 6.87 Gt in total, but exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity in China. The Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Basin and the endorheic Qiangtang Plateau Basin rank the first two contributors of the net LWSsv, which were respectively attributed to the most significant LWLsv changes and the largest lake group area. This national-scale quantification of the LWLsv and LWSsv helps advance our scientific understanding of the seasonal hydrologic behaviors for Chinese lakes in regulating the water cycle and providing a valuable reference for regional water resource management.

AB Dense time-series high-resolution satellite images are extremely valuable for long-term monitoring of land dynamics. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) techniques have been developed to integrate multi-resolution satellite images to produce data with high spatial resolution and temporal frequency. Due to the large volume and diversity of higher resolution global Earth Observation (EO) data, large-scale data processing methods need to be computationally efficient, free of parameter fine-tuning, and adaptive to various data structures without process customization. These requirements are especially critical for the production of global Seamless Data Cube (SDC). Considering the limitations of existing STF methods, we propose a ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model that exploits time-series information to obtain more accurate predictions. ROBOT maintains stable under varied data conditions by adopting a temporal-coherence regularization term. And being free of parameter tuning, ROBOT can be applied to arbitrary spatiotemporally distributed data without repetitive process customization. Its performance was compared with eight representative STF methods. Results show that ROBOT outperforms existing STF methods in most cases and is computationally efficient, about 4000-fold faster than ESTARFM and 600-fold faster than FSDAF. The proposed method has demonstrated its potential for global-scale SDC generation to support subsequent remote sensing applications.

AB Thermal radiation directionality (TRD) characterizes the anisotropic signature of most surface targets in the thermal infrared domain. It causes significant uncertainties in estimating surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) from space observations. In this regard, kernel-driven models (KDMs) are suitable to remove TRD effects from remote sensing dataset as they are computationally efficient. However, KDMs requires simultaneous multiangle observations as inputs to be well calibrated, which yields a difficulty with geostationary satellites as they can only provide a single-angle observation. To overcome this issue, we proposed a six-parameter time-evolving KDM that combines a four-parameter SULR diurnal variation model and a two-parameter TRD amplitude model to correct the TRD effect for single-angle estimated SULR dataset of geostationary satellites. The significant daytime TRD effect when solar zenith angle is within 60 degrees can be effectively eliminated. The modeling accuracy of the time-evolving KDM is evaluated using a simulated SULR dataset generated by the 3D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model; the TRD correction method based on the new time-evolving KDM is validated using a two-year single-angle estimated SULR dataset derived from data of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) against in situ measurements at 20 AmeriFlux sites. Results show that the proposed time-evolving KDM has a high accuracy with an R2 > 0.999 and a small RMSE = 1.5 W/m2; the TRD correction method based on the time-evolving KDM can greatly reduce the GOES-16 SULR uncertainty caused by the TRD effect with an RMSE decrease of 4.5 W/m2 (22.1%) and mean bias error decrease of 7.9 W/m2 (62.7%). Hence, the proposed TRD correction method is practically efficient for the operational TRD correction of SULR products generated from the geostationary satellites (e.g., GOES-16, FY-4A, Himawari-8, MSG).

AB Satellite altimetry has been widely used to determine the marine gravity fields. Different altimeter missions lead to different gravity grids with varying spatial resolutions and accuracies. Marine gravity accuracy in offshore waters is often low. Integrating marine gravity anomalies (MGA) derived from various altimeter missions are key to obtaining high-precision and high-resolution global marine gravity fields. Here an improved triple collocation (ITC) method is first proposed to establish a new 1 ' x1 ' marine gravity anomaly in the South China Sea (SCS), named MGAITC, by merging the grids of MGA from the Haiyang-2A (HY-2A), CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2 altimeter measurements. A combined MGA (MGACOM) is also constructed by using the least squares collocation (LSC) method from three sets of altimeter-derived geoid gradients. The qualities of MGAITC, MGACOM and each altimeter-derived MGA grids are assessed using shipborne gravity and different global gravity models over waters of varying depths and distances from the coastline. The accuracy of the MGAITC gravity against the shipborne gravity is 5.52 mGal, which represents improvements of 7%, 9%, 13%, and 3% relative to the gravity grids derived only from ICESat-2, CryoSat-2, HY-2A and from MGACOM. In all assessments involving different subregions, seafloors, and distances from the coastline, MGAITC performs the best, and ICESat-2 yields the best single-mission MGA grid, especially in offshore waters. We find that ICESat-2 has a high potential to improve shallow-water gravity accuracy and the global marine gravity field can be improved by integrating gravity grids from different altimetry missions using ITC.

AB Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an effective tool for measuring large-scale land subsidence. However, the measurement points generated by InSAR are too many to be manually analyzed, and automatic subsidence detection and classification methods are still lacking. In this study, we developed an oriented R-CNN deep learning network to automatically detect and classify subsidence bowls using InSAR measurements and multi-source ancillary data. We used 541 Sentinel-1 images acquired during 2015-2021 to map land subsidence of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area by resolving persistent and distributed scatterers. Multi-source data related to land subsidence, including geological and lithological, land cover, topographic, and climatic data, were incorporated into deep learning, allowing the local subsidence to be classified into seven categories. The results showed that the oriented R-CNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.847 for subsidence detection and a mean AP (mAP) of 0.798 for subsidence classi-fication, which outperformed the other three state-of-the-art methods (Rotated RetinaNet, R3Det, and ReDet). An independent effect analysis showed that incorporating all datasets improved the AP by 11.2% for detection and the mAP by 73.9% for classification, respectively, compared with using InSAR measurements only. Combining InSAR measurements with globally available land cover and digital elevation model data improved the AP for subsidence detection to 0.822, suggesting that our methods can be potentially transferred to other regions, which was further validated this using a new dataset in Shanghai. These results improve the understanding of deltaic subsidence and facilitate geohazard assessment and management for sustainable environments.

AB Satellite remote sensing technology provides a promising means for near real-time monitoring of crop water status and requirements in agricultural and hydrological applications. Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided by ever-increasing drone-and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally demanding than the LST-VI model.

AB The persistent land subsidence in the Beijing Plain induced by the massive exploitation of groundwater caused significant decreases in ground elevation and damages to buildings and civil infrastructures. Although various satellite SAR datasets have been analyzed to monitor subsidence in the Beijing Plain, no multi-decadal scale deformation measurement has been derived from multi-sensor InSAR results, and the recent deceleration of land subsidence or even uplift remains unclear. This study retrieved land subsidence measurements over the past three decades (1992-2022) by integrating multi-sensor C-band InSAR measurements into a logistic model. The cu-mulative subsidence presented three major subsidence funnels surrounding downtown in the North, Northeast, and East, with the maximum vertical displacement as high as 1.98 m in the Chaoyang District. The land sub-sidence positively responded to the changes in groundwater depth, showing a clear deceleration since 2016. After five and half years, it became almost stagnated within the context of continuous groundwater recovery, which implied the delayed compaction of lowly draining aquitards. Only slight residual subsidence persisted in Chaoyang, Shunyi, and Daxing Districts. Meanwhile, land uplift happened in Shunyi, Huairou, and Pinggu Districts. Remarkably, a portion of the land subsidence in the Chaobai Plain reversed to uplift due to multiple artificial recharges using diverted water. Although groundwater storage could recover significantly in the next decade, most severely sunken lands and inelastically compacted aquitards are irrecoverable, leading to a per-manent loss of storage capacity in the Beijing Plain. This study provides scientific data support for the local government decision-maker to better manage groundwater resources and mitigate land subsidence, which pre-sents a typical example of monitoring long-term land subsidence in similar global megacities.

AB The upper elevational limits of vegetation growth in global high-mountains have been the focus for monitoring and assessment of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. However, existing studies have relied on field surveys that do not allow for large-scale analysis. Although remote sensing data have been used for local and regional monitoring of the vegetation upper boundaries, a global synthesis of the treeline and vegetation line (the upper altitudinal threshold for the existence of trees and the transition line from vegetation to bare land or permanent snow cover, respectively) in high-mountain ecosystems is still missing. To fill this gap, we developed two independent methods based on (1) the relationship between a Sentinel-2 vegetation index and elevation and (2) the European Space Agency's 10 m resolution land cover dataset (WorldCover), respectively, to automatically identify the upper elevational limits of treeline and vegetation line for each one-quarter degree grid across the global high-mountain areas. We obtained highly consistent results from the two methods, both of which are spatially consistent with ground surveyed treeline elevations. Our results are in line with the current understanding of the global distributions of tree and vegetation lines, which are observed at the highest elevations in the Tibetan plateau and decreasing for increasing latitudes. We find that the tree and vegetation lines are aspect dependent, reaching higher elevations on the equatorial-facing slopes than on the polar-facing slopes in high latitudes, and the opposite in the middle latitudes. Our analysis shows that mountain height is the dominant factor in determining the upper elevational limits of tree and vegetation lines across the globe, while climatic conditions and soil properties also play important roles at regional scales. Our study provides a framework for monitoring the tree and vegetation lines in global high-mountains and provides an important benchmark for further examining their long-term changes in response to climate change.

AB Increasing air temperatures and associated permafrost thaw in Arctic river watersheds, such as the Mackenzie River catchment, are directly affecting the aquatic environment. As a consequence, the quantity and the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is transported via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean is expected to change. Particularly in these remote permafrost regions of the Arctic, monitoring of terrigenous organic carbon fluxes is insufficient and knowledge of distribution and fate of organic carbon when released to the coastal waters is remarkably lacking. Despite its poorly evaluated performance in Arctic coastal waters, Satellite Ocean Colour Remote Sensing (SOCRS) remains a powerful tool to complement monitoring of land-ocean DOC fluxes, detect their trends, and help in understanding their propagation in the Arctic Ocean.In this study, we use in situ and SOCRS data to show the strong seasonal dynamics of the Mackenzie River plume and the spatial distribution of associated terrigenous DOC on the Beaufort Sea Shelf for the first time. Using a dataset collected during an extensive field campaign in 2019, the performance of three commonly-used atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms and two available colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) retrieval algorithms were evaluated using the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Our results showed that in optically-complex Arctic coastal waters the Polymer AC algorithm performed the best. For the retrieval of CDOM, the gsmA algorithm (Mean Percentage Error (MPE) = 35.7%) showed slightly more consistent results compared to the ONNS algorithm (MPE = 37.9%). By merging our measurements with published datasets, the newly -established DOC-CDOM relationship for the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region allowed estimations of DOC con-centrations from SOCRS across the entire fluvial-marine transition zone with an MPE of 20.5%. Finally, we applied SOCRS with data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor to illustrate the seasonal variation of DOC concen-trations in the surface waters of the Beaufort Sea on a large spatial scales and high frequency throughout the entire open water period. Highest DOC concentrations and largest lateral extent of the plume were observed in spring right after the Mackenzie River ice break-up indicating that the freshet was the main driver of plume propagation and DOC distribution on the shelf. Satellite-derived images of surface water DOC concentration placed the in situ observations into a larger temporal and spatial context and revealed a strong seasonal vari-ability in transport pathways of DOC in the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region.

AB A novel automated approach for mapping nonurban flood extents using satellite-based Sentinel-1C-band SAR data is presented and applied in the Republic of Ireland. The methodology mapped the maximum flood extent of over 25,000 detected water bodies across Ireland over a five-year period (2016-2021). Flood extents were classified using a semi-automatic tile-based histogram thresholding approach and refined using a series of post processing filters. These included multi-temporal filters which exploited the timing and orbit position of the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify likely false positives, and contextual information based filters which used external information such as topography and land use to estimate the likelihood of flooding and constrain its extent. A topographic correction algorithm was also applied to hydrologically-correct flood bodies. The methodology produced a user accuracy of above 0.95 for each annual map when compared to observed flood level data, overall accuracy values above 0.97 and kp values above 0.7 when compared to mapping process based on Sentinel-2 validation imagery, and the capacity to detect over 90% of recorded permanent water bodies larger than 2 ha. As an additional step, confidence information was provided for each flood polygon based on the quantity of consistently flooded pixels used in its definition. The mapping process represents a stable and systematic nonurban flood mapping methodology that enables inter-annual comparison of flood extent at gauged and ungauged sites.

AB Fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2ff), the main driver of global warming and climate change, is often co-emitted with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and precursors to ground-level ozone from anthropogenic sources like power plants or vehicles. In urban and suburban areas, satellite-based NO2 can be used as a proxy to track the emissions of CO2ff. Because of NO2's shorter lifetime, urban NO2 plumes are more distinguishable from backgrounds and more sensitive to variations in emissions. However, the combination of these two gases is limited by the asynchrony among NO2 and CO2 monitoring satellites. We used CO2ff simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to reconcile the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) from Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide enhancements (Delta XCO2) from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) Snapshot Area Maps (SAMs) over a multicity area, Washington D.C.-Baltimore (DC-Balt), and a basin city, Mexico City. NO2/CO2ff ratios over DC-Balt are smaller than Mexico City, indicative of stricter emission restrictions, a more combustionefficient vehicle fleet, and higher combustion efficiency due to lower altitude in DC-Balt. For single-track cases, the spatial correlations between NO2 and Delta XCO2 over Mexico City are stronger than DC-Balt because the NO2 and CO2 are mostly trapped in the valley of Mexico City, while DC-Balt is severely affected by distant sources (i. e., US East Coast cities). Using multi-track averaging, spatial correlation coefficients increase with the number of days used for averaging. The correlations reached a maximum when averaging >12 continuous images for DCBalt and >10 continuous images for Mexico City. This finding indicates that multi-track averaging using modeled CO2ff as a proxy is helpful to filter the noise in single-track images, to cancel the interference from distant sources, and to magnify correlations between NO2 and CO2ff. Mexico City showed stronger spatial correlations but weaker temporal correlations than DC-Balt due to biomass burning hot spots and large transport errors caused by the trapping effects of the surrounding mountains. Tracking the 20-day moving average of CO2ff emissions using TROPOMI NO2 seems technically feasible, considering the relationship between correlation coefficients and the number of available satellite images.

AB Restoration of temperate forests alters the diurnal dynamics of land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) through increases in biomass, diversity, and complexity. The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) is the first space-based thermal imaging instrument that allows for a study of diurnal LST and ET dynamics at a moderate spatial resolution (70 x 70 m).
   We quantified, compared, and modeled the LST and ET dynamics of two groups of forest restoration sites (43 sites in total, between 2 and 75 ha) in Southern Ontario, Canada that were initially restored from mainly agriculture between 2007 and 2019. We included all useable LST (n = 29) and ET (n = 9) ECOSTRESS image products from a full growing season in 2020 (June 1st to September 30th). Forest restoration sites were compared by age and against agriculture (pre-restoration state), mature forest (post-restoration state), and suburban residential sites (competing land use).
   The ability of forest restoration sites to buffer temperatures was highest in the afternoon, around 14:00 local time (EDT). As predicted, restoration sites were significantly cooler ((x) over bar 4.4-7.4 degrees C) than residential and agricultural areas and significantly warmer (x.1.6-2.9 degrees C) compared to mature reference forest sites at both groups of sites. Relative diurnal (24-h) LST variability of forest and restoration sites was also significantly lower (0.9-2.9 degrees C) compared to agriculture and residential sites (3.3-5.2 degrees C). Daytime LST decreased significantly by 0.1 degrees C (3.1%), per year since restoration for one of the groups of sites relative to nearby mature reference forest sites as per a linear mixed effects regression model. It would take these sites similar to 30 years to reach the same buffering as mature forests. In characterizing ET dynamics of a subset of sites, we found that more recently restored sites had a statistically significant higher overall ET than older ones and that daytime relative instantaneous ET decreased with years since restoration. The variation explained by the ET model was however low.
   Our study provides insights into how diurnal forest ecosystem energy conversion and storage dynamics changes over time after restoration. These diurnal thermal dynamics impact wildlife habitat as well as human wellbeing. The change in thermal buffering over time could be used to assess the pace and trajectory of restoration by managers. The thermal buffering provided by restored forest can also be quantified as an ecosystem service. As such, the study demonstrates the utility and also limitations of novel thermal remote sensing methods, using free and publicly available imagery from ECOSTRESS.

AB Post monsoonal agricultural Crop Residue Burning (CRB) over northwestern India is believed to severely affect the air quality of the megacity of Delhi. However, the mechanistic understanding remains elusive. Long-term satellite observations (2007-2020) of aerosol properties during CRB season (Oct 20th to Nov 20th) indicate a distinct airshed of CRB plume transport from Northwestern India (source region) to greater Delhi (downwind region). Theoretically, the smoke concentration should disperse downwind, and the CRB-associated PM2.5 enhancement over Northern India should be inversely proportional to the distance from the CRB source region. However, the in-situ PM2.5 observations illustrate that smoke-associated enhancement in PM2.5 over greater Delhi (downwind region) is disproportionately large compared to the source region. In this study, we examine satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based observations along with reanalysis data to provide robust evidence that aerosol-boundary layer - PM2.5 associations via semi-direct effect can explain the above heterogeneity. Vertically resolved satellite observations indicate that as the emitted CRB-smoke plumes travel downwind, a portion of the transported smoke plume injected relatively at a higher altitude leads to the formation of an elevated smoke layer over greater Delhi. These elevated smoke layers tend to suppress the mixing height via inducing strong temperature inversion, thereby severely constraining the daytime dilution effect of shallow boundary layers. Along with direct advection of smoke particles, enhanced accumulation of local urban emissions due to these semi-direct impacts can lead to the observed disproportionate PM2.5 enhancements over Delhi during CRB haze periods. Thus, control of the local anthropogenic emissions could bring relief during the extreme haze episodes over Delhi.

TI Improving soil moisture assimilation efficiency via model calibration

ID SIMULATION; FRAMEWORK; PRODUCTS
AB To minimize systematic differences between soil moisture (SM) time series derived from remote sensing (RS) and land surface model (LSM), RS-based SM climatology information is typically discarded during land data assimilation (DA). However, recent studies have demonstrated that SM climatology estimates provided by L-band microwave RS retrievals can significantly outperform comparable estimates derived from LSMs. Consequently, neglecting a RS-based SM climatology may lead to degraded SM spatial patterns generated by land DA. Here, we propose a climatology-optimized SM DA framework, which first calibrates LSM parameters to leverage the RS SM climatology information. Next, multi-sensor RS SM retrievals are assimilated into the calibrated LSM using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). This framework is demonstrated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and RS SM retrievals derived from the L-band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and C-band Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) sensors. Here, both SMAP and ASCAT SM retrievals are assimilated into the VIC model after calibrating VIC to match spatial variations captured in the SMAP SM climatology. The DA SM results are validated using in-situ SM observations derived from 820 stations. Results show that SMAP-based SM clima-tology calibration directly improves the quality of SM spatial patterns estimated by VIC. In addition, the SMAP-based calibration also benefits our model-error representation and thereby yields better Kalman gains that improve temporal SM DA accuracy. Relative to typical DA approaches, this newly proposed DA framework improves both spatial (0.26 versus 0.51 (-)) and temporal correlations (0.48 versus 0.52 (-)) versus in-situ SM observations. In addition, SM improvements are effectively propagated into improved streamflow estimates - leading to an average increase of Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient from 0.74 to 0.76 (-). Overall, we demonstrate that RS SM climatology information is valuable for land DA and our climatology-optimized framework suc-cessfully retains such information to the benefit of land DA performance.

AB Predicting long-term ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is important globally to support environmental and public health research and to provide information to governments and society for air pollution control policies. The ozone monitoring instrument (OMI), onboard Aura Satellite, detects monthly global tropospheric column amounts (TrCA) of NO2 molecules. However, the relationship between the ground-level NO2 concentration and TrCA of NO2 molecules remains elusive because NO2 molecules in the air are not evenly distributed vertically. We use geographically weighted panel regression (GWPR) to examine the relationship between satellite-derived data, measured ground-level NO2 concentrations, and several controlling meteorological variables from January 2015 to October 2021. The GWPR can analyze unbalanced panel data and capture the spatial variability of the relationship. Based on the GWPR estimation, 82 monthly global ground-level NO2 concentrations are predicted from January 2015 to October 2021. The GWPR is reliable, as indicated by the 10-fold cross-validation. The accuracy of the raster prediction of global ground-level NO2 from January 2015 to October 2021 is 69.61%. The coefficient of correlation, root mean square error and mean absolute error between globally predicted and measured ground-level NO2 are 0.838, 7.84 Ag/m3 and 4.07 Ag/m3, respectively, while the mean of globally measured ground-level NO2 is 19.47 Ag/m3. Overall, this research provides critical basic data to environmental and public health science and valuable information for governments and societies to make more reasonable policies.

AB Accurate classification of individual tree species is essential for inventorying, managing, and protecting forest resources. Individual tree species classification in subtropical forests remains challenging as existing individual tree segmentation algorithms typically result in over-segmentation in subtropical broadleaf forests, in which tree crowns often have multiple peaks. In this study, we proposed a watershed-spectral-texture-controlled normalized cut (WST-Ncut) algorithm, and applied it to delineate individual trees in a subtropical broadleaf forest situated in Shenzhen City of southern China (114 degrees 23 ' 28 '' E, 22 degrees 43 ' 50 '' N). Using this algorithm, we first obtained accurate crown boundary of individual broadleaf trees. We then extracted different suites of vertical structural, spectral, and textural features from UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data, and used these features as inputs to a random forest classifier to classify 18 tree species. The results showed that the proposed WST-Ncut algorithm could reduce the over-segmentation of the watershed segmentation algorithm, and thereby was effective for delineating individual trees in subtropical broadleaf forests (Recall = 0.95, Precision = 0.86, and F-score = 0.91). Combining the structural, spectral, and textural features of individual trees provided the best tree species classification results, with overall accuracy reaching 91.8%, which was 10.2%, 13.6%, and 19.0% higher than that of using spectral, structural, and textural features alone, respectively. In addition, results showed that better individual tree segmentation would lead to higher accuracy of tree species classification, but the increase of the number of tree species would result in the decline of classification accuracy.

AB The use of night-time livestock enclosures, often referred to as "bomas ", "corrals ", or "kraals ", is a common practice across African rangelands. Bomas protect livestock from predation by wildlife and potential theft. Due to the concentration of animal faeces inside bomas, they not only become nutrient-rich patches that can add to biodiversity, but also hotspots for the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas, especially when animals are kept inside for long periods. To provide an accurate estimate of such emissions for wider landscapes, bomas need to be accounted for. Moreover, initial experiments indicated that more frequent shifts in the boma locations could help to reduce N2O emissions. This stresses the need for better understanding where bomas are located, their numbers, as well as when they are actively used. Given the recent advances in satellite technology, resulting in high-frequent spectral measurements at fine spatial resolution, solutions to address these needs are now within reach. This study is a first effort to map and monitor the appearance of bomas with the use of satellite image time series. Our main dataset was a dense times series of 3 m resolution PlanetScope multi -spectral imagery. In addition, a reference dataset of boma and non-boma locations was created using GPS-collar tracking data and 0.5 m resolution Pleiades imagery. The reduction of vegetation cover and increase of organic material following boma installation result in typical spectral changes when contrasted against its surroundings. Based on these spectral changes we devised an empirical approach to infer approximate boma installation dates from PlanetScope's near infrared (NIR) band and used our reference dataset for setting optimal parameter values. A NIR spatial difference index resulted in clear temporal patterns, which were more apparent during the wet season. At landscape scale our approach reveals clear spatio-temporal patterns of boma installation, which could not be revealed from less frequent sub-meter resolution imagery alone. While further improvements are possible, we show that small-sized (150-500 m(2)) temporary surface changes, such as those that occur when pastoralists use mobile bomas, can be detected with dense image time series like those offered by the PlanetScope constellation. In future, this could lead to better assessment of a) spatio-temporal livestock distribution, b) the contribution of bomas to N2O emissions and soil fertility at landscape scale, and c) the uptake of enclosure rotation practices at large spatial scales.

AB Large errors in Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) tied to remote-sensing retrieval algorithms remain a challenge especially in complex terrain with fast hydrologic response. We propose a new framework to derive dynamic hydrologic corrections of rainfall in headwater basins that enforces water budget closure, and distributes transient rainfall corrections by Lagrangian backtracking along runoff trajectories constrained by realistic time-of-travel distributions. Downscaled QPE products (250 m resolution) are applied first as input to a distributed hydrologic model to predict runoff trajectories and the event hydrograph at the basin's outlet. Second, time-varying rainfall corrections are derived from the residuals between predicted and observed discharge at the outlet. Finally, the corrections are spatially distributed following the runoff trajectories backward (i.e. trajectories are used as streaklines originating at the basin's outlet). Because nonlinear interactions between rainfall, runoff and storage are transient, the corrections are applied recursively until the shape and volume of the predicted hydrograph are stable. The framework is applied to ground-based (e.g. Stage IV) and satellite-based remote-sensing QPEs (e.g. IMERG) associated with the 49 largest floods 2008-2018 in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. The results show improvements in hydrograph prediction efficiency skill at 15 min timescale from-0.5 to 0.6 on average and up to 0.9 for warm season events, bounding event runoff volume errors with a mean of 3%, and reducing time to peak errors by half an hour on average. Corrected QPEs exhibit nearly perfect correlation and no bias at high elevation gauge locations. Uncertainty in the water budget closure at the event scale is less than the uncertainty in streamflow measurements. Error attribution shows strong organization of QPE corrections according to seasonal weather and rainfall regime, thus providing a path to generalization to ungauged mountain basins.

AB The Amazon River basin harbors some of the world's largest wetland complexes, which are of major importance for biodiversity, the water cycle and climate, and human activities. Accurate estimates of inundation extent and its variations across spatial and temporal scales are therefore fundamental to understand and manage the basin's resources. More than fifty inundation estimates have been generated for this region, yet major differences exist among the datasets, and a comprehensive assessment of them is lacking. Here we present an intercomparison of 29 inundation datasets for the Amazon basin, based on remote sensing only, hydrological modeling, or multisource datasets, with 18 covering the lowland Amazon basin (elevation <500 m, which includes most Amazon wetlands), and 11 covering individual wetland complexes (subregional datasets). Spatial resolutions range from 12.5 m to 25 km, and temporal resolution from static to monthly, spanning up to a few decades. Overall, 31% of the lowland basin is estimated as subject to inundation by at least one dataset. The long-term maximum inundated area across the lowland basin is estimated at 599,700 +/- 81,800 km2 if considering the three higher quality SAR-based datasets, and 490,300 +/- 204,800 km2 if considering all 18 datasets. However, even the highest resolution SAR-based dataset underestimates the maximum values for individual wetland complexes, suggesting a basin-scale underestimation of ~10%. The minimum inundation extent shows greater disagreements among datasets than the maximum extent: 139,300 +/- 127,800 km2 for SAR-based ones and 112,392 +/- 79,300 km2 for all datasets. Discrepancies arise from differences among sensors, time periods, dates of acquisition, spatial resolution, and data processing algorithms. The median total area subject to inundation in medium to large river floodplains (drainage area > 1000 km2) is 323,700 km2. The highest spatial agreement is observed for floodplains dominated by open water such as along the lower Amazon River, whereas intermediate agreement is found along major vegetated floodplains fringing larger rivers (e.g., Amazon mainstem floodplain). Especially large disagreements exist among estimates for interfluvial wetlands (Llanos de Moxos, Pacaya-Samiria, Negro, Roraima), where inundation tends to be shallower and more variable in time. Our data intercomparison.

AB By characterizing high-frequency surface thermal dynamics at a medium spatial scale, hourly land surface temperatures (LST), retrieved from geostationary satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations, shows great potential to be used across a range of scientific applications; however, cloud cover typically leads to data gaps and degraded retrieval accuracy in TIR LST products, such as the official Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) LST product. Studies have focused on the LST gap reconstruction; however, most interpolation-based methods only work for a short-term cloud duration and are unable to adequately compensate for cloud effects, and traditional surface energy balance (SEB)-based methods are able to handle cloud coverage while they are not feasible for use at night. Moreover, few studies have concentrated on recovering the abnormal retrievals of partial cloud pixels. In this study, an all-sky diurnal, hourly LST estimation method based on SEB theory was proposed; the proposed method involved three major steps: 1) an original spatiotemporal dynamic model of LST was constructed from ECMWF Reanalysis v.5 (ERA5); 2) clear-sky ABI LST was then assimilated to the dynamic model to generate a continuous LST series; 3) the diurnal cloud effects were superimposed on cloudy time estimated by an innovative optimization method from satellite radiation products. A 2-km, all-sky, hourly LST product was produced over the contiguous US and Mexico from July 2017 to June 2021. Validation was conducted using ground measurements at 18 sites from Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) and core AmeriFlux networks, and produced an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.44 K, a bias of-0.19 K, and an R-2 of 0.97 based on 408,300 samples. For clear-sky samples, the RMSE values were 2.37 and 2.24 K for day and nighttime, respectively, which was a notable improvement over the corresponding values of the official ABI LST product (2.73 and 2.86 K, respectively). The RMSE values on cloudy-sky were 2.78 and 2.23 K for day and nighttime, respectively. The daily mean LST by aggregating all-sky, hourly LST had an RMSE of 1.13 K and R-2 of 0.99. Overall, this product showed reliability under consistent cloud durations, although it was slightly affected by surface elevation. The diurnal temperature cycle climatology of major land cover types was also characterized. The product is freely available at: http://glass.umd.edu/allsky_LST/ABI/.

AB Climate oscillations with seasonal and longer periods drive surface water cycles and quasi-cycles at regional and global scales. Changes in terrestrial water storage produce responses in the Earth's gravitational field and crustal deformation. Here, we use techniques from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to reveal a normal pattern of inter-annual fluctuations in the water level in the North American Great Lakes (GL). The GRACE-estimated time series was in good agreement with in situ water level measurements from 2002 to 2018, especially in terms of phases. The amplitude of 3-4 inter-annual signals in water thickness was 4-6 cm, which is equivalent to a 50-75 km(3) oscillation in surface water volume within the entire GL. The slightly larger annual and inter-annual fluctuation amplitudes estimated using GRACE data indicate that the aquifer system of the GL and its surroundings also contributes to seasonal mass changes. After 2013, water levels in the GL region rose abruptly, and the water mass increased by nearly 270 km(3) until the end of 2018. We also used GPS-and GRACE-derived three-component displacements (vertical, northward, and eastward) to identify load patterns. GPS-and GRACE-estimated maximum probability source directions based on multi-channel singular spectrum analysis showed that most of the selected GPS sites point to the GL region, although the direction deviations of GPS results at a few sites are mainly caused by the combined effect of the local load and superposition of the distant GL. Our findings indicate that inter-annual displacement changes at different frequencies (1-to 8-year cycle) are primarily due to water volume fluctuations in the GL. The amplitudes estimated by GPS are greater than the GRACE-based and GL-modeled results at most stations, which reflects sensitivity differences between these geodetic solutions to the surface load, as hydrological processes in the local area around a station are difficult to identify using GRACE data with a resolution of similar to 300 km.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring sea states in terms of the significant wave height (SWH). Regarding the specific wave mode, to date, the previous empirical models for estimating SWH from SAR data rely on single polarization. In the emerging deep learning era, few published quad-polarized SAR SWH retrieval algorithms have been based on machine learning technique, and whether quad-polarimetry improves the skill of wave height estimation remains a question. Here we propose a deep residual convolutional neural network-based SAR SWH retrieval algorithm in quad-polarization. By collocating WaveWatch III sea state hindcasts and all available archives of quad-polarized Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagettes in wave mode, a database with approximately 30,000 matchups was employed to establish our deeply-learned network. The GaoFen-3 significant wave height retrievals were validated against the hindcast dataset independent of training along with altimeter observations. The result of good consistency in terms of a root mean square error of 0.32 m (under sea state conditions of approximately 0.5-7.0 m) outperforms the existing Gaofen-3 wave height retrieval algorithms. Additionally, this paper introduces a discussion about the contribution of polarizations by comparing SWH derived from single-, dual-and quad-polarized deep convolutional neural networks. Single-polarized Gaofen-3 SAR data are found to be sufficient to provide accurate estimates compared to quad-polarization via a deep learning model under moderate sea conditions. Exploitation of SAR quad-polarimetry information will improve SAR wave height retrievals under high sea conditions.

AB Accurate urban land-use maps, which reflect the complicated land-use pattern implied in the function and distribution of land-cover types, play an important role in urban analysis. In recent years, data-driven deep learningbased land-use mapping methods have made great breakthroughs due to their strong feature extraction ability. Meanwhile, multisource geographic data, such as open street map (OSM), has been applied in land-use mapping with high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSR) imagery. Nevertheless, given the intraclass visual inconsistency and interclass label ambiguity, there are enormous challenges in OSM-based land-use pattern depiction: 1) the significant size variability of land-use parcel generated by OSM; 2) the weak interpretability of the datadriven based features; and 3) the neglect of intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between landcover and land-use. In this paper, to bridge the "knowledge gap" for urban land-use mapping, a knowledgeguided land pattern depicting (KGLPD) framework is proposed. The proposed KGLPD framework mainly contains four parts. Land-use parcels with various scales are generated based on OSM. An adaptive gradient perceptive (AGP) mechanism is proposed to provide patch distribution prior knowledge for guiding the datadriven based visual feature extraction. To effectively cognize the layout of different land-cover types as the knowledge-driven information, a land pattern cognitive (LPC) model is designed to capture the inner and outer relationships (i.e., direction, distance and co-frequency) of different land-cover types. The fully sparse topic model (FSTM) is then used to extract the critical land pattern information from the data-driven and knowledgedriven information. Four typical Chinese urban cities are selected to evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results on three cities with four regions of distinctive characteristics in different years, have achieved high classification accuracies of about 80%, with 10% improvement compared with other methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed knowledge-guided urban land use mapping framework. Experimental results on the whole city of Shenzhen in China imply that the proposed framework perform well with small training samples. The results on different cities validate the generalizability and transferability of KGLPD. The typical land-use maps and the corresponding land-cover maps help understanding the relationship between them.

AB The Hapke bidirectional reflectance model has mainly been used in planetary remote sensing and has given rise to some studies in Earth science. However, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated using data from different sources, and its ability to model reflectance spectra needs to be further explored. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a tangible parametric model of soil hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance via the evaluation and extension of the Hapke model (hereafter named the Hapke-HSR model). Comprehensive directional and spectral soil reflectance datasets, including satellite, field data, two spectral libraries, and simulated reflectance spectra, were used. First, the two widely used versions of the Hapke model, namely, the SOILSPECT and original Hapke models, were compared. Thereafter, the simplified SOILSPECT model was extended to characterize soil hyperspectral reflectance by deriving an approximate relationship between the single-scattering albedo and wavelength. We obtained the following results. (1) Both versions of the Hapke model agreed well in fitting soil bidirectional reflectance data. However, the SOILSPECT model (R-2 = 0.983-0.997, RMSE = 0.007-0.014) performed better than the original Hapke model (R-2 = 0.800-0.988, RMSE = 0.014-0.057) when both satellite and field data were used. (2) The Hapke-HSR model could effectively capture the characteristics of the soil hyperspectral reflectance (R-2 = 0.963-0.983 and RMSE = 0.018-0.028) based on both spectral libraries. The simulated reflectance spectra showed that the Hapke-HSR model can capture the soil moisture content variations (R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.011). In addition, the residual prediction deviation (RPD) values of the Hapke-HSR model were greater than 3, indicating a high prediction accuracy. These findings demonstrate that the Hapke-HSR model performs well with respect to the characterization of soil hyperspectral directional reflectance.

AB As an urban heat island (UHI) is closely associated with a wide variety of environmental issues, it is necessary to monitor its spatiotemporal variations in an accurate and timely manner. However, the accuracy of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) estimation is greatly challenged by three issues. Namely, less attention has been given to city-based global studies, LSUHII (SUHII difference) is induced when various methods are used to the determine background reference, and uncertainty arises in the methods for coping with missing land surface temperature (LST). Thus, this paper quantitatively evaluated these different methods and their impacts on spatiotemporal SUHII variations across 1112 global cities. There are two major findings: (1) the modified equal area-rural (MEA-R) method can overcome the limitations of the other methods. The fixed buffer (FB) method is limited by the difficulty of buffer selection and the inapplicability of a single fixed buffer for various cities, particularly in large-scale studies. The simplified urban-extent (SUE) method is challenged by cluster discrepancies and data obsolescence issues, and the modified equal area-suburban (MEA-S) method underestimates SUHII resulting from strong human activities in suburban areas. The daytime LSUHII induced by different methods for the reference definition reaches 0.62 K, accounting for 42% of the average SUHII. LSUHII is 0.34 K (23%) at night. LSUHII with evident spatiotemporal variations indicates that the different methods used to define the background reference introduce a considerable uncertainty to SUHII research. (2) After comparing methods for coping with missing LST, the first spatial and after temporal aggregation with threshold removal (FSAT-T) method is demonstrated to provided improved robustness to data missing over other methods. Daytime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 62% of cities, and nighttime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 45% of cities. Strong latitudinal and seasonal variations of LSUHII induced by the different methods used to cope with missing data introduce uncertainty and incomparability to SUHII research. Moreover, various image quality control (QC) methods and the effects from these methods on SUHII are discussed. The accuracy of QC methods changes with the error distribution of the image quality. Further investigations are required to determine the optimal QC method. The questions of whether different background definition affects the atmospheric UHI were also discussed. In this paper, a promising strategy for estimating city-based SUHII is proposed and a global-scale database based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is established to support further research on the variations and controls of SUHI.

AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP) hosts numerous glaciers and lakes which are critical natural water reserves but highly vulnerable to changing climate. In contrast to general drying trends in global endorheic basins in recent decades, the widespread lake expansions across the endorheic TP stand out as a puzzling "anomaly". To quantify the contribution of glacier mass changes to lake expansion at fine basin-scale details, we compute spatially resolved estimation of mass change in both glaciers and lakes across the endorheic TP between 2000 and 2010/14 based on multi-mission remote sensing observations. Our glacier mass balance estimates were based on the differences between the newly released global TanDEM-X DEM and the historical SRTM-C DEM, which provide nearly complete coverage (98%) of the glacierized area on the endorheic TP. We provide lake water storage changes of all lakes 1 km(2) on the inner TP. These estimates reveal that the massive lake water increase (9.44 +/- 1.43 Gt yr(-1)) was essentially not from the mass loss of glaciers which represents only about 4.7 +/- 8.8% of the lake water change (0.44 +/- 0.80 Gt yr(-1)). The relationship in individual basins was, however, highly heterogeneous. About 20% of total lake storage gain had no causality with glacier feeding. In comparison, for 28% of lake water surplus, mainly in the northwestern TP, the positive glacier mass balance infers that glaciers retained some precipitation surplus that could otherwise have been drained to downstream lakes. For the other 52% of lake storage gain, mostly in southern and eastern regions, the glacier mass loss varied among the basins with limited contributing levels (mostly <20%). Our analyses highlight remarkable spatial and temporal variabilities in lake/glacier changes on the endoreic TP and contribute to a better understanding of the role of glaciers in the recent Tibetan lake growth and the impact of climate change on the two types of water reserves.

AB The size structure of phytoplankton communities influences important ecological and biogeochemical processes, including the transfer of energy through marine food webs. A variety of algorithms have been developed to estimate phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from satellite ocean color data. However, many of these algorithms were developed for application to the global ocean, and their performance in more productive, optically complex coastal and continental shelf regions warrants evaluation. In this study, several existing PSC models were applied in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NES) region and compared with in situ PSC estimates derived from a local HPLC pigment data set. The effect of regional re-parameterization and incorporation of sea surface temperature (SST) into existing abundance-based model frameworks was investigated and model performance was assessed using an independent data set. Abundance-based model re-parameterization alone did not result in significant improvement in model performance compared with other models. However, the inclusion of SST led to a consistent reduction in model error for all size classes. Of two absorption-based algorithms tested, the best performing approach displayed similar performance metrics to the regional SST-dependent abundance-based model. The SST-dependent model and the absorption-based method were applied to monthly composites of the NES region for April and September 2019 and qualitatively compared. The results highlight the benefit of considering SST in abundance-based models and the applicability of absorption-based PSC methods in optically complex regions.

AB Despite its critical importance to carbon storage modeling, forest vertical structure remains poorly characterized over large areas. Canopy height estimates from current satellite missions such as ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) offer promise to close this knowledge gap, but their validation is critically important to inform their measurement uncertainties and scientific utility. Using existing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, the agreement of a variety of terrain and aboveground canopy height metrics including summary height statistics and percentiles, from ICESat-2' Land, Water and Vegetation Elevation product (ATL08) product was assessed in 12 sites across six major biomes in the United States. The agreement between ATL08 and ALS heights was assessed using the mean bias (Bias, ATL08 - ALS), the mean absolute error (MAE) and their percent equivalents, percent bias (pBias) and percent MAE (pMAE), respectively. In general, the agreement between ATL08 and ALS terrain heights was high (Bias 0.18 m, pBias 0.1%) while canopy heights showed lower agreement (Bias -1.71 m, pBias -15.9%). Analyses by biome, time of acquisition and beam strength of the ICESat-2 photon data also showed generally higher agreement for ATL08 terrain than canopy heights. Analyses also showed the performance of ATL08 heights varied with canopy cover with ATL08 terrain heights showing the best agreement when canopy cover was between 40 and 70% while the best performance for ATL08 canopy heights was observed when canopy cover was greater than 80%. This observation, coupled with analyses by biome, indicate that ATL08 canopy heights are more suitable in relatively dense canopy environments such as conifer and broadleaf forests than relatively sparse environments such a temperate grassland and Savannas. Higher level canopy height percentiles (95th and 98th) showed higher agreement (mean Bias 12.5%) with ALS heights than lower percentiles (minimum, 25th, mean pBias similar to 39.2%). These findings indicate that ATL08 canopy heights show more promise for routine canopy height characterization using the 95th and 98% percentiles but is limited in characterizing intermediate vertical structure. The observed performance differences between ATL08 terrain and canopy heights are attributed to differences in photon sampling rates over terrain and canopy surfaces which, compounded with background noise in ICESat-2 photon data, led to different effectiveness for ATL08 processing routines in filtering terrain and off-terrain points. This assessment of the impact of a variety of factors provides the vegetation community with an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of height estimates from the ICESat-2 ATL08 product.

AB Vitality loss of trees caused by extreme weather conditions, drought stress or insect infestations, are expected to increase with ongoing climate change. The detection of vitality loss at an early stage is thus of vital importance for forestry and forest management to minimize ecological and economical damage. Remote sensing instruments are able to detect changes over large areas down to the level of individual trees. The scope of our study is to investigate whether it is possible to detect stress-related spectral changes at an early stage using hyperspectral sensors. For this purpose, two Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest stands, both different in age and maintenance, were monitored in the field over two vegetation periods. In parallel, time series of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data were acquired. For each stand 70 trees were artificially stressed (ring-barked) and 70 trees were used as control trees. The data collected in south-eastern Germany consists of measurements at multiple times and at different scales: (1) crown conditions were visually assessed in the field (2) needle reflectance spectra were acquired in the laboratory using a FieldSpec spectrometer, and (3) hyperspectral airborne data (HySpex) were flown at 0.5 m spatial resolution. We aimed for a simultaneous data acquisition at the three levels. This unique data set was investigated whether any feature can be discriminated to detect vitality loss in trees at an early stage. Several spectral transformations were applied to the needle and tree crown spectra, such as spectral derivatives, vegetation indices and angle indices. All features were examined for their separability (ring-barked vs. control trees) with the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. As result, the younger, well maintained forest stand only showed minor changes over the 2-year period, whereas changes in the older forest stand were observable both in the needle and in the hyperspectral tree crown spectra, respectively. These changes could even be detected before changes were visible by field observations. The tree spectral reactions to ring-barking were first noticeable 11 months after ring-barking and 6 weeks before they were visible by field inspection. The most discriminative features for separating the two groups were the reflectance spectra and the spectral derivatives, over the VIs or angle indices. The tree crown spectra of the two groups could be separated by the RF classifier with a 79% overall accuracy at the beginning of the second vegetation period and 1 month later with 92% overall accuracy with high kappa index. The results clearly demonstrate the great potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in detecting early vitality changes of stressed trees.

AB Multi- and hyperspectral cameras on drones can be valuable tools in environmental monitoring. A significant shortcoming complicating their usage in quantitative remote sensing applications is insufficient robust radiometric calibration methods. In a direct reflectance transformation method, the drone is equipped with a camera and an irradiance sensor, allowing transformation of image pixel values to reflectance factors without ground reference data. This method requires the sensors to be calibrated with higher accuracy than what is usually required by the empirical line method (ELM), but consequently it offers benefits in robustness, ease of operation, and ability to be used on Beyond-Visual Line of Sight flights. The objective of this study was to develop and assess a drone-based workflow for direct reflectance transformation and implement it on our hyperspectral remote sensing system. A novel atmospheric correction method is also introduced, using two reference panels, but, unlike in the ELM, the correction is not directly affected by changes in the illumination. The sensor system consists of a hyperspectral camera (Rikola HSI, by Senop) and an onboard irradiance spectrometer (FGI AIRS), which were both given thorough radiometric calibrations. In laboratory tests and in a flight experiment, the FGI AIRS tilt-corrected irradiances had accuracy better than 1.9% at solar zenith angles up to 70 degrees. The system's low-altitude reflectance factor accuracy was assessed in a flight experiment using reflectance reference panels, where the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) were less than +/- 2% for the light panels (25% and 50%) and less than +/- 4% for the dark panels (5% and 10%). In the high-altitude images, taken at 100-150 m altitude, the NRMSEs without atmospheric correction were within 1.4%-8.7% for VIS bands and 2.0%-18.5% for NIR bands. Significant atmospheric effects appeared already at 50 m flight altitude. The proposed atmospheric correction was found to be practical and it decreased the high-altitude NRMSEs to 1.3%-2.6% for VIS bands and to 2.3%5.3% for NIR bands. Overall, the workflow was found to be efficient and to provide similar accuracies as the ELM, but providing operational advantages in such challenging scenarios as in forest monitoring, large-scale autonomous mapping tasks, and real-time applications. Tests in varying illumination conditions showed that the reflectance factors of the gravel and vegetation targets varied up to 8% between sunny and cloudy conditions due to reflectance anisotropy effects, while the direct reflectance workflow had better accuracy. This suggests that the varying illumination conditions have to be further accounted for in drone-based in quantitative remote sensing applications.

AB Most algorithms for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval depend on acquiring prior knowledge. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel LST retrieval method based on model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning, called the MDK-DL method. Based on the expert knowledge and radiation transfer model, we deduce LST retrieval mechanism and determine the best combination of the thermal infrared (TIR) bands of the sensor. Then, we use the radiation transfer model simulation and reliable satellite-ground data to establish a training and test database, and finally use the deep learning neural network for optimal computation. Three typical high-, medium- and low-spatial-resolution TIR remote sensing datasets (from Gaofen, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Fengyun) are used for theoretical simulation and application analysis. The simulation shows that the minimum mean absolute error (MAE) is less than 0.1 K (standard deviation: 0.04 K; correlation coefficient: 1.000) at a small viewing direction (<7.5 degrees) and less than 0.8 K at a large viewing direction (<65 degrees). The in situ validation shows that the minimum MAE obtained by the optimal band combination is approximately 1 K (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.12 K; coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.902). The retrieval accuracy is improved by increasing the number of TIR bands in the atmospheric window, and adding accurate atmospheric water vapor information produces better results. In general, four TIR bands in the atmospheric window bands are sufficient to retrieve the LST with high accuracy. Likewise, three TIR bands plus atmospheric water vapor information are sufficient for the retrieval requirements. All analyses indicate that our method is feasible and reliably accurate and can also be used to help design the instrument band to retrieve the LST with high precision.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission can measure high-resolution wide-swath sea surface heights (SSHs) that may greatly improve the current accuracy and spatial resolution of marine gravity from nadir-looking altimeters. To investigate the potential of SWOT in recovering high-quality marine gravity and how SWOT observation errors should be treated to optimize the accuracy of gravity anomaly from SWOT observations, we create high-wavenumber SSH components from multi-beam depths in the northern South China Sea (SCS) and simulate SWOT SSH errors. To cross-validate gravity signals and avoid gravity errors from SWOT, we use two computational methods (inverse Vening-Meinesz formula, IVM and inverse Stokes' integral, ISM) and recommend separate optimal data processing strategies when using geoid gradients (GGs) and geoid heights (GHs) for gravity recovery. The use of GGs (for IVM) effectively eliminates systematic errors in gravity derivation. If GHs (for ISM) are used in gravity recovery, the tilt in wide-swath SSHs should be removed before gravity computation, and the recovered gravity must be filtered (post-processed) to avoid artificial gravity signals due to the SSH errors. Our assessments using mgal-accuracy shipborne gravity anomalies in the northern SCS show that multiple-cycle SWOT observations can deliver high-quality marine gravity anomalies. IVM is more robust than ISM in resisting random and systematic errors in SWOT. Our processing strategies can be used for the gravity validation of SSHs from SWOT's fast-sampling and science phases.

AB Knowledge of building height is critical for understanding the urban development process. High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M(3)Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M(3)Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M(3)Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M(3)Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M(3)Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km(2)) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality.

TI Impact of scene-specific enhancement spectra on matched filter

AB Matched filter techniques have been widely used for retrieval of greenhouse gas enhancements from imaging spectroscopy datasets. While multiple algorithmic techniques and refinements have been proposed, the greenhouse gas target spectrum used for concentration enhancement estimation has remained largely unaltered since the introduction of quantitative matched filter retrievals. The magnitude of retrieved methane and carbon dioxide enhancements, and thereby integrated mass enhancements (IME) and estimated flux of point-source emitters, is heavily dependent on this target spectrum. Current standard use of molecular absorption coefficients to create unit enhancement target spectra does not account for absorption by background concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar and sensor geometry, or atmospheric water vapor absorption. We introduce geometric and atmospheric parameters into the generation of scene-specific unit enhancement spectra to provide target spectra that are compatible with all greenhouse gas retrieval matched filter techniques. Specifically, we use radiative transfer modeling to model four parameters that are expected to change between scenes: solar zenith angle, column water vapor, ground elevation, and sensor altitude. These parameter values are well defined, with low variation within a single scene. A benchmark dataset consisting of ten AVIRIS-NG airborne imaging spectrometer scenes was used to compare IME retrieved using a matched filter algorithm. For methane plumes, IME resulting from use of standard, generic enhancement spectra varied from -22 to +28.7% compared to scene-specific enhancement spectra. Due to differences in spectral shape between the generic and scenespecific enhancement spectra, differences in methane plume IME were linked to surface spectral characteristics in addition to geometric and atmospheric parameters. IME differences were much larger for carbon dioxide plumes, with generic enhancement spectra producing integrated mass enhancements -76.1 to -48.1% compared to scene-specific enhancement spectra. Fluxes calculated from these integrated enhancements would vary by the same percentages, assuming equivalent wind conditions. Methane and carbon dioxide IME were most sensitive to changes in solar zenith angle and ground elevation. We introduce an interpolation approach that can efficiently generate scene-specific unit enhancement spectra for given sets of parameters. Scene-specific target spectra can improve confidence in greenhouse gas retrievals and flux estimates across collections of scenes with diverse geometric and atmospheric conditions.

AB Hydrological changes, which are affected by climate variability and human activities, pose challenges to the sustainable management and conservation of water resources. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of how climate and anthropogenic activities impact land water storage. Previous studies using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data have struggled to effectively separate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on water storage. Here, we propose a statistical model that simulates natural dynamically driven changes in water storage to reconstruct climate-driven water storage anomalies at basin scales and discuss the possibility of differentiating climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method shows optimal robustness. Compared with water storage anomalies calculated using land surface models, our reconstruction results are closer to GRACE observations, especially in humid basins with few human interventions. Mismatches are found in basins with intensive human interventions. Isolated human-driven water storage anomalies in four representative basins correlate well with anthropogenic water usage in each basin. The results of this study provide a method to effectively separate and monitor climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies, thereby providing information for better protection and utilization of water resources.

AB The Landsat satellite data applications have been broadened by the improvement in data consistency, e.g., advances in calibration and atmospheric correction algorithms. However, there are still inter-sensor inconsistencies of surface reflectance caused by differences in sensor spectral response and residuals in calibration and atmospheric correction. Such inconsistencies tend to entangle with the land surface change, especially for the subtle changes such as vegetation responses to climate change. We propose a Bayesian approach to reduce inter-sensor inconsistencies by making Landsat 5, 7 and 8 reflectance consistent with MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR). The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance should be similar to the MODIS NBAR when it is degraded to the MODIS resolution considering the point spread function (PSF). The MODIS NBAR PSF is modelled as a Gaussian function with empirically derived and band specific parameters. The relationships between the MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance and the two available reflectance (i.e., the MODIS NBAR and observed Landsat reflectance) are built in the Bayesian framework. The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance is then derived using the computationally efficient conjugate gradient descent method. The algorithm was applied to Landsat 5, 7 and 8 surface reflectance over five study areas in Brazil, China, France, Russia and USA, and compared with a linear regression-based reflectance adjustment method. Visual difference was evident in the MODIS NBAR and the observed Landsat reflectance and the relative root-mean-squared differences (rRMSD) ranged from 3.16% to 67.72% and R2 from 0.037 to 0.934. Both the Bayesian and linearly MODISconsistent Landsat reflectance are visually more consistent with the MODIS NBAR. The average rRMSD and R2 improvements of the Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance over the observed Landsat reflectance were 21.36% and 0.19, 3.38% and 0.11, 5.25% and 0.07, 3.14% and 0.11, 3.49% and 0.08, and 5.72% and 0.09 for the blue, green, red, near infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands, respectively. The linearly MODISconsistent Landsat reflectance had less rRMSD improvements: 18.26%, 1.46%, 3.02%, 1.86%, 1.97% and 3.36% for the six bands respectively, and had no R2 improvements. The linear regression derived using the whole image pixels has low performance in adjusting some extreme reflectance values that are not well represented in the image. In contrast, the Bayesian method derives the reflectance image that is consistent to MODIS at pixel level.

AB This paper demonstrates the capability and performance of sea surface wind speed retrieval in coastal regions (within 200 km away from the coastline) using spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data from NASA's Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. The wind speed retrieval is based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A feedforward neural network is trained with the collocated CYGNSS Level 1B (version 2.1) observables and the wind speed from European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast Reanalysis 5th Generation (ECMWF ERA5) data in coastal regions. An ANN model with five hidden layers and 200 neurons in each layer has been constructed and applied to the validation set for wind speed retrieval. The proposed ANN model achieves good wind speed retrieval performance in coastal regions with a bias of -0.03 m/s and a RMSE of 1.58 m/s, corresponding to an improvement of 24.4% compared to the CYGNSS Level 2 (version 2.1) wind speed product. The ANN based retrievals are also compared to the ground truth measurements from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, which shows a bias of -0.44 m/s and a RMSE of 1.86 m/s. Moreover, the sensitivities of the wind speed retrieval performance to different input parameters have been analyzed. Among others, the geolocation of the specular point and the swell height can provide significant contribution to the wind speed retrieval, which can provide useful reference for more generic GNSS-R wind speed retrieval algorithms in coastal regions.

AB Several crops bear reproductive organs (RO) at the top of the canopy after the flowering stage, such as ears for wheat, tassels for maize, and heads for sunflowers. RO present specific architecture and optical properties as compared to leaves and stems, which may impact canopy reflectance. This study aims to understand and quantify the influence of RO on the bi-directional variation of canopy reflectance and NDVI. Multispectral camera observations from a UAV were completed over wheat, maize, and sunflower just after flowering when the RO are fully developed and the leaf layer with only marginal senescence. The flights were designed to sample the BRDF with view zenith angles spanning from nadir to 60?and many compass directions. Three flights corresponding to three sun positions were completed under clear sly conditions. The camera was always pointing to two adjacent plots of few tenths of square meters: the RO were manually removed on one plot, while the other plot was kept undisturbed. Results showed that the three visible bands (450 nm, 570 nm, 675 nm), and in a lesser way the red edge band (730 nm) were strongly correlated. We, therefore, focused on the 675 nm and 850 nm bands. The Bi-Directional Reflectance (BRF) of the canopy without RO shows that the BRF values were almost symmetrical across the principal plane, even for maize and sunflower canopies with a strong row structure. Examination of the BRF difference between the canopy with and without RO indicate that the RO impact canopy BRDF for the three crops. The magnitude of the impacts depends on crop, wavelength and observational geometry. These observations are generally consistent with realistic 3D reflectance simulations. However, some discrepancies were noticed, mainly explained by the small magnitude of the RO effect on canopy BRF, and the approximations made when simulating the RO layer and its coupling with the bottom canopy layer. We finally demonstrated that the RO layer impact the estimates of canopy traits such as GAI as derived from the multispectral observations.

AB Slow-moving landslides exhibit persistent but non-uniform motion at low rates which makes them exceptional natural laboratories to study the mechanisms that control the dynamics of unstable hillslopes. Here we leverage 4.5+ years of satellite-based radar and optical remote sensing data to quantify the kinematics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropical rural environment of the Kivu Rift, with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution. We measure landslide motion using sub-pixel image correlation methods and invert these data into dense time series that capture weekly to multi-year changes in landslide kinematics. We cross-validate and compare our satellite-based results with very-high-resolution Unoccupied Aircraft System topographic datasets, and explore how rainfall, simulated pore-water pressure, and nearby earthquakes control the overall landslide behaviour. The landslide exhibited seasonal and multi-year velocity variations that varied across the landslide kinematic units. While rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure exerts a primary control on the landslide motion, these alone cannot explain the observed variability in landslide behaviour. We suggest instead that the observed landslide kinematics result from internal landslide dynamics, such as extension, compression, material redistribution, and interactions within and between kinematic units. Our study provides, a rare, detailed overview of the deformation pattern of a landslide located in a tropical environment. In addition, our work highlights the viability of sub-pixel image correlation with long time series of radar-amplitude data to quantify surface deformation in tropical environments where optical data is limited by persistent cloud cover and emphasize the importance of exploiting synergies between multiple types of data to capture the complex kinematic pattern of landslides.

AB To address increasing water demands in expanding cities, many aquifers in Mexico are overexploited and deplete. The resulting land subsidence often combines with ground faulting/fracturing and damage to infrastructure. This study provides the longest Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) survey ever undertaken for the Aguascalientes Valley, aimed to constrain its structurally-controlled subsidence process and the induced risk. 275 ERS-1/2 1996-2002, ENVISAT 2003-2010 and Sentinel-1 2014-2020 C-band SAR images are processed with change detection, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods. Aguascalientes notably expanded over the last four decades, as revealed by Seasat 1978 L-band SAR, Landsat 1985-2010 and Sentinel-2 2020 optical imagery. The observed subsidence pattern involves alluvial/fluvial deposits within the N-S trending graben. Maximum settlement rates are -14 cm/year in 1996, -10 cm/year in 2000-2010 and over -12 cm/year in 2015-2020. An acceleration (-0.70 cm/year(2)) is recorded in 2015-2020 close to recently developed industrial plants and housing districts. Satellite estimates agree with in-situ observations, static GPS surveying and continuous GPS monitoring data. Rough correlation is found with piezometric level drop rates, whereas aquifer thickness plays a stronger role in the subsidence process. While these outcomes align with the existing literature, this InSAR survey: (i) unveils previously unknown E-W deformation affecting two N-S oriented bands within the valley, with up to similar to +/- 3 cm/year in 2015-2020 towards its center; (ii) identifies zones of sagging and hogging with horizontal strain (epsilon) of up to 0.05-0.1%; (iii) retrieves differential rates reaching 6-8 cm/year and angular distortions (beta) of 1/500 along the Oriente fault; and (iv) investigates the statistical distribution of, beta across field surveyed faults and fissures, and marks areas with potentially yetunmapped ground discontinuities. A new surface faulting risk matrix embedding beta and epsilon is therefore proposed to estimate subsidence impact on properties and population. Given its scale-dependency, the risk assessment provides a lower bound to the percentage of urban areas at risk within the Aguascalientes state: at least 2% of the urban areas were at high and very high risk in 2003-2010 (involving similar to 12,000 properties and similar to 39,000 inhabitants), but this increased to 6% in 2015-2020 (similar to 25,600 properties, similar to 85,200 inhabitants). The evidence of a subsidence process evolving spatially and temporally highlights the need for continuous updating of hazard information.

AB Over the course of a year, vegetation and temperature have strong phenological and seasonal patterns, respectively, and many species have adapted to these patterns. High inter-annual variability in the phenology of vegetation and in the seasonality of temperature pose a threat for biodiversity. However, areas with high spatial variability likely have higher ecological resilience where inter-annual variability is high, because spatial variability indicates presence of a range of resources, microclimatic refugia, and habitat conditions. The integration of inter-annual and spatial variability is thus important for biodiversity conservation. Areas where spatial variability is low and inter-annual variability is high are likely to limit resilience to disturbance. In contrast, areas of high spatial variability may be high priority candidates for protection. Our goal was to develop spatiotemporal remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of biodiversity conservation concern. We generated indices that capture the inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness and land surface temperature and integrated them to identify areas of high, medium, and low biodiversity conservation concern. We applied our method in Argentina (2.8 million km(2)), a country with a wide range of climates and biomes. To generate the inter-annual variability indices, we analyzed MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series from 2001 to 2018, fitted curves to obtain annual phenological and seasonal metrics, and calculated their inter-annual variability. To generate the spatial variability indices, we calculated standard deviation image texture of Landsat 8 EVI and LST. When we integrated our inter-annual and spatial variability indices, areas in the northeast and parts of southern Argentina were the hotspots of highest conservation concern. High inter-annual variability poses a threat in these areas, because spatial variability is low. These are areas where management efforts could be valuable. In contrast, areas in the northwest and central-west are where protection should be strongly considered because the high spatial variability may confer resilience to disturbance, due to the variety of conditions and resources within close proximity. We developed remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of high and low conservation concern at scales relevant to biodiversity conservation, = which can be used to target management actions in order to minimize biodiversity loss.

AB Spectral unmixing has trigged considerable attention to both multispectral and hyperspectral data processing. Among different kinds of spectral unmixing models, the linear mixture model (LMM) has been widely applied with its simplicity in light scattering mechanisms and flexibility in different scenarios. Recently, a variety of optimized LMMs have been developed to enhance the decomposing ability. However, two major challenges still exist: endmember variability and global optimum solution with the inequality constraint. In this study, aiming to avoid the influence of endmember variability and to extend the application of LMM, a novel inequality-constrained weighted linear mixture model (IWLMM) is proposed. Based on the errors-in-variables (EIV) model and the theory of weighted total least squares (WTLS), the issue of endmember variability and stochastic errors of both endmembers and mixed pixels are eliminated. With the non-negativity constraint, a brief optimal algorithm to solve the IWLMM is generated as well. In order to indicate the advantages of proposed IWLMM, comparative experiments with the conventional fully constrained least squares (FCLS), three currently proposed LMM-based models (perturbed LMM (PLMM), extended LMM (ELMM) and augmented LMM (ALMM)) and three physics-based nonlinear mixture models (bilinear-Fan model (BFM), generalized bilinear model (GBM) and polynomial post-nonlinear model (PPNM)) on four synthetic and real scenarios with hyperspectral and multispectral datasets were performed. The experimental results suggest the IWLMM outperforms the other seven linear and nonlinear unmixing models after adding the correction for endmember variability by modeling the perturbation and scaling factors of spectral features simultaneously. It has an impressive ability for decomposing and reconstructing pixels.

AB The seasonal dynamics of snow cover strongly affect ecosystem processes and winter habitat, making them an important driver of terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites can capture these dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales, allowing for the development of indices with specific application in ecological research and predicting biodiversity. Here, our primary objective was to derive winter habitat indices (WHIs) from MODIS that quantify snow season length, snow cover variability, and the prevalence of frozen ground without snow as a proxy for subnivium conditions. We calculated the WHIs for the full snow year (Aug-Jul) and winter months (Dec-Feb) across the contiguous US from 2003/04 to 2017/18 and validated them with ground-based data from 797 meteorological stations. To demonstrate the potential of the WHIs for biodiversity assessments, we modeled their relationships with winter bird species richness derived from eBird observations. The WHIs had clear spatial patterns reflecting both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in snow cover. Snow season length was generally longer at higher latitudes and elevations, while snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow were highest across low elevations of the mid latitudes. Variability in the WHIs was largely driven by elevation in the West and by latitude in the East. Snow season length and frozen ground without snow were most accurately mapped, and had correlations with station data across all years of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. Snow cover variability was accurately mapped for winter (r = 0.79), but not for the full snow year (r = -0.21). The model containing all three WHIs used to predict winter bird species richness patterns across the contiguous US was by far the best, demonstrating the individual value of each index. Regions with longer snow seasons generally supported fewer species. Species richness increased steadily up to moderate levels of snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow, after which it steeply declined. Our results show that the MODIS WHIs accurately characterized unique gradients of snow cover dynamics and provided important information on winter habitat conditions for birds, highlighting their potential for ecological research and conservation planning.

TI Generating surface soil moisture at 30 m spatial resolution using both
   data fusion and machine learning toward better water resources

AB Soil moisture has a considerable impact on the hydrological cycle, runoff generation, drought development, and water resources management. Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6-12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m x 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m x 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m x 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m x 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m x 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e. g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70-0.84, -0.034-0.012 cm (3)/cm(3), 0.025-0.044 cm(3)/cm(3), 0.031-0.050 cm(3)/cm(3), and 0.022-0.042 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m x 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale.

AB Assessing changes in forest structure over time is crucial for monitoring forest resources, supporting sustainable forest management practices, and providing key insights into changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent research interest and rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) technology principally due to its low cost and timeliness, is providing high-spatial resolution data for enhancing forest inventories and forest dynamics monitoring. The increasing prevalence of these UAV acquired datasets in forestry promotes a need for better understanding of how DAP-based point clouds change over time, and how these changes may relate to changes in forest structure. In this study, we utilized bi-temporal DAP data to investigate changes in forest structure over a 3-year period in subtropical planted forest stands throughout Dongtai Yellow Sea National Forest Park, Jiangsu Province, China. To do so, we evaluated both direct (i.e., structural parameter changes estimated using the differences between bi-temporal DAP metrics) and indirect (i. e., structural parameters were modelled for each date, and their changes predicted as their differences) methods to estimate the changes in forest structure. In addition, once models were developed, changes in Lorey's mean height and volume were extrapolated across the entire study site and examined related to the forest type and age. Our assessments of the different approaches showed that the direct approach (R-2 = 0.54-0.78) resulted in improved accuracy compared to the indirect method (R-2 = 0.51-0.73). The distributional metrics, namely, height percentiles (e.g., H-75 and H-95) and canopy return density (e.g., D-7 and D-5), and the Weibull-fitted metrics (e.g., alpha) were found to be sensitive to changes in structural parameters, whereas canopy volume-related metrics had relatively low predictive capabilities. Overall, the predicted changes in Lorey's mean height and volume were mapped over the entire study area, and indicated that Lorey's mean height increased mostly in middle-aged and young forest stands. Over-mature stands showed the lowest height increment. This study proved the capability of using bi-temporal point clouds from UAV-based DAP for enhancing forest inventories and promoting sustainable forest management.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems are undergoing rapid transformation as a result of changing environmental conditions and direct human impacts. However, we cannot adequately understand, monitor or simulate tropical ecosystem responses to environmental changes without capturing the high diversity of plant functional characteristics in the species-rich tropics. Failure to do so can oversimplify our understanding of ecosystems responses to environmental disturbances. Innovative methods and data products are needed to track changes in functional trait composition in tropical forest ecosystems through time and space. This study aimed to track key functional traits by coupling Sentinel-2 derived variables with a unique data set of precisely located in-situ measurements of canopy functional traits collected from 2434 individual trees across the tropics using a standardised methodology. The functional traits and vegetation censuses were collected from 47 field plots in the countries of Australia, Brazil, Peru, Gabon, Ghana, and Malaysia, which span the four tropical continents. The spatial positions of individual trees above 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were mapped and their canopy size and shape recorded. Using geo-located tree canopy size and shape data, community-level trait values were estimated at the same spatial resolution as Sentinel-2 imagery (i.e. 10 m pixels). We then used the Geographic Random Forest (GRF) to model and predict functional traits across our plots. We demonstrate that key plant functional traits can be accurately predicted across the tropicsusing the high spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery in conjunction with climatic and soil information. Image textural parameters were found to be key components of remote sensing information for predicting functional traits across tropical forests and woody savannas. Leaf thickness ((R)2 = 0.52) obtained the highest prediction accuracy among the morphological and structural traits and leaf carbon content (R-2 = 0.70) and maximum rates of photosynthesis (R-2 = 0.67) obtained the highest prediction accuracy for leaf chemistry and photosynthesis related traits, respectively. Overall, the highest prediction accuracy was obtained for leaf chemistry and photosynthetic traits in comparison to morphological and structural traits. Our approach offers new opportunities for mapping, monitoring and understanding biodiversity and ecosystem change in the most species-rich ecosystems on Earth.

AB Forest height is an important variable for modeling terrestrial carbon storage and global carbon cycle dynamics. Spaceborne SAR Interferometry (InSAR) has the sensitivity to measure canopy height and the underlying topography. In this paper, we refine and automate an interferometric ground finding approach that exploits few look (2to 4-look) averaged interferograms and incorporates the use of a coherent electromagnetic simulator and field inventory data. Using the coherent electromagnetic simulator, an InSAR simulation based on field data is performed to study the true ground position as a function of the statistics of few-look InSAR phase heights from a model perspective. With this statistical model, both the underlying topography and the canopy height (mean and top canopy height) can be estimated. Using German Aerospace Center's (DLR) single-baseline single-polarization TanDEM-X InSAR data, we validate the approach over a Brazilian tropical forest (Tapajos National Forest) with both field inventory and lidar data. As validated against lidar data, the underlying topography is estimated to an accuracy of 3 m. At one hectare aggregated pixel size, InSAR phase-center height is best compared with the field/ lidar mean canopy height with an accuracy of 2-3 m, while InSAR-inverted total height best characterizes the lidar top canopy height with an accuracy of 4-5 m. Given the global data availability of TanDEM-X and the future TanDEM-L, this approach has the potential for wall-to-wall mapping of forest height as well as underlying topography and also serves as a complementary tool to other existing InSAR, Polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) and SAR tomography (TomoSAR) methods when only single polarization and/or baseline data are available.

AB Shrublands occupy about 13% of the global land surface, contain about one-third of the biodiversity, store about half of the global terrestrial carbon, and provide many ecosystem services to a large amount of world's human population and livestock. Because phenology is a sensitive indicator of the response of shrubland ecosystems to climate change, the alteration of ecosystems following species invasions, and the dynamics of shrubland ecosystem function, biodiversity, and carbon budgets, it is critical to monitor and assess phenological dynamics in shrubland ecosystems. However, most current land surface phenology (LSP) products derived from satellite data do not provide phenology detections in some semiarid shrublands where the amplitude of seasonal vegetation greenness is small. Therefore, we investigated the LSP detection using multiple spatial resolution satellite data and examined the impacts of spatial scales and shrubland ecosystem components (shrub and herb cover) on LSP detections over the western United States. Specifically, greenup onset date (GUD) in shrublands was detected from 30 m Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data to quantify scale effects. The GUD spatial patterns were explored with 30 m pixel variations in shrubland ecosystem components. The results show that GUD values varied with percent vegetation cover and shifted to earlier dates with increasing vegetation cover, demonstrating that satellite observations were not able to capture greenup onset until a threshold of green vegetation cover is reached. GUD was mostly undetectable from both HLS and VIIRS pixels with vegetation cover less than 10% and became fully detectable with vegetation covers larger than 50%. Similarly, the differences of GUD between HLS and VIIRS detections also decreased with increased vegetation cover. As a result of high shrubland heterogeneity, GUD from 30 m HLS pixels could be partially detected within a 500 m pixel despite GUD being undetectable from VIIRS time series. Moreover, vegetation cover heterogeneity also made it difficult for GUD at 30 m to be aggregated to coarse scales (such as to 500 m VIIRS pixels). These findings have significant implications to the detection and characterization of shrubland LSP responses to environmental and climate changes.

AB Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was introduced for basic forest measurements, such as tree height and diameter, in the early 2000s. Recent advances in sensor and algorithm development have allowed us to assess in situ 3D forest structure explicitly and revolutionised the way we monitor and quantify ecosystem structure and function. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary focus to explore current developments in TLS to measure and monitor forest structure. We argue that TLS data will play a critical role in understanding fundamental ecological questions about tree size and shape, allometric scaling, metabolic function and plasticity of form. Furthermore, these new developments enable new applications such as radiative transfer modelling with realistic virtual forests, monitoring of urban forests and larger scale ecosystem monitoring through long-range scanning. Finally, we discuss upscaling of TLS data through data fusion with unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne and spaceborne data, as well as the essential role of TLS in validation of spaceborne missions that monitor ecosystem structure.

AB Information about forest stand species distribution is essential for biodiversity modelling, forest disturbances, fire hazard and drought monitoring, biomass and carbon estimation, detection of non-native and invasive species, as well as for planning forest management strategies. High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km(2)). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision.

AB Accurate estimation of cropping intensity (CI), an indicator of food production, is well aligned with the ongoing efforts to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) under diminishing natural resources. The advancement in satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities for capturing CI information in a spatially continuous manner. However, challenges remain due to the lack of generalizable algorithms for accurately and efficiently mapping global CI with a fine spatial resolution. In this study, we developed a 30-m planetary-scale CI mapping framework with the reconstructed time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multiple satellite images. Using a binary crop phenophase profile indicating growing and non-growing periods, we estimated pixel-by-pixel CI by enumerating the total number of valid cropping cycles during the study years. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we implemented the framework to estimate CI during 2016-2018 in eight geographic regions across continents that are representative of global cropping system diversity. Comparison with PhenoCam network data in four cropland sites suggests that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the seasonal dynamics of cropping practices. Spatially, overall accuracies based on validation samples range from 80.0% to 98.9% across different regions worldwide. Regarding the CI classes, single cropping systems are associated with more robust and less biased estimations than multiple cropping systems. Finally, our CI estimates reveal high agreement with two widely used land surface phenology products, including Vegetation Index and Phenology V004 (VIP4) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2), meanwhile providing much more spatial details. Due to its robustness, the developed CI framework can be potentially generalized to produce global fine resolution CI products for food security and other applications.

AB Soil salinity is one of the crucial factors which undermines agricultural production in the semi-arid region. The study was attempted for the Vellore district, one of the worst-hit semi-regions of Tamil Nadu by salinization. The Sentinel-1 data product of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) was instrumental in the development of the model. In the present research, a semi-empirical dielectric model was proposed, and its potential in demonstrating the rate of soil salinity was validated with in-situ measurements under semi-saturated conditions (soil moisture < 50%). The dielectric behavior of saline and non-saline soil was simulated by investigating the paradigm of the parameters, namely the backscattering coefficient of VV polarization, soil texture, and in-situ dielectric constant in the three-dimensional density space. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was retrieved by simulating the dielectric loss from the partition observed between the dielectric constant of saline and non-saline soils in the third dimension. The resultant product of the proposed model has achieved the best fit (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.14, Bias = -0.65) with the in-situ EC measures of sandy soil compared to other categories of soil due to the presence of soluble salts in the free water. The proposed simulation demonstrated that the dielectric behavior of saline affected soil is dependent on soil textural characteristics under the semi-saturated condition. The simulation has shown the highest prediction performance (R-2 > 0.7) in quantifying the soil EC covered with short crops with a mean height of 0.5 m. This statistical significance reveals the feasibility of the C-band SAR data to quantify the rate of salinity over bare and vegetated soil.

AB Satellite-derived phenology metrics are valuable tools for understanding broad-scale patterns and changes in vegetated landscapes over time. However, the extraction and interpretation of phenology in ecosystems with subtle growth dynamics can be challenging. US National Park Service monitoring of evergreen pinyon-juniper ecosystems in the western US revealed an unexpected winter-peaking phenological pattern in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. In this paper, we assess the validity of the winter peaks through ground-based observation of phenology and examination of solar and satellite geometry effects. To test the premise of a true vegetation response, we analyzed NDVI values extracted from a time series of ground-based digital camera ('phenocam') images collected September 2017 to December 2018 in a pinyon-juniper woodland in Arizona, US. Results show pinyon and juniper growth peaked in the warm season, as did the other species in the phenocam field of view. NDVI time series from four other sensors (Landsat 7, Sentinel-2, VIIRS, and Proba-V) confirmed that winter peaks in this ecosystem are not limited to MODIS products. Examination of NDVI time series (2003-2018) derived from daily 250-m MODIS data in the broader pinyon-juniper ecosystem revealed that solar-to-sensor angle, sensor zenith angle, and forward/back-scatter reflectance explained > 80% of intra-annual variability. Solar-to-sensor angle exerted the greatest control, and the direction of its correlation (positive) was the opposite of that which would be expected if it were driven by vegetation greenness. Solar-to-sensor angle is controlled seasonally by solar zenith angle and daily by variations in satellite overpass geometry. We mapped winter peaks across the western US in Google Earth Engine using 500-m MODIS MCD43A4 data, which correct for reflectance differences caused by view angle. In areas where winter vegetation peaks are ecologically improbable (i.e., locations with sub-freezing December temperatures), consistent winter peaks (>= 14 years in 2003 to 2018) are widespread in both pinyon-juniper and non-pinyon-juniper conifer ecosystems; winter peaks are common (>= 5 years in 2003 to 2018) across areas of shrubland. We attribute winter peaks to the positive correlation of NDVI with solar-to-sensor angle and solar zenith angle in combination with sparse, vertically oriented evergreen vegetation canopies. Increasing shadow visibility has been shown to increase overall NDVI, and the prevalence of the winter peaking in evergreen western sparse canopy ecosystems is consistent with this hypothesis. The extent of winter peaking patterns may have been previously overlooked due to temporal compositing, curve fitting, and incomplete snow screening.

AB The Soil Moisture Active Mission (SMAP) baseline V-pol single channel algorithm (SCA-V) retrieves soil moisture (SM) based on the 2000-2010 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) climatology. This parameterization scheme might affect SM retrievals in the context of vegetation disturbances, e.g., as a result of drought. By referencing the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 (SMOS-L3) and the SMOS-IC SM datasets, this study investigated the effects of SMAP vegetation parameterization on SMAP-reference SM differences in global land areas that are subject to differing vegetation disturbances. The results show that SMAP might underestimate SM by similar to 0.007 m(3).m(-3) for a relative NDVI decrease of 10%. The underestimation might be primarily caused by low biases in the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) surface temperature. Although using NDVI climatology might cause an overestimation of SM (due to an overestimation of vegetation effects and an underestimation of surface roughness effects), the concurrent underestimation of the GMAO surface temperature might cause an even larger underestimation of SM. The vegetation biases, particularly the surface temperature biases, should be considered for SMAP SM retrieval. These results have implications for future updates of SMAP SCA-V and applications of time series SMAP SM data for hydroecological studies, especially in the future, which is projected to have strong and long-lasting droughts.

AB This study examines links between two sets of parameters obtained from Radarsat-2 Quad-pol data and geophysical information of lake ice and landfast sea ice in the Resolute Bay area, Nunavut, Canada. The first set includes the three orthogonal backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)(hh), sigma(0)(vv), sigma(0)(vh)) in addition to the total backscatter power (SPAN). The second set includes polarimetric decomposition parameters obtained using Cloude-Pottier and Yamaguchi decomposition methods. Data were collected during the early freezing period from 20 September until 28 December 2017. Meteorological and ice climatological data from the weather station of Resolute Bay were used to facilitate this task. Ice thickness and salinity were obtained from established empirical models. Results show that single-bounce and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms are active in lake ice during the entire freezing period while multiple-bounce scattering is active in sea ice only during the initial freezing. Backscatter parameters can be used to determine the thickness of lake ice up to any depth, while both backscatter and the tested decomposition parameters are related to the thickness of young sea ice (<30 cm thick). Physical explanations are offered in each case. Spatial maps of ice thickness are produced. Polarimetric decomposition parameters demonstrate erratic behavior throughout the development of lake ice. High entropy (>0.6) is found to be associated with comparable single- and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms, hence can be used to identify new ice. Orthogonal backscatter coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters provide different information, yet their combination offers clues to better identify ice conditions and investigate questions about scattering mechanisms.

AB One of the challenging tasks in modern aquatic remote sensing is the retrieval of near-surface concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP)-based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (b(bp)) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from b(bp) via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m(3)], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to> 100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in R-rs leads to< 20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads.

AB A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted, and thematic and geographical trends were summarized. Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is among the most important variables in monitoring land surface processes. LST is often retrieved from thermal infrared remote sensing data, which have a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions and are spatially incomplete due to cloud contamination. Land surface model (LSM) output can reflect LST under all-weather conditions, but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse. In this study, a two-step LST data fusion framework was proposed for generating MODIS-like LST (at the satellite overpass time for each day) at a 1 km spatial resolution under all-weather conditions. First, MODIS LST on clear days (i.e., all MODIS LST pixels are cloud-free) for a given study region (e.g., 80 km x 80 km) and China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST at a spatial resolution of similar to 7 km x 7 km were fused using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). Second, systematic biases of the fused LST estimates were corrected by MODIS LST for clear pixels on cloudy days. Results indicate that the fused LST after bias correction (fused LSTcorr) under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with in situ LST measurements made at three sites with different land cover types in the north of China, in terms of mean absolute errors of 2.20-3.08 K, root mean square errors of 2.77-3.96 K, and coefficients of determination of 0.93-0.95. The accuracy of these results is comparable to that of the MODIS LST retrievals at all testing sites. In addition, the fused LSTcorr can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in LST under all-weather conditions, and there is no significant difference in the accuracy of the fused LSTcorr between the clear and cloudy pixels on cloudy days. The developed approach maximizes the potential of quality MODIS LST retrievals and LSM LST output, and generates LST under all-weather conditions without using ancillary remote sensing and in situ data. The generated MODIS-like LST data under all-weather conditions are valuable in soil moisture downscaling and evapotranspiration estimation for better water resources management.

However, the detection of this emission is severely affected by distortions, due to processes of light re-absorption both in the leaf and in the canopy. Even though some advances have been made to correct the signal in the far-red, the whole spectral range needs to be addressed, in order to accurately assess plant physiological state. In 2018, we introduced a model to obtain fluorescence spectra at leaf level, from what was observed at canopy level. In this present work, we publish a revision of that physical model, with a more rigorous and exact mathematical treatment. In addition, multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy, and the fraction of land covered by vegetation have also been taken into consideration. We validate this model upon experimental measures, in three types of crops of agronomic interest (Pea, Rye grass and Maize) with different architecture. Our model accurately predicts both the shape of fluorescence spectra at leaf level from that measured at canopy level and the fluorescence ratio. Furthermore, not only do we eliminate artifacts affecting the spectral shape, but we are also able to calculate the quantum yield of fluorescence corrected for re-absorption, from the experimental quantum yield at canopy level. This represents an advance in the study of these systems because it offers the opportunity to make corrections for both the fluorescence ratio and the intensity of the observed fluorescence.

AB Glacier velocity is one of the important parameters to know about glacier dynamics, its mass and health. Understanding glacier velocity also assists in the analysis of ice thickness, ice flux and mass balance. Furthermore, basin/sub-basin wise studies are helpful to understand the climate change over that region instead of monitoring individual glaciers. In the current study, the spatial distribution of glacier velocity is generated for the entire Chandra and Bhaga sub-basins, in the Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) differential interferometry pair images with a 14-days temporal gap. The glaciers in Chandra sub-basin are found to have a high flow rate as compared to the glaciers in Bhaga sub-basin. Local slope and ice thickness, which decrease towards the terminus in general, control the movement of valley glaciers, and lower movement rate is observed for most of glaciers towards the terminus/frontal area. However, a few glaciers of Bhaga sub-basin demonstrate an accelerated movement in their frontal areas. This irregular behaviour is also studied in this work and it is discovered that terrain slope and influx of melting water from adjacent glaciers are the major causes for such behaviour of these glaciers. They are, therefore, prone to accelerated mass loss compared to other glaciers in the sub-basin. Another key finding of the anomalous glacier dynamics study is the disintegrating behaviour of glaciers, which is also identified by interpreting the responses of physical scattering mechanisms retrieved from glaciers using fully polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. Warming temperatures are expected to cause glacier retreat and separation of tributary glaciers from the main glacier body. Melt water from tributary glaciers can further accelerate glacier flow and ice melt in lower part of glacier trunk. This can lead to formation of dead ice zones and disintegration of Himalayan glaciers, which are supported by numerous tributary glaciers. Therefore, we expect that the loss in glacier area due to warming will be larger than the present prediction, where mass loss is considered from conventional way.

AB Warming in arctic and boreal regions is increasing shrub cover and biomass. In southcentral Alaska, willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) shrubs grow taller than many tree species and account for a substantial proportion of aboveground biomass, yet they are not individually measured as part of the operational Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. The goal of this research was to test methods for landscape-scale mapping of tall shrub biomass in upper montane and subalpine environments using FIA-type plot measurements (n = 51) and predictor variables from imagery-based structure-from-motion (SfM) and airborne lidar. Specifically, we compared biomass models constructed from imagery acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; similar to 1.7 cm pixels), imagery from the NASA Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT; similar to 3.1 cm pixels), and concomitant G-LiHT small-footprint lidar. Tall shrub biomass was most accurately predicted at 5 m resolution (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 1.09 kg m(-2)) using G-LiHT SfM color and structure variables. Lidar-only models had lower precision (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.26 kg m(-2)), possibly due to reduced model information content from variable multicollinearity or lower data density. Separate models for upper montane zones with trees and shrubs and subalpine zones with only shrubs were always chosen over single models based on minimization of Akaike's Information Criterion, indicating the need for variable sets robust to overhanging tree canopy. Decreasing point density from UAV (5000-8000 pts. m(-2)) to the G-LiHT SfM point cloud (500-2000 pts. m(-2)) had little impact on model fit, suggesting that high-resolution airborne imagery can extend SfM approaches well beyond line-of-sight restrictions for UAV platforms. Overall, our results confirmed that SfM from high-resolution imagery is a viable approach to estimate shrub biomass in the boreal region, especially when an existing lidar terrain model and local field calibration data are available to quantify uncertainty in the SfM point cloud and landscape-scale estimates of shrub biomass.

AB In this study, the mechanism of channel-floodplain seasonal connectivity along the Amazon River is analyzed over a full hydrological year through the use of satellite radar altimetry data (Jason-2). This is done via a novel observation-based approach which employs the concurrent measurement of water levels (WLs) over river and floodplain, analyzing seasonal changes in water surface height differences between the two water bodies. Hydrological connectivity thresholds at different stages during the rising phase were identified, and then validated using field data and remote sensing-driven surface suspended sediment maps. Successful decoupling of the two indiscrete flooding processes during the rising phase: channelized and overbank dispersion processes, is one of the major outcomes of this study. Different roles of the connectivity processes on floodplain hydro-geomorphology are highlighted - that channelized flows determine inundation frequency, residence time and development of positive topographic features in the floodplain, while overbank flows contribute a good part of the seasonal water storage and sediment budget in the floodplain, and tends to smooth positive topography built by channelized flows. The zones of overbank flooding, however, are rather localized due to the well-developed natural levee complex and stable channel-dominated floodplain along the river bank. Lastly, the presented approach is straightforward and solely based on publicly available operational data, making it easily adaptable by non-remote sensing experts. Thus, along with the emergence of new radar altimetry platforms, such as ICESat-2 or Jason-3 that could measure WL of smaller lakes, the proposed approach offers the potential to contribute to research on channel-floodplain systems in other rivers at a global scale.

AB Climatology (mean seasonal cycle) errors often cause large differences between soil moisture products. However, relatively little work has been done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle (SMC) information acquired from different sources. This study evaluates surface (0-10 cm) SMCs obtained from four land surface models (LSMs), two C/X-band and two L-band remote-sensing (RS) products using 5 dense networks and 75 sparse in-situ soil moisture measurement sites located within the contiguous United States. Results show that relative to older C/X-band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), newer L-band products derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean and Salinity (SMOS) mission provide more accurate SMC estimates (with an average of 35% root-mean-square-error reduction). In fact, the latest SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product provides SMC intra-seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 3-34% and 2-37% more accurate, respectively, than all four LSM-based SMCs examined here. Hence, SMC validation against SMOS-IC SMC results may improve LSMs' ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics, and the common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM SMC estimates is likely sub-optimal for assimilating L-band soil moisture retrievals. Although the SMOS-IC product has made significant progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values, a temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS-IC surface SMCs over all land cover types. Addressing this bias should be a priority for future generations of SMOS retrieval algorithms.

AB Historically, change detection reviews have examined and categorized algorithms based on their techniques for the remote sensing community. Here, we synthesize urban land change algorithms by the types of information they provide to a diverse and growing set of user communities. Two goals of the paper are first to synthesize past and current change detection studies to examine urban land change to help users of remote sensing algorithms understand and navigate the vast variety of available methods, and second to identify gaps in knowledge for the urban remote sensing community. We analyzed 644 peer-reviewed research papers published in English-language journals and conducted a systematic review of urban land change algorithms. All papers included in our study focus on urban land change; studies that concentrate on single-date urban classification or mapping for one point in time without an explicit urban land change component are not included in this analysis. The review showed five key results and knowledge gaps. First, most urban change detection algorithms are being developed and applied for only a few regions, with 75% of studies focused on high or upper-middle-income countries and the majority of these on China or the United States. This suggests a major gap in geographic coverage as well as the need for more studies on cities in low and lower-middle-income countries. Second, the results show that 41% of the algorithms have been developed or applied for cities of over 5 million inhabitants. This focus on large cities is problematic given that only 11% of the world's urban population lives in cities with populations greater than 5 million and that most future urban growth will occur in small- and medium-sized towns and cities with populations of fewer than 1 million people. Third, our analysis shows that 62% of the studies use three or fewer time points to measure urban land change with an average study length of 17 years. Since rapidly growing urban areas are highly dynamic, this suggests that existing algorithms using only a few time points are likely missing urban transitions that can only be captured with high temporal frequency analysis. Fourth, we find that urban expansion is the most commonly monitored type of urban land change. Comparatively fewer studies characterized intra-urban change or three-dimensional structural change. Fifth and finally, the results show that an overwhelming majority-87%-of all studies identify only one urban class, highlighting a need for more studies that distinguish intra-urban variation and differentiate multiple urban classes. Our analysis shows that it is very difficult-nearly impossible-to compare across algorithms. Thus, for users of urban land change information, it is difficult to navigate the literature and know which algorithms are most appropriate for a particular use. Taken together, this points to the need for improved reproducibility, replicability, and comparability of studies in order to help harmonize urban land change information across regions and countries. This is especially important given the growing user communities of urban land change products and analysis, especially from policy and practice.

AB Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) shows promise as an approach for estimating gross primary production (GPP) remotely. However, sun-target-sensor geometry and within-canopy absorption of SIF can alter the relationship between measured SIF and GPP, because sensors can only retrieve some unknown fraction of the total emitted SIF. Radiative transfer models that allow for variation in canopy structure and sensor angles are therefore needed to properly interpret SIF measurements. Spectral invariants allow decoupling of the wavelength-independent canopy structure and the wavelength-dependent leaf and soil spectrum in the radiative transfer process. Here we develop a simple analytical Fluorescence Radiative Transfer model based on Escape and Recollision probability (FluorRTER) to investigate the impact of canopy structure and sun-target-sensor geometry on SIF emissions. SIF simulations using the FluorRTER model agreed well the one-dimensional Soil-Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy balance (SCOPE) model and the three-dimensional Fluorescence model with Weighted Photon Spread (FluorWPS) model. The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and clumping effect have a large influence the SIF emission of 3D discontinuous canopies. For a moderate solar zenith angle (30 degrees) and a clumped canopy (FVC = 0.6), the difference between the directional observed SIF of a 3D discontinuous canopy and a 1D homogeneous canopy was as large as 43.2% and 38.4% for Photosystem I + II fluorescence at 685 nm and at 740 nm, respectively. By bridging the gap between observed SIF and total emitted SIF over 3D heterogeneous vegetation canopies, the FluorRTER model can assist with the angular normalization of SIF measurements and enable the more robust interpretation of how variations in SIF from directional and hemispherical in-situ, airborne and satellite observations relate to leaf and whole-canopy physiological processes.

AB Satellite observations are used to detect surface waters but uncertainties such as instrument noise or retrieval errors can introduce noise or missing-data in the resulting water maps, especially for datasets at the global scale. In this study, spatial filters based on several a priori information are proposed to reduce noise and perform spatial interpolation to fill missing-data in satellite-based surface water maps such as wetlands, rivers, lakes. Four main sources of a priori of information are considered: (1) historical information at the pixel level, (2) neighbouring information constraints based on a historical record, (3) constraints based on topography, and (4) hydrological constraints based on a floodability index. Experiments are conducted over synthetic but realistic data, as well as over real Sentinel 1 (SAR) and 2 (visible) water map retrievals. Mis-classification quantitative results over these three types of data show that simple determinist spatial filters allow reducing noise and filling missing-data. The four sources of a priori information can be exploited and combined to improve observed water maps. This opens some ways to develop post-processing tools for improving surface water maps at high spatial resolution from missions such as SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) to be launched in 2020.

AB Boreal forests are globally extensive and store large amounts of carbon, but recent climate change has led to drier conditions and increasing fire activity. The objective of this study is to quantify trends in fire size and frequency using data spanning multiple scales in space and time. We use multi-temporal Landsat image compositing on Google Earth Engine and validate results with reference fire maps from the Canadian Park Service. We also interpret general fire trends through the concept of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). Our study site is Wood Buffalo National Park, which is a fire hot spot in Canada due to frequent lightning ignitions. The relativize differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) was the most accurate Landsat-based burn severity metric we evaluated (52.2% producer's accuracy, 87.6% user's accuracy). The Landsat-based burn severity maps provided a better fit for a linear relationship on the log-log scale of fire size and frequency than a manually drawn fire map. Landsat-based fire trends since 1990 conformed to a power-law distribution with a slope of 1.9, which is related to fractal dimensions of the satellite-based fire perimeter shapes. The unburned and low-severity patches within the burn severity mosaic influenced the power-law slope and associated fractal dimensionality. This study demonstrates a multi-scale and multi-dataset technique to quantify general fire trends and changing fire cycles in remote locations and establishes a baseline database for assessing future fire activity. Testing criticality by power laws helps to quantify emergent trends of contemporary fire regimes, which could inform the strategic application of prescribed fire and other management activities. Natural resource managers can utilize information from this study to understand local ecosystem adaptability to large fire events and ecosystem stability in the context of recent increasing fire activity.

AB Drone applications are becoming increasingly common in the arena of forest management and forest inventories. In particular, the use of photogrammetrically derived drone-based image point clouds (DIPC) in individual tree detection has become popular. Use of an area-based approach (ABA) in small areas has also been considered. However, in-situ field measurements of sample plots substantially increase the cost of small area forest inventories. Therefore, we examined whether small-scale forest management inventories could be carried out without local field measurements. We used nationwide and regional ABA models for stem volumes fitted with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to predict stem volumes using corresponding metrics calculated from DIPC data. The stem volumes were predicted at the cell level (15 x 15 m) and aggregated to test plots (30 x 30 m). Height metrics for the dominant tree layer from the DIPC data showed strong correlations with similar metrics computed from the ALS data. The ALS-based models applied with DIPC metrics performed well, especially if the ABA model was fitted in the same geographical area (regional model) and the inventory units were disaggregated to coniferous and deciduous dominated stands using auxiliary information from Multi-source National Forest Inventory data (root mean square error at 30 x 30 m level was 13.1%). The corresponding root mean square error associated with the nationwide ABA model was 20.0% with an overestimation (mean difference 9.6%).

AB The extent, timing and duration of seasonal freeze/thaw (FT) state exerts dominant control on boreal forest carbon, water and energy cycle processes. Recent and on-going L-Band (approximate to 1.4 GHz) spaceborne missions have the potential to provide enhanced information on FT state over large geographic regions with rapid revisit time. However, the low spatial resolution of these spaceborne observations ( 45 km) makes it difficult to isolate the primary contributions (soil, vegetation, snow) to the FT signal in boreal forest. To better quantify these controls, two L-Band radiometers were deployed (September 2016 to July 2017) at a black spruce (Picea mariana) dominated boreal forest site; one unit above and one unit on the ground surface below the canopy to disentangle the microwave contributions of overstory canopy, and the ground surface on the FT brightness temperature (TB) signal. Bi-weekly multi-angular measurements from both units were combined in order to estimate effective scattering albedo (omega) and the microwave vegetative optical depth (tau), using the tau-omega microwave vegetation radiative transfer model. Soil moisture probes were inserted in the trunk of two black spruce and one larch (Larix laricina) trunks located in the footprint of the above-canopy radiometer to measure tree trunk relative dielectric constant (RDCtree). Results showed a strong relationship between RDCtree and tree skin temperature (Thee) under freezing temperature conditions, which led to a gradual decrease of tau in winter. During the spring thawing period in April and May, tau remained relatively stable. In contrast, it increased substantially in June, most likely in relation to the growing season onset. Overall, tau was related to the seasonal RDCtree cycle (r = 0.76). Regarding omega, a value of 0.086 (+/- 0.029) was obtained, but no dependency on T-tree or RDCtree was observed. Despite the observed impact of FT on vegetation L-Band signals, results from continuous TB observations spanning from 14 September 2016 to 25 May 2017, indicated that the main contribution to the observed L-Band TB freeze-up signal in the fall originated from the ground surface. The above-canopy unit showed some sensitivity to overstory canopy FT, yet the sensitivity was lower compared to the signal induced by the ground FT. In April and May, L-Band radiometer FT retrieval agreed closely to the melt onset detection using ADC, but it was likely related to the coincident presence of liquid water in the snow. Our findings have important applications to L-Band spaceborne FT algorithm development and validation across the boreal forest. More specifically, our findings allow better quantification of the potential effect of frozen ground on various biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes in boreal forests.

AB Outbreaks of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) in Europe generate considerable economic and environmental damage, and this plant pest continues to spread. Detecting and monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease symptoms caused by Xf at a large scale is key to curtailing its expansion and mitigating its impacts. Here, we combined 3-D radiative transfer modelling (3D-RTM), which accounts for the seasonal background variations, with passive optical satellite data to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of Xf infections in olive orchards. We developed a 3D-RTM approach to predict Xf infection incidence in olive orchards, integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery and freely available Sentinel-2 satellite data with radiative transfer modelling and field observations. Sentinel-2A time series data collected over a two-year period were used to assess the temporal trends in Xf-infected olive orchards in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Hyperspectral images spanning the same two-year period were used for validation, along with field surveys; their high resolution also enabled the extraction of soil spectrum variations required by the 3D-RTM to account for canopy background effect. Temporal changes were validated with more than 3000 trees from 16 orchards covering a range of disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) levels. Among the wide range of structural and physiological vegetation indices evaluated from Sentinel-2 imagery, the temporal variation of the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) showed superior performance for DS and DI estimation (r(VALUES)(2) > 0.7, p < 0.001). When seasonal understory changes were accounted for using modelling methods, the error of DI prediction was reduced 3-fold. Thus, we conclude that the retrieval of DI through model inversion and Sentinel-2 imagery can form the basis for operational vegetation damage monitoring worldwide. Our study highlight the value of interpreting temporal variations in model retrievals to detect anomalies in vegetation health.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) provides an effective tool to study slow-moving landslides. However, InSAR observations are often contaminated by tropospheric artefacts due to spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric refractivity. Particularly, the topography-dependent stratified delays may introduce seasonal oscillation biases into InSAR-measured deformation time series under steep terrains, which cannot be removed by conventional spatial and temporal filtering. In this study we proposed two complementary approaches to correct the stratified tropospheric delays for time series InSAR analysis when studying single landslides. One is the Iterative Linear Model (ILM) as an improved version of the traditional Linear Model (LM). The other is to fuse tropospheric delays predicted by several global weather models (FDWM) with different temporal intervals and spatial resolutions. Both methods are integrated into the standard Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) time series analysis procedure. We evaluated the proposed methods in three landslide-prone areas in southwest China using Sentinel-1 datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the ILM method removed the seasonal stratified delays mixed in deformation time series, unaffected by the deforming points. The FDWM method achieved an optimal combination of tropospheric delay predictions by four weather models, i.e. ERA-Interim, ERAS, HRES ECMWF, and MERRA-2. Validations using in-situ GPS measurements suggested that the original Root Mean Squared (RMS) values of interferometric phases declined by more than 35% after both ILM and FDWM corrections. The ILM had better performances than the FDWM to correct stratified delay for single landslides, whereas the FDWM can be an effective alternative when the ILM is inapplicable in case of limited coherent points.

AB In April and May 2010 the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull experienced an explosive eruption that led to substantial ashfall across the central-southern parts of the island. The resulting ash deposits covered Eyjafjallajokull, Myrdalsjokull and parts of Vatnajokull ice caps. In order to quantify the influence of these deposits on albedo, we analyzed albedo evolution across Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps over the period 2001-2016 using the MOD10A1 and MCD43A3 data products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. A geostatistical model with a daily temporal resolution was used to delineate areas on the ice caps that show distinct ash cover-related albedo reductions over the post-eruption period. Results suggest that despite an overall decrease of the ash cover-related albedo reductions with time, noticeable albedo reductions persist on both, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull over the entire post-eruption period. These reductions show means of 0.19 +/- 0.11 and 0.17 +/- 0.10, respectively, and occur most prominently during the summer seasons. Persistent albedo reductions are in agreement with and limited to areas of higher ash deposition during the volcanic eruption such as the southern parts of Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull ice caps. In addition, redistribution of Eyjafjallajokull ash deposited on the lowlands in southern Iceland contributed to dust storm events in the years after the eruption and caused additional albedo reductions.

AB Indicators of vegetation composition, vegetation structure, bare ground cover, and gap size in drylands potentially gives information about the condition of ecosystems, in part because they are strongly related to factors such as erosion, wildlife habitat characteristics, and the suitability for some land uses. Field data collection based on points does not produce spatially continuous information about surface indicators and cannot cover vast geographic areas. Remote sensing is possibly a labor- and time-saving method to estimate important biophysical indicators of vegetation and surface condition at both temporal and spatial scales impossible with field methods. Regression models based on machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), can build relationships between field and remotely sensed data, while also providing error estimates. In this study, field data including over 15,000 points from the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands throughout the Western U.S., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance products with ancillary data were used as predictor variables in a k-fold cross-validation approach to RF modeling. RF regression models were built to predict fourteen indicators of vegetation cover and height, as well as bare gap parameters. The RF model estimates exhibited good correlations with independent samples, with a low bias and a low RMSE. External cross-validation showed good agreement with out-of-bag (OOB) errors produced by RF and also allowed mapping prediction uncertainty. Predicted distribution maps of the surface indicators were produced by using these relationships across the arid and semiarid Western U.S. The bias and RMSE distribution maps show that the sample insufficiency and unevenly pattern of sample strongly impact the accuracy of the RF regression and prediction. The results from this study clearly show the utility of RF as a means to estimate multiple dryland surface indicators from remotely sensed data, and the reliability of the OOB errors in assessing the accuracy of the predictions.

AB Current plant species diversity of the forest herb layer is influenced by site conditions, seed banks, stand age and historic canopy dynamics, induced for example by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985-2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson's diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R-2 between 0.13 and 0.63. We conclude that disturbances, canopy closure, as well as stand age, as represented in NDVI time series, influence the diversity in the herb layer in five of the six examined forest types. Our study shows that information on historic canopy dynamics, detected from Landsat time series, can contribute to a better understanding of current herb layer diversity in some forest types. This study gives first indications on the potential of temporal metrics of Landsat time series in biodiversity research.

AB Landsat Thematic Mapper has been collecting multispectral imagery at 30 m resolution globally since 1984. One utility of the data has been for detailed mapping of agricultural regions and seasonal identification of crops grown within them. However, the ability to do so has only been applied sporadically and eluded widespread adoption due to cost of the imagery, burdensome preprocessing requirements, and computing not being up to the task. These hurdles have become much reduced of recent with the free and open distribution of the Landsat imagery, emphasis on ready-to-use surface reflectance data products, and distributed high performance computing infrastructures available online in "the cloud." As such, this work leverages these aspects and investigates the ability to retrospectively map summer crops over the United States (US) annually from 1984 to 2007. Google's Earth Engine Internet-based analytical platform containing the historical Landsat archive in surface reflectance format was used as a foundation for the classification work. Robust 30 m Cropland Data Layer (CDL) information from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for years 2008 through 2011 were leveraged to train rule-based classifiers which were applied back through time to each year 1984 through 2007. Focus crops were corn, soybeans, and winter wheat - the three largest by area in the US. A large sampling of highly intensive counties throughout the country were prototyped for generation of the 24 years of historical crop cover. For validation, crop area statistics were calculated for each county-year and compared to survey-based information existing from the USDA. Results were muted overall with the average crop area coefficient of determination (R-2) correlations for the years 1984-2007 found to be 0.192, 0.159, and 0.142 for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviations were variable at 0.132, 0.177, and 0.133, also respectively. While unimpressive, it was found as a benchmark that the R2 between the 2008 through 2017 CDL classifications were only 0.478, 0.686, and 0.726 and thus a suggestion that the USDA area statistics are an imperfect measure of map accuracy. Deletion of approximately one third to one half of the grossest 1984-2007 outlier years from the historical outputs pulled the correlations to the benchmark standard. Qualitatively, most of the remaining years classified looked of high quality and were believed useful as field-level thematic crop area maps. These historical cropland maps could provide the ability to better detail the role farming has played on the broad US landscape over recent decades.

AB Wetlands hold the highest density of belowground carbon stocks on earth, provide myriad biogeochemical and habitat functions, and are at increasing risk of degradation due to climate and land use change. Microtopographic variation is a common and functionally important feature of wetlands but is challenging to quantify, constraining estimates of the processes and functions (e.g., habitat diversity, carbon storage) that it regulates. We introduce a novel method of quantifying fine-scale microtopographic structure with Terrestrial Laser Scanning using 10 black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA as test cases. Our method reconstructs surface models with fine detail on the order of 1 cm. Our independent validation verifies the surface models capture hummock (local high points) and hollow (local low points) features with high precision (RMSE = 3.67 cm) and low bias (1.26 cm). A sensitivity analysis of surface model resolution showed a doubling of model error between 1 cm and 50 cm resolutions, suggesting high-resolution reconstructions most precisely capture surface variation. We also compared five classification methods at resolutions ranging from 1 cm to 1 m and determined that maximum likelihood classification at 25 cm resolution most accurately (78.7%) identifies hummock and hollow features, but a simple thresholding of surface model elevation and slope was ideal for hummock feature delineation, retaining over 91% of hummock areas. Finally, we test and validate a novel microtopographic delineation method (TopoSeg) that accurately (Bias = 0.2-11.9%, RMSE = 19.6-24.1%) estimates the height, area, volume, and perimeter of individual hummock features. For the first time, we introduce an accurate and automated approach for quantifying fine-scale microtopography through high resolution surface models, feature classification, and feature delineation, enabling geospatial statistics that can explain spatial heterogeneity of habitat structure, soil processes, and carbon storage in wetland systems.

AB Satellite time-series data are bolstering global change research, but their use to elucidate land changes and vegetation dynamics is sensitive to algorithmic choices. Different algorithms often give inconsistent or sometimes conflicting interpretations of the same data. This lack of consensus has adverse implications and can be mitigated via ensemble modeling, an algorithmic paradigm that combines many competing models rather than choosing only a single "best" model. Here we report one such time-series decomposition algorithm for deriving nonlinear ecosystem dynamics across multiple timescales-A Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). As an ensemble algorithm, BEAST quantifies the relative usefulness of individual decomposition models, leveraging all the models via Bayesian model averaging. We tested it upon simulated, Landsat, and MODIS data. BEAST detected changepoints, seasonality, and trends in the data reliably; it derived realistic nonlinear trends and credible uncertainty measures (e.g., occurrence probability of changepoints over time) some information difficult to derive by conventional single-best-model algorithms but critical for interpretation of ecosystem dynamics and detection of low-magnitude disturbances. The combination of many models enabled BEAST to alleviate model misspecification, address algorithmic uncertainty, and reduce over fitting. BEAST is generically applicable to time-series data of all kinds. It offers a new analytical option for robust changepoint detection and nonlinear trend analysis and will help exploit environmental time-series data for probing patterns and drivers of ecosystem dynamics.

AB Maps of urban tree canopy are essential to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem services, and to determine who benefits from them. Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m(2), three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m(2) on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m(2), which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5-81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE) decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block. Our work is comparable to past efforts to map urban tree canopy, and the open source software and use of imagery that is freely available for all cities in the contiguous US make it broadly applicable.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter is the coherent combination of the scattering from multiple individual scatterers within the radar resolution cell, which results into a 2-D radar image. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) takes advantage of multiple SAR acquisitions to provide 3-D vertical structure of the imaged target. Over forests, parameters such as canopy structure, canopy density, leaf area and phenology contribute to different SAR scattering mechanisms along the vertical dimension of the trees. Tomography has been demonstrated in various earlier works for forest bio-physical parameter estimation using airborne data. In this research work, multi-polarimetric space-borne TanDEM-X tomograms are examined for the first time over a multi-species Indian tropical forest. Multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions are focused using Capon beamforming at five polarimetric channels - HH, HV, VV, HH - VV and HH + VV. Four distinct forest species compartments are selected representing different canopy structure and density. The tomograms obtained in different polarizations for these species are analyzed in detail to understand the scattering patterns across different forest species. Field surveys carried out in several forest locations provide in situ observations of forest height and vertical structure. It was observed that canopy gaps and leaf density play a crucial role for X-band SAR signal penetration through ground. For dense canopy species the backscatter contributions are spread through the canopy, while in case of sparse canopy species, the ground scattering is dominant. Vertical profiles obtained at surveyed plot locations are plotted in all polarizations, and provide a good agreement with field observations. Further, the obtained TomoSAR backscatter layers have a good correlation with field measured above-ground biomass (AGB). The AGB is modeled from TomoSAR with the HH-pol TomoSAR backscatter layer at 27 m canopy height leading to an AGB estimation with correlation r = 0.76 and RMSE of 50.4 t/ha.

AB Surface seawater partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) is a critical parameter in the quantification of air-sea CO2 flux, which further plays an important role in quantifying the global carbon budget and understanding ocean acidification. Yet, the remote estimation of pCO(2) in coastal waters (under influences of multiple processes) has been difficult due to complex relationships between environmental variables and surface pCO(2). To date there is no unified model to remotely estimate surface pCO(2) in oceanic regions that are dominated by different oceanic processes. In our study area, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through the evaluation of different approaches, including multi-linear regression (MLR), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), principle component regression (PCR), decision tree, supporting vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN), and random forest based regression ensemble (RFRE). After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise datasets, the RFRE model proved to be the best approach. The RFRE model was trained using data comprised of extensive pCO(2) datasets (collected over 16 years by many groups) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) estimated sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl), and diffuse attenuation of downwelling irradiance (Kd). This RFRE-basedpCO(2) model allows for the estimation of surface pCO(2) from satellites with a spatial resolution of 1 km. It showed an overall performance of a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 9.1 mu atm, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95, a mean bias (MB) of - 0.03 mu atm, a mean ratio (MR) of 1.00, an unbiased percentage difference (UPD) of 0.07%, and a mean ratio difference (MRD) of 0.12% for pCO(2) ranging between 145 and 550 mu atm. The model, with its original parameterization, has been tested with independent datasets collected over the entire GOM, with satisfactory performance in each case (RMSD of <= similar to 10 mu atm for open GOM waters and RMSD of <= similar to 25 mu atm for coastal and river-dominated waters). The sensitivity of the RFRE-based pCO(2) model to uncertainties of each input environmental variable was also thoroughly examined. The results showed that all induced uncertainties were close to, or within, the uncertainty of the model itself with higher sensitivity to uncertainties in SST and SSS than to uncertainties in Chl and Kd. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity analysis indicate the robustness of the RFRE model in estimating surface pCO(2) for the range of 145-550 mu atm in most GOM waters. The RFRE model approach was applied to the Gulf of Maine (a contrasting oceanic region to GOM), with local model training. The results showed significant improvement over other models suggesting that the RFRE may serve as a robust approach for other regions once sufficient field measured pCO(2) data are available for model training.

AB Surface roughness can be defined as the mean slope angle integrated over all scales from the grain size to the local topography. It controls the energy balance of bare soils, in particular the angular distribution of scattered and emitted radiation. This provides clues to understand the intimate structure and evolution of planetary surfaces over ages. In this article we investigate the capacity of the Hapke photometric model, the most widely used in planetary science, to retrieve surface roughness from multiangular reflectance data. Its performance is still a question at issue and we lack validation experiments comparing model retrievals with ground measurements. To address this issue and to show the potentials and limits of the Hapke model, we compare the mean slope angle determined from very high resolution digital elevation models of volcanic and sedimentary terrains sampled in the Asal-Ghoubbet rift (Republic of Djibouti), to the photometric roughness estimated by model inversion on multiangular reflectance data measured on the ground (Chamelon field goniometer) and from space (Pleiades images). The agreement is good on moderately rough surfaces, in the domain of validity of the Hapke model, and poor on others.

AB The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched on September 15th, 2018 and this mission offers an extraordinary opportunity to contribute to an assessment of forest resources at multiple spatial scales. This study served to develop a methodology for utilizing ICESat-2 data over vegetated areas. The specific objectives were to: (1) derive a simulated ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar (PCL) vegetation product using airborne lidar data, (2) examine the use of simulated PCL metrics for modelling aboveground biomass (AGB) along ICESat-2 profiles using a simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product and reference AGB estimated from airborne lidar data, and (3) estimate forest canopy cover using simulated PCL canopy product data and airborne lidar-derived canopy cover. Using existing airborne lidar data for Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in Texas and known ICESat-2 track locations, PCL simulations were carried out. Three scenarios were analyzed in this study; 1) simulated data without the addition of noise, 2) processed simulated data for daytime, and 3) nighttime scenarios. Segments measuring 100 m along the proposed ICESat-2 tracks were used to extract simulated PCL metrics from each of the three data scenarios and spatially coincident, reference airborne lidar-estimated AGB and airborne lidar canopy cover estimates. Linear regression models were then developed with a subset of the simulated PCL segments to estimate AGB and canopy cover and their performance assessed using separate testing sets. AGB model testing with the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios resulted in R-2 values of 0.79, 0.79 and 0.63 respectively, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 19.16 Mg/ha, 19.23 Mg/ha, and 25.35 Mg/ha. Predictive models for canopy cover (4.6 m) achieved R-2 values of 0.93, 0.75 and 0.63 and RMSE values of 6.36%, 12.33% and 15.01% for the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios respectively. Findings from this study suggest the potential of ICESat-2 for estimating AGB, given the photon detection rate and background noise anticipated by ICESat-2 under temperate forest settings, and especially in the data format provided by standard ICESat-2 data vegetation products.

AB One of the most important characteristics of any quantitative method is its detection limit, which is the lowest detectable amount of analyte in a sample in a given method. The detection limit helps to know to which extent a method is applicable and valid. The detection of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in bare soils is important, because of its vast distribution and its negative effects on humans and the environment. Hyperspectral remote sensing is an acceptable, cost-effective and spatially comprehensive tool, which has detection possibilities of petroleum hydrocarbon. However, previous studies that engaged with this topic did not directly consider the detection limit of the method and no detection limit has been systematically explored. In this study, an outdoor experiment was executed in which three types of soil were contaminated with 14 levels of pure crude oil and measured in outdoor conditions with a hyperspectral camera (950-2500 nm) at three distances from the camera (4, 8 and 12 m). For each soil type, and for each distance, the detection limit was systematically calculated. The results show that the detection limit is a dynamic range affected by the spatial domain and the soil type. Moreover, a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the average detection limit (1.32, 2.09 and 2.90 wt %) of the three soil types was found, suggesting that the detection limit is not only related to the PHC wt% but also depends on the soil type. The results presented in this study can help to improve our understanding of the limitations of hyperspectral remote sensing in direct detection of petroleum hydrocarbon and can be projected to other hyperspectral domains and soils.

AB The distribution of snow cover is critical for predicting ecohydrological processes and underpins mountain water supplies in ranges like the Sierra Nevada in the Western United States. Many key water supply areas are covered by montane forests, which have substantial effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt. In-situ observations of snow-forest interactions have limited spatial coverage and remote sensing using optical sensors (e.g. MODIS) cannot observe snow cover below the canopy. In this study, we developed and verified a lidar-based method to detect snow cover under canopy, investigated how fractional snow covered area (fSCA) varies with topography in open versus under canopy areas and developed a correction factor that could be used to improve satellite derived fSCA products. We developed our new method using three snow-on lidar overflights and verified it with in-situ distributed temperature sensor (DTS) observations at Sagehen Creek watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. DTS validation of lidar classifications showed excellent agreement at 85-96%, including high agreement and large number of returns in under canopy locations. The lidar-derived fSCA observations generally showed earlier snow disappearance under the canopy than in open positions, which is consistent with relatively warm temperatures and greater longwave radiation. However, in contrast to expectations, areas with high solar exposure (i.e. high southwestness) exhibited higher fSCA under the canopy. Results indicated that the k factor (the ratio of under canopy fSCA to open fSCA) varied systematically with southwestness and elevation. Using this factor to correct the study domain fSCA indicated that the typical assumption that k = 1 could lead to an up to similar to 0.05 bias (in fSCA units) towards overestimation. However, within 10 and 100-m individual pixels the fSCA overprediction bias can be 25-30% for higher fSCA values. Although uncertainty would be reduced using higher snow-on lidar point densities, our method shows promise to improve the typical assumption that snow disappearance is identical in under the canopy and in the open (k = 1). Future applications of our lidar-based method at different sites with varying climate, topography and vegetation structure has the dual potential to expand understanding of snow-forest interactions in complex terrain and improve operational fSCA products.

AB Hydraulic variables obtained from remotely sensed data have been successfully used to estimate river discharge (Q). However, most studies have used a rating curve based on a single hydraulic variable or the Manning equation (multiplicative method). In this study, we developed a mathematically different approach to estimating Q by applying the ensemble learning regression method (here termed ELQ), which is one of the machine learning techniques that linearly combine several functions to reduce errors, over the Congo mainstem as a test-bed. Using the training dataset (November 2002 - November 2006) of water levels (H) derived from different Envisat altimetry observations, the ELQ-estimated Q at the Brazzaville in-situ station showed reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 823 m(3) s(-1) (relative RMSE (RMSE normalized by the average in-situ Q, RRMSE) of 2.08%) compared to the Q obtained using a single rating curve. ELQ also showed improved performance for the validation dataset (December 2006 - September 2010). Based on the error analysis, we found the correlation coefficients between input variables affect the performance of ELQ. Thus, we introduced an index, termed the Degree of compensation (I-DoC), which describes how ELQ performs compared to the classic hydraulic relation (e.g., H-Q rating curve). The performance of ELQ improves when I-DoC increases because the additional information could be added in the ELQ process. Since ELQ can combine several variables obtained over different locations, it would be advantageous, particularly if there exist few virtual stations along a river reach. It is expected that ELQ can be also applied to the products of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will provide direct measurements of surface water slope (5), effective river width (W-e), and H, to be launched in 2021.

AB Many applications that target dynamic land surface processes require a temporal observation frequency that is not easily satisfied using data from a single optical sensor. Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide observations of similar nature and offer the opportunity to combine both data sources to increase time-series temporal frequency at high spatial resolution. Multi-sensor image compositing is one way for performing pixel-level data integration and has many advantages for processing frameworks, especially if analyses over larger areas are targeted. Our compositing approach is optimized for narrow temporal-intervals and allows the derivation of time-series of consistent reflectance composites that capture field level phenologies. We processed more than a year's worth of imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. We used all data acquired over Germany and integrated observations into composites for three defined temporal intervals (10-day, monthly and seasonal). Our processing approach includes generation of proxy values for OLI in the MSI red edge bands and temporal gap filling on the 10-day time-series. We then derive a national scale crop type and land cover map and compare our results to spatially explicit agricultural reference data available for three federal states and to the results of a recent agricultural census for the entire country. The resulting map successfully captures the crop type distribution across Germany at 30 m resolution and achieves 81% overall accuracy for 12 classes in three states for which reference data was available. The mapping performance for most classes was highest for the 10-day composites and many classes are discriminated with class specific accuracies > 80%. For several crops, such as cereals, maize and rapeseed our mapped acreages compare very well with the official census data with average differences between mapped and census area of 11%, 2% and 3%, respectively. Other classes (grapevine and forest classes) perform slightly less well, likely, because the available reference data does not fully capture the variability of these classes across Germany. The inclusion of the red edge bands slightly improved overall accuracies in all cases and improved class specific accuracies for most crop classes. Similarly, our gap filling procedure led to improved mapping accuracies when compared to nongap-filled 10-day features. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of approaches that utilize data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat which allows for detailed assessments of agricultural and other land-uses over large areas.

AB High-quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data are important for many regional and global ecological and environmental applications. Unfortunately, residual noise in current NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications. Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11 phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based, and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period. In addition, implementing STSG required only raw MODIS NDVI time-series products without any additional burden of data requirements. All of these advantages make STSG a promising noise-reduction method for generating high quality NDVI time-series data.

AB The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) is an airborne high resolution imaging spectrometer built at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for evaluating solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). OCO-2 is a NASA mission designed to measure atmospheric CO2 but one of the novel data products is SIF, retrieved using reductions in the optical depth of Fraunhofer lines in OCO-2's O-2 Aband, covering 757-775 nm at 0.042 nm spectral resolution. CFIS was specifically designed to retrieve SIF within the wavelength range of OCO-2, but extends further down to 737 nm, nearly maintaining the high spectral resolution of the OCO-2 instrument (0.07 vs. 0.042 nm). Here, we provide an overview of the instrument calibration and performance as well as the retrieval strategy based on non-linear weighted least-squares. To illustrate the retrieval performance using actual flight data, we focus on data acquired over agricultural fields in Mead, Nebraska from an unpressurized Twin Otter (DHC-6) aircraft at a flight altitude of 3000 m above ground level (AGL). Spectral residuals are consistent with expected detector noise, which enables us to compute realistic 1-alpha precision errors of 0.5-0.7 W/m(2)/sr/mu m for typical SIF retrievals, which can be reduced to < 0.2 W/m(2)/sr/mu m when individual data is gridded at 30 m spatial resolution. The 30 m resolution also enabled direct comparison with the Crop Data Layer from the National Agricultural Statistics Service as well as Landsat imagery (NDVI, EVI, T-sk(in)), taken just a day prior to the CFIS overflights. Results show consistently higher vegetation indices and SIF values over soy fields compared to corn, likely due to the respective phenological stage, which might already have affected chlorophyll content and canopy structure (August 15, 2016). While this work is intended to highlight the technical capabilities and performance of CFIS, the comparisons against Landsat and crop types provide insights into how CFIS can be used to study mechanisms related to photosynthesis at fine spatial scales, with the fidelity needed to obtain un-biased SIF retrievals void of atmospheric correction.

AB Understanding forest dynamics at the landscape scale is critical given the demands of sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat time series. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances). This ongoing element of forest dynamics is often under-reported. The method was tested over 3.7 million ha of public land sclerophyll forests, where multiple disturbance events have occurred over the last 30 years (1987-2016). Our models of disturbance and recovery levels obtained overall accuracies of 78.6% and 72.3% for primary and secondary disturbance events, respectively. The overall accuracies for the models of disturbance causal agents were 80.7% and 73.0%, respectively. The data cube reported an average annual disturbance rate of 4.2% per year. This was dominated by newly detected disturbance (2.7% per year) as distinct from ongoing disturbance that was, however, considerable (1.5% per year). Our approach presented herein can improve the understanding of forest dynamics over long time periods and large areas and has potential for supporting land managers.

AB The unique adaptation of lichens to repeated cycles of drying and rehydration makes them ideal subjects for developing remote sensing methodologies for water content estimation. This laboratory-based study evaluates the suitability of simple ratios (SR) and normalized difference indices (NDI), from several spectral regions; visible to near infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm), short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1000-2500 nm) and mid-wave infrared (MWIR, 2500-5500 nm) in the water content estimation of seven lichen species. The utilization of a wide wavelength range and several different lichen species allowed the evaluation of the robustness of the water content indices. Our results show that although there was high variability between different lichen species in their spectral responses to increasing water content, the best indices predicted water content accurately for the combination of species (RMSE 16.3%, 10.3% and 13.9% for the test set, in the VNIR, SWIR and MWIR regions, respectively). Generally the NDI indices were found to be slightly better than the SR indices.

AB We analyzed the evolution processes of two tabular icebergs, C28A and C28B, originating from iceberg C28, using continuous multisource radar remote sensing data. The monitoring began during the calving of iceberg C28 from the Mertz Ice Tongue in February 2010 and ended in April 2012. The evolution of the iceberg area was determined from ENVISAT ASAR images, and the freeboard change was derived from CryoSat-2 profiles. Two patterns of iceberg area decreases are observed during iceberg drifting. In austral summer (from October to next March), iceberg area shows a gradual decrease and it is interpreted to represent edge wasting, sidewall melting and wave erosion, the gradual decrease of the area of C28A occurred at rates between 8.1 km(2)/month and 16.5 km(2)/month. In austral winter (from April to September), iceberg area has several discrete decreases (sudden drop) while it remained constant for most of the time, and it is interpreted to be large rift calving primarily caused by ocean swell and basal melting. Calving area of the two studied icebergs is observed to be greater in the winter. The freeboard decreased at different rates at different locations on the same iceberg (between -0.02 +/- 0.22 and -0.82 +/- 0.28 m/month for C28A and C28B), suggesting a laterally inhomogeneous melting of icebergs. The average rate of change of the C28B freeboard during its 22-month grounding period was -0.03 +/- 0.01 m/month, which is considerably smaller than the -0.76 +/- 0.23 m/month observed when it was freely drifting in the ocean. The cold-water regime surrounding the iceberg can help the iceberg maintain a stable state. This study reveals the potential use of radar remote sensing when monitoring Antarctic icebergs.

AB Attributes that describe forest structure, such as height, canopy cover, volume, and biomass, are required to inform forest inventories and monitoring programs. Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been successfully demonstrated as a means to derive a suite of forest structure attributes at the plot level; however, these acquisitions are often constrained to limited spatial extents and to a given point in time. Sample based approaches for model development can accommodate the spatial limitations of lidar acquisitions when characterizing large areas. The combination of lidar plot data and time-series satellite imagery is well suited to provide spatially extensive, and temporally dense, information on forest structure and related dynamics over very large areas. In this research, we combine lidar plot-derived information with Landsat pixel-based composites to produce annual forest structure estimates from 1984 to 2016 over 650 million ha of Canada's forest ecosystems using a nearest neighbor imputation approach with a Random Forests-based distance metric. Imputed variables included lidar metrics of height (e.g., mean height, standard deviation of height) and cover, as well as area-based modelled inventory estimates of Lorey's height, basal area, stem volume, and biomass. Models were validated using reserved validation plots, with model R-2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.64 for lidar metrics of height and cover, and R-2 of 0.67, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.70 for Lorey's height, basal area, volume and biomass, respectively. Unique to this study was the assessment of model extension through time, with model performance for imputing lidar metrics evaluated at the forest stand-level using independent lidar data representing a latitudinal gradient of forest conditions and that was not used in model development. The period evaluated was 2006-2012, with R-2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.66 for height metrics, and 0.47-0.77 for cover metrics. Ultimately, we show how deriving forest structural estimates on an annual basis enables the analysis of both the dynamics and regional trends of undisturbed forest, as well as regenerating stands following stand-replacing disturbances (i.e., fire, harvesting).

AB Retrieval of ice cloud properties from passive remote satellite instruments using multispectral observations of the upwelling radiance at the top of atmosphere is challenging. This requires an accurate separation of the surface spectral reflectance below the cloud and that coming from the ice cloud particle. In this paper, a weighting-function based method is described, which retrieves ice cloud optical thickness (COT) and ice cloud crystal effective radius (CER). The retrieval algorithm belongs to the newly developed eXtensible Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm family, and is called XBAER-ice. The XBAER-ice retrieval uses a surface reflectance parameterization minimizing the impact of surface scattering on the retrieval of optically thin ice cloud properties. A fractal model is used to describe the ice cloud optical properties. The comparison of COT and CER between XBAER-ice and latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products shows good agreement. We note that ice cloud property retrievals are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the ice particle shape. The comparison between satellite derived COTs using both the MODIS C6 product and XBAER-ice algorithm agree well with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) in-situ measurements (with correlation coefficient above 0.9) whereas CERs show poorer agreement (similar to 0.6). The global spatial distribution patterns and values of COT from ice clouds retrieved by using the MODIS C6 and XBAER-ice algorithms show a high degree of consistency. The XBAER-ice derived ice cloud CER values are systematically smaller than the MODIS C6 product, but both products have similar spatial distribution patterns. The XBAER-ice offers a potential alternative algorithm for the synergistic operational retrieval of ice cloud properties from the observations of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3.

AB Laser altimetry offers the potential to monitor ice-sheet elevation changes with millimeter accuracy. While previous missions have used infrared lasers to make these measurements, NASA's upcoming ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)-2 mission will use a green laser. Because ice absorbs green light very weakly, in the absence of light-absorbing impurities, green photons can scatter off many snow grains before returning to the surface, delaying the return pulse and leading to an apparent downward shift in the snow surface. In this paper, we explore the effects of snow-grain size and impurity content on these measurements, and investigate strategies that might help minimize the biases they introduce. We find that an uninformed choice of measurement parameters (a windowed mean including a large range of photons around the surface) can result in > 0.45 m of apparent surface-height variation between large and small grain sizes. Other choices of measurement parameters, such as a windowed median, can reduce this uncertainty by a factor of two to three. In addition, measurements of surface reflectance at green and infrared wavelengths, and interpretation of return-pulse shapes may be used to estimate and correct for these biases.

AB This study presents a new 10 year of liquid water cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) climatology, and analyzes its long-term variation on both regional and global scales based on accurate depolarization ratio measurement from CALIPSO and 3.7 mu m cloud effective radius retrieval from MODIS. Compared with the widely used passive retrieval method (e.g., MODIS retrieval), which considers N-d as function of cloud optical depth, geometry thickness and effective radius, retrieval method of the new N-d dataset has a weak dependence upon the cloud adiabatic assumption and eliminates the possible bias caused by multilayer clouds. Statistical results show that the annual cycle and long-term variability of N-d retrieved by CALIPSO agree reasonably well with those obtained from MODIS retrieval method, especially over the stratocumulus regions (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Multiple regression models and contribution calculation verify that the variability of sulfate mass concentration dominates the long-term variation of N-d over most regions, even though the contribution factors and rates vary with different regions, temperatures and methods. In addition, our study also indicates that the impact of BC and OC on N-d should not be ignored, especially for supercooled water clouds over those important biomass burning regions. These results demonstrate the temperature-dependent N-d climatology derived from CALIOP has potential to be beneficial to climate research and reduce the uncertainties in estimates of the aerosol indirect effect in the model simulations.

TI ALES plus : Adapting a homogenous ocean retracker for satellite
   altimetry to sea ice leads, coastal and inland waters

AB Water level from sea ice-covered oceans is particularly challenging to retrieve with satellite radar altimeters due to the different shapes assumed by the returned signal compared with the standard open ocean waveforms. Valid measurements are scarce in large areas of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, because sea level can only be estimated in the openings in the sea ice (leads and polynyas). Similar signal-related problems affect also measurements in coastal and inland waters.
   This study presents a fitting (also called retracking) strategy (ALES +) based on a subwaveform retracker that is able to adapt the fitting of the signal depending on the sea state and on the slope of its trailing edge. The algorithm modifies the existing Adaptive Leading Edge Subwaveform retracker originally designed for coastal waters, and is applied to Envisat and ERS-2 missions.
   The validation in a test area of the Arctic Ocean demonstrates that the presented strategy is more precise than the dedicated ocean and sea ice retrackers available in the mission products. It decreases the retracking open ocean noise by over 1 cm with respect to the standard ocean retracker and is more precise by over 1 cm with respect to the standard sea ice retracker used for fitting specular echoes. Compared to an existing open ocean altimetry dataset, the presented strategy increases the number of sea level retrievals in the sea ice-covered area and the correlation with a local tide gauge. Further tests against in-situ data show that also the quality of coastal retrievals increases compared to the standard ocean product in the last 6 km within the coast.
   ALES + improves the sea level determination at high latitudes and is adapted to fit reflections from any water surface. If used in the open ocean and in the coastal zone, it improves the current official products based on ocean retrackers. First results in the inland waters show that the correlation between water heights from ALES + and from in-situ measurement is always over 0.95.

AB A first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use. Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.

AB Rapid urban population growth in Sub-Saharan Western Africa has important environmental, infrastructural and social impacts. Due to the low availability of reliable urbanization data, remote sensing techniques become increasingly popular for monitoring land use change processes in that region. This study aims to quantify land cover for the Ouagadougou metropolitan area between 2002 and 2013 using a Landsat-TM/ETM + /OLI time series. We use a support vector regression approach and synthetically mixed training data. Working with biseasonal image stacks, we account for spectral variability between dry and rainy season and incorporate a new class- seasonal vegetation- that describes surfaces that are soil and vegetation during parts of the year. We produce fraction images of urban surfaces, soil, permanent vegetation and seasonal vegetation for each time step. Statistical evaluation shows that a temporally generalized, hi-seasonal model over all time steps performs equally or better than yearly or mono-seasonal models and provides reliable cover fractions. Urban fractions can be used to visualize pixel-based spatial-temporal patterns of urban densification and expansion. A simple rule set based on a seasonal vegetation to soil ratio is appropriate to delineate areas of unplanned and planned settlements and, thus, contributes to monitoring urban development on a neighborhood scale.

AB Thermal infrared sensing from space is a well-developed field, but mixed pixels pose a problem for many applications. We present a field study in Dana Meadows, Yosemite National Park, California to scale from point (similar to 2-m resolution) to aerial (similar to 5-m resolution gridded, 1 km x 6 km extent) to satellite (MODIS, similar to 1000-m resolution, global extent) observations. We demonstrate how multiple thermal bands on MODIS can be used to separate snow and forest temperatures and determine the fractional snow-covered area (f(scA)) over a 3 km x 3 km array of 9 MODIS grid cells. During the day, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared bands provide a first guess of f(scA) and help to constrain the solution. This technique, which has estimated errors < 2 degrees C and 10% f(scA) for many expected conditions, enables better understanding of the snowpack energy balance, atmospheric inversions and cold air pools, and forest health.

AB Nonlinear Internal Waves (NLIWs) in the ocean are observable from passive satellite radiometers. The surface manifestations of these internally propagating waves are curvilinear bands demarcating relatively smooth and rough surface waters, providing a means for their detection via observations of sunglint. Typical horizontal scales of NLIWs are such that traditionally only high resolution (< 1 km pixel) sensors aboard polar orbiting satellites could resolve them. The launch on 28 October 2014 of the Japanese Meteorological Agency's Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and its Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) opens up possibilities to study the spatio-temporal change of these relatively small scale NLIW features from geostationary orbit. Himawari-8 provides 500-m resolution visible imagery every 10 min over a hemispheric field of regard centered at 140.7 degrees E longitude. These spatial and temporal resolutions allow for not only the identification of NLIWs over the low latitude regions such as the Indonesian Seas, but also the ability to track the evolution of these waves in real time. Here, we present examples of NLIWs as viewed from Himawari-8/AHI and calculate a few basic wave quantities, including wavelength and propagation speed. These quantities were found to be consistent with previous observations and model simulations of NLIWs, but observations from AHI provide the ability to calculate wave propagation speeds in the same locations over multiple times a day for multiple days, which is impossible with polar-orbiting satellite data. Geostationary observations will augment the existing database of observed NLIWs and help to better quantify their spatial and temporal attributes.

AB Global coastal and freshwater wetlands provide ecosystem services valued at over $200,000 USD per hectare per year. Despite their value, wetlands continue to be lost at alarming rates worldwide, with as much as 71% of global wetland extent being converted to other land-cover types since 1900. Targeted conservation and restoration efforts, however, have proven successful, particularly in Europe and North America. Such efforts require accurate protocols to identify, assess, and map wetlands repeatedly to enable detection of change. High resolution (i.e. 2-meter pixel) satellite imagery has proven effective to map wetlands at higher accuracies than historical 30-meter or coarser satellite data. We describe a method to process and classify high volumes of multispectral high-resolution satellite data to update wetland maps. We show the results of a study conducted with 130 2-meter resolution WorldView-2 satellite images to map forested wetland, upland, water, bare land, and developed lands in a 6500 km(2) watershed. The processing of the map was completed in under 24 h and was more accurate at identifying forested wetland (78%) and upland (64%) than three previous, widely used maps of the same area (45-65%, and 49-53%, respectively). This method offers high potential for monitoring change in coastal areas and adjacent watersheds over large geographic scales.

AB The upcoming Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission will offer prospects for mapping and monitoring biomass and carbon of terrestrial ecosystems over large areas using photon counting LiDAR data. In this paper, we aim to develop a methodology to derive terrain elevation and vegetation canopy height from test-bed sensor data and further pre-validate the capacity of the mission to meet its science objectives for the ecosystem community. We investigated a novel methodological framework with two essential steps for characterizing terrain and canopy height using Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental LiDAR (MABEL) data and simulated ICESat-2 data with various vegetation conditions. Our algorithm first implements a multi-level noise filtering approach to minimize noise photons and subsequently classifies the remaining photons into ground and top of canopy using an overlapping moving window method and cubic spline interpolation. Results of noise filtering show that the design of the multi-level filtering process is effective to identify background noise and preserve signal photons in the raw data. Moreover, calibration results using MABEL and simulated ICESat-2 data share similar trends with the retrieved terrain being more accurate than the retrieved canopy height, and the nighttime results being better than corresponding daytime results. Compared to the results of simulated ICESat-2 data, MABEL data achieve lower accuracy for ground and canopy heights in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), which may partly result from the inconsistency between MABEL and reference data. Specifically, simulated ICESat-2 data using 115 various nighttime and daytime scenarios, yield average RMSE values of 1.83 m and 2.80 m for estimated ground elevation, and 2.70 m and 3.59 m for estimated canopy height. Additionally, the accuracy assessment of percentile heights of simulated ICESat-2 data further substantiates the robustness of the methodology from different perspectives. The methodology developed in this study illustrates plausible ways of processing the data that are structurally similar to expected ICESat-2 data and holds the potential to be a benchmark for further method adjustment once genuine ICESat-2 are available.

AB With the increasing availability of spectral sensors and consumer-grade data processing software, a democratization of imaging spectroscopy is taking place. In particular, novel lightweight 2D spectral imagers in combination with UAVs are increasingly being adapted for imaging spectroscopy. In contrast to traditional line scanners, these sensors capture spectral information as a 2D image within every exposure. With computer vision algorithms embedded in consumer grade software packages, these data can be processed to hyperspectral digital surface models that hold spectral and 3D spatial information in very high resolution. To understand the spectral signal, however, one must comprehend the complexity of the capturing and data processing process in imaging spectroscopy with 2D imagers.
   This study establishes the theoretical background to comprehend the properties of spectral data acquired with 2D imagers and investigates how different data processing schemes influence the data. To improve the interpretability of a spectral signal derived for an area of interest (AOI, the specific field of view is introduced as a concept to understand the composition of pixels and their angular properties used to characterize a specific AOI within a remote sensing scene.
   These considerations are applied to a multi-temporal field study carried out under different illumination conditions in a barley field phenotyping experiment. It is shown that data processing significantly affects the angular properties of the spectral data and influences the apparent spectral signature. The largest differences are found in the red domain, where the signal differs by approximately 10% relative to a single nadir image. Even larger differences of approximately 14% are found in comparison with ground-based non-imaging field spectrometer measurements. The differences are explained by investigating the interaction between the angular properties of the data and canopy anisotropy, which are wavelength and growth stage dependent. Additionally, it is shown that common vegetation indices cannot normalize the differences and that the retrieval of chlorophyll is affected. In conclusion, this study helps to understand the process of imaging spectroscopy with 2D imagers and provides recommendations for future missions.

AB Common requirements for cloud detection methods including the adjustability with respect to incorrect results are clarified, and a method is proposed that satisfies the requirements by applying the support vector machine (SVM). Because the conditions of clouds and Earth's surfaces vary widely, incorrect results in actual cloud detection operations are unavoidable. Cloud detection methods therefore should be adjustable to easily reduce the frequency of incorrect results under certain conditions, without causing new incorrect results under other conditions. Cloud detection methods are also required to resolve a characteristic issue: the boundary between clear-sky and cloudy-sky areas in nature is vague, because the density of the cloud particles continuously varies. This vagueness makes the cloud definition subjective. Furthermore, the training dataset preparation for machine learning should avoid circular arguments. The SVM learning is generally less likely to result in overfitting: this study suggests that only typical data are sufficient for the SVM training dataset. By incorporating the discriminant analysis (DA), it is possible to subjectively determine the definition of typical cloudy and clear sky and to obtain typical cloud data without direct cloud detection. In an approach to adjust the classifier, data typical of certain conditions that lead to incorrect results are added to the training dataset. In this study, an adjustment procedure is proposed, which quantitatively judges, whether an addition is actually effective for reduction of the frequency of incorrect results. Another approach for the adjustment is improving feature space used for cloud detection. Indices as quantitative guidance to estimate whether an addition or elimination of a feature actually reduces the frequency of incorrect results can be obtained from the analysis of the support vectors. The cloud detection method incorporating the SVM is therefore able to integrate practical adjustment procedures. Applications of this method to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data demonstrate that the concept of the method satisfies the requirements and the adjustability to various conditions can be realized.

AB Advanced interferometric SAR processing techniques (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, Small Baseline Subset) are able to detect and monitor various surface displacements caused by e.g. gravitative mass movement, subrosion, groundwater extraction, fluid injection, natural gas extraction. These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities).
   In order to support the operational use of this technique a "Ground Motion Service Germany" has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000 km(2)) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented.
   The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of >30,000 km(2) and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction.
   To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the "Ground Motion Service Germany" and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Freshwater resources are among the most basic requirements of human society. Nonetheless, global information about the space-time variations of the area of freshwater bodies, and the water stored in them, is surprisingly limited. We introduce a new approach that uses MODIS multispectral data to map the global areal extent and temporal variations of known reservoirs at 500 m spatial resolution at nominal eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2015. We evaluate the performance of the approach on 94 reservoirs by comparing the variations in surface area extents with satellite radar altimetry measurements. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies for five reservoirs on four continents to demonstrate the impact of different challenges on the performance of the approach. For three of these case studies, we also evaluate surface area estimates using Landsat-based surface extent reference maps. Altimetry based height measurements for the 94 reservoirs show higher correlation with surface area computed using our approach, compared to surface area computed using previous approaches. One of the main reasons for these improvements is a novel post-processing technique that makes use of imperfect labels produced by supervised classification approaches on multiple dates to estimate the elevation structure of locations and uses it to enhance the quality and completeness of imperfect labels. However, effective estimation of this elevation structure requires that the water body shows sufficient area variations. Hence, the post-processing approach will not be effective for water bodies that are mostly unchanged or are too small to have sufficient variation. The approach is still challenged in regions with frequent cloud cover, snow and ice coverage, or complicated geometries that will require remote sensing data at finer spatial resolution. The surface area estimates we describe here are publically available. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB High-resolution (HR) remote sensing images present geometric details of land surface. Object-based change detection (OBCD) provides an effective solution to reveal detailed changes of geographic objects in HR images. In OBCD, the separate segmentation strategy holds the potential of revealing specific object-to-object changes, but it is difficult to establish spatial correspondence between distinct multi-temporal segments. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed to first detect multi-temporal changed objects based on separate segmentations and then to establish spatial correspondence between changed objects at different phases. Three separate segmentation strategies, named as SIISeg, SAISeg, and SAOSeg, are compared to indicate the importance of associating separate segmentation procedures for successive spatial correspondence establishment. The experiments of detecting building changes in urban area are performed to demonstrate the success, benefits, and potentials of establishing spatial correspondence for object-to-object change detection.

AB Mapping tree species within urban areas is essential for sustainable urban planning as well as to improve our understanding of the role of urban vegetation as an ecological service. Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m(2)) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. LiDAR-derived crown structural information was combined with hyper spectral-derived spectral vegetation indices for species classification. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively. The overall accuracy for the two most important and iconic native coniferous species improved markedly from 78.3% up to 91% using the combined data. The results of this research highlight that (1) the combination of structural and spectral information provided an improved classification accuracy than when used separately, and variables derived from LiDAR data contributed more to the accurate prediction of species than hyperspectral features; (2) higher classification accuracies were observed for evergreen species, species with distinguishable crown structure, and species undergoing flowering; (3) and finally the anthocyanin content index and photochemical reflectance index were the most important hyperspectral features for the discrimination of tree species in the spring bud burst stage.

AB Precipitation plays an important role in the water cycle and in matter and energy exchanges. Acquiring accurate information on precipitation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has a limited rain gauge network, has been a great challenge. Downscaling the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 Version 7 dataset (0.25 resolution) provided an optimal approach to estimating precipitation at 1 km resolution over this highland plateau. Our downscaling assumptions were that non-stationary relationships between precipitation and land surface characteristics occur and have varying two-dimensional scale effects, and that the relationships vary in different sub-regions having differing combinations of land surface characteristics, including vegetation index, topographical factors, and land surface temperatures. We used Cubist (a spatial data mining algorithm) to implement our assumption. Cubist separated the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into sub-regions according to geographical similarities, and selected the most effective variables over each sub-region to build models. We found that: (1) the downscaled results using this algorithm were more accurate and precise than other commonly used algorithms (e.g., geographically weighted regression) and the original TMPA data at 0.25 resolution; (2) DEM showed limited correlation with precipitation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; and (3) the effects of systematic anomalies in the original TMPA data were removed in the downscaled results based on Cubist. We conclude that Cubist is a promising algorithm able to take hundreds of variables into consideration, and in this study was used to retrieve precipitation estimates at approximately 1 km resolution.

AB L-band radiometer measurements collected over the Dome similar to C area from 2010 to 2015 indicated that the brightness temperature (T-B) was relatively stable at vertical (V) polarization (standard deviation lower than 1 K at annual scale), while it was slightly more variable at horizontal (H) polarization. During the 2014-2015 austral summer, an exceptional situation was recorded by both the DOMEX ground radiometer and the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. From November 2014 to March 2015, T-B H showed a progressive and significant increase until 20 March 2015 when it sharply decreased by about 5 K (at 52.5 incidence angle) within a few days. In parallel to the increase in T-B H, glaciological and meteorological in situ measurements showed a wind speed that was lower than usual and a low-density snow layer being progressively set up on the surface. This was consistent with the exceptional hoar event observed, as well as with snow accumulation on the surface. On the other hand, the decrease in T-B H was related to the passing over Dome C of a storm that removed or compacted the layer of light snow on the surface. The WALOMIS (Wave Approach for LOw-frequency Microwave emission in Snow) snow-emission model was used with in situ measurements of the snowpack as inputs for evaluating the effect of changes observed on the snow surface in T-B H. The simulations indicated that the surface snow density variations were sufficient for predicting the increasing and decreasing trends of the T-B H. However, the thickness variations of the superficial layer were essential so as to obtain a better agreement with the SMOS observations. This result confirmed that the L-band T-B H was affected by the snow properties of the top centimeters of the snowpack, in spite of the large penetration depth (hundreds of meters). Both the surface snow density and the thickness of the superficial layer were relevant, due to coherent interference effects.

AB Crop monitoring information is essential for food security and to improve our understanding of the role of agriculture on climate change, among others. Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel -2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological connectivity processes along the lower Amazon River floodplain at Lago Miratuba Floodplain (LMF) were analyzed based on remote sensing and field measurements. Connectivity processes are related to 12 geomorphic sub-units of the floodplain that are interconnected at different stage thresholds through channelized and overbank flow paths, while lakes act as reservoirs for flood waters, local rainfall, and water table saturation-seepage. Hydrological connectivity processes along the floodplain happen through complex internal routings of water flows over space and time, mainly along floodplain channels and breached levees. The contribution of local recharge (mainly rainfall) was decoupled from river recharge (river hydrological connection to floodplain) because precipitations and local runoff also recharge the floodplain. The hydrological connectivity of the 12 geomorphic units varied significantly from each other, because the inundation and the floodplain connections with the river were initiated at specific river stage thresholds for each sub-unit.
   An interesting finding is that connections with the river for all units were initiated through channelized flows below the bankfull stage of the Amazon River. The connectivity processes over different geomorphic units are also not correlated with their minimum distance (shortest lines) from the river. This implies that a "flood pulse" model largely concerned with lateral connectivity (mostly through overbank diffusion) only partially explains the complex hydrological connectivity processes at a regional scale along the complex lower Amazon River floodplain. Thus, for hydrological connectivity assessments in the Amazon River floodplain, reach-by-reach scale studies have to be carried out, relating the hydro-geomorphologic processes (channelized flow routing paths, overbank diffusion, and local recharge) to the internal geomorphic variability and complexity of the floodplain.

AB While SoilMoisture (SM) can be used as a direct indictor of dryness, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and vegetation status are indirectly related to SM, and consequently, affect the degree of dryness. Each of these three variables has been individually used to assess the dryness. Furthermore, a combination of the LST and vegetation information has also been applied for dryness estimation through the scatter-plot of the LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, a combination of these three variables has not been used to estimate the dryness. In this study, a 3 Dimensional (3D) space of the LST, Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), and SM was developed to define a new dryness index named the Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI). The TVMDI was evaluated against in situ SM and soil temperature data, as well as the NDVI. The results demonstrated that the TVMDI values were highly correlated with the field soil temperature data and the NDVI (R = 0.78 and R = -0.87, respectively). However, even though the dryness values estimated from the TVMDI were not highly correlated with the in situ SM data, the correlation was still acceptable (R = -0.65). Furthermore, a comparison between the proposed index and several satellite-based dryness indices, including the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), Second Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI1), and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), concluded that the TVMDI was the most accurate index. Moreover, using the TVMDI and multi-temporal Landsat 8 images two dryness maps were produced for the Yanco area to show the effectiveness of the proposed index in depicting the temporal and spatial variation of dryness values for medium spatial resolution images. To show the effectiveness of the TVMDI in large scale applications, two dryness maps from the all of Australia and Iran were also produced using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. Overall, it was concluded that the TVMDI had a high potential to map dryness over different regions, and is a promising index for early awareness of drought risk management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Time series fractional green vegetation cover (FVC) is crucial for monitoring vegetation cover status monitoring, simulating growth processes and modeling land surfaces. Through the integration of remotely sensed data and FVC estimation models, FVC can be routinely and periodically monitored using remote sensing images over large areas. However, due to frequent cloud contamination and trade-offs in satellite sensor design, the FVC estimates from remote sensing data are not continuous, either spatially or temporally, and cannot simultaneously depict details in spatio-temporal variation. Taking the seasonally inundated Zoige alpine wetland in China as a case area, the objective of this paper is to develop a practical and effective approach to quantifying the explicit vegetation FVC details with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In this approach, 30-m multi-spectral images from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing (HJ), which means environment in Chinese) satellite constellation with a 2-day revisit time were first composited at 16-day intervals to improve spatio-temporal continuity. Then, a new adaptive endmember selection linear spectral mixture model (ASLSMM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of FVC estimation by considering the endmember dynamics for each pixel. FVC time series were finally estimated by applying the ASLSMM to the cloudless HJ composites. The performance of the model and the spatio-temporal representational capability of the FVC estimation results were comprehensively evaluated using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reference images and ground measurements from an integrated, multi-scale remote sensing experiment. A traditional LSMM with fixed endmembers and the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) model were also used for model performance comparison. The results showed that the R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from the proposed model and the UAV reference were 0.7315 and 0.1016 (unitless) respectively, which was better than the results from the linear spectral mixture model with a fixed number of endmembers, with R-2 of 0.5924 and RMSE of 0.3821. The R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from MESMA and the UAV reference were 0.6327 and 0.1578, which was comparable with the ASLSMM. The accuracy evaluation usingmulti-temporal in situ measurements indicated the consistently high performance of the ASLSMM. This study highlights the feasibility of using HJ satellite constellation images to generate the temporally dense and fine spatial resolution FVC estimations for wetland and wetland-like heterogeneous landscape monitoring. The proposed approach can be viewed as a reference for generating FVC datasets from the on-going HJ constellation and similar constellation missions such as Sentinel-2A/B. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Bare ground gain, or vegetative cover loss, is an important component of global land cover change resulting from economic drivers such as urbanization and resource extraction. In this study, we characterized global bare ground gain from Landsat time series. The maps were then used to stratify the globe in creating a sample-based estimate of global bare ground gain extent, land cover/land use outcomes, and associated uncertainties from 2000 to 2012. An estimated total of 93,896 km(2) (+/- 9317 km(2) for 95% confidence interval) of bare ground gain occurred over the study period. Human-induced bare ground gain accounted for 95% of the total and consisted of the following components: 39% commercial and residential development, 23% resource extraction, 21% infrastructure development, 11% transitional, and 1% greenhouses. East Asia and the Pacific accounted for nearly half of all global bare ground gain area (45%), with China alone accounting for 35% of global gain. The United States was second to China, accounting for 17% of total bare ground gain. Land cover/land use outcomes of bare ground gain varied between regions and countries, reflecting different stages of development and the possible use of bare ground gain as an indicator of economic activity.

AB Snow accumulation, ablation, and runoff in mountainous areas are critical components of the hydrologic cycle, but are poorly known. Passive microwave (PM) measurements are sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE), even in mountain regions, but vegetation masks the microwave signals and reduces this sensitivity. This study examines how the PM snow signal is affected by the forest density in fourteen basins in the Sierra Nevada, USA, and in a series of sixteen subsets of the Kern basin that have varied vegetation density. 36.5 GHz vertical polarization brightness temperature (T-b) time series for each basin were produced from the spaceborne AMSR-E operational period (water year (WY) 2003 to WY2011). For each basin, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the annual minimum Tb and the concurrent SWE was calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the PM to SWE. The relationship between the R-2 values and the forest density was then analyzed to assess how vegetation affect the SWE information in the observed Tb. Mean forest coverage from MODIS was used to represent forest density. The R2 between the annual minimum Tb and concurrent SWE was >0.6 for three of the basins. Consistent with previous studies, WY2006 demonstrated anomalous Tb values for many basins, apparently due to anomalous warm winter rainfall. Excluding WY2006, R-2 is significantly higher in all basins: eight of fourteen basins have R-2 >0.6. For basins with average elevation >2500 m, SWE correlates well with Tb. The R-2 decreases monotonically with decreasing elevation. Basin elevation and forest cover are highly correlated in the Sierra; a basin elevation of 2500 m generally coincides with forest cover of 20%. A total of 42% of Sierra Nevada has <20% forest cover; this corresponds to an estimated 34% of the total SWE in the Sierra. Thus, SWE and Tb are empirically correlated for over a third of the SWE in the Sierra, typically at high elevations and above treeline. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate BPDF (Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Functions) of urban will help to improve the accuracy of inverted aerosol parameters that is very important for the research of urban atmospheric pollution and climate change. With Fresnel formula of polarization as the foundation, this paper studies three important factors that influence the BPDF: shadow, slope distribution and NDVI, and proposes a new BPDF model (named as XieCheng model for convenience in comparison) for urban areas. Because the influence of slope distribution is trivial, only two parameters are needed in the new model, one controlling the shadow and the other for overall scale. An experimental factor is introduced into the model to compensate the influence of NDVI for polarized reflectance more accurately. Experiments prove that new model performs best in both correlation and RMSE for measurements not only with different urban places around the world but also clustered urban data by different NDVIs. Compared with the best current BPDF model, new model can reduce the average RMSE error by about 4.5% for different urban areas. Error distribution in polar coordinates also shows that new model can achieve smallest errors in almost all directions under fixed sun zenith angle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the relationships between the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) at the leaf level and pigment pools, focusing on the constitutive role of pigments in influencing PRI over seasonal or ontogenetic time frames. The purpose was to re-evaluate the role of PRI as an indicator of seasonally shifting pigment (chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin) contents, and hence photosynthetic activity, across a range of tree and crop species. We studied natural vegetation - three tree species (maple, chestnut and beech) and two managed irrigated and rainfed crop species (maize and soybean), contrasting in photosynthetic pathway and leaf structure, and having wide variation of pigment content and composition. In anthocyanin-free leaves, PRI related to both total chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid (Car) contents, however, much closer relationships were found between PRI and Car to Chl ratio (Car/Chl). The sensitivity of PRI to Car/Chl varied widely in tree species with the degree of secondary carotenoids. In crop leaves where the Car vs. Chl relationship was very close, the slopes of PRI vs. Car/Chl relationships for maize and soybean were almost identical. PRI vs. Car/Chl relationships for leaves of different tree species formed a significant, uniform relationship with PRI. Two crops also formed a significant, uniform PRI vs. Car/Chl relationship with a slope half the value found for trees. In anthocyanin-containing leaves, PRI did not clearly relate to any pigment content because reflectance values at both PRI wavebands are affected by anthocyanin content. The findings of a strong link between leaf level PRI and Car/Chl over seasonal and ontogenetic time spans supports recent findings calling for a more careful evaluation of the relationship between PRI and either LUE or photosynthetic activity. In particular, studies that contrast short-term (e.g. diurnal) vs. long-term (e.g. seasonal) pigment, PRI, and photosynthetic responses in contrasting vegetation types are needed.

AB The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 105 of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced similar to 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at similar to 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along -track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross -track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along -track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.

AB Floodplains are a key ecological feature of arid and semi-arid regions and flooding is the main source of vegetation productivity. Characterizing the spatiotemporal flood dynamics, such as surface water and changes in subsequent vegetation growth vigour and biomass, is essential in better understanding of ecology and hydrology of these regions. Recent remotely sensed flooding studies of arid zone floodplains have concentrated on improving classification of surface water, particularly in mixed water-vegetation areas; less is known about the effect of surface water flooding pattern on emergent vegetation dynamics. We use an integrated framework for mapping both flood extents and the persistence of floodplain response changes of water, vegetation and moisture in Cooper Creek, Australia. We analysed pixel-based time series of multiple indices generated by daily MODIS data for 14 highly variable flow flood events between 2000 and 2012. Results indicate that for the extremely flat Cooper Creek floodplain, mapping inundation area by changes in vegetation growth vigour and biomass was significantly larger than surface water mapping area (16.2% for the 2004 flood event) and the difference in inundation mapping mainly occurs around the inundated edges. In addition, by studying surface water and subsequent vegetation response together, it is possible to generate new information, such as the lag time between flooding and peak vegetation growth vigour and biomass, and persistence time of surface water and green vegetation, which provide important insights to arid zone floodplain behaviour. The large extent and high frequency of MODIS images provide advantages in characterizing inundation dynamics for large-scale floodplains where instantaneous (daily) inundation extent is considerably smaller than total cumulative inundation extent, compared with sensors with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution; however, the coarse resolution of MODIS (500 m) limits its performance for small flood events. Globally, this approach is suitable for other large, low-gradient floodplains in arid zones that show similar, long duration vegetation responses as observed in Cooper Creek.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a novel optical tool for the assessment of terrestrial photosynthesis or gross primary production (GPP). Several recent studies have demonstrated the strong link between GPP and space-borne retrievals of SIF at broad scales. However, critical gaps remain between short-term small-scale mechanistic understanding and seasonal global observations. Here, we present a model-based analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP across scales for diverse vegetation types and a range of meteorological conditions, with the ultimate focus on reproducing the environmental conditions during remote sensing measurements. The coupled fluorescence-photosynthesis model SCOPE is used to simulate GPP and SIF at the both leaf and canopy levels for 13 flux sites. Analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of temporal scaling, canopy structure, overpass time, and spectral domain on the relationship between SIF and GPP. The simulated SIF is highly non-linear with GPP at the leaf level and instantaneous time scale and tends to linearize when scaling to the canopy level and daily to seasonal. These relationships are consistent across a wide range of vegetation types. The relationship between SIF and GPP is primarily driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), especially at the seasonal scale, although the photosynthetic efficiency also contributes to strengthen the link between them. The linearization of their relationship from leaf to canopy and averaging over time is because the overall conditions of the canopy fall within the range of the linear responses of GPP and SIF to light and the photosynthetic capacity. Our results further show that the top-of-canopy relationships between simulated SIF and GPP have similar linearity regardless of whether we used the morning or midday satellite overpass times. Field measurements confirmed these findings. In addition, the simulated red SIF at 685 nm has a similar relationship with GPP as that of far-red SIF at 740 nm at the canopy level. These findings provide model-based evidence to interpret remotely sensed SIF data and their relationship with GPP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present the Fluspect-B model (generally referred to as Fluspect), which simulates leaf chlorophyll fluorescence (ChIF), reflectance and transmittance spectra. The existing PROSPECT model and its concept of a compact leaf are used as a starting point, and the differential equations for radiative transfer within the leaf are solved by an efficient doubling algorithm. Due to the simplicity of these equations, Fluspect offers a high computational speed. With incident light provided as the main input parameter, Fluspect calculates the emission of ChIF on both the illuminated and shaded side of the leaf. Other input parameters are chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, leaf water, dry matter and senescent material (brown pigments) content, leaf mesophyll structure parameter and ChIF quantum efficiency for the two photosystems, PS-I and PS-II. We investigated the model performance using measurements of leaf reflectance, transmittance and ChIF spectra, collected for barley and sugar beet leaves in both a laboratory and outdoors setting. The plants had been grown under various illumination conditions to increase between-leaf variability of leaf biochemical and structural properties. We retrieved the model parameters, compared them to corresponding destructive measurements and finally, used them to simulate ChIF on either side of the leaf at several light intensities. The results show that the model reproduces observed SIF accurately, especially for leaves measured under natural illumination. Most of the observed between-leaf variability of ChIF could be explained from differences in leaf biochemical and structural properties, with potential additional information held by ChIF emission efficiency parameters.

AB Topography is one of the most important factors that can affect the radiative transfer process in remote sensing earth observation by making the ground objects of the same type but in different topographical locations present different radiative characteristics which increases the complexity of spectral radiation information and violates the radiometric consistency among those type-identical objects. Utilizing the topographic information we proposed a coupling parameter based atmospheric correction method or CPBAC for short. This method firstly establishes the radiative transfer equations using the data of objects with good Lambertian properties under various topographical positions, and then calculates the coupling parameters of atmosphere and topography and finally accomplishes both the atmospheric and topographic correction simultaneously using those parameters. To validate it, the Landsat 7 multispectral data about one region in Cody Town of Wyoming, USA which was acquired in different seasons was used to do a comparison with the commonly used FLAASH and QUAC methods. The comparison revealed that the CPBAC method can effectively achieve atmospheric correction with its result similar to that produced by either FLAASH or QUAC, and the topography caused spectral radiation difference among the objects of the same type was eliminated by showing an increased spectral consistency and a decreased relevance between radiometric information and topography. Although the assumptions which the CPBAC method is based upon impose restrictions on its widespread use, it can achieve the best effect when it is applied to handle the data containing objects of good Lambertian properties located in different terrains, and the selected pixels for the parameters calculation are various combinations of those with small slope and small sun zenith angle.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas contributing to about half of the total anthropogenic change in the Earth's radiation budget. And about half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere, the remainder is taken up by the biosphere. It is of paramount importance to better understand CO2 sources and sinks and their spatio-temporal distribution. In the context of climate change this information is needed to improve the projections of future trends in carbon sinks and sources. Since the terrestrial carbon and water cycles are tightly coupled by biological plant processes, i.e. through the stomatal gas exchange with the atmosphere, it is expected that information on the soil moisture state will help to constrain terrestrial carbon fluxes. In the present feasibility study we employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System CCDAS to pioneer the assimilation of the SMOS L3 soil moisture product together with another biophysical data set in this case atmospheric CO2 flask samples. The two data streams are assimilated into a process-based model of the terrestrial carbon cycle over two years. CCDAS aims to optimise model process parameters and subsequently land surface CO2 exchange fluxes. We find that the assimilation of SMOS data improves the agreement with independent soil moisture data from the active ASCAT instrument. In both cases the assimilation also improves the fit of modelled atmospheric CO2 to the observations at flask sampling sites which have not been used in the assimilation. Reduction of uncertainty relative to the prior is generally high for both regional net ecosystem productivity and net primary productivity and considerably higher than for assimilating CO2 only, which quantifies the added value of SMOS observations as a constraint on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The study demonstrates a high potential for a SMOS L4 carbon flux product. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Observations of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) from space have the potential to improve estimates of global carbon exchange. However the relationship between photosynthetic rate and these measurements is complicated by several factors that relate to the dissipation of absorbed light energy via both photochemical (photosynthesis) and non-photochemical pathways. Numerical simulations of physiological remote sensing signals require the coupling of physically-based radiative transfer models with models of physiological dynamics. These schemes provide the quantitative frameworks from which physiological information can be extracted from remote sensing observations of vegetation, helping to resolve the aforementioned complexities. We present such a framework that links physiological fluorescence theory with spectral remote sensing type measurements at the leaf scale. We show how a simple expression can be used to predict the quantum yield of photochemistry (Phi(PSII)), a proxy for photosynthetic efficiency, from spectral measurements and modelled non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). We tested two alternate models of NPQ; one process-based (PHOTOII) and the other empirical, based on visible region reflectance changes (the PRI). We used a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) model to retrieve the separated yields of chlorophyll fluorescence from photo systems II and I. Measurements of dynamic spectral fluorescence, the PRI, hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, saturation pulse integrated fluorescence and pigment contents were collected from maple leaves and used to calibrate and validate the modelling framework. Both NPQ models reproduced the observed photochemical and non-photochemical dynamics. Future work is recommended to scale the framework across space, time and species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The polarimetric characteristics of a mud flat area in the intertidal zone near Jiangsu, China, are analyzed under different environmental conditions using X-band and C-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Radarsat-2 (R2) satellites. The dominant scattering mechanisms of different objects, including mud flats and aquaculture facilities in the intertidal zone, are studied based on the polarimetric target decomposition of fully polarimetric R2 data. The polarimetric characteristics of different objects in the intertidal zone are quantitatively compared using the depolarization parameters derived from the R2 data, which indicate that tides have different effects on the dominant scattering mechanisms of the mud flats and aquaculture farms. Furthermore, comparisons of the C-band and X-band polarimetric characteristics of the mud flats and aquaculture farms in the intertidal zone are analyzed by combining the TSX and R2 data. The results show that surface scattering is the dominant mechanism of the mud flats, whereas different dominant mechanisms occur in the aquaculture areas present during different tides. Interestingly, strikingly similar polarimetric characteristics of mud flats and aquaculture in X-band and C-band SAR are observed, and these novel results were achieved through a depolarization analysis based on the TSX and R2 data in synergy.

AB For many decades remotely sensed data have been used as a source of auxiliary information when conducting regional or national surveys of forest resources. In the past decade, airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has emerged as a promising tool for sample surveys aimed at improving estimation of aboveground forest biomass. This technology is now employed routinely in forest management inventories of some Nordic countries, and there is eager anticipation for its application to assess changes in standing biomass in vast tropical regions of the globe in concert with the UN REDD program to limit C emissions. In the rapidly expanding literature on LiDAR-assisted biomass estimation the assessment of the uncertainty of estimation varies widely, ranging from statistically rigorous to ad hoc. In many instances, too, there appears to be no recognition of different bases of statistical inference which bear importantly on uncertainty estimation. Statistically rigorous assessment of uncertainty for four large LiDAR-assisted surveys is expounded. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most of the existing ALS-based algorithms for individual tree delineation from the point cloud are top-down, which are accurate for delineating cone-shaped conifers, but have lower delineation accuracies over more structurally complex broad-leaf forests. Therefore, in this study we developed a new bottom-up algorithm for detecting trunks and delineating individual trees with complex shapes, such as eucalypts. Experiments were conducted in the largest river red gum forest in the world, located in the southeast of Australia, that experienced severe dieback over the past six decades. For detection of individual tree trunks, we used a novel approach based on conditional Euclidean distance clustering that takes advantage of spacing between laser returns. Overall, the algorithm developed in our study was able to detect up to 67% of field-measured trees with diameter larger than or equal to 13 cm. By filtering ALS based on the intensity, return number and returned pulse width values, we were able to differentiate between woody and leaf tree components, thus improving the accuracy of tree trunk detections by 5% as compared to non-filtered ALS. The detected trunks were used to seed random walks on graph algorithm for tree crown delineation. The accuracy of tree crown delineation for different ALS point cloud densities was assessed in terms of tree height and crown width and resulted in up to 68% of field-measured trees being correctly delineated. The double increase in point density from similar to 12 points/m(2) to similar to 24 points/m(2) resulted in tree trunk detection increase of 11% (from 56% to 67%) and percentage of correctly delineated crowns increase of 13% (from 55% to 68%). Our results confirm an algorithm that can be used to accurately delineate individual trees with complex structures (e.g. eucalypts and other broad leaves) and highlight the importance of full-waveform ALS for individual tree delineation.

AB Defoliators and bark beetles are natural disturbance agents in many forest ecosystems around the world. Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of insect disturbance dynamics can help in understanding their impacts on forest ecosystem resilience and functioning, and in developing adaptive management strategies. In recent years, much progress has been made in landscape-level analyses of insect-induced disturbances using remotely sensed data. However, many studies have focused on single insect agents or aggregated different insect agents into a single group. In this study, we characterized the temporal-spectral patterns associated with bark beetle and defoliator disturbances using Landsat time series between 1990 and 2013, with the objective to test if the two insect disturbances can be separated with Landsat data. We analyzed a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani Razowski) in British Columbia, Canada. To characterize the disturbance and recovery trends associated with insect disturbances we used the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm. We fitted LandTrendr spectral trajectories to annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap (TC) time series, from which we then extracted a set of disturbance metrics. With these disturbance metrics, two random forest models were trained to a) distinguish insect disturbances from harvest and fire disturbances; and to b) attribute the insect disturbances to the most likely agent, i.e. mountain pine beetle or western spruce budworm. Insect disturbances were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 76.8%, and agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 75.3% to 88.0%, depending on whether only pure host-stands or mixed stands with both insect hosts were considered. In the case of mixed host stands, nearly 45% of the western spruce budworm disturbances were falsely attributed to mountain pine beetle. Spectral metrics describing disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the two insect agents than the disturbance duration. Spectral changes associated with western spruce budworm disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than mountain pine beetle disturbances. Moreover, disturbances by western spruce budworm were more strongly associated with changes in TC greenness, whereas disturbances by mountain pine beetle were more strongly associated with changes in TC brightness and wetness. The results reflect the ephemeral nature of defoliators versus the tree mortality impacts of bark beetles in our study area. This study demonstrates the potential of Landsat time series for mapping bark beetle and defoliator disturbances at the agent level and highlights the need for distinguishing between the two insect agents to adequately capture their impacts on ecosystem processes.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) surface deformation is retrieved for the March 6-10,2011 (UTC dates), Kamoamoa fissure eruption along the East Rift Zone of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, through the integration of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) and multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) measurements from the COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR. The measurement accuracies of 1) the individual and multi-stacked MAI interferograms and 2) the 3D deformation, which is measured from COSMO-SkyMed data, are assessed using continuous GPS stations. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of individual MAI interferograms for descending and ascending data are 2.97 +/- 0.6 cm and 320 +/- 0.62 cm, respectively. The MAI interferograms stacked from multi-temporal observations can produce better results by emphasizing surface deformation signals, with the RMS errors of 1.06 and 124cm for descending and ascending data, respectively. The empirical equations for measurement uncertainties are determined with respect to interferometric coherence for individual and stacked MAI interferograms. An assessment of the 3D components of deformation was performed as well, and RMS errors of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.68 cm were estimated in the east, north, and up directions. A performance test of magma source model parameter estimations was carried out by using the InSAR and 3D measurements. From the 3D deformation field, we found that the magma chamber source at the Kilauea caldera should be modeled by the spheroid source rather than the simple point source. The performance comparison between the InSAR and 3D modeled results showed that the 3D deformation field allows for precise model parameter estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar chlorophyll (Chl) and nitrogen (N) was examined for 19 species over a six-month growing period at Mer Bleue, an ombrotrophic bog located near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The goal of this study was to model total Chl and N concentration at the landscape-scale from remotely sensed data utilizing a model insensitive to plant functional type (PFT), species and season. To date the relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar properties is poorly understood in peatlands owing to the scarcity of studies examining the spectral variability between mosses and vascular plants. A model that comprised a continuous wavelet transform coupled with a neural network was constructed to predict Chl and N content from selected wavelet features (coefficients) at both leaf and airborne image scales. The model was compared to thirteen common spectral indices used to determine vegetation properties in forest environments. The heterogeneity of the vascular plant/moss cover over small spatial scales (<1 m) and the spectral complexity of the vegetation cover, precluded a regression model to be derived from the spectral indices for all species across seasons; the best model for all species combined was R-2 = 0.3. The final continuous wavelet model resulted in a noticeable improvement with R-2 values ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 (for both Chl and N content). We scaled up our predictive model from the leaf/capitulum level data to 40 cm spatial resolution 72-band airborne imagery (CASI-2 429.6-968.8 nm) to create surfaces of Chi and N content for the study area.

AB This paper focuses on a multidisciplinary study carried out in an urban area affected by subsidence and related structural damages. The study area is located about 20 km east of Rome (Italy) and is characterised by relevant groundwater exploitation for various purposes as well as by the presence of compressible soils immediately below the ground level. Extensive processing at different scales of SAR satellite images (ERS and ENVISAT provided by ESA in the frame of a CAT-1 project) by means of A-DInSAR technique was performed. The time histories of ground displacements, have been analysed in combination with a detailed geological setting of the study area and with the hydrogeological changes occurred in the last decades (as the response to the anthropic stress) based on a large piezometric dataset. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to describe the space and time distributions of the subsidence process. The spatial pattern and deformation rate change is attributed to the following causes: i) the changes in the groundwater levels due to the intensification of mine exploitation (requiring dewatering operations) and ii) the distribution and thickness of recent compressible deposits. Specifically, it is derived that the groundwater level variations drive the timing of subsidence triggering over the area, whereas the local geological conditions control the magnitude of the deformation process.

AB This paper presents and assesses spatially explicit estimates of forest growing stock volume (GSV) of the northern hemisphere (north of 10 degrees N) from hyper-temporal observations of Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) backscattered intensity using the BIOMASAR algorithm. Approximately 70,000 ASAR images at a pixel size of 0.01 degrees were used to estimate GSV representative for the year 2010. The spatial distribution of the GSV across four ecological zones (polar, boreal, temperate, subtropical) was well captured by the ASAR-based estimates. The uncertainty of the retrieved GSV was smallest in boreal and temperate forest (<30% for approximately 80% of the forest area) and largest in subtropical forest. ASAR-derived GSV averages at the level of administrative units were mostly in agreement with inventory-derived estimates. Underestimation occurred in regions of very high GSV (>300 m(3)/ha) and fragmented forest landscapes. For the major forested countries within the study region, the relative RMSE between ASAR-derived GSV averages at provincial level and corresponding values from National Forest Inventory was between 12% and 45% (average: 29%).

AB The Leeuwin Current is an anomalous poleward-flowing eastern boundary current that transports warm tropical waters southward and imposes significant ecological influences on the coastal marine ecosystems off Western Australia. In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current's SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current's SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current's SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current's SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, both part of NASA's Earth Observing System, have each been providing high quality global sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) for over a decade. The ability to retrieve accurate SST from satellites is dependent on many factors including spectral response, radiometer noise, pre-launch instrument characterization and in flight behavior, calibration, viewing geometry, cloud screening and correction of the clear-sky atmospheric effects. We present a characterization of both the historical and current MODIS SST products, and we describe the evolution of, and motivation for, improvements in MODIS SST for each Collection released to the public, i.e., each radiance level mission data reprocessing, each driven by improved knowledge of the instrument behavior and better corrections for instrumental artifacts.

AB \ Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is an important parameter in ecosystem and land surface models. PAR represents the amount of solar radiation in the spectral range of 400-700 nm that travels through the atmosphere to the top of the vegetation canopy. In recent years, various methods using different input data to estimate PAR and produce different PAR products have been developed. However, most of the algorithms used in these state-of-the-art studies have not fully compensated for the low spatial and temporal resolution of the data, which affects the accuracy of the PAR estimates. In this study, we have developed a method for estimating hourly PAR based on a combination of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data. The Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) was selected to retrieve cloud optical depth (COD) with a higher spatial resolution, and the polar orbit satellite data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used to derive surface parameters based on multispectral characteristics. A look-up table was established by the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-Vector (6SV) model and the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model consisting the following parameters: solar zenith angle, total water vapor, total ozone column, aerosol optical depth (ADD), COD, surface elevation, surface albedo and PAR. The instantaneous PAR was linearly interpolated from the input data for the selected parameters and the look-up table. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated and observed instantaneous PAR at the Huailai station was 45.72 W/m(2) for all sky conditions. The RMSE between the estimated and observed daily PAR at the meteorological stations was 17% in the eastern regions of China. The mean bias error (MBE) was between -2.83 and 32.43 W/m(2) for the Tibetan Plateau. These results indicated that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of PAR estimates and can be used to produce PAR products with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the method requires further improvement, especially with respect to cloudy conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 nm Intermediate Product (IP) data was evaluated by comparing it with measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals. The spatial and temporal variations in the regional AOT over China during 2013 (from 24 January to 31 December) were then firstly investigated using VIIRS aerosol IP data. Evaluation of VIIRS IP AOT with MODIS retrievals and AERONET measurements indicated that the performance of the VIIRS aerosol IP product is comparable to that of their counterparts from the heritage MODIS sensor. However, the VIIRS IP can produce more retrievals than MODIS due to its higher spatial resolution, therefore more suitable for regional AOT study. It was found that the VIIRS IP mean AOT over China differs from that of MODIS by - 0.032 for the collocated retrievals, with a correlation of 0.928. Compared with AERONET measurements, VI1RS IP AOT shows a negative bias of - 0.058 with the standard deviation of the difference of 0.192 over China. Among the 10 typical sites under study, the maximum annual average AOT550 values (with +/- standard deviation) were found in Chengdu (1.07 +/- 032), whereas the lowest annual mean AOT550 values were found in FB1 (0.242 +/- 025). The economically developed regions had high AOT values during all seasons. Based on the distribution of AOT, China can be divided into an economically developed eastern region with high AOT values and less-developed western regions, consistent with the boundary between China's second and third terrain regions.

AB Exposure to particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) adversely impacts human health. In many geographical regions where ground PM2.5 monitoring is spatially sparse and unsuitable for environmental health inference, satellite remote sensing can potentially be used for estimating human exposure to PM2.5. However, retrieval of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the Dark Target (DT) algorithm is uncertain in many regions worldwide (e.g. western USA, the Middle East and central Asia) due to low signal-to-noise ratio as a result of high surface reflectivity in the spectral bands used by the algorithm. In this study we use the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm as well as a combined DB-DT algorithm for AOD retrievals. The AOD products are used to predict ground PM2.5 using mixed effects models and the daily calibration approach. Models for the two study areas (Israel and San Joaquin Valley, Central California) were developed independently and then compared to each other. Using the AOD(DB) within a mixed effects model considerably improved PM2.5 prediction in high reflectance regions, revealing in both study areas enhanced model performance (in terms of both R-2 and the root mean square prediction error), significant increase in the spatiotemporal availability of the AOD product, and improved PM2.5 prediction relative to using AOD(DT) retrievals.

AB Precipitation is an important hydro-meteorological variable, and is a primary driver of the water cyde. In large parts of the world, real-time ground-based observations of precipitation are sparse and satellite-derived precipitation products are the only information source.
   We used changes in satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) to reduce uncertainties in the real-time TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis product (TMPA-RT). The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was used to model the response of LST and SM on precipitation, and a particle filter was used to update TMPA-RT. Observations from AMSR-E (LPRM and LSMEM), ASCAT, SMOS and LST from AMSR-E were assimilated to correct TMPA-RT over the continental United States.
   Assimilation of satellite-based SM observations alone reduced the false detection of precipitation (by 85.4%) and the uncertainty in the retrieved rainfall volumes (5%). However, a higher number of observed rainfall events were not detected after assimilation (34%), compared to the original TMPA-RT (46%). Noise in the retrieved SM changes resulted in a relatively low potential to reduce uncertainties. Assimilation of LST observations alone increased the rainfall detection rate (by 51%), and annual precipitation totals were closer to ground-based precipitation observations. Combined assimilation of both satellite SM and LST, did not significantly reduce the uncertainties compared to the original TMPA-RT, because of the influence of satellite SM over LST. However, in central United States improvements were found after combined assimilation of SM and LST observations. This study shows the potential for reducing the uncertainties in TMPA-RT estimates over sparsely gauged areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite was successfully launched in 28 October 2011. The day-night band (DNB) is mounted on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the NPP to greatly improve upon the night time imaging capabilities. In order to cover the wide dynamic radiation range, the Low Gain Stage (LGS), Median Gain Stage (MGS) and High Gain Stage (HGS) are employed to view the earth at daytime, twilight and nighttime respectively. Especially, the radiance measured at night is relatively low, so the radiometric calibration is too difficult to calculate directly. To independently evaluate the radiometric calibration of DNB HGS at night, the vicarious calibration of S-NPP/VIIRS DNB on the basis of the deep convection clouds (DCCs) under lunar illumination is presented. DCCs are selected by applying the spatial homogeneity criteria of brightness temperature and radiance. To determine the macro- and microphysical properties of DCCs at night, the CloudSat-CALIPSO nighttime observation data for 2-year period from January 2009 to December 2010 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the average of the cloud top heights, cloud base heights, and cloud effective radius are 15 km, 0.9 km and 30 pm separately over tropical area from 2009 to 2010. These properties of DCCs are assumed to be the typical values for DCCs. The top of atmosphere reflectance values of the identified DCC targets at the VIIRS DNB at night are simulated by the promoted radiative transfer model, which combined the lunar irradiance model with the SCIATRAN to realize the radiative transfer simulation at anytime. The comparison between the simulated reflectance values and the corresponding DNB HGS measurements for a 1-year period from August 2012 to July 2013 shows that, on a daily basis, the DNB HGS data are calibrated on orbit within a 4.9% 8.8% uncertainty range near full moon. The vicarious calibration method using DCCs are suggested to be reliably used for DNB HGS radiometric calibration directly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Landsat data were evaluated as auxiliary information with the intent to increase the precision of growing stock volume estimates in field-based forest inventories. The aim of the study was to efficiently utilize both wall-to-wall Landsat data and a sample of LiDAR data using model-assisted estimation. Variables derived from the Landsat 7 ETM + satellite image were spectral values of blue, green, red, near infra-red (IR), and two shortwave IR (SWIR) bands. From the LiDAR data twenty-six height and density based metrics were extracted. Field plots were measured according to a design similar to the 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory, although with an increased number of plots per area unit. The study was performed in a 30000 ha area of Kuortane, Western Finland. Three regression models based on different combinations of auxiliary data were developed, analysed, and applied in the model-assisted estimators. Our results show that adding auxiliary Landsat and LiDAR data improves estimates of growing stock volume. Very precise results were obtained for the case where wall-to-wall Landsat data, LiDAR strip samples, and field plots were combined; for simple random sampling of LiDAR strips the relative standard errors (RSE) were in the range of 1-4%, depending on the size of the sample. With only LiDAR and field data the RSEs ranged from 4% to 25%. We also showed that probability-proportional-to-size sampling of LiDAR strips (utilizing predicted volume from Landsat data as the size variable) led to more precise results than simple random sampling.

AB In this work, land subsidence in Bandung Basin, Indonesia between 2002 and 2011 was mapped using the C-band ENVISAT ASAR and L-band ALOS PALSAR data. Twenty four ALOS PALSAR and thirty ENVISAT ASAR images acquired between 2002-2008 and 2007 - 2011, respectively, were analysed. Several locations that were experiencing land displacement were identified including Cimahi, Dayeuh Kolot, Rancaekek, Solokan Jeruk and Gedebage. The subsidence rates in the basin range from -240 mm/year to 40 mm/year. The comparison between the ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR measurements, which showed good agreement, suggested the subsidence in many areas of the basin were steady between 2002 and 2011, except south Bandung. Acceleration of subsidence in south Bandung was observed between the measurements from the two datasets, likely as a result of increasing population and industries. The subsidence in the basin was expected mainly as a result of excessive groundwater extraction and soil consolidation caused by surficial loading GPS survey data collected between 2002 and 2010 were used to validate the ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR measurements. Good correlations were observed between InSAR and GPS measurements. The comparison between the land subsidence measurements and the groundwater level information showed there were some correlations between them. For every 1 m reduction in groundwater level per annum, ground subsidence of 20-23 mm per annum has been observed. The comparison results suggested that there was no evidence showing the aquifer in the basin is being recovered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Emission of mineral dust aerosols is highly dynamic, in part due to variability in surface erodibility. Investigation of the variations of surfaces within dust source regions has the potential to elucidate the processes that control erodibility and to improve model representations of dust emission. In this study, we investigate surface temporal variability in the Black Rock playa (Nevada, USA) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data from between 2004 and 2010. The SAR backscatter (sigma(0)) observations of the playa surface are compared to weather station observations and temporally-resolved measurements of water inundation derived from multi-spectral MODIS satellite data. The data illustrate that centimeter-scale surface roughness on the playa is surprisingly heterogeneous over multi-meter length scales and evolves dynamically on annual time scales. Interannual changes in surface roughness on the playa are quite large compared to the variability of surface roughness during the summer months (July-September), suggesting that summer anthropogenic and aeolian processes are substantially less important than water-related processes for controlling the evolution of the playa surface. Playa median ob is relatively low in years with high annual precipitation (>140 mm), suggesting that surface water controls centimeter-scale surface roughness and, potentially, erodibility. Spatially, there is a relationship between ob and the time of year at which a surface dries. Areas drying in July have significantly higher ob than surfaces that dry earlier in the year, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in ob is controlled by cycles of wetting and drying at the edge of the playa lake. The implications in the Black Rock playa, and potentially more broadly, are that water is a critical factor controlling playa surface evolution, and the annual time scale is crucial for investigations of playa erodibility.

AB Mapping of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence from space has shown potential for providing global measurements related to gross primary productivity (GPP). In particular, space-based fluorescence may provide information on the length of the carbon uptake period. Here, for the first time we test the ability of satellite fluorescence retrievals to track seasonal cycle of photosynthesis as estimated from a diverse set of tower gas exchange measurements from around the world. The satellite fluorescence retrievals are obtained using new observations near the 740 nm emission feature from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) instrument offering the highest temporal and spatial resolution of available global measurements. Because GOME-2 has a large ground footprint (similar to 40 x 80 km(2)) as compared with that of the flux towers and the GOME-2 data require averaging to reduce random errors, we additionally compare with seasonal cycles of upscaled GPP estimated from a machine learning approach averaged over the same temporal and spatial domain as the satellite data surrounding the tower locations. We also examine the seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (AFAR) estimated from satellite measurements. Finally, to assess whether global vegetation models may benefit from the satellite fluorescence retrievals through validation or additional constraints, we examine seasonal cycles of GPP as produced from an ensemble of vegetation models. Several of the data-driven models rely on satellite reflectance-based vegetation parameters to derive estimates of APAR that are used to compute GPP. For forested (especially deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) and cropland sites, the GOME-2 fluorescence data track the spring onset and autumn shutoff of photosynthesis as delineated by the upscaled GPP estimates. In contrast the reflectance-based indicators and many of the models, particularly those driven by data, tend to overestimate the length of the photosynthetically-active period for these biomes. Satellite fluorescence measurements therefore show potential for improving the seasonal dependence of photosynthesis simulated by global models at similar spatial scales.

AB The spectral data of many plant pigments available in the literature are limited in their range and resolution. The objective of this project was to obtain improved spectral data that are representative of in vivo absorption characteristics for a selection of pigments relevant to leaf reflectance modeling. Absorption spectra of anthocyanins, betacyanins, betaxanthins, chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids were obtained between 300 and 800 nm at 1-nm intervals. These pigments were extracted from plant material and separated using column and thin layer chromatography. The two methods showed consistent results for all pigments except the chlorophylls which could not be fully separated using simple column chromatography. The anthocyanin and betacyanin spectra were very similar but anthocyanin displayed greater absorption in the UV range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79 < R-2 < 0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth.

AB In this paper we examine the potential of multi-polarization SAR systems to detect and discriminate oil pollution from uncontaminated recently formed thin sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, where both oil and thin sea ice have similar low backscatter returns on SAR imagery. In this study, we present a theoretical model of the relative permittivity of oil-in-sea-ice mixtures and apply it to determine the effect of dielectric properties on the co-polarized backscatter ratio for sea ice, ocean, and oil. To support the theoretical discussion, we invstigate available multi-polarization and multi-frequency SAR measurements. We compare SAR data collected over oil spills in sea-water in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea with available similar data covering sea ice in the Arctic region. The results suggest that multi-polarization SAR systems will be useful to detect Arctic oil spills should a spill occur in new and young sea ice conditions, particularly in the marginal ice zones adjacent to the main polar ice pack.

AB In the last decade, the number of offshore wind farms has increased rapidly. Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

AB Satellite derived water surface temperature maps are widely used in many environmental studies and applications. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is among the widely used sensors in this field and sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the standard quantities derived from MODIS imagery. However, MODIS SST maps have limited applications in near-shore and coastal environments due to inadequate spatial resolution of 1 km. This problem means that the MODIS pixels closer than 1 km from the shore are mixed pixels, i.e. they include by both water and land, and must be discarded from the SST map. In this work SWTI (Sharpening Water Thermal Imagery) methods were applied to MODIS thermal imagery for the first time. The information required by SWTI regarding cover fractions and perpendicular vegetation index was obtained from the MODIS images in the Visible-Near Infrared bands at a spatial resolution of 250 m. In this way, the SST MODIS maps were extended to a minimum distance of 250 m from the shore. The SWTI results were evaluated using as a reference the SST computed from two ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images acquired simultaneously to the MODE images and covering the same areas. The applied validation methodology provides an evaluation of the deviations introduced by SWTI separated from the pre-existing differences between MODIS SST and ASTER SST upscaled to 250 m. For sea coast environments, SWTI was able to compute the SST of more than 80% of the pixels close to the shore at a spatial resolution of 250 m. This represents an increase of 67% compared to the number of pixels obtainable using a simple downscaling method based on polynomial interpolation; in areas with lagoons and estuaries the increases were + 70% and + 60% respectively. The ASTER SST comparison showed that the SST bias and the unsystematic deviation introduced by SWTI were Delta(s) <= 0.45 K and sigma(epsilon(S)) <= 0.88 K respectively, corresponding to a total deviation TD <= 0.97 K. SWTI is written in the IDL language and could be adapted for automatic application to MODIS images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on-board the METOP satellite is designed to provide very accurate measurements of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). In this work, using one year of METOP-AVHRR data and a geostatistical approach, we characterize the spatial anisotropy and non-stationarity of the SST variability using oriented ellipsoids. The method is also able to separate the true SST variability from the artificial error introduced by the METOP-AVHRR sensor. These spatial parameters are then used for producing variability atlases (available on-line) over the whole ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study estimated the LAI through field measurements and satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) in two alluvial forest sites at species level (black alder). The primary objective of this study was the validation of seasonal relationships between field-measured LAI, using a LI-COR 2200 plant canopy analyzer (PCA), and four red edge and non-red edge satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) of 10 high spatial resolution RapidEye images: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the red edge NDVI (NDVI-RE), the modified red edge simple ratio (mSR-RE), and the curvature. The indices were compared using 4 phenological phases (leaf flushing until crown closure, leaf growth under crown closure, decreasing leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf senescence) over the entire vegetation period in 2011 using regression analyses, t-test and root mean square error (RMSE). The results suggest that the LAI-SVI relationships varied seasonally. Strong to weak linear relationships were obtained during different periods. For each phase, a different SW fitted best: NDVI-RE during leaf flushing until crown closure (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.47), mSR-RE during leaf growth under crown closure (R-2 = 0.422, RMSE = 0.71), NDVI-RE during decreasing leaf chlorophyll content (R-2 = 0.182, RMSE = 0.58), and NDVI during leaf senescence (R-2 = 0.829, RMSE = 0.53). Thus, implementing the red edge channel improved the LAI-SVI relationships, particularly during periods with few variations in the LAI. An analysis of the entire vegetation period revealed that NDVI had the best regression (R-2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.507) because it was the most stable index due to moderate LAI values (average max. LAI = 4.63). The satellite-based vegetation indices used in this study provided reliable estimates and described the temporal changes and spatial variability in the LAI well. It can be concluded that a LAI-SVI relation cannot be established by a single linear regression throughout a year. Hence, a multi-temporal approach is recommended when monitoring alluvial forest dynamics. Future research on estimating the LAI based on satellite imagery should include the phenological phases into the calculation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil Surface Roughness (SR) provides a representation of surface variability which can be an important factor in a range of modelling applications such as surface water flow and sediment/nutrient transport. Moreover, it is a crucial parameter for interpreting backscatter characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for agricultural application such as near-surface soil moisture retrieval. SR is typically estimated using manual profiles of height variation along short transects (1 to 3 m). However, this approach can be very time consuming and often only a small number of transects can be measured in this way, which may not be adequate to characterize the spatial variability of SR across the landscape. This study investigated the feasibility of utilising airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)_observations as an alternative for mapping SR attributes across an agricultural environment in New South Wales, Australia. To that end, SR attributes were extracted from airborne LiDAR observations and compared with those extracted from an extensive ground survey of SR making use of manual pin-profilers. Results show that LiDAR-estimates of soil profile surface heights Root Mean Square (RMS) are both accurate (compared to manual profiles) and precise (repeatable stable estimates) for fields presenting bare or fallow conditions and either presenting no row structure or as long as the orientation of the LiDAR scan line is perpendicular to the row structure. In such cases results indicated a strong correlation between LiDAR-estimated and ground-measured RMS estimates (R-2 > 0.68, p <0.05), with an RMSE better than 0.81 cm and bias smaller than 0.48 cm from a 400 m flight altitude. Moreover, estimates produced from repeat pass LiDAR datasets were consistent and highly correlated (R-2 0.98) suggesting that the approach is precise and robust, provided that key tillage parameters (i.e. presence of vegetative material and row direction) can be pre-classified. LiDAR estimates of surface height RMS were shown to be accurate enough to allow the tracking of temporal changes in surface roughness due to farming activities. In contrast, LiDAR-derived surface Correlation Length (CL) estimates were not found to be a reliable proxy of the ground-measured CL. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Ocean color (OC) remote sensing has entered a new phase with the successful deployment of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The representativeness and accuracy of the VIIRS geophysical products need to be assessed before a wide use of these data by the scientific community. As an integral part of the VIIRS sensor calibration and validation efforts, our group has been continuously monitoring the validity of the VIIRS's OC and atmospheric data stream through time-series in-situ data acquired at the observatory sites which are part of the AERONET-OC network. This paper addresses the preliminary evaluations of the VIIRS sensor's performance for retrieving OC data of typical coastal water environments, by carrying out time-series, as well as qualitative and quantitative match-up comparisons analysis between in-situ and satellite retrieved OC data. Initial time-series match-up comparisons carried out for a year period (January to December, 2012) show that VIIRS data exhibits strong temporal and statistical agreements with AERONET-OC data demonstrating a potential in enhanced coastal water monitoring from space. VIIRS data of two NASA-OBPG processing schemes which apply different vicarious calibration gains and NOAA-IDPS system are analyzed based on in-situ data of LISCO and WaveCIS AERONET-OC sites which are located in Long Island Sound and Gulf of Mexico respectively as well as OC retrievals of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Aqua satellite. The underlying cause of the discrepancies observed in VIIRS retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances is also investigated. Finally, as the NASA-OBPG and NOAA-IDPS processing schemes for ocean color data of the VIIRS sensor continue to evolve, the results underline the necessity for monitoring and assessing the validity and consistency of VIIRS' ocean color products, especially for coastal waters.

AB Leaf area index (IAI) is one of the key parameters for the calculation of the energy budget, photosynthesis, and the interception of precipitation in land-surface models at local to global scales. Estimation of LAI from satellite data is a challenging and difficult problem. Studies over the past decades have focused predominantly on the improvement of forward modeling of the radiative transfer problem and on the application of more realistic numerical inversion schemes. Little or no attention has been paid to alternatives for the least squares method as a statistical distance measure or cost function, used to minimize the distance between observations and model predictions. The least-squares method has properties that assume noise with a Gaussian distribution and zero mean, an assumption often violated when LAI is estimated from satellite reflectance data. Here, we test the use of alternative statistical distance measures or cost functions to estimate LAI. We combine a look-up table (LUT)-inversion method based on the FLIGHT radiative transfer model and test how well it estimates LA! from MODIS reflectance data for a large set of alternative cost functions. We consider three classes of statistical distance measures or cost functions: information divergence measures, M-estimates, and minimum contrast methods. We estimate LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (MOD09GA) for 11 VALERI and BigFoot sites around the globe. These sites consist of a wide range of tree-cover types that include conifer, broadleaf and mixed (conifer, broadleaf, grassland) forest sites. We develop LUTs with FLIGHT for conifer and broadleaf forests and we show that improvements can be obtained for the estimation of LAI by choosing a cost function appropriate for a particular problem. Results show error reductions of 20% compared with the MODIS LA! retrieval (MOD15A2). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Breeding distribution of the Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, was surveyed with Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data in an area covering approximately 330 degrees of longitude along the coastline of Antarctica. An algorithm was designed to minimize radiometric noise and to retrieve Adelie penguin colony location and spatial extent from the ETM+ data. In all, 9143 individual pixels were classified as belonging to an Adelie penguin colony class out of the entire dataset of 195 ETM+ scenes, where the dimension of each pixel is 30 m by 30 m, and each scene is approximately 180 km by 180 km. Pixel clustering identified a total of 187 individual Adelie penguin colonies, ranging in size from a single pixel (900 m(2)) to a maximum of 875 pixels (0.788 km(2)). Colony retrievals have a very low error of commission, on the order of 1% or less, and the error of omission was estimated to be similar to 3 to 4% by population based on comparisons with direct observations from surveys across east Antarctica. Thus, the Landsat retrievals successfully located Adelie penguin colonies that accounted for similar to 96 to 97% of the regional population used as ground truth. Geographic coordinates and the spatial extent of each colony retrieved from the Landsat data are available publically. Regional analysis found several areas where the Landsat retrievals suggest populations that are significantly larger than published estimates. Six Adelie penguin colonies were found that are believed to be previously unreported in the literature. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The study presented in this paper is to investigate the possibility of using spaceborne remote sensing data for groundwater head prediction. Remotely-sensed soil moisture time series of SWI (Soil Water Index) derived from ERS (European Remote Sensing) scatterometers are used to predict groundwater head dynamics in the Rhine-Meuse basin, where over four thousand observed groundwater head time series are available. Our study consists of three evolving research steps. First, the correlation between observed time series of groundwater head and SWI is investigated. Second, SWI time series are used as input to a transfer-function noise (TFN) model for temporal prediction ( forecasts) of groundwater heads. Third, TFN models with spatially interpolated parameters are used with SWI time series for spatio-temporal prediction of groundwater heads. Here, HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) as derived from a digital elevation model is used as auxiliaty information. Results show that the correlation between SWI and groundwater head time series is apparent, particularly in areas with shallow groundwater, and that correlation increases when a time-lag is taken into account. Temporal predictions with TFN models reproduce observed groundwater head time series well at locations with shallow groundwater, but results are poor for locations with deep groundwater. The spatio-temporal prediction method is not able to estimate the absolute value of groundwater heads. However, head variation in terms of timing and amplitude is predicted reasonably well, in particular in areas with shallow groundwater. This suggests that, once a groundwater model is suitably calibrated, remotely sensed soil moisture data could be used to improve groundwater prediction in an operational data-assimilation framework.

AB Essential climate variables such as LAI or FAPAR are required for the monitoring, understanding and modeling of land surfaces at the global scale. While several products were already developed from the current medium resolution sensors, the few validation exercises currently achieved highlighted significant discrepancies and inconsistencies. The objective of this study is to develop improved global estimates of LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER variables by capitalizing on the development and validation of already existing products. In a first step, the performances of the MODIS, CYCLOPES, GLOBCARBON and JRC-FAPAR products were reviewed. The MODIS and CYCLOPES products were then selected since they provide higher level of consistency. These products were fused to generate the improved LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER values that were later scaled to closely match their expected range of variation. Finally, neural networks were trained to estimate these fused and scaled products from SPOT-VEGETATION top of canopy directionally normalized reflectance values. The resulting GEOV1 products are associated to quality control flags as well as quantitative estimates of uncertainties. Performances of the GEOV1 products are finally evaluated in a companion paper. The GEOV1 products are freely available to the community at www.geoland2.eu from 1999 up to present, globally at 1/112 degrees spatial sampling grid at the dekadal time step. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Grasslands and savannas form a heterogeneous and patchy mosaic of spectral properties that are challenging characterization of vegetation states. This study examines the potential for use of suites of vegetation indices (VIs) from the proposed Sentinel 2 sensor to describe vegetation states in grasslands and savannas for a North American transect. Hyperion hyperspectral data from the EO-1 satellite were used to simulate Sentinel 2, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) images for field sites in Alberta, North Dakota and Texas that represent the continuum from short grass prairie to oak savanna and are intermingled with agriculture. Indices representing photosynthetic pigments (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Carotenoid Reflectance Index, Anthocyanin Reflectance Index and Red-Green Ratio), vegetation and landscape water content (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), senescent vegetation and soil (Short Wave Infrared Ratio and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index) and herbaceous biomass (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) were used. There were distinct differences among sites in the relative sensitivity of different VIs depending upon moisture status, tree cover and type of grassland. Simple multi-variate models based on mean values or VIs showed limited ability to predict land cover classes and nominal vegetation states. However, analysis of sample areas using pixels as individual observations within a statistical distribution indicated that subtle variation and gradients within management or land units could be used to characterize fine differences in selected nominal states at each site. Despite some differences in band locations, all VIs except the anthocyanin reflectance index were scalable between Sentinel 2 and MODIS and VIIRS data. A framework for using suites of VIs as indicators of vegetation states that could be applied to the state and transition model approach-applied by the US Natural Resource Conservation Service is described. Land types can be effectively characterized by pixel value distribution histograms, and statistical metrics may be used as indicators of status and change. However, time series are needed to fully capture states and state changes, since grasslands and savannas have such high levels of spectral and phenological variation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB One of the primary variables affecting ignition and spread of wildfire is fuel moisture content (FMC). Live FMC (LFMC) is responsive to long term climate and plant adaptations to drought, requiring remote sensing for monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in LFMC. Liquid water has strong absorption features in the near- and shortwave-infrared spectral regions, which provide a physical basis for direct estimation of LFMC. Complexity introduced by biophysical and biochemical properties at leaf and canopy scales presents theoretical and methodological problems that must be addressed before remote sensing can be used for operational monitoring of LFMC. The objective of this paper is to review the use of remotely sensed data for estimating LFMC, with particular concern towards the operational use of LFMC products for fire risk assessment. Relationships between LFMC and fire behavior have been found in fuel ignition experiments and at landscape scales, but the complexity of fire interactions with fuel structure has prevented linking LFMC to fire behavior at intermediate scales. Changes in LFMC have both direct (liquid water absorption) and indirect (pigment and structural changes) impacts on spectral reflectance. The literature is dominated by studies that have used statistical (empirical) and physical model-based methods applied to coarse resolution data covering the visible, near infrared, and/or shortwave infrared regions of the spectrum. Empirical relationships often have the drawback of being site-specific, while the selection and parameterization of physically-based algorithms are far more complex. Challenges remain in quantifying error of remote sensing-based LFMC estimations and linking LFMC to fire behavior and risk. The review concludes with a list of priority areas where advancement is needed to transition remote sensing of LFMC to operational use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing offers great potential for detecting changes of the thermal state of permafrost and active layer dynamics in the context of Arctic warming. This study presents a comprehensive feasibility analysis of satellite-based permafrost modeling for a typical lowland tundra landscape in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. We assessed the performance of a transient permafrost model which is forced by time series of land surface temperatures (LSTs) and snow water equivalents (SWEs) obtained from MODIS and GlobSnow products. Both the satellite products and the model output were evaluated on the basis of long-term field measurements from the Samoylov permafrost observatory. The model was found to successfully reproduce the evolution of the permafrost temperature and freeze-thaw dynamics when calibrated with ground measurements. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed in order to evaluate the impact of inaccuracies in the model forcing and uncertainties in the parameterization. The sensitivity analysis showed that a correct SWE forcing and parameterization of the snow's thermal properties are essential for reliable permafrost modeling. In the worst case, the bias in the modeled permafrost temperatures can amount to 5 degrees C. For the thaw depth, a maximum uncertainty of about +/- 15 cm is found due to possible uncertainties in the soil composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the global distribution of phytoplankton functional types (PFT) and phytoplankton size classes (PSC) has been determined by remote sensing. Many of these methods rely on interpretation of phytoplankton size or type from pigment data, but independent validation has been difficult due to lack of appropriate in situ data on cell size.
   This work uses in situ data (photosynthetic pigments concentration and cell abundances) from the north-east Atlantic, along a trophic. gradient, sampled from 2005 to 2010, as well as Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) data for the same region, to test a previously developed conceptual model, which calculates the fractional contributions of pico-, nano- and micro-plankton to total phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass (Brewin et al., 2010). The application of the model proved to be successful, as shown by low mean absolute error between data and model fit. However, regional values obtained for the model parameters had some effect on the relative distribution of size classes as a function of chlorophyll-a, compared with the results according to the original model. The regional parameterisation yielded a dominance of micro-plankton contribution for chlorophyll-a concentrations greater than 0.5 mg m(-3), rather than from 1.3 mg m(-3) in the original model. Intracellular chlorophyll-a (Chla) per cell, for each size class, was computed from the cell enumeration results (microscope counts and flow cytometry) and the chlorophyll-a concentration for that size class given by the model. The median intracellular chlorophyll-a values computed were 0.004, 0.224 and 26.78 pg Chla cell(-1) for pico-, nano-, and micro-plankton respectively. This is generally consistent with the literature, thereby providing an indirect validation of the method based on pigments to assign size classes. Using a satellite-derived composite image of chlorophyll-a for the study area, a map of cell abundance was generated based on the computed intracellular chlorophyll-a for each size-class, thus extending the remote-sensing method for mapping size classes of phytoplankton from chlorophyll-a concentration to mapping cell numbers in each class. The map reveals the ubiquitous presence of pico-plankton, and shows that all size classes are more abundant in more productive areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets are a collection of orthorectified, cloud-minimized Landsat-type satellite images, providing near complete coverage of the global land area decadally since the early 1970s. The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from four sensors: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager. The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales. This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps. In general, the three latest GLS datasets are of a better quality than the GLS-1990 and GLS-1975 datasets, with most of the imagery (85%) having cloud cover of less than 10%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration. Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year). This paper provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies.

AB A sensor's footprint determines the target that is observed by the sensor, and influences the angular features of the target's directional brightness temperature (DBT) at the field site. This paper describes a new radiative transfer model (FovMod) to simulate the DBT of the row crop canopy by considering the sensor's footprint in the ground measurements. The FovMod firstly divides the sensor's circular or elliptical footprint into a few small cells, and then estimates the components' fractions (e.g., leaves, sunlit soil and shaded soil) in each cell based on the gap probability theory. The canopy's DBT is finally obtained by weighting the components' brightness temperatures and their fractions using a Gaussian point spreading function (PSF) of the sensor's response. Simulation results indicate that a small footprint causes the distribution of the DBT to be strongly dominated by the row direction and a single component's temperature but little influenced by the solar position. On the contrary, a large footprint smoothes the row-space effect and causes the DBT to distribute as a uniform, continuous canopy. Comparison with a previous parallel model shows that if the diameter of the sensor's circular footprint extends to 1.5-2.0 times as large as the total width of the row crop canopy, the footprint effect is minimized, and the ground measured DBT can, theoretically, be used to evaluate the parallel model with negligible error. Finally, validations with a maize canopy demonstrated that the new model performed more accurately than the parallel model to simulate the DBT. Moreover, the FovMod also provides an opportunity to assess the measurement uncertainty caused by some unexpected changes in the sensor's footprint. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The responses of land surface microwave properties to precipitation, including the brightness temperature (Tbs) and emissivities (MLSEs) at 18.7, 23.8 and 37.0 GHz, are studied by combining satellite synergetic retrievals (from AQUA AMSR-E and MODIS) with in-situ measured land surface temperature, soil moisture (SM), and precipitation at two Amazonia tropical rainforest sites Km83 and Km67. In general, Tbs and MLSEs are found to be negatively correlated to SM. Their dependences on the vegetation water content (VWC) are not monotonic: positive correlations at relatively low VWC and negative correlations at high VWC range. Although Amazon dense rainforest is the most stable vegetation regime, there are significant seasonal variations in both MLSE and Tbs, with amplitudes of about 0.025 and 7.0 K, respectively. The day-to-day variation of MLSE and Tbs is larger in the wet seasons than in the dry seasons, although the mean MLSE and Tbs are lower in the wet seasons than in the dry seasons. After precipitation, the SM, VWC and canopy interception water increase and reach their peak values at different transit times. There is an equilibrium time point (about 4 h in this case) at which the vegetation soil system holds the largest amount of moisture. Consequently, Tbs and MLSEs decrease during the first several hours after the start of precipitation and then increase after the equilibrium time point Ignoring the "turning point" may introduce significant errors in the estimation of MLSEs (up to 0.04) and Tbs (up to 10 K) under rainy conditions.

AB Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is the main cause of the global biodiversity crisis and protected areas are critical to prevent habitat loss. Rapid changes in institutional and socio-economic conditions, such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, often trigger widespread LULCC Yet, it is unclear how effective protected areas are in safeguarding habitat within them during such periods of rapid LULCC. Our goal here was to map changes in forest cover and agricultural lands from 1984 to 2010 in order to assess the effectiveness of two strictly protected areas, Olcsky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves, in temperate European Russia. We analyzed dense time series of Landsat images for three Landsat footprints and applied a support vector machine classification and trajectory-based change detection to map forest disturbance. We then used matching statistics to quantify the effectiveness of the protected areas. Our analyses highlighted considerable post-Soviet LULCC in European Russia. The LULCC maps revealed disturbances on 5.02% of the total forest area, with strongly declining disturbance rates in post-Soviet times. We also found that 39.89% of the agricultural land used in 1988 was abandoned after 1991, leading to widespread forest regrowth. Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves had a significantly lower probability of forest disturbance (-0.1 to -3.5% lower) in comparison to their surrounding areas. This suggests that protected areas were relatively effective in limiting human-induced forest disturbance in European Russia, despite lower levels of control and an eroding infrastructure for nature protection. Moreover, we found drastic land-cover changes, particularly forest regrowth, in the surroundings of these protected areas, highlighting conservation opportunities. Protected areas can play a key role in biodiversity conservation during periods of rapid LULCC, and remote sensing coupled with matching statistics provide important tools for monitoring the success and failure of conservation efforts.

AB Land cover maps at different resolutions and mapping extents contribute to modeling and support decision making processes. Because land cover affects and is affected by climate change, it is listed among the 13 terrestrial essential climate variables. This paper describes the generation of a land cover map for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) for the year 2008. It was developed in the framework of the project Latin American Network for Monitoring and Studying of Natural Resources (SERENA), which has been developed within the GOFC-GOLD Latin American network of remote sensing and forest fires (RedLaTIF). The SERENA land cover map for LAC integrates: I) the local expertise of SERENA network members to generate the training and validation data, 2) a methodology for land cover mapping based on decision trees using MODIS time series, and 3) class membership estimates to account for pixel heterogeneity issues. The discrete SERENA land cover product, derived from class memberships, yields an overall accuracy of 84% and includes an additional layer representing the estimated per-pixel confidence. The study demonstrates in detail the use of class memberships to better estimate the area of scarce classes with a scattered spatial distribution. The land cover map is already available as a printed wall map and will be released in digital format in the near future. The SERENA land cover map was produced with a legend and classification strategy similar to that used by the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) to generate a land cover map of the North American continent, that will allow to combine both maps to generate consistent data across America facilitating continental monitoring and modeling.

AB Retrievals of vegetation canopy water content (CWC) from remotely sensed imagery can improve our understanding of the water cycle and help manage irrigation of agricultural crops. Optical remote sensing data can be used to detect seasonal CWC variation but whether they are sensitive enough for detecting diurnal CWC variation remains unknown. This paper investigates whether MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) data can be used to detect diurnal variation in CWC over well irrigated almond and pistachio orchards in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California, USA. MASTER images were first corrected for the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effect to remove cross-track variation in reflectance amplitude. Two spectral indexes, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were derived from corrected morning and afternoon MASTER imagery and related to the field-measured CWC. At the ground level, a significant decrease (similar to 9%) in CWC occurred from morning to afternoon (p<0.0001). The field-measured CWC was positively correlated with MASTER-derived NDII and NDVI for both morning (NDII: r(2)=0.67, NDVI: r(2)=0.56, p<0.0001)and afternoon (NDII: r(2)=0.42, NDVI: r(2)=039, p<0.001) data. The diurnal change in CWC also led to a statistically significant spectral change that was observed as a 4% decline in NDII (p<0.005) or 2% decline in NDVI (p<0.0005). Our results show that the diurnal variation in CWC can be detected for the irrigated orchards using simple spectral indexes derived from MASTER data, with higher sensitivity for NDII than for NDVI as expected. The results also demonstrate the potential for remote sensing to improve crop management and better understand plant physiological changes at field to regional scales. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation moisture content is an important early indicator of forest drought stress, disease and fire risk. Existing remote sensing techniques to measure biochemical properties of vegetation, such as Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT), are limited by an inability to differentiate canopy and understorey properties and are influenced by variations in canopy structure. By providing a range-resolved estimate of reflectance, laser scanner measurements have the potential to overcome these limitations. Dual-wavelength laser scanning can provide an active measurement of reflectance from which spectral indices can be derived that are insensitive to range, incidence angle and scattering area of the target within the laser beam, factors that make exploiting single-wavelength laser scanner intensity data difficult.
   This study demonstrates the potential of dual-wavelength laser scanning for measurement of leaf biochemical properties, through determining the relationship between a laser-scanner-derived spectral index, using near infrared (1063 nm) and middle infrared (1545 nm) wavelengths, and the EWT of individual leaves. The suitability and sensitivity of the index is tested using a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT-5) and the method is tested experimentally under laboratory conditions using the Salford Advanced Laser Canopy Analyser. A strong relationship (R-2=0.8, RMSE=0.0069 gcm(-2)) was found between a normalised ratio of the two wavelengths and measured EWT of leaf samples. The relationship corresponds well to that predicted by modelling. However, the experimental data also revealed significant spatial variability in the index value across individual leaves, suggesting heterogeneity in moisture distribution at within-leaf scales. The study suggests significant potential for using dual-wavelength and multispectral laser scanning for measuring-vegetation biochemical properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass (AGB), with potential applications in REDD forest monitoring. For larger geographical regions such as counties, states or nations, it is not feasible to collect airborne LiDAR data continuously ("wall-to-wall") over the entire area of interest. Two-stage cluster survey designs have therefore been demonstrated by which LiDAR data are collected along selected individual flight-lines treated as clusters and with ground plots sampled along these LiDAR swaths. Recently, analytical AGB estimators and associated variance estimators that quantify the sampling variability have been proposed. Empirical studies employing these estimators have shown a seemingly equal or even larger uncertainty of the AGB estimates obtained with extensive use of LiDAR data to support the estimation as compared to pure field-based estimates employing estimators appropriate under simple random sampling (SRS). However, comparison of uncertainty estimates under SRS and sophisticated two-stage designs is complicated by large differences in the designs and assumptions. In this study, probability-based principles to estimation and inference were followed. We assumed designs of a field sample and a LiDAR-assisted survey of Hedmark County (HC) (27,390 km(2)), Norway, considered to be more comparable than those assumed in previous studies. The field sample consisted of 659 systematically distributed National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots and the airborne scanning LiDAR data were collected along 53 parallel flight-lines flown over the NFI plots. We compared AGB estimates based on the field survey only assuming SRS against corresponding estimates assuming two-phase (double) sampling with LiDAR and employing model-assisted estimators. We also compared AGB estimates based on the field survey only assuming two-stage sampling (the NFI plots being grouped in clusters) against corresponding estimates assuming two-stage sampling with the LiDAR and employing model-assisted estimators. For each of the two comparisons, the standard errors of the AGB estimates were consistently lower for the LiDAR-assisted designs. The overall reduction of the standard errors in the LiDAR-assisted estimation was around 40-60% compared to the pure field survey. We conclude that the previously proposed two-stage model-assisted estimators are inappropriate for surveys with unequal lengths of the LiDAR flight-lines and new estimators are needed. Some options for design of LiDAR-assisted sample surveys under REDD are also discussed, which capitalize on the flexibility offered when the field survey is designed as an integrated part of the overall survey design as opposed to previous LiDAR-assisted sample surveys in the boreal and temperate zones which have been restricted by the current design of an existing NFT.

AB Remote-sensing based cover mapping has a long history of use in natural resource management for a wide-range of applications. In order to be effectively employed, remote-sensing based cover maps must be accurate and meet the spatial scale inherent to the phenomena of interest. In this study, we employed the Random Forests algorithm in a supervised classification approach to construct a fine-scale (i.e., 1.0 meter pixel resolution) remote-sensing based cover map of coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems at Cape Cod National Seashore, USA. We achieved high overall classification accuracies (i.e., 75.1% and 86.8% correct classification rate for the dune and salt marsh study areas, respectively) with a large proportion of the misclassified holdout validation assessment points being errors of commission between overlapping and/or ecologically similar cover classes. In addition, we were able to considerably reduce the predictor variable set by using a forward selection variable reduction method while achieving modestly higher classification accuracies compared to the global model. Our results suggest that coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems can be mapped at a fine spatial resolution with reasonably high classification accuracy using a supervised Random Forests-based approach such as ours.

AB Snow plays a critical role in hydrology and water resources, but snow properties in mountainous areas vary dramatically in space, making characterization difficult: in situ measurements represent a single point of spatially-variable snow properties. Spaceborne passive microwave (PM) remote sensing has spatially continuous coverage, but coarse spatial resolution. PM spatial footprints are nominally elliptical, with the spatial orientation changing relative to a given basin on the ground from one satellite pass to the next. The widely used Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) resamples the raw PM observations to a 25 km x 25 km grid; this is far coarser than The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) 37 GHz Level 2A (L2A) footprints with an area of 87.9 km(2). This paper presents methods for processing the L2A data in order to illustrate that PM measurements contain information about snow accumulation and ablation cycles in mountainous regions. Methods are presented 1) to calculate the average T-b over a hydrologic basin for monitoring SWE accumulation amount, and 2) to interpolate T-b to a point for monitoring SWE ablation timing. Across the six-year study period, the range of the T-b was 50 K. while the range of the air temperature was only 30 K, indicating significant surface emissivity variations. The minimum T-b of each water year (WY), which starts from October 1 of a calendar year and ends at September 30 of the next, showed a strong inverse relationship to SWE measured in situ; the correlation coefficient between T-b and an in situ basin average SWE was -0.94. The L2A data is three times more sensitive to than the EASE-Grid data to in situ SWE. The diurnal amplitude variability (DAV, or difference between daytime and nighttime T-b) was used to identify the day of melt onset and compared with in situ estimates of onset derived from daily SWE measurements. L2A data corresponded well with the in situ onset dates with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and an RMSE of 5.04 days. When using EASE-Grid data, the RMSE in onset date was 11.7 days. In addition, T-b DAV was found to be correlated with T-air DAV during winter, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.72. Future work will explore methods to extract this information in order to improve estimates of snow accumulation and ablation patterns. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sea turtles nesting beaches are found near-globally, and the ability to characterize beaches by topographic and bathymetric features has remained largely out of reach. Twenty-one beaches and their offshore areas in southern Florida used by three sea turtle species (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Dermochelys coriacea) were compared using topographic measures derived from LiDAR data. Variables such as slope, aspect, rugosity, and topographic and bathymetric position indices (TPI and BPI) were extracted from the LiDAR surface raster to characterize beaches used by sea turtles; stepwise multiple regression was used to determine which variables are most strongly associated with turtle nesting density. The three species exhibited tolerances for similar ranges of values in measured variables; beaches with values outside these tolerances were not used for nesting. Beach nesting density can be successfully modeled for all three species, but different topographic measures were important in each model. This work demonstrates the potential of high spatial resolution topographic datasets to successfully characterize coastal habitat for ecological applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study validated the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture products developed by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using ground measurements at six Rural Development Administration network sites during the 2007 growing season (May 1 through September 30) in Korea. In order to overcome current key validation issues from the spatial scaling mismatch between the ground measurements (point scale) and the AMSR-E soil moisture products (25 km scale), a synergistic approach from 25 to 1 km spatial resolution was performed using auxiliary data from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The 25 km VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture data had error statistics (biases = -0.099 to -0.170 m(3) m(-3), root-mean-squared error = 0.131 to 0.179 m(3) m(-3), and correlation coefficients = 0.127 to 0.725) that were worse than the suggested goal of accuracy (less than or equal to root-mean-squared error of 0.06 m(3) m(-3)) determined by the several previous validation studies. This deficiency is theoretically due to the spatial scaling mismatch and different measurement depth between the ground measurements and the VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture products. The disaggregated 1 km soil moisture was reasonably similar to the 25 km VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture at spatial and temporal scales with better error statistics (biases = -0.024 to -0.158 m(3) m(-3), root-mean-squared error = 0.059 to 0.171 m(3) m(-3), and correlation coefficients = 0.348 to 0.658). Although additional studies are needed under a range of field conditions, the synergistic approach used in this study appears to be a feasible method to improve the spatial distributions of VUA-NASA AMSR-E soil moisture products as well as future microwave soil moisture products.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) and its diurnal variation are vital to the study of land-atmosphere interactions and climate change. In this study, in situ and MSG-SEVIRI-derived LSTs were used to evaluate the performance of six published diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models, i.e. the GOT01, GOT01_0, VAN06, JNG06, INA08, and GOT09 models. Two time intervals were considered: one is the entire day (sunrise to sunrise: Period A), and the other is from 09:00 A.M. to 03:00 A.M. on the following day (local solar time) (Period B). The results of Period A indicated that the JNG06 and GOT09 models performed best with overall root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.5 K. The GOT01, VAN06, and INA08 models performed similarly with overall RMSEs of 0.8 K. The GOT01_0 model performed the worst with an overall RMSE of 1 K. The results of Period B demonstrated that, except for the GOT01_0 model, the other models produced similar results with overall RMSEs of 0.4 K. However, if the width over the half-period of the cosine term (omega) in the GOT01_0, GOT01, and INA08 models was treated as a free parameter in the model fit during Period A. the performance of the GOT01 and INA08 models was significantly improved and attained the same level of accuracy as the JNG06 and GOT09 models. Although the accuracy of the GOT01_0 model was also improved to an overall RMSE of 0.8 K, with five free parameters, this model cannot accurately describe the variations of the LSTs around sunrise and noon.

AB People's preference for living in rural areas is converting rural landscapes into low-density residential development (i.e., exurban development). To assess the environmental impacts of exurban development (e.g., habitat fragmentation, threats to wildlife, and increased demand for natural resources), accurate maps of its spatial extent and change over time are needed. Mapping technologies that are based on remote sensing spectral data alone have generally failed to separate exurban development from the surrounding landscape and from other mixed pixels with similar spectra. Although deciduous forests in the eastern United States are thought to have experienced a significant increase in exurbanized area, a rigorous assessment of exurban trends has yet to be undertaken. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel analytic approach to map exurban development and to assess its magnitude and rate in north-central Virginia and western Maryland. We applied spectral mixture analysis to Landsat TM images from 1986 to 2009 at 4 time steps to estimate the fractional cover of vegetation, shade, substrate, and non-photosynthetic vegetation endmembers within each image. Using training data based on aerial photos, we classified the resulting endmember fraction images using a decision tree. Finally, terminal nodes from the decision tree that did not differentiate between exurban and urban areas were analyzed using morphological spatial pattern analysis to assess the shape and form of landscape elements. Scattered, isolated pixels were considered representative of exurban development. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 93 to 98%, an improvement of up to 34% over the decision tree alone. Our mapping approach effectively identified 7.3% of north-central Virginia and western Maryland as exurban development. Exurban development had a substantial expansion in the region, increasing on average 6.1% per year between 1986 and 2009. The mapping of land-cover changes beyond urban fringe provides valuable information for policymakers, planners, and land managers tasked with managing and mitigating the potential adverse consequences of this increasingly common form of landscape change.

TI Combining lake and watershed characteristics with Landsat TM data for

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

DE Water quality; Maine; New England; Remote sensing; Assessment tool
ID WISCONSIN
AB Water clarity is a reliable indicator of lake productivity and an ideal metric of regional water quality. Clarity is an indicator of other water quality variables including chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and trophic status; however, unlike these metrics, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Remote sensing is useful in regions containing a large number of lakes that are cost prohibitive to monitor regularly using traditional field methods. Field-assessed lakes generally are easily accessible and may represent a spatially irregular, non-random sample of a region. We developed a remote monitoring program for Maine lakes >8 ha (1511 lakes) to supplement existing field monitoring programs. We combined Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) brightness values for TM bands 1 (blue) and 3 (red) to estimate water clarity (secchi disk depth) during 1990-2010. Although similar procedures have been applied to Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes, neither state incorporates physical lake variables or watershed characteristics that potentially affect clarity into their models. Average lake depth consistently improved model fitness, and the proportion of wetland area in lake watersheds also explained variability in clarity in some cases. Nine regression models predicted water clarity (R-2=0.69-0.90) during 1990-2010, with separate models for eastern (TM path 11; four models) and western Maine (TM path 12; five models that captured differences in topography and landscape disturbance. Average absolute difference between model-estimated and observed secchi depth ranged 0.65-1.03 m. Eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes consistently were estimated more accurately than oligotrophic lakes. Our results show that TM bands 1 and 3 can be used to estimate regional lake water clarity outside the Great Lakes Region and that the accuracy of estimates is improved with additional model variables that reflect physical lake characteristics and watershed conditions.

AB In this paper we integrate the information about water stress into SEBS, one of the surface energy balance models that employ remote sensing (RS) data. The level of water stress is taken into account in the calculation of sensible heat, through a modified definition of kB(-1), the parameter that summarizes the excess aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer compared to momentum transfer. Surface energy balance models are employed to obtain evapotranspiration as the remainder of available energy minus sensible heat flux (H). These models assume that information on the ratio of actual to potential evaporation is implicitly embedded in the land surface temperature. This assumption is usually adequate where available energy is the limiting factor for evapotranspiration (ET), but there is a problem when water availability becomes limiting for ET. In this case, the daily evapotranspiration is often overestimated, in particular for sparsely vegetated semi-arid regions, because of an underestimation of sensible heat flux for these areas. Our method remedies this shortcoming by progressively decreasing kB(-1) with increasing levels of water stress. This decreases aerodynamic resistance, and hence increases H, leading to lower estimates of ET. The decrease of kB(-1) with a rise in plant water stress is based on general plant physiological observations related to vertical canopy stomatal conductance profiles, which affects the exchange of sensible and latent heat between the canopy and the atmosphere.
   The new approach was tested by comparing SEBS H outputs with field observations from Bowen ratio stations distributed over the Konya basin in Turkey, and the results indicate a large improvement when the soil moisture is integrated explicitly in the calculation of sensible heat flux by SEBS. More importantly, the new approach provides a considerable operational improvement for regional ET mapping through integrating microwave soil moisture measurements into SEBS, as illustrated by our findings for this semi-arid region. The daily ET map generated by the new SEBS model captured better the low ET values observed in the drylands, and also reflected better the overall contrast between irrigated fields and the extremely dry surrounding areas. Improved mapping of regional ET by soil moisture integrated SEBS offers the opportunity to provide more accurate estimation of energy and water fluxes in regions where plant water stress is a recurrent feature.

AB The landscape freeze-thaw (FT) signal from satellite microwave remote sensing is closely linked to vegetation phenology and land-atmosphere trace gas exchange where seasonal frozen temperatures are a major constraint to plant growth. We applied a temporal change classification of 37 GHz brightness temperature (T-b) series from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to classify daily FT status over global land areas where seasonal frozen temperatures influence ecosystem processes. A temporally consistent, long-term (30 year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR T-b record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/-8.6) and 84 ( +/-9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6 months, with greater benefits at higher (>45 degrees N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189 days yr(-1)) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (-0.149 days yr(-1)) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033 degrees C yr(-1) regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199 days yr(-1)) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.

AB A new and updated version of the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) based GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) dataset is now available covering 1981 to 2010 (GIMMS3g). Earlier versions of this global coverage 15-day composite dataset have been used for numerous local to global scale vegetation time series studies during recent years. However, several aspects of the AVHRR sensor design and data processing potentially introduce substantial noise into the NDVI dataset if not corrected for. The more recent NDVI dataset from Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is considered an improvement over AVHRR data and with the release of GIMMS3g an overlapping period of 11 years now provides a possibility to perform a robust evaluation of the accuracy of GIMMS3g data and derived trends. In this study the accuracy is evaluated by comparison with the global Terra MODIS NDVI (MOD13C2 Collection 5) data using linear regression trend analysis. The trends of GIMMS NDVI were found to be in overall acceptable agreement with MODIS NDVI data. A significant trend in NDVI (alpha=0.05) was found for 11.8% of the MODIS NDVI pixels on a global scale (5.4% characterised by positive trends and 6.3 with negative trends) whereas GIMMS NDVI analysis produced a total of 10.5% significant pixels (4.9% positive, 5.6% negative). However, larger differences were found for the Southern Hemisphere land masses (South America and Australia) and the high northern latitude Arctic regions. From a linear regression analysis the correlation coefficient between the two datasets was found to be highly significant for areas with a distinct phenological cycle. Discrepancies between the GIMMS and MODIS datasets were found in equatorial areas (broadleaved, evergreen forest), Arctic areas (sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub cover) and arid areas (herbaceous cover, closed-open). Linear regression of QA filtered Terra and Aqua MODIS NDVI (2003-2010) revealed similar inconsistencies for Arctic and equatorial areas suggesting that robust long-term NDVI trend estimates in these areas are difficult to obtain from both GIMMS and MODIS data. Additionally, GIMMS based NDVI trend analysis in arid areas of limited photosynthetic activity should be interpreted with caution. The regression coefficient (slope value) (p<0.01) was found to be close to 1 for most land cover types on a global scale (global land cover class average slope = 1.00) suggesting overall compatibility between MODIS and GIMMS NDVI, but with land cover class specific variations (within class and between classes).

AB Spatially-explicit knowledge of the timing, frequency, and intensity of forest disturbances is essential for forest management, yet little is known about how disturbances such as forest harvests and insect outbreaks might accumulate in their effects over time. Capturing the many forest harvest and insect defoliation events occurring over twenty-five years, we transformed a series of Landsat images into cumulative disturbance maps covering Green Ridge State Forest (GRSF) and Savage River State Forest (SRSF) in western Maryland. These maps summed yearly Delta DI images, which were defined as the change in a yearly tasseled cap disturbance index (DI), relative to a synthetic reference condition map created by finding the minimum DI value for all years. Intensive field-plot surveys and AVIRIS imagery collected during the summer of 2009 provided measurements of forest structure and canopy nitrogen. With these data, we found that while the most recent year's Delta DI had little relation, increases in the cumulative DI were related to decreased field-measured current canopy cover (R-2= 0.66 at GRSF, 0.67 at SRSF and 0.34 combined) and watershed-averaged AVIRIS canopy N (R-2= 0.40 at GRSF, 0.57 at SRSF and 0.54 combined). The latter relationship was obscured at the field-plot level of analysis, suggesting that fine scale studies will also need to account for other drivers (e.g. species composition) of variability in canopy N. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be synthesized into cumulative metrics incorporating multiple disturbance types, which help explain important cumulative disturbance-mediated changes in ecosystem functioning.

AB The knowledge of impervious surfaces, especially the magnitude, location, geometry, spatial pattern of impervious surfaces and the perviousness-imperviousness ratio, is significant to a range of issues and themes in environmental science central to global environmental change and human-environment interactions. Impervious surface data is important for urban planning and environmental and resources management. Therefore, remote sensing of impervious surfaces in the urban areas has recently attracted unprecedented attention. In this paper, various digital remote sensing approaches to extract and estimate impervious surfaces will be examined. Discussions will focus on the mapping requirements of urban impervious surfaces. In particular, the impacts of spatial, geometric, spectral, and temporal resolutions on the estimation and mapping will be addressed, so will be the selection of an appropriate estimation method based on remotely sensed data characteristics. This literature review suggests that major approaches over the past decade include pixel-based (image classification, regression, etc.), sub-pixel based (linear spectral unmixing, imperviousness as the complement of vegetation fraction etc.), object-oriented algorithms, and artificial neural networks. Techniques, such as data/image fusion, expert systems, and contextual classification methods, have also been explored. The majority of research efforts have been made for mapping urban landscapes at various scales and on the spatial resolution requirements of such mapping. In contrast, there is less interest in spectral and geometric properties of impervious surfaces. More researches are also needed to better understand temporal resolution, change and evolution of impervious surfaces over time, and temporal requirements for urban mapping. It is suggested that the models, methods, and image analysis algorithms in urban remote sensing have been largely developed for the imagery of medium resolution (10-100 m). The advent of high spatial resolution satellite images, spaceborne hyperspectral images, and LiDAR data is stimulating new research idea, and is driving the future research trends with new models and algorithms.

AB We present a new global dataset of aerosol properties and surface reflectance derived from the AATSR instrument for the period 2003-2009. The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol type over a wide variety of surfaces including ocean, vegetated land and desert. The AATSR dual-view allows retrieval without prior information about land surface reflectance. Results show global mean values of AOD at 550 nm over land of 0.195, and over ocean of 0.137. The datasets are compared with sun photometer measurements from AERONET and the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN), and with MODIS and MISR aerosol products. Agreement with AERONET (r=0.80; Delta tau=+/- 0.025 +/- 0.4 tau) and MAN (r=0.97; Delta tau=+/- 0.04) was high. Estimates of aerosol coarse/fine mode classification where tau>02 show 71% correspondence over land and 81% over ocean. Monthly AOD from MODIS, MISR and AATSR showed close agreement over most regions. However, over deserts AATSR estimates were higher than MODIS or MISR, while over southern oceans both AATSR and MODIS were lower than MISR. Global composites show aerosol sources of desert dust, anthropogenic pollution, biomass burning, and their transport. Aerosol radiative forcing is a major source of uncertainty in climate modelling; this newly derived dataset gives spatially and temporally comprehensive fields of aerosol properties suitable to constrain global models and to analyse regional and global trends.

AB While feature tracking of sea ice using cross-correlation methods on pairs of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images has been extensively carried out in the Arctic, this is not the case in the Antarctic. This is due to the dynamic nature of Antarctic pack ice, its microwave signature, the tendency for SAR swath paths to be poorly aligned with the often narrow sea ice zone around the continent and inadequate satellite sampling. A semi-automated system, known as IPADS (IMCORR [IMageCORRelationj Processing, Analysis and Display System), has been developed to map fast ice and pack ice in Antarctica using multiple pairs of SAR images. The software processing pipeline uses overlapping image pairs which are geocoded and roughly registered using only data contained in the image headers. Next, fast ice maps are rapidly generated using zero motion features located within ocean regions. This also provides precise image registration. Finally, the same image pairs are re-examined for pack ice motion in a slower off-line batch process. The pack and fast ice are identified using a cluster-based search method which compares both location and motion information. Each image pair generates a NetCDF file which adds to a growing database of Antarctic sea ice motion and ice roughness. Five image-pair examples are presented to illustrate the methods used as well as their strengths and limitations. Substantial pack ice motion can often be detected in the marginal ice zone on SAR images only a few days apart. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Insect outbreaks are major forest disturbances, causing tree mortality across millions of ha in North America. Resultant spatial and temporal patterns of tree mortality can profoundly affect ecosystem structure and function. In this study, we evaluated the classification accuracy of multispectral imagery at different spatial resolutions. We used four-band digital aerial imagery (30-cm spatial resolution and aggregated to coarser resolutions) acquired over lodgepole pine-dominated stands in central Colorado recently attacked by mountain pine beetle. Classes of interest included green trees and multiple stages of post-insect attack tree mortality, including dead trees with red needles ("red-attack"), dead trees without needles ("gray-attack"), and non-forest. The 30-cm resolution image facilitated delineation of trees located in the field, which were used in image classification. We employed a maximum likelihood classifier using the green band, Red-Green Index (RGI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Pixel-level classification accuracies using this imagery were good (overall accuracy of 87%, kappa = 0.84), although misclassification occurred between a) sunlit crowns of live (green) trees and herbaceous vegetation, and b) sunlit crowns of gray- and red-attack trees and bare soil. We explored the capability of coarser resolution imagery, aggregated from the 30-cm resolution to 1.2, 2.4, and 4.2 m, to improve classification accuracy. We found the highest accuracy at the 2.4-m resolution, where reduction in omission and commission errors and increases in overall accuracy (90%) and kappa (0.88) were achieved, and visual inspection indicated improved mapping. Pixels at this resolution included more shadow in forested regions than pixels in finer resolution imagery, thereby reducing forest canopy reflectance and allowing improved separation between forest and non-forest classes, yet were fine enough to resolve individual tree crowns better than the 4.2-m imagery. Our results illustrate that a classification of an image with a spatial resolution similar to the area of a tree crown outperforms that of finer and coarser resolution imagery for mapping tree mortality and non-forest classes. We also demonstrate that multispectral imagery can be used to separate multiple postoutbreak attack stages (i.e., red-attack and gray-attack) from other classes in the image. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Optical remote sensing is still one of the most attractive choices for obtaining biomass information, as new sensors are available with fine spatial and spectral resolutions. Better biomass estimates may be possible if suitable processing techniques for these sensors can be demonstrated. This research investigates the potential of high resolution optical data from the ALOS AVNIR-2 sensor for biomass estimation in a mountainous, subtropical forested region using four different types of image processing techniques including i) spectral reflectance and simple spectral band ratio, ii) commonly used vegetation indices, iii) texture parameters and iv) ratio of texture parameters. Simple linear and stepwise multiple regression models were developed between biomass data from 50 field plots, and image parameters derived from these techniques.
   Results indicate that spectral reflectance, the simple band ratio, and commonly used vegetation indices have relatively low potential for biomass estimation, as only about 58% of the variability in the field data was explained by the model (adjusted r(2) = 0.58 and RMSE = 64 t/ha). However, the texture parameters of spectral bands were found to be effective for biomass estimation with an explained variability of ca. 76% (adjusted r(2) = 0.76 and RMSE=46 t/ha). The result was further improved to adjusted r(2) = 0.88 (RMSE = 32 t/ha) using the simple ratio of texture parameters. The results suggest that the performance of biomass estimation can be improved significantly using the texture parameters of high resolution optical data, and further improvement can be obtained using the ratio of texture parameters, as this combines the advantages of both texture and ratio.

AB Spectral mixture modeling has previously been used to retrieve fire temperature and fractional area from multiband radiance data containing emitted radiance from fires. While this type of temperature modeling has potential for improving understanding of fire behavior and emissions, modeled temperature and fractional area may depend on the wavelength region used for modeling. Using airborne hyperspectral (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer; AVIRIS) and multispectral (MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator: MASTER) data acquired simultaneously over the 2008 Indians Fire in California, we examined changes in modeled fire temperature and fractional area that occurred when input wavelength regions were varied. Temperature and fractional area modeled from multiple MASTER runs were directly compared. Incompatible spatial resolutions prevented direct comparison of the AVIRIS and MASTER model runs, so total area modeled at each temperature was used to indirectly compare temperature and fractional area retrieved from these two sensors. AVIRIS and MASTER model runs using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands produced consistent fire temperatures and fractional areas when modeled temperatures exceeded 800 K. Temperatures and fire fractional areas were poorly correlated for temperatures below 800 K and when the SWIR bands were excluded as model inputs. The single temperature blackbody assumption commonly used in mixing model retrieval of fire temperature is potentially useful for modeling higher temperature fires, but is likely not valid for lower temperature smoldering combustion due to mixed radiance from multiple fuel elements combusting at different temperatures. SWIR data contain limited emitted radiance from combustion at lower temperatures, and are thus essential for consistent modeling of fire temperature and fractional area at higher fire temperatures.

AB In mountain forest ecosystems where elevation gradients are prominent, temperature gradient-based phonological variability can be high. However, there are few studies that assess the capability of remote sensing observations to monitor ecosystem phenology along elevation gradients, despite their relevance under climate change. We investigated the potential of medium resolution remotely sensed data to monitor the elevation variations in the seasonal dynamics of a temperate deciduous broadleaf forested ecosystem. Further, we explored the impact of elevation on the onset of spring leafing. This study was based on the analysis of multi-annual time-series of VEGETATION data acquired over the French Pyrenees Mountain Region (FPMR), in conjunction with simultaneous ground-based observations of leaf phenology made for two dominant tree species in the region (oak and beech). The seasonal variations in the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) were analyzed during a five-year period (2002 to 2006). The five years of data were averaged into a one sole year in order to fill the numerous large spatio-temporal gaps due to cloud and snow presence frequent in mountains - without altering the temporal resolution. Since a VEGETATION pixel (1 km(2)) includes several types of land cover, the broadleaf forest-specific seasonal dynamics of PVI was reconstructed pixel-by-pixel using a temporal unmixing method based on a non-parametric statistical approach. The spatial pattern of the seasonal response of PVI was clearly consistent with the relief. Nevertheless the elevational or geographic range of tree species, which differ in their phenology sensitivity to temperature, also has a significant impact on this pattern. The reduction in the growing season length with elevation was clearly observable from the delay in the increase of PVI in spring and from the advance of its decrease in the fall. The elevation variations in leaf flushing timing were estimated from the temporal change in PVI in spring over the study area. They were found to be consistent with those measured in situ (R2>0.95). It was deduced that, over FPMR, the mean delay of leaf flushing timing for every 100 m increase in elevation was estimated be approximately 2.3 days. The expected estimation error of satellite-based leaf unfolding date for a given elevation was approximately 2 days. This accuracy can be considered as satisfactory since it would allow us to detect changes in leafing timing of deciduous broadleaf forests with a magnitude equivalent to that due to an elevation variation of 100 m (2.3 days on average), or in other words, to that caused by a variation in the mean annual air temperature of 0.5 degrees C. Although averaging the VEGETATION data over five years led to a loss of interannual information, it was found to be a robust approach to characterise the elevation variations in spring leafing and its long-term trends.

AB Discrete Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data is used to stratify a multilayered eucalyptus forest and characterise the structure of the vertical profile. We present a methodology that may prove useful for a very broad range of forest management applications, particularly for timber inventory evaluation and forest growth modelling. In this study, we use LiDAR data to stratify a multilayered eucalyptus forest and characterise the structure of specific vegetation layers for forest hydrology research, as vegetation dynamics influence a catchment's streamflow yield. A forest stand's crown height, density, depth, and closure, influence aerodynamic properties of the forest structure and the amount of transpiring leaf area, which in turn determine evapotranspiration rates. We present a methodology that produces canopy profile indices of understorey and overstorey vegetation using mixture models with a wide range of theoretical distribution functions. Mixture models provide a mechanism to summarise complex canopy attributes into a short list of parameters that can be empirically analysed against stand characteristics.
   Few studies have explored theoretical distribution functions to represent the vertical profile of vegetation structure in LiDAR data. All prior studies have focused on a Weibull distribution function, which is unimodal. In a complex native forest ecosystem, the form of the distribution of LiDAR points may be highly variable between forest types and age classes. We compared 44 probability distributions within a two component mixture model to determine the most suitable bimodal distributions for representing LiDAR density estimates of Mountain Ash forests in south-eastern Australia. An elimination procedure identified eleven candidate distributions for representing the eucalyptus component of the mixture model.
   We demonstrate the methodology on a sample of plots to predict overstorey stand volumes and basal area, and understorey basal area of 18-, 37-, and 70-year old Mountain Ash forest with variable density classes. The 70-year old forest has been subjected to a range of treatments including: thinning of the eucalyptus layer with two distinct retention rates, removal of the understorey, and clear felling of patches that have 37 year old regenerating forest. We demonstrate that the methodology has clear potential, as observed versus predicted values of eucalyptus basal area and stand volume were highly correlated, with bootstrap based r(2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.89 and 0.67 to 0.88 respectively. Non-eucalyptus basal area r(2) ranged from 0.5 to 0.91. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The subject of this study is to investigate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing data to predict ground concentrations of PM10 over the European Alpine region using satellite derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and the polar-orbiting MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The spatial and temporal resolutions of these aerosol products (10 km and 2 measurements per day for MODIS, similar to 25 km and observation intervals of 15 min for SEVIRI) permit an evaluation of PM estimation from space at different spatial and temporal scales. Different empirical linear relationships between coincident AOD and PM10 observations are evaluated at 13 ground-based PM measurement sites, with the assumption that aerosols are vertically homogeneously distributed below the planetary Boundary Layer Height (BLH). The BLH and Relative Humidity (RH) variability are assessed, as well as their impact on the parameterization. The BLH has a strong influence on the correlation of daily and hourly time series, whilst RH effects are less clear and smaller in magnitude. Despite its lower spatial resolution and AOD accuracy, SEVIRI shows higher correlations than MODIS (r(SEV)similar to 0.7, r(MOD)similar to 0.6) with regard to daily averaged PM10. Advantages from MODIS arise only at hourly time scales in mountainous locations but lower correlations were found for both sensors at this time scale (r similar to 0.45). Moreover, the fraction of days in 2008 with at least one satellite observation was 27% for SEVIRI and 17% for MODIS. These results suggest that the frequency of observations plays an important role in PM monitoring, while higher spatial resolution does not generally improve the PM estimation. Ground-based Sun Photometer (SP) measurements are used to validate the satellite-based AOD in the study region and to discuss the impact of aerosols' micro-physical properties in the empirical models. A lower error limit of 30 to 60% in the PM10 assessment from space is estimated in the study area as a result of AOD uncertainties, variability of aerosols properties and the heterogeneity of ground measurement sites. It is concluded that SEVIRI has a similar capacity to map PM as sensors on board polar-orbiting platforms, with the advantage of a higher number of observations. However, the accuracy represents a serious limitation to the applicability of satellites for ground PM mapping, especially in mountainous areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate high-resolution soil moisture data are needed for a range of agricultural and hydrologic activities. To improve the spatial resolution of similar to 40 km resolution passive microwave-derived soil moisture, a methodology based on 1 km resolution MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) red, near-infrared and thermal-infrared data has been implemented at 4 km resolution. The three components of that method are (i) fractional vegetation cover, (ii) soil evaporative efficiency (defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation) and (iii) a downscaling relationship. In this paper, 36 different disaggregation algorithms are built from 3 fractional vegetation cover formulations, 3 soil evaporative efficiency models, and 4 downscaling relationships. All algorithms differ with regard to the representation of the nonlinear relationship between microwave-derived soil moisture and optical-derived soil evaporative efficiency. Airborne L-band data collected over an Australian agricultural area are used to both generate similar to 40 km resolution microwave pixels and verify disaggregation results at 4 km resolution. Among the 36 disaggregation algorithms, one is identified as being more robust (insensitive to soil, vegetation and atmospheric variables) than the others with a mean slope between MODIS-disaggregated and L-band derived soil moisture of 0.94. The robustness of that algorithm is notably assessed by comparing the disaggregation results obtained using composited (averaged) Terra and Aqua MODIS data, and using data from Terra and Aqua separately. The error on disaggregated soil moisture is systematically reduced by compositing daily Terra and Aqua data with an error of 0.012 vol./vol. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the 21st century, water resource management will be a major socioeconomic issue and an essential component of progress in semi-and regions The Soudano-Sahelian region of Africa suffers from a chronic lack of reliable hydro-geological maps for local water resource managers To provide better tools for groundwater exploration, this paper focuses on hydro-geological lineament mapping using remote sensing data The objectives were (1) evaluate the potential of multi-angular and multi-temporal Radarsat-1 images for extracting lineaments in semi-and regions and (2) provide map of potential hydro-geological lineaments. No significant relationship was found between lineament yield and incidence angle of Radarsat-1 images. while lineament spatial distribution was in good agreement with the land use and geology of the study area. The high scores observed for NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE orientations match the results of local lineament studies of the region. Radarsat-1 image acquired on May 01, 2001 offers the greatest potential, due to the reduced effect of vegetation during this region's dry season Potential hydro-geological lineaments were mapped using the weighting of well location, presence of green vegetation during the dry season, preferential lineament orientations and presence of cross-points The mapping revealed five classes (Very low, Low, Moderate, High and Very high) of potential hydro-geological lineaments with high and very high potential poorly represented. Results also reveal that most wells are far enough from lineaments or cross-points and hence the inefficiency of existing drilling programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Diagnosis of land condition is a basic prerequisite for finding the degradation of a territory under climatic and human pressures leading to desertification. Ecosystemic approaches, such as the one presented here, address ecosystem maturity or resilience. They are low cost, not very prone to error propagation and well-suited to implementation on remotely sensed time-series data covering large areas. The purposes of this work were to develop a land condition surveillance methodology based on the amount of biomass produced per unit rainfall, and to test it on the Iberian Peninsula.
   In this article, we propose parallel and complementary synchronic assessment and diachronic monitoring procedures to overcome the paradox of monitoring as a sequence of assessments. This is intrinsically contradictory when dealing with complex landscape mosaics, as relative estimators commonly produced for assessment are often difficult to set in a meaningful time sequence. Our approach is built on monthly time-series of two types of data, a vegetation density estimator (Green Vegetation Fraction-GVF) derived from Global Environmental Monitoring satellite archives, and corresponding interpolated climate fields. Rain Use Efficiency (RUE) is computed on two time scales to generate assessment classes. This enables detrended comparisons across different climate zones and provides automatic detection of reference areas to obtain relative RUE. The monitoring procedure uses raw GVF change rates over time and aridity in a stepwise regression to generate subclasses of discriminated trends for those drivers. The results of assessment and monitoring are then combined to yield the land condition diagnostics through explicit rules that associate their respective categories.
   The approach was tested in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1989 to 2000 using monthly GVF images derived from the 1-km MEDOKADS archive based on the NOAA-AVHRR sensors, and a corresponding archive of climate variables. The resulting land condition was validated against independent data from the Natura 2000 network of conservation reserves. In very general terms, land was found to be healthier than expected, with localised spots of ongoing degradation that were associated with current or recent intensive land use. Static or positive vegetation growth rates were detected almost everywhere, including Mediterranean areas that had undergone increased aridification during the study period. Interestingly, degrading or static trends prevailed in degraded or unusually degraded land, whereas trends to improve were most represented in land in good or unusually good condition.

AB MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) snow cover products, of daily, freely available, worldwide spatial extent at medium spatial resolution, have been widely applied in regional snow cover and modeling studies, although high cloud obscuration remains a concern in some applications. In this study, various approaches including daily combination, adjacent temporal deduction, fixed-day combination, flexible multi-day combination, and multi-sensor combination are assessed to remove cloud obscuration while still maintain the temporal and spatial resolutions. The performance of the resultant snow cover maps are quantitatively evaluated against in situ observations at 244 SNOTEL stations over the Pacific Northwest USA during the period of 2006-2008 hydrological years. Results indicate that daily Terra and Aqua MODIS combination and adjacent temporal deduction can reduce cloud obscuration and classification errors although an annual mean of 37% cloud coverage remains. Classification errors in snow-covered months are actually small and tend to underestimate the snow cover. Primary errors of MODIS daily, fixed and flexible multi-day combination products occur during transient months. Flexible multi-day combination is an efficient approach to maintain the balance between temporal resolution and realistic estimation of snow cover extent since it uses two thresholds to control the combination processes. Multi-sensor combinations (daily or multi-day), taking advantage of MODIS high spatial resolution and AMSR-E cloud penetration ability, provide cloud-free products but bring larger image underestimation errors as compared with their MODIS counterparts.

AB Crop descriptors, such as leaf area index, crop cover fraction, and leaf chlorophyll content, can be successfully estimated using appropriate spectral indices from the visible and near infrared spectral regions. However, these indices do not provide estimates of dry biomass, an important indicator of crop productivity. For estimating crop aboveground dry biomass and yield, this study developed an approach to integrate crop stressors and crop descriptors derived from optical remote sensing data with the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. Multi-temporal remote sensing data were acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager and the Landsat-5/7 Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) sensors to monitor the growth conditions of corn in the 2001 and 2006 growing seasons. The modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) derived from the remote sensing data was used to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(ApAR)). A canopy structure dynamics model was then used to simulate the seasonal variation of f(APAR). Crop water stress was estimated from the near and shortwave infrared reflectance of the Landsat images for a dry period in the 2001 growing season. By estimating leaf chlorophyll content using the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) in combination with the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), different levels of nitrogen content could be identified. For the two growing seasons, the aboveground dry biomass and yield were linearly related with the cumulative absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using the Monteith radiation use efficiency model. The cumulative APAR accounted for 96% of the corn aboveground dry biomass variability and 72% of the yield variability. Biomass and yield variability were partly explained by the variations in crop water stress intensity, which was dependent on soil texture. The seasonal radiation use efficiency was stable over the 2 years and was about 3.9 g MJ(-1), with a confidence interval of 0.6 g MJ(-1) at the 95% confidence level. The assimilation of remotely sensed data into the radiation use efficiency model performed well for monitoring dry biomass accumulation and estimating corn yields.

AB This work is devoted to a presentation of the ECOCLIMAP-II database for Western Africa, which is an upgrade for this region of the former initiative, ECOCLIMAP-I, implemented at global scale. ECOCLIMAP-II is a dual database at I-km resolution that comprises an ecosystem classification and a coherent set of land surface parameters. This new physiographic information (e.g. leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover, albedo and land cover classification), was especially developed in the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) programme in order to support the modelling of land-atmosphere interactions, which stresses the importance of the present study. Criteria for coherence between prevalent land cover classifications and the analysis of time series of the satellite leaf area index (LAI) between 2000 and 2007 constitute the analysis tools for setting up ECOCLIMAP-II. The LAI and inferred fraction of vegetation cover are spatially distributed per land cover unit. The fraction of vegetation cover is handled to split the land surface albedo into vegetation and bare soil albedo components, as is required for a large number of applications. The new ECOCLIMAP-II land cover product is improved with regard to the spatial coherence compared to former version. The reliability of the physiographic details is also confirmed through verification with land cover products at higher resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) has been identified as one of several key satellite-derived biophysical datasets. With multiple global FAPAR datasets now available and a lack of in-situ measurements and comparison studies in the far north, this study attempts to provide the reader with an indication of the performance of four global FAPAR datasets (MODIS, CYCLOPES, JRC and GLOBCARBON) over Northern Eurasia in the year 2000 via comparison. Within the year 2000 growing season, both the MODIS and CYCLOPES datasets recorded on average similar but substantially higher values than the JRC and GLOBCARBON datasets. Among three of the four datasets, a high level of agreement in deciduous broadleaf forests and croplands was observed. Largest disagreement occurred among needleleaf forests and grassland/shrubland. Potential reasons for discrepancies among the datasets include different retrieval methods, use of LAI and land cover, snow effects and others. Findings from this study and other published results suggest that overall, JRC best captures FAPAR over northern Eurasia in the year 2000. However, when considering individual landcover types, any one or more of the four products may be suitable. There exists a real need for more in-situ measurements in this region the lack of such measurements makes evaluation extremely difficult. It appears that areas north of 60 degrees urgently require further investigadon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past few years, the increased spectral and spatial resolution of remote sensing equipment has promoted the investigation of new techniques for inland and coastal water monitoring. The availability of new high-resolution data has allowed improvements in models based on the radiative transfer theory for assessing optical water quality parameters. In this study, we fine-tuned a physical model for the highly turbid Venice lagoon waters and developed an inversion technique based on a two-step optimization procedure appropriate for hyperspectral data processing to retrieve water constituent concentrations from remote data. In the first step, the solution of a linearized analytical formulation of the radiative transfer equations was found. In the second step, this solution was used to provide the initial values in a non-linear least squares-based method. This effort represents a first step in the construction of a feasible and timely methodology for Venice lagoon water quality monitoring by remote sensing, especially in view of the existing experimental hyperspectral satellite (Hyperion) and the future missions such as PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRI. The optical properties of the water constituents were assessed on the basis of sea/lagoon campaigns and data from the literature. The water light field was shaped by an analytical formulation of radiative transfer equations and the application of numerical simulations (Hydrolight software). Once the optical properties of the Venice lagoon bio-optical model were validated, the inverse procedure was applied to local radiometric spectra to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter and tripton. The inverse procedure was validated by comparing these concentrations with those measured in the laboratory from in situ water samples, then it was applied to airborne (CAST and MMS) and satellite (Hyperion) sensors to derive water constituent concentration maps. The consistent results encourage the use of this procedure using future missions satellite (PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRl). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Whether diversity and composition of avian communities is determined primarily by responses of species to the floristic composition or to the structural characteristics of habitats has been an ongoing debate, at least since the publication of MacArthur and MacArthur (1961). This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p<0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain.

AB This study strives to establish an objective basis for image compositing in satellite oceanography. Image compositing is a powerful technique for cloud filtering that often emphasizes cloud clearing at the expense of obtaining synoptic coverage. Although incomplete cloud removal in image compositing is readily apparent, the loss of synopticity, often, is not. Consequently, the primary goal of image compositing should be to obtain the greatest amount of cloud-free coverage or clarity in a period short enough that synopticity, to a significant degree, is preserved.
   To illustrate the process of image compositing and the problems associated with it, we selected a region off the coast of California and constructed two 16-day image composites, one, during the spring, and the second, during the summer of 2006, using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) InfraRed (IR) satellite imagery. Based on the results of cloud clearing for these two 16-day sequences, rapid cloud clearing occurred up to day 4 or 5, followed by much slower cloud clearing out to day 16, suggesting an explicit basis for the growth in cloud clearing. By day 16, the cloud clearing had, in most cases, exceeded 95%. Based on these results, a shorter compositing period could have been employed without a significant loss in clarity. A method for establishing an objective basis for selecting the period for image compositing is illustrated using observed data. The loss in synopticity, which, in principle, could be estimated from pattern correlations between the images in the composite, was estimated from a separate time series of SST since the loss of synopticity, in our approach, is only a function of time. The autocorrelation function of the detrended residuals provided the decorrelation time scale and the basis for the decay process, which, together, define the loss of synopticity. The results show that (1) the loss of synopticity and the gain in clarity are inversely related, (2) an objective basis for selecting a compositing period corresponds to the day number where the decay and growth curves for synopticity and clarity intersect, and (3), in this case, the point of intersection occurred 3.2 days into the compositing period. By applying simple mathematics it was shown that the intersection time for the loss in synopticity and the growth in clarity is directly proportional to the initial conditions required to specify the clarity at the beginning of the compositing period, and inversely proportional to the sum of the rates of growth for clarity and the loss in synopticity. Finally, we consider these results to be preliminary in nature, and, as a result, hope that future work will bring forth significant improvements in the approach outlined in this study.

AB A computationally efficient reflectance model for row planted canopies is developed in this paper through separating the contributions of incident direct and diffuse radiation scattered by row canopies. The row model allows calculating the reflectance spectrum in any given direction for the optical spectral region. The performance of the model is evaluated through comparisons with field measurements of winter wheat as well as with an established 3D computer simulation model. Especially the systematic comparisons with the computer simulation model demonstrate that the model can adequately simulate the characteristic distribution of directional reflectance factors of row canopies, which is shown in the polar map of reflectance as a high or low value stripe approximately parallel to the row orientation, besides the hotspot effect. Physical mechanisms causing the dynamics were proposed and supported by comparison studies. The features of reflectance distributions of row canopies, which are distinctively different from those of homogeneous canopy, imply that it is problematic to use one-dimensional radiation transfer model to interpret radiation data and estimate the structural or spectral parameters of row canopies from reflectance measurements. Finally, further improvements needed for the current model are briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessing the ecosystem productivity dynamics is a key issue in the context of the carbon cycle at the southern Europe ecosystems. The availability of remote sensing data and products, as FAPAR. strongly motivates its use in ecosystem modeling. This paper presents a comparative analysis between MODIS-FAPAR and MERIS-MGVI datasets, two products carrying similar information, from regional (the Iberian Peninsula) to local (six biomes) scales. Moreover, an assessment of the impacts of its use in terrestrial ecosystem modeling, by using the CASA production efficiency model is presented. The analysis was conducted for both datasets for the year 2003, and was supported by an extensive statistical analysis, including geostatistics, focusing both seasonality and spatial coherence. Main findings refer to (i) a systematically higher MODIS than MERIS data. both at the Iberian Peninsula and at local biomes, (ii) a seasonality of the correlation between the two datasets, and (iii) a spatial homogeneity over larger extensions from MERIS-MGVI data, opposing to a higher spatial variability from MODIS-FAPAR. Although these different data properties, it was found that the two independent datasets produce reasonable NEP estimates, by using CASA model at the site level. These results suggest that the MODIS-FAPAR and MERIS-MGVI differences can be minimized in biophysical modeling through model re-parameterization, although this process does not solve the seasonal dependence pattern found in the original datasets.

AB Surface urban heat island (SUHI) is a phenomenon of both high spatial and temporal variability. In this context, studying and monitoring the SUHIs of urban areas through the satellite remote sensing technology, requires land surface temperature (LST) image data from satellite-borne thermal sensors of high spatial resolution as well as temporal resolution. However, due to technical constrains, satellite-bome thermal sensors yield a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolution; a high spatial resolution is associated with a low temporal resolution and vice versa. To resolve this drawback, we applied in this study four downscaling techniques using different scaling factors to downscale 1-km LST image data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, given that AVHRR can offer the highest temporal resolution currently available. The city of Athens in Greece was used as the application site. Downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs simulated by the downscaling techniques, were then used for SUHI intensity estimation based on LST differences observed between the main urban land covers of Athens and the city's rural background. For the needs of the study, land cover information for Athens was obtained from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2000 database for Greece. Validation of the downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs as well of the retrieved SUHI intensities was performed by comparative analysis with time-coincident observations of 120-m LST and SUM intensities generated from the band 6 of the Thermal Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 platform. The spatial pattern of the downscaled AVHRR LST was found to be visually improved when compared to that of the original AVHRR LST and to resemble more that of TM6 LST. Statistical results indicated that, when compared to 120-m TM6 LST, the root mean square error (RMSE) in 120-m AVHRR LST generated by the downscaling techniques ranged from 4.9 to 5.3 degrees C. However, the accuracy in SUM intensity was found to have significantly improved, with a RMSE value decreasing from 2.4 degrees C when the original AVHRR LST was utilized, down to 0.94 degrees C in case that downscaling was applied.

AB The spatial and temporal patterns of the forest background optical properties are critically important in retrieving the biophysical parameters of the forest canopy (overstory) and in ecosystem modeling. In this paper we carry out background reflectivity mapping over conterminous United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean land mass using Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 1.1 km resolution. The refined methodology uses the nadir and 45 degrees forward directions of the MISR camera images. The background reflectivity is shown to vary between coniferous and deciduous stands, particularly in the near-infrared band. and with the overall amount of overstory vegetation. The largest seasonal differences were observed over a boreal region. The main drawback is a high amount of missing MISR data due to the presence of clouds and other atmospheric effects. The paper also contains a demonstration of the effect on LAI estimates when the dynamic background reflectivity information is inserted into a global LAI algorithm. Multi-angular remote sensing is thus shown to enable us to effectively map yet another forest structure parameter over large areas, which was not possible using mono-angle data.

AB A methodology is proposed to infer the altitude of aerosol plumes over the ocean from reflectance ratio measurements in the O-2 absorption A-band (759 to 770 nm). The reflectance ratio is defined as the ratio of the reflectance in a first spectral band, strongly attenuated by O-2 absorption, and the reflectance in a second spectral band, minimally attenuated. For a given surface reflectance, simple relations are established between the reflectance ratio and the altitude of an aerosol layer, as a function of atmospheric conditions and the geometry of observation. The expected accuracy for various aerosol loadings and models is first quantified using an accurate, high spectral resolution, radiative transfer model that fully accounts for interactions between scattering and absorption. The method is developed for POLDER and MERIS, satellite sensors with adequate spectral characteristics. The simulations show that the method is only accurate over dark surfaces when aerosol optical thickness at 765 nm is relatively large (>0.3). In this case, the expected accuracy is on the order of +/- 0.5 km or +/- 0.2 km for POLDER or MERIS respectively. More accurate estimates are obtained with MERIS, since in this case the spectral reflectance ratio is more sensitive to aerosol altitude. However, a precise spectral calibration is needed for MERIS. The methodology is applied to MERIS and POLDER imagery acquired over marine surfaces. The estimated aerosol altitude is compared with in situ lidar profiles of backscattering coefficient measured during the AOPEX-2004 experiment for MERIS, or obtained with the space-borne lidar CALIOP for POLDER. The retrieved altitudes agree with lidar measurements in a manner consistent with theory. These comparisons demonstrate the potential of the differential absorption methodology for obtaining information on aerosol altitude over dark surfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) quantity, defined as biomass per unit area (t/ha), and the quality, defined as the proportion of standing dead logs to the total CWD quantity, greatly contribute to many ecological processes such as forest nutrient cycling, tree regeneration, wildlife habitat, fire dynamics, and carbon dynamics. However, a cost-effective and time-saving method to determine CWD is not available. Very limited literature could be found that applies remote sensing technique to CWD inventory. In this paper, we fused the wall-to-wall multi-frequency and multi-polarization Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AirSAR) and optical Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to estimate the quantity and quality of CWD in Yellowstone post-fire forest ecosystem, where the severe 1988 fire event resulted in high spatial heterogeneity of dead logs. To relate backscatter values to CWD metrics, we first reduced the terrain effect to remove the interference of topography on AirSAR backscatter. Secondly, we removed the influence of regenerating sapling by quadratic polynomial fitting between AVIRIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and different channels backscatters. The quantity of CWD was derived from P-hh and P-hv, and the quality of CWD was derived from P-hh aided by the ratio of L-hv and P-hh. Two maps of Yellowstone post-fire CWD quantity and quality were produced. The calculated CWD quantity and quality were validated by extensive field surveys. Regarding CWD quantity, the correlation coefficient between measured and predicted CWD is only 0.54 with mean absolute error up to 29.1 t/ha. However, if the CWD quantity was discretely classified into three categories of "<= 60", "60-120", and ">= 120", the overall accuracy is 65.6%; if classified into two categories of "<= 90" and ">= 90", the overall accuracy is 73.1%; if classified into two categories of "<= 60" and ">= 60", the overall accuracy is 84.9%. This indicates our attempt to map CWD quantity spatially and continuously achieved partial success; however, the general and discrete categories are reasonable. Regarding CWD quality, the overall accuracy of 5 types (Type 1-standing CWD ratio >= 40%; Type 2-15% <= standing CWD ratio < 40%; Type 3-7% <= standing CWD ratio<15%; Type 4-3% <= standing CWD ratio <7%; Type 5-standing CWD ratio <3%) is only 40.32%. However, when type 1, 2, 3 are combined into one category and type 4 and 5 are combined into one category, the overall accuracy is 67.74%. This indicates the partial success of our initial results to map CWD quality into detailed categories, but the result is acceptable if solely very coarse CWD quality is considered. Bias can be attributed to the complex influence of many factors, such as field survey error, sapling compensation, terrain effect reduction, surface properties, and backscatter mechanism understanding.

AB Forest structure data derived from lidar is being used in forest science and management for inventory analysis, biomass estimation, and wildlife habitat analysis. Regression analysis dominated previous approaches to the derivation of tree stem and crown parameters from lidar. The regression model for tree parameters is locally applied based on vertical lidar point density the tree species involved, and stand structure in the specific research area. The results of this approach, therefore, are location-specific, limiting its applicability to other areas. For a more widely applicable approach to derive tree parameters, we developed an innovative method called 'wrapped surface reconstruction' that employs radial basis functions and an isosurface. Utilizing computer graphics, we capture the exact shape of an irregular tree crown of various tree species based on the lidar point cloud and visualize their exact crown formation in three-dimensional space. To validate the tree parameters given by our wrapped surface approach, survey-grade equipment (a total station) was used to measure the crown shape. Four vantage points were established for each of 55 trees to capture whole-tree crown profiles georeferenced with post-processed differential GPS points. The observed tree profiles were linearly interpolated to estimate crown volume. These fieldwork-generated profiles were compared with the wrapped surface to assess goodness of fit For coniferous trees, the following tree crown parameters derived by the wrapped surface method were highly correlated (p<0.05) with the total station-derived measurements: tree height (R-2=0.95), crown width (R-2=0.80), live crown base (R-2=0.92), height of the lowest branch (R-2=0.72), and crown volume (R-2=0.84). For deciduous trees, wrapped surface-derived parameters of tree height (R-2=0.96), crown width (R-2=0.75), live crown base (R-2=0.53), height of the lowest branch (R-2=0.51), and crown volume (R-2=0.89) were correlated with the total station-derived measurements. The wrapped surface technique is less susceptible to errors in estimation of tree parameters because of exact interpolation using the radial basis functions. The effect of diminished energy return causes the low correlation for lowest branches in deciduous trees (R-2=0.51), even though leaf-off lidar data was used. The wrapped surface provides fast and automated detection of micro-scale tree parameters for specific applications in areas such as tree physiology, fire modeling, and forest inventory.

AB Rossby waves are difficult to detect with in situ methods. However. as we show in this paper, they can be clearly identified in multi-parameters in multi-mission satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color observations of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), as well as 1/12 degrees global HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulations of SSH, SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Indian Ocean. While the surface structure of Rossby waves can be elucidated from comparisons of the signal in different sea surface parameters, models are needed to gain direct information about how these waves affect the ocean at depth. The first three baroclinic modes of the Rossby waves are inferred from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and two-dimensional Radon Transform (2D RT). At many latitudes the first and second baroclinic mode Rossby wave phase speeds from satellite observations and model parameters are identified. Wavelet transforms of these multi-para meters from satellite observations and model simulations help to discriminate between the annual and semi-annual signal of these Rossby waves. This comprehensive study reveals that the surface signature of Rossby waves in SSS anomalies is likely to be between 0.05 and 0.3 psu in the South Indian Ocean. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Quantifying forest structure is important for sustainable forest management, as it relates to a wide variety of ecosystem processes and services. Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes Such as canopy height. basal area, and LAI. However, the potential of this technology to characterize forest succession remains largely untested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse. mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy>95%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately classifying forest succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests: but further research should be conducted to classify forest successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas. Furthermore, the final classification map represents a significant advancement for forest succession modeling and wildlife habitat assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The radiation budget at the earth surface is an essential climate variable for climate monitoring and analysis as well as for verification of climate model output and reanalysis data. Accurate solar surface irradiance data is a prerequisite for an accurate estimation of the radiation budget and for an efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems.
   This paper describes a new approach for the retrieval of the solar surface irradiance from satellite data. The method is based on radiative transfer modelling and enables the use of extended information about the atmospheric state. Accurate analysis of the interaction between the atmosphere, surface albedo. transmission and the top of atmosphere albedo has been the basis for the new method, characterised by a combination of parameterisations and "eigenvector" look-up tables. The method is characterised by a high computing performance combined with a high accuracy. The performed validation shows that the mean absolute deviation is of the same magnitude as the confidence level of the BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation Measurement) ground based measurements and significant lower as the CM-SAF (Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility) target accuracy of 10W/m(2) The mean absolute difference between monthly means of ground measurements and satellite based solar surface irradiance is 5 W/m(2) with a mean bias deviation of -1 W/m(2) and a RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of 5.4 W/m(2) for the investigated European sites. The results for the investigated African sites obtained by comparing instantaneous values are also encouraging. The mean absolute difference is with 2.8% even lower as for the European sites being 3.9%, but the mean bias deviation is with -1.1 % slightly higher as for the European sites, being 0.8%. Validation results over the ocean in the Mediterranean Sea using shipboard data complete the validation. The mean bias is -3.6 W/m(2) and 2.3% respectively. The slightly higher mean bias deviation over ocean is at least partly resulting from inherent differences due to the movement of the ship (shadowing, allocation of satellite pixel). The validation results demonstrate that the high accuracy of the surface solar irradiance is given in different climate regions. The discussed method has also the potential to improve the treatment of radiation processes in climate and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, because of the high accuracy combined with a high computing speed.

AB Imaging spectrometry has the potential to provide improved discrimination of crop types and better estimates of crop yield. Here we investigate the potential of Hyperion to discriminate three Brazilian soybean varieties and to evaluate the relationship between grain yield and 17 narrow-band vegetation indices. Hyperion analysis focused on two datasets acquired from opposite off-nadir viewing directions but similar solar geometry: one acquired on 08 February 2005 (forward scattering) and the other on 14 January 2006 (back scattering). In 2005, the soybean canopies were observed by Hyperion at later reproductive stages than in 2006. Additional Hyperion datasets were not available due to cloud cover. To further examine the impact of viewing geometry within the same season, Hyperion data were complemented by 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (bands I and 2) acquired in consecutive days (05-06 February 2005) with opposite viewing geometries (-42 degrees and +44 degrees, respectively). MODIS data analysis was used to keep reproductive stage as a constant factor while isolating the impact of viewing geometry. For discrimination purposes, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) was applied over each dataset using surface reflectance values as input variables and a stepwise procedure for band selection. All possible Hyperion band ratios and the 17 narrow-band vegetation indices with soybean grain yield were evaluated across years through Pearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression. MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR) were evaluated within the same growing season. Results showed that: (1) the three soybean varieties were discriminated with highest accuracy in the back scattering direction, as deduced from MDA classification results from Hyperion and MODIS data; (2) the highest correlation between Hyperion vegetation indices and soybean yield was observed for the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (r=+0.74) in the back scattering direction and this result was consistent with band ratio analysis: (3) higher Hyperion correlation results were observed in the back scattering direction when compared to the forward scattering image. For the same reproductive stage, stronger shadowing effects were observed over the MODIS red band in the forward scattering direction producing lower and lesser variable reflectance for the sensor. As a result, the relationship between MODIS-derived NDVI and soybean yield improved from the forward (r of +0.21) to the back scattering view (r of +0.60). The same trend was observed for SIR that increased from +0.22 to +0.58. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Disturbance of forest ecosystems, an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, has become a focus of research over recent years, as global warming is about to increase the frequency and severity of natural disturbance events. Remote sensing offers unique opportunities for detection of forest disturbance at multiple scales: however, spatially and temporally continuous mapping of non-stand replacing disturbance remains challenging. First, most high spatial resolution satellite sensors have relatively broad spectral ranges with bandwidths unsuitable for detection of subtle, stress induced, features in canopy reflectance. Second, directional and background reflectance effects, induced by the interactions between the sun-sensor geometry and the observed canopy surface, make up-scaling of empirically derived relationships between changes in spectral reflectance and vegetation conditions difficult. Using an automated tower based spectroradiometer, we analyse the interactions between canopy level reflectance and different stages of disturbance occurring in a mountain pine beetle infested lodgepole pine stand in northern interior British Columbia, Canada, during the 2007 growing season. Directional reflectance effects were modelled using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) acquired from high frequency multi-angular spectral observations. Key wavebands for observing changes in directionally corrected canopy spectra were identified using discriminant analysis and highly significant correlations between canopy reflectance and field measured disturbance levels were found for several broad and narrow waveband vegetation indices (for instance, r(NDVI)(2)=0-90: r(CHL3)(2)=0.85; p < 0.05). Results indicate that multi-angular observations are useful for extraction of disturbance related changes in canopy reflectance, in particular the temporally and spectrally dense data detected changes in chlorophyll content well. This study will help guide and inform future efforts to map forest health conditions at landscape and over increasingly coarse scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The magnitude M-w=6.3 earthquake in Al Hoceima, Morocco of 24 February, 2004 occurred in the active plate boundary accommodating the oblique convergence between Africa and Eurasia. Three different sets of estimates of its source parameters have already been published. We try to resolve the discrepancies between them by using additional data including two remote sensing satellite systems (ENVISAT and SPOTS). Using a model with a dislocation in an elastic half-space, we constrain the source parameters. The hypothesis of two subevents on distinct faults as inferred from seismological inversions is confirmed here by adopting a cross-fault mechanism. The rupture began on a left-lateral strike-slip fault striking at N10 degrees azimuth with 90 cm of horizontal slip and then transferred to a right-lateral strike-slip fault striking at N312 degrees azimuth with 85 cm of horizontal slip. The first fault is at 500 m depth from the free surface and the second fault is at 3 km depth. This model is consistent with ground-based observations, including GPS, seismology, and mapped surface fissures. The pair of faults activated in 2004 appears to constitute part of a complex seismogenic structure striking NNE-SSW that separates the Rif tectonic blocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to estimate the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR) from point measurements to airborne lidar for hierarchical scaling up and assessment of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) WAR product within a "medium-sized" (7 km x 18 km) watershed. Nine sites across Canada, containing one or more (of 11) distinct species types and age classes at varying stages of regeneration and seasonal phenology were examined using a combination of discrete pulse airborne scanning Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) and coincident analog and digital hemispherical photography (HP). Estimates of WAR were first compared using three methods: PAR radiation sensors, HP, and airborne lidar. HP provided reasonable estimates of WAR when compared with radiation sensors. A simplified fractional canopy cover ratio from lidar based on the number of within canopy returns to the total number of returns was then compared with WAR estimated from HP at 486 geographically registered measurement locations. The return ratio fractional cover method from lidar compared well with HP-derived WAR (coefficient of determination =0.72, RMSE=0.11), despite varying the lidar survey configurations, canopy structural characteristics, seasonal phenologies, and possible slight inaccuracies in location using handheld GPS at some sites. Lidar-derived fractional cover estimates of WAR were similar to 10% larger than those obtained using HP (after removing wood components), indicating that lidar likely provides a more realistic estimate of WAR than HP when compared with radiation sensors. Finally, WAR derived from lidar fractional cover was modelled at 1 m resolution and averaged over 99 1 km areas for comparison with MODIS WAR. The following study is one of the first to scale between plot measurements and MODIS pixels using airborne lidar. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The evaluation of a new global monthly leaf area index (LAI) data set for the period July 1981 to December 2006 derived from AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data is described. The physically based algorithm is detailed in the first of the two part series. Here, the implementation, production and evaluation of the data set are described. The data set is evaluated both by direct comparisons to ground data and indirectly through inter-comparisons with similar data sets. This indirect validation showed satisfactory agreement with existing LAI products, importantly MODIS, at a range of spatial scales, and significant correlations with key climate variables in areas where temperature and precipitation limit plant growth. The data set successfully reproduced well-documented spatio-temporal trends and inter-annual variations in vegetation activity in the northern latitudes and semi-arid tropics. Comparison with plot scale field measurements over homogeneous vegetation patches indicated a 7% underestimation when all major vegetation types are taken into account. The error in mean values obtained from distributions of AVHRR LAI and high-resolution field LAI maps for different biomes is within 0.5 LAI for six out of the ten selected sites. These validation exercises though limited by the amount of field data, and thus less than comprehensive, indicated satisfactory agreement between the LAI product and field measurements. Overall, the inter-comparison with short-term LAI data sets, evaluation of long term trends with known variations in climate variables, and validation with field measurements together build confidence in the utility of this new 26 year LAI record for long term vegetation monitoring and modeling studies.

AB The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was developed as a standard satellite vegetation product for the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS). EVI provides improved sensitivity in high biomass regions while minimizing soil and atmosphere influences, however, is limited to sensor systems designed with a blue band, in addition to the red and near-infrared bands, making it difficult to generate long-term EVI time series as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) counterpart. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a 2-band EVI (EVI2), without a blue band, which has the best similarity with the 3-band EVI, particularly when atmospheric effects are insignificant and data quality is good. A linearity-adjustment factor 13 is proposed and coupled with the soil-adjustment factor L used in the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to develop EVI2. A global land cover dataset of Terra MODIS data extracted over land community validation and FLUXNET test sites is used to develop the optimal parameter (L, beta and G) values in EVI2 equation and achieve the best similarity between EVI and EVI2. The similarity between the two indices is evaluated and demonstrated with temporal profiles of vegetation dynamics at local and global scales. Our results demonstrate that the differences between EVI and EVI2 are insignificant (within +/- 0.02) over a very large sample of snow/ice-free land cover types, phenologies, and scales when atmospheric influences are insignificant, enabling EVI2 as an acceptable and accurate substitute of EVI. EVI2 can be used for sensors without a blue band, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and may reveal different vegetation dynamics in comparison with the current AVHRR NDVI dataset. However, cross-sensor continuity relationships for EVI2 remain to be studied. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB New pan-Arctic (> 60 degrees N) snowmelt onset and end date records (2000-2005) were produced from enhanced resolution (4.45 km) QuikSCAT (QSCAT) Ku-band backscatter measurements. A modified threshold method was used to detect multiple melt events and the main melt event was identified by the longest melt duration or the largest melt intensity. Algorithm validation was performed with a Circum-Arctic network of station measurements extracted from the Global Surface Summary of Day product maintained by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Estimates of melt onset date corresponded to a clear shift in the statistical distribution of mean daily air temperatures from largely below freezing to above freezing. Melt was not detected in 7% of the cases mainly over dense boreal forest cover, or very shallow tundra snow cover. QSCAT-derived melt end dates were significantly correlated with station-derived snow-off estimates (r(2)= 0.79: RMSE = 11.6 days). The difference between the two estimates was within one week for 70% of the cases so there is good potential to use QSCAT-derived melt end dates to approximate snow-off dates across the pan-Arctic region. There was a tendency for QSCAT-derived snow-off dates to be biased early over dense forest regions due to a diminished backscatter melt signature. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Urbanization related alterations to the surface energy balance impact urban warming ('heat islands'), the growth of the boundary layer, and many other biophysical processes. Traditionally, in situ heat flux measures have been used to quantify Such processes, but these typically represent only a small local-scale area within the heterogeneous urban environment. For this reason, remote sensing approaches are very attractive for elucidating more spatially representative information. Here we use hyperspectral imagery from a new airborne sensor, the Operative Modular Imaging Spectrometer (OMIS), along with a survey map and meteorological data, to derive the land cover information and surface parameters required to map spatial variations in turbulent sensible heat flux (Q(H)). The results from two spatially-explicit flux retrieval methods which use contrasting approaches and, to a large degree, different input data are compared for a central urban area of Shanghai, China: (1) the Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) and (2) an Aerodynamic Resistance Method (ARM). Sensible heat fluxes are determined at the full 6 m spatial resolution of the OMIS sensor, and at lower resolutions via pixel exceeds that of roads, water and vegetated areas, with values peaking at similar to 350 W m(-2), whilst the storage heat flux is greatest for road dominated pixels (peaking at around 420 W m(-2)). We investigate the use of both OMIS-derived land surface temperatures made using a Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) approach, and land surface temperatures estimated from air temperature measures. Sensible heat flux differences from the two approaches over the entire 2 x 2 km study area are less than 30 W m(-2), suggesting that methods employing either strategy maybe practical when operate using low spatial resolution (e.g. 1 km) data. Due to the differing methodologies, direct comparisons between results obtained with the LUMPS and ARM methods are most sensibly made at reduced spatial scales. At 30 m spatial resolution, both approaches produce similar results, with the smallest difference being less than 15 W m(-2) in mean Q(H) averaged over the entire study area. This is encouraging given the differing architecture and data requirements of the LUMPS and ARM methods. Furthermore, in terms of mean study Q(H,) the results obtained by averaging the original 6 m spatial resolution LUMPS-derived Q(H) values to 30 and 90 m spatial resolution are within similar to 5 W m(-2) of those derived from averaging the original surface parameter maps prior to input into LUMPS, suggesting that that use of much lower spatial resolution spaceborne imagery data, for example fro Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is likely to be a practical solution for heat flux determination in urban areas.

AB A satellite retrieval of surface solar irradiance based on METEOSAT SEVIRI-derived cloud properties is presented and validated for the Netherlands with one year of pyranometer measurements from 35 stations. The approach requires two independent steps: 1. Cloud properties are determined from narrow-band satellite radiances. 2. These cloud properties are used together with data on water vapor column and surface albedo to calculate the atmospheric flux transmittance. The retrieved irradiance is biased low by about 3-4 W/m(2) throughout the year, corresponding to an underestimate in atmospheric flux transmittance of about 0.015 in summer and 0.04 in winter. From a least-squares linear regression, residual standard deviations of 56 W/m(2) (0.072,17.0%), 11 W/m(2) (0.052,10.8%), and 4 W/m(2) (0.021, 4.2%) are found for hourly, daily and monthly mean irradiance (transmittance, relative error), respectively. These findings indicate that the accuracy of the retrieval is comparable to first-class pyranometers in the summer half year (5% of daily-mean values), but significantly lower in winter. Two aspects requiring further investigation have been identified: 1. For thin clouds, the atmospheric flux transmittance is strongly underestimated. 2. The retrieval accuracy is reduced for snow-covered surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The PROSPECT leaf optical model has, to date, combined the effects of photosynthetic pigments, but a finer discrimination among the key pigments is important for physiological and ecological applications of remote sensing. Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional-hemi spherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE=9 mu g/cm(2)) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE=3 mu g/cm(2)). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400-2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An algorithm for the derivation of atmospheric parameters and surface reflectance data from MEdium Resolution Imaging Specrometer Instrument (MERIS) on board ENVIronmental SATellite (ENVISAT) images has been developed. Geo-rectified aerosol optical thickness (AOT), columnar water vapor (CWV) and spectral surface reflectance maps are generated from MERIS Level-1b data over land. The algorithm has been implemented so that AOT, CWV and reflectance products are provided on an operational manner, making no use of ancillary parameters apart from those attached to MERIS products. For this reason, it has been named Self-Contained Atmospheric Parameters Estimation from MERIS data (SCAPE-M). The fundamental basis of the algorithm and applicable error figures are presented in the first part of this paper. In particular, errors of +/- 0.03, +/- 4% and +/- 8% have been estimated for AOT, CWV and surface reflectance retrievals, respectively, by means of a sensitivity analysis based on a synthetic data set simulated under a usual MERIS scene configuration over land targets. The assumption of a fixed aerosol model, the coarse spatial resolution of the AOT product and the neglection of surface reflectance directional effects were also identified as limitations of SCAPE-M. Validation results are detailed in the second part of the paper. Comparison of SCAPE-M AOT retrievals with data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations showed an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05, and an average correlation coefficient R-2 of about 0.7-0.8. R-2 values grew up to more than 0.9 in the case of CWV after comparison with the same stations. A good correlation is also found with the MERIS Level-2 ESA CWV product. Retrieved surface reflectance maps have been successfully compared with reflectance data derived from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) on board the PRoject for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA) in the first place. Reflectance retrievals have also been compared with reflectance data derived from MERIS images by the Bremen AErosol Retrieval (BAER) method. A good correlation in the red and near-infrared bands was found, although a considerably higher proportion of pixels was successfully processed by SCAPE-M. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mountain pine beetle red attack damage has been successfully detected and mapped using single-date high spatial resolution (< 4 in) satellite multi-spectral data. Forest managers; however, need to monitor locations for changes in beetle populations over time. Specifically, counts of individual trees attacked in successive years provide an indication of beetle population growth and dynamics. Surveys are typically used to estimate the ratio of green (current) attack trees to red (previous) attack trees or G:R In this study, we estimate average stand-level G:R using a time-series of QuickBird multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite data, combined with field data for three forested stands near Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Using a ratio of QuickBird red to green wavelengths (Red-Green Index or RGI), the change in RGI (Delta RGT) in successive image pairs is used to estimate red attack damage in 2004, 2005, and 2006, with true positive accuracies ranging from 89 to 93%. To overcome issues associated with differing viewing geometry and illumination angles that impair tracking of individual trees through time, segments are generated from the QuickBird multi-spectral data to identify small groups of trees. These segments then serve as the vehicle for monitoring changes in red attack damage over time. A local maxima filter is applied to the panchromatic data to estimate stem counts, thereby allowing an indication of the total stand population at fisk of attack. By combining the red attack damage estimates with the local maxima stem counts, predictions are made of the number of attacked trees in a given year. Backcasting the current year's red attack damaged trees as the previous year's green attack facilitates the estimation of an average stand G:R. In this study area, these retrospective G:R values closely match those generated from field surveys. The results of this study indicate that a monitoring program using a time series of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data (multi-spectral and panchromatic) over select sample locations, could be used to estimate G:R over large areas, facilitating landscape level management strategies and/or providing a mechanism for assessing the efficacy of previously implemented strategies.

AB Accurate land cover change estimates are among the headline indicators set by the Convention on Biological Diversity to evaluate the progress toward its 20 10 target concerning habitat conservation. Tropical deforestation is of prime interest since it threatens the terrestrial biomes hosting the highest levels of biodiversity. Local forest change dynamics, detected over very large extents, are necessary to derive regional and national figures for multilateral environmental agreements and sustainable forest management. Current deforestation estimates in Central Africa are derived either from coarse to medium resolution imagery or from wall-to-wall coverage of limited areas. Whereas the first approach cannot detect small forest changes widely spread across a landscape, operational costs limit the mapping extent in the second approach. This research developed and implemented a new cost-effective approach to derive area estimates of land cover change by combining a systematic regional sampling scheme based on high spatial resolution imagery with object-based unsupervised classification techniques. A multi-date segmentation is obtained by grouping pixels with similar land cover change trajectories which are then classified by unsupervised procedures. The interactive part of the processing chain is therefore limited to land cover class labelling of object clusters. The combination of automated image processing and interactive labelling renders this method cost-efficient. The approach was operationally applied to the entire Congo River basin to accurately estimate deforestation at regional, national and landscape levels. The survey was composed of 10 x 10 km sampling sites systematically-distributed every 0.5 degrees over the whole forest domain of Central Africa, corresponding to a sampling rate of 3.3%. For each of the 571 sites, subsets were extracted from both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery acquired in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Approximately 60% of the 390 cloud-free samples do not show any forest cover change. For the other 165 sites, the results are depicted by a change matrix for every sample site describing four land cover change processes: deforestation, reforestation, forest degradation and forest recovery. This unique exercise estimates the deforestation rate at 0.21% per year, while the forest degradation rate is close to 0.15% per year. However, these figures are less reliable for the coastal region where there is a lack of cloud-free imagery. The results also show that the Landscapes designated after 2000 as high priority conservation zones by the Congo Basin Forest Partnership had undergone significantly less deforestation and forest degradation between 1990 and 2000 than the rest of the Central African forest.

AB Two types of Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) modeling approaches can be applied to monitor root-zone soil moisture in agricultural landscapes. Water and Energy Balance (WEB) SVAT modeling is based on forcing a prognostic root-zone water balance model with observed rainfall and predicted evapotranspiration. In contrast, thermal Remote Sensing (RS) observations of surface radiometric temperature (T-R) are integrated into purely diagnostic RS-SVAT models to predict the onset of vegetation water stress. While RS-SVAT models do not explicitly monitor soil moisture, they can be used in the calculation of thermal-based proxy variables for the availability of soil water in the root zone. Using four growing seasons (2001 to 2004) of profile soil moisture, micro-meteorology, and surface radiometric temperature measurements at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancements (OPE3) study site in Beltsville, MD, prospects for improving WEB-SVAT root-zone soil water predictions via the assimilation of diagnostic RS-SVAT soil moisture proxy information are examined. Results illustrate the potential advantages of such an assimilation approach relative to the competing approach of directly assimilating T-R measurements. Since T-R measurements used in the analysis are tower-based (and not obtained from a remote platform), a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of remote sensing limitations on the value of the RS-SVAT proxy. Overall, results support a potential role for RS-SVAT modeling strategies in improving WEB-SVAT model characterization of root-zone soil moisture. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Assuming that the intensity level can be described by a transport-diffusion equation, the proposed approach is based on variational assimilation of image observations within a simple transport-diffusion model. This approach permits to retrieve the current velocity field from a sequence of satellite images.

AB The green vegetation fraction (Fg) is an important climate and hydrologic model parameter. A common method to calculate Fg is to create a simple linear mixing model between two NDVI endmembers: bare soil NDVI (NDVIo) and full vegetation NDVI (NDVI infinity). Usually it is assumed that NDVI, is close to zero (NDVIo similar to 0.05) and is generally chosen from the lowest observed NDVI values. However, the mean soil NDVI computed from 2906 samples is much larger (NDVI=0.2) and is highly variable (standard deviation = 0.1). We show that the underestimation of NDVI,, yields overestimations of Fg. The largest errors occur in grassland and shrubland areas. Using parameters for NDVI, and NDVI infinity derived from global scenes yields overestimations of Fg that are larger than 0.2 for the majority of U.S. land cover types when pixel NDVI values are 0.2 < NDVIpixel < 0.4. When using contenninous U.S. scenes to derive NDVIo and NDVI infinity, the overestimation is less (0.10-0.17 for 0.2 < NDVIpixel < 0.4). As a result, parts of the contenninous U. S. are affected at different times of the year depending on the local seasonal NDVI cycle. We propose using global databases of NDVI along with information on historical NDVIpixel values to compute a statistically most-likely estimate of Fg. Using in situ measurements made at the Sevilleta LTER, we show that this approach yields better estimates of Fg than using global invariant NDVIo values estimated from whole scenes. At the two studied sites, the Fg estimate was adjusted by 52% at the grassland and 86% at the shrubland. More significant advances will require information on spatial distribution of soil reflectance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since 2000, the southwestern Brazilian Amazon has undergone a rapid transformation from natural vegetation and pastures to row-crop agricultural with the potential to affect regional biogeochemistry. The goals of this research are to assess wavelet algorithms applied to MODIS time series to determine expansion of row-crops and intensification of the number of crops grown. MODIS provides data from February 2000 to present, a period of agricultural expansion and intensification in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We have selected a study area near Comodoro, Mato Grosso because of the rapid growth of row-crop agriculture and availability of ground truth data of agricultural land-use history. We used a 90% power wavelet transform to create a wavelet-smoothed time series for five years of MODIS EVI data. From this wavelet-smoothed time series we determine characteristic phenology of single and double crops. We estimate that over 3200 km(2) were converted from native vegetation and pasture to row-crop agriculture from 2000 to 2005 in our study area encompassing 40,000 km(2). We observe an increase of 2000 km(2) of agricultural intensification, where areas of single crops were converted to double crops during the study period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global NDVI data are routinely derived from the AVHRR, SPOT-VGT, and MODIS/Terra earth observation records for a range of applications from terrestrial vegetation monitoring to climate change modeling. This has led to a substantial interest in the harmonization of multisensor records. Most evaluations of the internal consistency and continuity of global multisensor NDVI products have focused on time-series harmonization in the spectral domain, often neglecting the spatial domain. We fill this void by applying variogram modeling (a) to evaluate the differences in spatial variability between 8-km AVHRR, 1-km SPOT-VGT, and 1-km, 500-m, and 250-m MODIS NDVI products over eight EOS (Earth Observing System) validation sites, and (b) to characterize the decay of spatial variability as a function of pixel size (i.e. data regularization) for spatially aggregated Landsat ETM+ NDVI products and a real multisensor dataset. First, we demonstrate that the conjunctive analysis of two variogram properties - the sill and the mean length scale metric - provides a robust assessment of the differences in spatial variability between multiscale NDVI products that are due to spatial (nominal pixel size, point spread function, and view angle) and non-spatial (sensor calibration, cloud clearing, atmospheric corrections, and length of multi-day compositing period) factors. Next, we show that as the nominal pixel size increases, the decay of spatial information content follows a logarithmic relationship with stronger fit value for the spatially aggregated NDVI products (R-2 = 0.9321) than for the native resolution AVHRR, SPOT-VGT, and MODIS NDVI products (R-2 = 0.5064). This relationship serves as a reference for evaluation of the differences in spatial variability and length scales in multiscale datasets at native or aggregated spatial resolutions. The outcomes of this study suggest that multisensor NDVI records cannot be integrated into a long-term data record without proper consideration of all factors affecting their spatial consistency. Hence, we propose an approach for selecting the spatial resolution, at which differences in spatial variability between NDVI products from multiple sensors are minimized. This approach provides practical guidance for the harmonization of long-term multisensor datasets. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Mega capture of the Rio Negro and formation of the Anavilhanas
   Archipelago, Central Amazonia, Brazil: evidences in an SRTM digital
   elevation model
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Central Amazonia (Brazil), the Solimoes River and the Negro River ("Rio Negro") merge to form the Amazonas, the largest river in the world. Analysis of a digital elevation model produced by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) in that region reveals the relicts of a large ancient drainage system hidden by the tropical rain forest. Interpretation of this unreported terrain feature in the context of the regional geological framework indicates that the present lower course of the Rio Negro results from a mega fluvial capture driven by an active tectonic regime prevailing in the Amazonian basin. The diversion of the Rio Negro was controlled by pre-existing NW-SE structural features, in which the arrangement of fault blocks compelled the river to funnel down into a strait. Partially blocked by this natural barrier, the Rio Negro widens upstream, assuming a lake-like appearance (up to 20 km-wide). Free space availability and low energy favored the deposition of sediments to form the Anavilhanas Archipelago, the largest group of freshwater islands on the world, refuge of a diversified fauna and flora.

AB This study investigated the potential value of integrating hyperspectral visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared imagery with multispectral thermal data for geological mapping. Two coregistered aerial data sets of Cuprite, Nevada were used: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data, and MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) multispectral thermal data. Four classification methods were each applied to AVIRIS, MASTER, and a combined set. Confusion matrices were used to assess the classification accuracy. The assessment showed, in terms of kappa coefficient, that most classification methods applied to the combined data achieved a marked improvement compared to the results using either AVIRIS or MASTER thermal infrared (TIR) data alone. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) showed the best overall classification performance. Minimum distance classification had the second best accuracy, followed by spectral feature fitting (SFF) and maximum likelihood classification. The results of the study showed that SFF applied to the combination of AVIRIS with MASTER TIR data are especially valuable for identification of silicified alteration and quartzite, both of which exhibit distinctive features in the TIR region. SAM showed some advantages over SFF in dealing with multispectral TIR data, obtaining higher accuracy in discriminating low albedo volcanic rocks and limestone which do not have unique, distinguishing features in the TIR region.

AB The photon recollision probability in vegetation canopies, defined as the probability that a photon, after having interacted with a canopy element, will interact again, is a useful tool in remote sensing and ecological applications, enabling to link canopy optical properties at different wavelength and to estimate radiation absorption. In this work, a method is presented to estimate the photon recollision probability for horizontally homogeneous leaf canopies with arbitrary leaf angle distribution as well as for discrete crown canopies. The estimation is based on analytical approximation of the first-order recollision probability. Using the analytical solution of the two-stream equations of radiative transfer and Monte Carlo modeling, the first-order photon recollision probability is shown to slightly underestimate the mean recollision probability. Also, an approximation formula for the mean recollision probability in a horizontally homogeneous canopy is presented as a function of leaf area index. The method to calculate photon recollision probability in discrete crown canopies requires only the knowledge of total and between-crown canopy transmittance and is thus independent of the geometric-optical model used.

AB Spectral similarity metrics have previously been used to select representative spectra from a class for use in spectral mixture modeling. Since the tasks of spectral selection for spectral mixture modeling and spectral selection for temporal compositing are similar, these metrics may have utility for temporal compositing. This paper explores the use of two spectral similarity metrics, endmember average root mean square error (EAR) and minimum average spectral angle (MASA), for constructing temporal composites. EAR and MASA compositing algorithms were compared against four previously used algorithms, including maximum NDVI, minimum view zenith angle, minimum blue, and median red. A total of 10 different algorithms were used to create 16-day composites of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data over a 6-year period. Algorithm performance was assessed based on short-term temporal variability in spectral reflectance and in a selection of indices, both within a southwestern California study area and within five land-cover class subsets. EAR compositing produced the lowest variability for 4 out of 7 MODIS bands, as measured by the root mean square of time series residuals. MASA or EAR compositing produced the lowest root mean square residual values for all of the tested indices. To assess how compositing algorithms might affect remote sensing correlations with biophysical variables, correlations between indices calculated from different composites and live fuel moisture were compared. Correlations between indices and live fuel moisture were higher for shape-based composites compared with the standard composites. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Phenological records constructed from global mapping satellite platforms (e.g. AVHRR and MODIS) hold the potential to be valuable tools for monitoring vegetation response to global climate change. However, most satellite phenology products are not validated, and field checking coarse scale (>= 500 m) data with confidence is a difficult endeavor. In this research, we compare phenology from Landsat (field scale, 30 m) to MODIS (500 m), and compare datasets derived from each instrument. Landsat and MODIS yield similar estimates of the start of greenness (r(2) =0.60), although we find that a high degree of spatial phenological variability within coarser-scale MODIS pixels may be the cause of the remaining uncertainty. In addition, spatial variability is smoothed in MODIS, a potential source of error when comparing in situ or climate data to satellite phenology. We show that our method for deriving phenology from satellite data generates spatially coherent interannual phenology departures in MODIS data. We test these estimates from 2000 to 2005 against long-term records from Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) and Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Forests. MODIS successfully predicts 86% of the variance at Harvard forest and 70% of the variance at Hubbard Brook; the more extreme topography of the later is inferred to be a significant source of error. In both analyses, the satellite estimate is significantly dampened from the ground-based observations, suggesting systematic error (slopes of 0.56 and 0.63, respectively). The satellite data effectively estimates interannual phenology at two relatively simple deciduous forest sites and is internally consistent, even with changing spatial scale. We propose that continued analyses of interannual phenology will be an effective tool for monitoring native forest responses to global-scale climate variability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB In Antarctica, radar altimeter measurements are sensitive to dielectric and penetration properties of the sensed medium (snow) such that the spacecraft's altitude can be biased. Since 2002, relatively low frequency radar measurements over the Amery Ice Shelf, east Antarctica, have been acquired using the Envisat dual frequency altimeter at S (3.2 GHz) and Ku (13.6 GHz) bands, which penetrate a few meters into the fim.
   The altimeter signal is however modified in summer by the presence of snowfilled crevasses. Indeed, the specularity of the snow surfaces in summer makes the altimetric signal sensitive mostly to nadir echoes, that increases the ratio between the crevasse signal and the surrounding ice-shelf signal at nadir. Crevasses are distinguished by differences in backscattering behavior compared with the surrounding ice-shelf signal. Crevasses are characterized by a strong backscatter coefficient at Ku band and anomalies in the S band altitude estimation. These two characteristics make snowfilled crevasses detectable by the dual frequency altimeter of Envisat.
   We first retrieve the geometric properties of the crevasses using a hyperbolic shape function, created by strong crevasse backscatter in the Ku waveform measurements. From this retrieved crevasse signal and further waveform analysis, we assess the properties of the snow surface and its sub-surface. The crevasse, due to its small size compared to the altimeter footprint, is found to be an excellent target to study snow properties of the ice-shelf.
   The anomalies in the S band altitude measurements over crevasses can then be explained by the presence of a double echo in the S band waveforms. This echo is attributed to a reflection at the base of the snowbridge, where we see evidence of sub-surface echos in the individual altimeter waveforms. Based on this observation, a methodology is developed to estimate the thickness of the snowbridge. We calculate the penetration depths in the summer snow surface of the Amery at Ku band, that is found to be around 6 in. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing has the potential of improving our ability to map and monitor pasture degradation. Pasture degradation is one of the most important problems in the Amazon, yet the manner in which grazing intensity, edaphic conditions and land-use age impact pasture biophysical properties, and our ability to monitor them using remote sensing is poorly known. We evaluate the connection between field grass biophysical measures and remote sensing, and investigate the impact of grazing intensity on pasture biophysical measures in Rondonia, in the Brazilian Amazon. Above ground biomass, canopy water content and height were measured in different pasture sites during the dry season. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, four spectral vegetation indices and fractions derived from spectral mixture analysis, i.e., Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV), Green Vegetation (GV), Soil, Shade, and NPV+Soil, were calculated and compared to field grass measures. For grazed pastures under dry conditions, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (ND115 and ND117), had higher correlations with the biophysical measures than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). NPV had the highest correlations with all field measures, suggesting this fraction is a good indicator of pasture characteristics in Rondonia. Pasture height was correlated to the Shade fraction. A conceptual model was built for pasture biophysical change using three fractions, i.e., NPV, Shade and GV to characterize possible pasture degradation processes in Rondonia. Based upon field measures, grazing intensity had the most significant impact on pasture biophysical properties compared to soil order and land-use age. The impact of grazing on pastures in the dry season could be potentially measured by using remotely sensed measures such as NPV. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We developed an approach to map turbidity in estuaries using a time series (May 2003 to April 2006) of 250-m resolution images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite, using Tampa Bay as a case study. Cross-calibration of the MODIS 250-m data (originally designed for land use) with the well-calibrated MODIS 1-km ocean data showed that the pre-launch radiometric calibration of the 250-m bands was adequate. A simple single scattering atmospheric correction provided reliable retrievals of remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm (0.002<R-rs(645)<0.015 sr(-1), median bias=-7%, slope=0.95, intercept=0.00, r(2)=0.97, n=15). A more rigorous approach, using a multiple scattering atmospheric correction of the cross-calibrated at-sensor radiances, retrieved similar R-rs(645). R-rs(645) 087 estimates, after stringent data quality control, showed a close correlation with in situ turbidity (turbidity= 1203.9 xR(rs)(645)(1.087) 0.9 <turbidity< 8.0 NTU, r(2) =0.73, n=43). MODIS turbidity imagery derived using the developed approach showed that turbidity in Hillsborough Bay (HB) was consistently higher than that in other sub-regions except in August and September, when higher concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter seem to have caused underestimates of turbidity. In comparison, turbidity in Middle Tampa Bay (MTB) was generally lowest among the Bay throughout the year. Both Old Tampa Bay (OTB) and Low Tampa Bay (LTB) showed marked seasonal variations with higher turbidity in LTB during the dry season and in OTB during the wet season, respectively. This seasonality is linked to wind-driven bottom resuspension events in lower portion of the Bay and river inputs of sediments in the upper portion of the Bay. The Bay also experiences significant interannual variation in turbidity, which was attributed primarily to changes in wind forcing. Compared with the once-per-month, nonsynoptic in situ surveys, synoptic and frequent sampling facilitated by satellite remote sensing provides improved assessments of turbidity patterns and thus a valuable tool for operational monitoring of water quality of estuarine and coastal waters such as in Tarnpa Bay.

Remote monitoring of spatial and temporal surface soil moisture in fire disturbed boreal forest ecosystems with ERS SAR imagery. Int. J. Rem. Sens.] demonstrated that ERS SAR imagery can be used to estimate surface soil moisture in recently burned black spruce forests in interior Alaska. We used this relationship to analyze the intra- and inter-annual variations surface soil moisture in two burned black spruce forests in Alaska. The results of this study showed distinct seasonal and longer-term trends in soil moisture in the two sites, with the site that burned in 1994 having higher soil moisture than the site that burned in 1999. The differences in soil moisture between the sites were related to landscape-scale variations in soil drainage and seasonal permafrost thawing. Finally, we found that the 1999 site had dramatically lower levels of tree recruitment (both aspen and black spruce) than the 1994 site as a result of the lower soil moisture levels. These results show that the ERS SAR and similar systems can be used to monitor a site characteristic that is important to understanding changes in the ecosystem community structure that result from variations in climate and the fire regime in the boreal region.

AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the term palustrine wetland to describe vegetated wetlands traditionally identified as marsh, bog, fen, swamp, or wet meadow. Landsat TM imagery was combined with image texture and ancillary environmental data to model probabilities of palustrine wetland occurrence in Yellowstone National Park using classification trees. Model training and test locations were identified from National Wetlands inventory maps, and classification trees were built for seven years spanning a range of annual precipitation. At a coarse level, palustrine wetland was separated from upland. At a finer level, five palustrine wetland types were discriminated: aquatic bed (PAB), emergent (PEM), forested (PFO), scrub-shrub (PSS), and unconsolidated shore (PUS). TM-derived variables alone were relatively accurate at separating wetland from upland, but model error rates dropped incrementally as image texture, DEM-derived terrain variables, and other ancillary GIS layers were added. For classification trees making use of all available predictors, average overall test error rates were 7.8% for palustrine wetland/upland models and 17.0% for palustrine wetland type models, with consistent accuracies across years. However, models were prone to wetland over-prediction. While the predominant PEM class was classified with omission and commission error rates less than 14%, we had difficulty identifying the PAB and PSS classes. Ancillary vegetation information greatly improved PSS classification and moderately improved PFO discrimination. Association with geothermal areas distinguished PUS wetlands. Wetland over-prediction was exacerbated by class imbalance in likely combination with spatial and spectral limitations of the TM sensor. Wetland probability surfaces may be more informative than hard classification, and appear to respond to climate-driven wetland variability. The developed method is portable, relatively easy to implement, and should be applicable in other settings and over larger extents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of fractional mapping is to obtain land cover fraction estimates within each pixel over a region. Using field, Ikonos and Landsat data at three sites in northern Canada, we evaluate a physical unmixing method against two modeling approaches to map five land cover fractions that include bare, grass, deciduous shrub, conifer, and water along an 1100 km north-south transect crossing the tree-line of northern Canada. Error analyses are presented to assess factors that affect fractional mapping results, including modeling method (linear least squares inversion (LLSI) vs. linear regression vs. regression trees), number of Landsat spectral bands (3 vs. 5), local and distant fraction estimation using locally and globally calibrated models, and spatial resolution (30 m vs. 90 m). The ultimate purpose of this study is to determine if reliable land cover fractions can be obtained for biophysical modeling over northern Canada from a three band, resampled 90 m Landsat ETM+ mosaic north of the tree-line. Of the three modeling methods tested, linear regression and regression trees with five spectral bands produced the best local fraction estimates, while LLSI produced comparable results when unmixing was sufficiently determined. However, distant fraction estimation using both locally and globally calibrated models was most accurate using the three spectral bands available in the Landsat mosaic of northern Canada at 30 m resolution, and only slightly worse at 90 m resolution. While local calibrations produced more accurate fractions than global calibrations, application of local calibration models requires stratification of areas where local endmembers and models are representative. In the absence of such information, globally calibrated linear regression and regression trees to estimate separate fractions is an acceptable alternative, producing similar root mean square error, and an average absolute bias of less than 2%.

AB Many theoretical and applied studies have demonstrated that the anisotropic reflectance of the land surface is determined by the structural and optical properties of the land surface. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) measures the anisotropic reflectance of the land surface thus has the potential to improve the operational mapping of canopy attributes in Queensland, one of the largest states in Australia. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between foliage projective cover (FPC) and the shape of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for a mixed grassland/woodland ecosystem, the Southern Brigalow Belt Biogeographic Region. A practical approach for deriving the surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) from MISR "Local" mode data using existing MISR products is presented. The BRDF typology of the land surface was determined using shape parameters derived from inversion of the linear Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Reciprocal and the non-linear Rahman-Pinty-Verstracte (RPV) models against a time series of MISR "Local" mode surface BRF data. Following an evaluation of the models inversion error, the RPV model was examined for correlation with FPC, a canopy attribute routinely derived from Landsat data in Queensland. Our empirical analyses showed the MISR derived RPV model parameters were qualitatively related to spatial and temporal variations in vegetation structure in Queensland and the k parameter contained information independent of FPC. These results are consistent with published findings from other regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two sites on a playa (claypan) in south western Queensland, Australia were chosen to represent the variability in soil surface conditions known to control wind erosion and dust production in the region. The material was very fine and comprised of large amounts and different types of salts, high electrical conductivity, a propensity for slaking and the presence of cyanobacteria. The surfaces of 4 plots at each site were modified using in situ rainfall simulation and wind tunnel abrasion. The changes in the surface conditions were recorded using digital images and multi-angular spectral measurements of reflectance and inverted against a soil bi-directional spectral reflectance model. Optimised values of the model parameters produced the single scattering albedo (SSA) and a description of the scattering behaviour of the soil surfaces that included an estimate of microscopic roughness. The model parameters removed the effect of the measurement conditions (illumination and viewing geometry) on the spectral reflectance.
   Abrasion of the untreated surfaces demonstrated that the variability in the antecedent surface conditions played an important role in their response. Rainfall, drying and subsequent abrasion appeared to reset the soil surface conditions and controlled the spatial and temporal variation in the soil surface conditions. Redundancy analyses, conducted separately for SSA of selected wavebands, model parameter values and treatments elucidated the subtle and interactive effects of the treatments and surface responses. The results showed that high intensity rainfall and abrasion was associated with wavebands in the visible region and reduced roughness. Low intensity rainfall was associated with wavebands in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions and increased roughness. The analysis was interpreted as the result of eluviation due to rainsplash impact which caused size segregation and the preferential translocation of iron oxides to the surface and the creation of a thick surface seal and caused a thin crust which enabled the movement of salts and/or mineral clays to the surface because of the strong evaporation gradient. A poor relationship between aerodynamic resistance and microscopic roughness suggested that features of soil surface erodibility created by natural environmental processes such as rainsplash and wind erosion required a correction for macroscopic roughness. The values of the model parameters appeared to be insensitive to the directional nature of the abrasion process. The findings are significant for the development of this work towards an airborne or satellite-based assessment of soil surface erodibility and erosion. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new multitemporal technique is presented that allows monitoring of vegetation dynamics in coarse multispectral remote sensing data. This technique, relative spectral mixture analysis (RSMA), provides information about the amount of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) plus litter, and snow relative to a reference time. The RSMA indices of specific ground components are defined so that they are positive when the fractional cover of a ground component is greater than that at the reference time and negative when the fractional cover is less than that at the reference time. The rationale for the new technique and its mathematical underpinnings are discussed. Example RSMA timeseries from the southern-central United States are presented based on four years of MODIS MOD43 nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data. This timeseries shows that the RSMA GV index, X-GV, is robust in the presence of snow. Spectral simulations show that X-GV is also robust with different soil backgrounds. The RSMA index of NPV/Iitter cover, X-NPV/(litter), provides information about the dynamics of the nonphotosynthetic portion of organic matter at or above the surface. The RSMA index of total vegetation plus litter, X-TV, provides information about the dynamics of the non-soil/non-snow portion of ground cover. Because it Mirrors the bare ground cover, X-TV may be particularly useful in remote sensing applications aimed at the study of soil erosion. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Longwave radiation flux, an important part of the surface heat budget, is generally represented by epsilon sigma T-r(4), where epsilon is the surface emissivity, sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T-r is the measured radiometric temperature. epsilon sigma T-r(4) differs from hemispheric emission because the measured radiometric temperature is anisotropic for an uneven surface. This paper analyzes the anisotropy-related error in measurements of longwave radiation flux from a building canopy. The flux difference between epsilon sigma T-r(4) and directly measured flux was up to 8% of the directly measured flux, which could be greater than the typical error in measurement of turbulent heat flux over a building canopy. The flux difference increased as the temperature variation within the urban street canyon increased, and also with increasing difference between the incident solar radiation of the building walls and street canyon floors (pavement, roads, ground surface). Theoretical calculations indicate that the flux difference is due to the structure of the building canopy and the temperature difference between the walls and canopy floors. A numerical model of a building canopy heat budget shows that the flux difference increases as the street canyon aspect ratio increases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface emissivity retrieval over agricultural regions is important for energy balance estimations, land cover assessment and other related environmental studies. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) produces images of sufficient spatial resolution (from 15 m to 90 m) to be of use in agricultural studies, in which fields of crops are too small to be well-resolved by low resolution sensors. The ASTER project generates land surface emissivity images as a Standard Product (AST05) using the Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. However, the TES algorithm is prone to scaling errors in estimating emissivities for surfaces with low spectral contrast if the atmospheric correction is inaccurate. This paper shows a comparison between the land surface. emissivity estimated with the TES algorithm and from a simple approach using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for five ASTER images (28 June 2000, 15 August 2000, 31 August 2000, 28 April 2001 and 02 August 2001) of the agricultural area of Barrax (Albacete, Spain). The results indicate that differences are < 1% for ASTER band 13 (10.7 mu m) and < 1.5% for band 14 (11.3 mu m), but > 2% for bands 10 (8.3 mu m), 11 (8.6 mu m) and 12 (9.1 mu m). The emissivities for the five ASTER bands were tested against in situ measurements carried out with the CIMEL CE 312-2 field radiometer, the NDVI method giving root mean square errors (RMSE) < 0.005 over vegetated areas and RMSE < 0.015 over bare soil, and the TES algorithm giving RMSE similar to 0.01 for vegetated areas but RMSE > 0.03 over bare soil. The errors and inconsistencies for ASTER bands 13 and 14 are within those anticipated for TES, but the greater errors for bands 10-12 suggest the presence of problems related to atmospheric compensation and model assumptions about soil spectra. The NDVI method uses visible/near-infrared data co-acquired with the thermal images to estimate vegetation cover and, hence, provides an independent constraint on emissivity. The success of this approach suggests that it may be useful for daytime images of agricultural or other heavily vegetated areas, in which the TES algorithm has occasional failures.

AB We used land surface temperature (LST) algorithms and NDVI values to estimate changes in vegetation in the European continent between 1982 and 1999 from the Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) dataset. These two parameters are monitored through HANTS (Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series) software, which allows the simultaneous observation of mean value, first harmonic amplitude and phase behaviors in the same image. These results for each complete year of data show the effect of volcanic aerosols and orbital drift on PAL data. Comparison of time series of HANTS cloud-free time series with the original time series for various land cover proves that this software is useful for LST analysis, although primarily designed for NDVI applications. Comparison of yearly averages of HANTS LST over the whole Europe with air temperature confirms the validity of the results. Maps of the evolution for both parameters between periods 1982/1986 and 1995/1999 have been elaborated: NDVI data show the well confirmed trend of increase over Europe (up to 0.1 in NDVI), Southern Europe seeing a decrease in NDVI (-0.02). LST averages stay stable or slightly decrease (up to -1.5 K) over the whole continent, except for southern areas for which the increase is up to 2.5 K. These results evidence that and and semi-arid areas of Southern Europe have become more arid, the rest of Europe seeing an increase in its wood land proportion, while seasonal amplitude in Northern Europe has decreased.

AB Estimates of daily gross primary production (GPP) and annual net primary production (NPP) at the 1 km spatial resolution are now produced operationally for the global terrestrial surface using imagery from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Ecosystem-level measurements of GPP at eddy covariance flux towers and plot-level measurements of NPP over the surrounding landscape offer opportunities for validating the MODIS NPP and GPP products, but these flux measurements must be scaled over areas on the order of 25 km(2) to make effective comparisons to the MODIS products. Here, we report results for such comparisons at 9 sites varying widely in biome type and land use. The sites included arctic tundra, boreal forest, temperate hardwood forest, temperate conifer forest, tropical rain forest, tallgrass prairie, desert grassland, and cropland. The ground-based NPP and GPP surfaces were generated by application of the Biome-BGC carbon cycle process model in a spatially-distributed mode. Model inputs of land cover and leaf area index were derived from Landsat data. The MODIS NPP and GPP products showed no overall bias. They tended to be overestimates at low productivity sites - often because of artificially high values of MODIS FPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy), a critical input to the MODIS GPP algorithm. In contrast, the MODIS products tended to be underestimates in high productivity sites - often a function of relatively low values for vegetation light use efficiency in the MODIS GPP algorithm. A global network of sites where both NPP and GPP are measured and scaled over the local landscape is needed to more comprehensively validate the MODIS NPP and GPP products and to potentially calibrate the MODIS NPP/GPP algorithm parameters.

AB Measurements of spring phenological dates in boreal regions using NDVI can be affected by snowmelt. This impacts the analysis of interannual variations in phenology and the estimates of annual carbon fluxes. For these two objectives, snowmelt effect must be removed from the phenological detection. We propose a methodology for determining the date of onset of greening in the 1982-2004 period using SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) and NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. From 1998 onwards, the date of onset of greening is taken as the date at which the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), calculated from SPOT-VGT near and short-wave infrared bands, starts increasing. This index decreases with snowmelt but increases with vegetation greening. For the 1982-2001 period, the date of onset of greening is the date at which AVHRR-NDVI equals a pixel specific threshold (PST), determined using the results of the NDWI method in the years common to the two datasets. The methods are validated using in situ measurements of the dates of leaf appearance. RMSE of 6.7 and 7.8 days, respectively, is found using NDWI-VGT and PST-NOAA methodologies, and the difference between the two methodologies in the common years is small. Very importantly, the dates are not biased. The interannual variations of the 23-year spring phenology dataset on the study area in northern Eurasia are analysed. In average over the study area, an advance of 8 days and a delay of 3.6 days are, respectively, found over the periods 1982 - 1991 and 1993 -2004. These results confirm and complete previous studies about the greening trend, remove the uncertainty due to snow, and may improve carbon budget calculations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Near real-time vegetation indices derived from MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations (http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov) provide a first opportunity to monitor ecohydrological systems globally at a spatial resolution consistent with biophysical processes at the field scale. Here, we present work toward the quantitative estimation of the uncertainty associated with MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), an end-product that depends on several MODIS derived vegetation indices. GPP products, available at 8-day and 1-km resolutions, were evaluated in two representative tropical ecosystems: a mixed forest site in the humid tropics (the Marsyandi river basin in the Nepalese Himalayas), and an open shrubland site in a semi-arid region (the Sonora river basin in northern Mexico). The MODIS-GPP products were compared against simulations made with a process-based biochemical-hydrology model driven by flux tower meteorological observations. Whereas the temporal march of vegetation indices and GPP products is consistent between the model and the algorithm, our study indicates that that there is a positive bias in the case of the mixed forest biome in the Marsyandi basin, and a negative bias in the case of open shrublands in the Sonora basin. We examined the error contribution from the DAO meteorological data used in the standard MODIS GPP products. The bias between the GPP estimates using DAO and tower meteorology is - 2.77 gC/m(2)/day (i.e., -77% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in the Marsyandi, and 0.33 gC/m2/day (i.e., 18% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in Sonora. Analysis of the temporal evolution of the discrepancies between the model and the MODIS algorithm points to the need for examining the light use efficiency parameterization, especially with regard to the representation of nonlinear functional dependencies on vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and seasonal evolution of the productive capacity of vegetation as influenced by water stress.

AB Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data with a sampling density of 0.9-1.2 m(-2) collected over 133 georeferenced field sample plots and 56 forest stands located in young and mature forest. The plot size was 300-400 m 2 and the average stand size was 1.7 ha. Spruce and pine were the dominant tree species. Canopy height distributions were created from both first and last pulse data. The laser data were acquired in 1999 and 2001. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. Corresponding metrics derived from the 1999 and 2001 laser datasets were compared. Forty-five of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data changed their values significantly due to forest growth. The upper height percentiles increased their values more than the field-based height growth estimates. The 50 and 90 height percentiles increased by 0.4-1.3 in whereas the field-estimated mean height increased by 0.2-0.9 m. Metrics derived from the last pulse data were less influenced by growth.
   Mean tree height (h(L)), basal area (G), and volume (V) were regressed against the laser-derived variables to predict corresponding values of hL, G, and V based on the 1999 and 2001 laser data, respectively. Forest growth was estimated as the difference between the 2001 and 1999 estimates. Laser data were able to predict a significant growth in all the three biophysical variables over the 2-year period. However, the accuracy of the predictions was poor. In most cases the predictions were biased and the precision was low. Finally, several key issues of particular relevance to laser-based monitoring of forest growth are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Because their broad spatial and temporal coverage, satellites provide the main source of fire data for Amazonia. A key to the application of these tools for environmental studies is the appropriate interpretation of the data they provide. To enhance the interpretation of satellite fire data for this region, we collected ground-based data on fires in 2001 and 2002 using a simple and passive method, and statistically related these data to corresponding estimates from AVHRR and MODIS fire products using error matrices. Multiple methods of analyses from simple to complex produced qualitatively similar results. Total accuracies for both fire products were very high (> 99%) and dominated by accurate (> 99%) non-fire detection. Kappa statistics and fire-detection accuracies were substantially lower, with omission errors higher than commission errors. Results calculated using several different sets of spatial-matching parameters of analysis showed that Kappa was 1-10.6% for AVHRR, and 0-1.4% for MODIS. User's accuracy for fires was 0-40% for AVHRR and 3-100% for MODIS. Producer's accuracy for fires was 0-8% for AVHRR and 0-1% for MODIS. Statistical evaluations of potential explanatory factors showed that fire size and sampling time were dominant factors for low accuracies. Results from this study indicate that current satellite fire products are providing a limited sample of the fire activity in the region, and that ground-based analyses can substantially contribute to the interpretation of these products.

AB MODIS primary production products (MOD 17) are the first regular, near-real-time data sets for repeated monitoring of vegetation primary production on vegetated land at 1-km resolution at an 8-day interval. But both the inconsistent spatial resolution between the gridded meteorological data and MODIS pixels, and the cloud-contaminated MODIS FPAR/LAI (MOD15A2) retrievals can introduce considerable errors to Collection4 primary production (denoted as C4 MOD 17) results. Here, we aim to rectify these problems through reprocessing key inputs to MODIS primary vegetation productivity algorithm, resulting in improved Collection5 MOD17 (here denoted as C5 MOD17) estimates. This was accomplished by spatial interpolation of the coarse resolution meteorological data input and with temporal filling of cloud-contaminated MOD15A2 data. Furthermore, we modified the Biome Parameter Look-Up Table (BPLUT) based on recent synthesized NPP data and some observed GPP derived from some flux tower measurements to keep up with the improvements in upstream inputs. Because MOD17 is one of the down-stream MODIS land products, the performance of the algorithm can be largely influenced by the uncertainties from upstream inputs, such as land cover, FPAR/LAI, the meteorological data, and algorithm itself. MODIS GPP fits well with GPP derived from 12 flux towers over North America. Globally, the 3-year MOD17 NPP is comparable to the Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) NPP data set, and global total MODIS GPP and NPP are inversely related to the observed atmospheric CO2 growth rates, and MEI index, indicating MOD 17 are reliable products. From 2001 to 2003, mean global total GPP and NPP estimated by MODIS are 109.29 Pg C/year and 56.02 Pg C/year, respectively. Based on this research, the improved global MODIS primary production data set is now ready for monitoring ecological conditions, natural resources and environmental changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Fire researchers and resource managers are dependent upon accurate, spatially-explicit forest structure information to support the application of forest fire behavior models. In particular, reliable estimates of several critical forest canopy structure metrics, including canopy bulk density, canopy height, canopy fuel weight, and canopy base height, are required to accurately map the spatial distribution of canopy fuels and model fire behavior over the landscape. The use of airborne laser scanning (LIDAR), a high-resolution active remote sensing technology, provides for accurate and efficient measurement of three-dimensional forest structure over extensive areas. In this study, regression analysis was used to develop predictive models relating a variety of LIDAR-based metrics to the canopy fuel parameters estimated from inventory data collected at plots established within stands of varying condition within Capitol State Forest, in western Washington State. Strong relationships between LIDAR-derived metrics and field-based fuel estimates were found for all parameters [sqrt(crown fuel weight): R-2=0.86; In(crown bulk density): R-2=0.84; canopy base height: R-2=0.77; canopy height: R-2=0.98]. A cross-validation procedure was used to assess the reliability of these models. LIDAR-based fuel prediction models can be used to develop maps of critical canopy fuel parameters over forest areas in the Pacific Northwest.

AB We propose to evaluate the calibration of MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) over dark waters in the near infrared. We work with 5 months of data, from July to November 2003, over five world sites: Venice and Lampedusa in Italy, El Arenosillo in Spain, MOBY/Lanai and CalCOFI/San Nicolas in the United States. The sites are all equipped with a CIMEL station that forms part of the AERONET network. The basic idea is to associate CIMEL sky radiance measurements with MERIS level-1b data in a twin geometry which corresponds to the same scattering angle. This vicarious calibration relies on an accurate description of the atmospheric scattering based on the CIMEL measurements.
   After a selection of MERIS and CIMEL data we finally obtained 8 days for the calibration task-about 10% of the initial dataset. We achieved a match-up analysis at 6 MERIS wavelengths, from 884 nm to 664 nm, in the near infrared (NIR). Results show an agreement between the onboard calibration and our method within 1.5% in the NIR which falls in the expected accuracy of the two methods. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation indices and transformations have been used extensively in forest change detection studies. In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated (>0.95 r(2)) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7-8% higher commission and 12-22% higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired I and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals.

AB Accurate calculation of the time of melt onset, freeze onset, and melt duration over Arctic sea-ice area is crucial for climate and global change studies because it affects accuracy of surface energy balance estimates. This comparative study evaluates several methods used to estimate sea-ice melt and freeze onset dates: (1) the melt onset database derived from SSM/I passive microwave brightness temperatures (T(b)s) using Drobot and Anderson's [J. Geophys. Res. 106 (2001) 24033] Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm (AHRA) and distributed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC); (2) the International Arctic Buoy Program/Polar Exchange at the Sea (IABP/POLES) surface air temperatures (SATs); (3) an elaborated version of the AHRA that uses IABP/POLES to avoid anomalous results (Passive Microwave and Surface Temperature Analysis [PMSTA]); (4) another elaborated version of the AHRA that uses T-b valiance to avoid anomalous results (Mean Differences and Standard Deviation Analysis [MDSDA]); (5) Smith's [J. Geophys. Res. 103 (1998) 27753] vertically polarized Tb algorithm for estimating melt onset in multiyear (MY) ice (SSM/I 19V-37V); and (6) analyses of concurrent backscattering cross section (sigma(o)) and brightness temperature (Tb) from OKEAN-01 satellite series. Melt onset and freeze onset maps were created and compared to understand how the estimates vary between different satellite instruments and methods over different Arctic sea-ice regions. Comparisons were made to evaluate relative sensitivities among the methods to slight adjustments of the Tb calibration coefficients and algorithm threshold values. Compared to the PMSTA method, the AHRA method tended to estimate significantly earlier melt dates, likely caused by the AHRA's susceptibility to prematurely identify melt onset conditions. In contrast, the IABP/POLES surface air temperature data tended to estimate later melt and earlier freeze in all but perennial ice. The MDSDA method was least sensitive to small adjustments of the SMMR-SSM/I inter-satellite calibration coefficients. Differences among methods varied by latitude. Freeze onset dates among methods were most disparate in southern latitudes, and tended to converge northward. Surface air temperatures (IABP/POLES) indicated freeze onset well before the MDSDA method, especially in southern peripheral seas, while PMSTA freeze estimates were generally intermediate. Surface air temperature data estimated latest melt onset dates in southern latitudes, but earliest melt onset in northern latitudes. The PMSTA estimated earliest melt onset dates in southern regions, and converged with the MDSDA northward. Because sea-ice melt and freeze are dynamical transitional processes, differences among these methods are associated with differing sensitivities to changing stages of environmental and physical development. These studies contribute to the growing body of documentation about the levels of disparity obtained when Arctic seasonal transition parameters are estimated using various types of microwave data and algorithms.

AB Motivated by the increasing importance of hyperspectral remote sensing data, this study sought to determine whether current-generation narrow-band hyperspectral remote sensing data could better track vegetation leaf area index (L l) than traditional broad-band multispectral data. The study takes advantage of a unique dataset, wherein field measurements of LAI were acquired at the same general time and grain size as both Landsat ETM+ and AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) imagery in four different biomes. Biome types sampled included row-crop agriculture, tallgrass prairie, mixed hardwood-conifer forest, and boreal conifer forest. The effects of bandwidth, band placement, and number of bands were isolated from radiometric quality by comparing regression models derived from individual AVIRIS channels with those derived from simulated ETM+ and MODIS channels using the AVIRIS data. Models with selected subsets of individual AVIRIS channels performed better to predict LAI than those based on the broadband datasets, although the potential to overfit models using the large number of available AVIRIS bands is a concern. Models based on actual ETM+ data were generally stronger than those based on simulated ETM+ data, suggesting that, for predicting LAI, ETM+ data suffer no penalty for having lower radiometric quality. NDVI was generally not sensitive to LAI at the four sites. Band placement of broad-band sensors (e.g., simulated ETM+ and MODIS) did not affect relationships with LAI, suggesting that there is no inherent advantage to MODIS spectral properties over those of ETM+ for estimating LAI. Spectral channels in the red-edge and shortwave-infrared regions were generally more important than those in the near-infrared for predicting LAI. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Remote sensing offers an important means of detecting and analyzing temporal changes occurring in our landscape. This research used remote sensing to quantify land use/land cover changes, and landscape metrics to track ecological impacts of such changes at the Effigy Mounds National Monument (EFMO), Iowa, USA. Aerial photography spanning a period of six decades, IKONOS pan-sharpened (I X I m) data, and input from the US National Park Service were used to develop land cover classification maps for the 1940s, 1960s, and 1990s. A post-classification algorithm was applied to derive land cover changes, and landscape metrics were used to analyze specific habitat classes. Overall changes in natural vegetation between 1940s and 1990s at EFMO showed interchangeable shifts whereby the canopies of some areas of deciduous forests and bottomland woodlands thinned out, whereas others transited from croplands in the 1940s to full growth forest in the 1990s. Similar patterns were observed for cropland and pasture, where the total area of cropland declined while that of pasture increased, albeit with a decline in the number of patches. Land cover changes around EFMO reflect the impacts of management decisions made in response to shifts in agricultural and economic policy while, within EFMO, the areas of "natural" vegetation are well maintained and devoid of any significant human activity.

AB There is a pressing need for an objective, repeatable, systematic and spatially explicit measure of land degradation. In northeastern South Africa (SA), there are large areas of the former homelands that are widely regarded as degraded. A time-series of seasonally integrated I km, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was used to compare degraded rangelands [mapped by the National Land Cover (NLC) using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery] to nondegraded rangelands within the same land capability units (LCUs). Nondegraded and degraded areas in the same LCU (paired areas) were compared by: (i) testing for differences in spatial mean SigmaNDVI values, (ii) calculating the relative degradation impact (RDI) as the difference between the spatial mean SigmaNDVI values of paired areas expressed as a percentage of nondegraded rnean value, (iii) investigating the relationship between RDI and rainfall and (iv) comparing the resilience and stability of paired areas in response to natural variations in rainfall. The SigmaNDVI of degraded areas was significantly lower for most of the LCUs. Relative degradation impacts (RDI) across all LCUs ranged from 1% to 20% with an average of 9%. Although SigmaNDVI was related to rainfall, RDI was not. Degraded areas were no less stable or resilient than nondegraded. However, the productivity of degraded areas, i.e., the forage production per unit rainfall, was consistently lower than nondegraded areas, even within years of above normal rainfall. The results indicate that there has not been a catastrophic reduction in ecosystem function within degraded areas. Instead, degradation impacts were reflected as reductions in productivity that varied along a continuum from slight to severe, depending on the specific LCU. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB High spatial and temporal resolution maps of sea surface temperature (SST) have numerous applications in coastal and estuarine systems. A climatology map, tracking SST as a function of year-day, was produced at Southern New England using 53 Landsat TM and ETM+ thermal infrared data. A recursive curve-fitting algorithm was used to fit these data and eliminate cloud contamination, resulting in an average daily temperature at every 60-m pixel. The climatology was validated against long-term in situ records that were analyzed with the same techniques. The results show, as expected, that isolated and shallow water bodies undergo more extreme temperature variation ( -2 to 25 degreesC) than deeper, well-connected embayments (I to 21 degreesC) or the coastal ocean (4 to 18 degreesC). The coastal ocean is shown to lag insolation and shallow lakes by up to 44 days, with embayments showing a gradation between these extremes. Despite the Subtle temperature range variation, there is rich detail in the spatial patterns which are relevant to the applied sciences of coastal and estuarine systems. The spatial pattern of the climatology reveals anomalous patterns, such as occur where anthropogenic forcing alters climatological patterns. The heat budget of Mount Hope Bay in northeast Narragansett Bay has anthropogenic thermal input from a large power plant, and this input is reflected in the climatology. From the results, it is seen that Narragansett Bay has, on average, a mean annual temperature of 11.86 +/- 0.41 degreesC, while the Mount Hope Bay system is consistently warmer at 12.30 +/- 0.21 degreesC and shows a delayed response to autumn cooling. The long history of Landsat data acquisition can be used to create a climatology of coastal and estuarine scale dynamics at an order of magnitude finer scale resolution than AVHRR climatologies.

AB Digitized colour infrared images are a potential information source for multi-source forest inventory applications and particularly for estimating the forest characteristics of relatively small areas. The main problem in computer-aided image analysis of aerial photographs is the presence of bidirectional reflectance, which causes the spectral values of the image pixels to depend on their location in the image. Because of this, and the lack of operational methods for radiometric correction, the full potential of aerial photographs has not been utilised. This paper presents a local radiometric correction method that can be used for reducing the effect of bidirectional reflectance. The method employs satellite images that are less affected by the bidirectional reflectance for the local adjustment of the registered pixel values of aerial photographs. Because of the different spatial resolution of the aerial and satellite imagery, the local correction coefficients are computed for units that are larger than a single aerial photo pixel. In this way, the general level of brightness of the correction units can be determined on the basis of the satellite imagery while retaining the finer spatial resolution of the original aerial photo. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not require complex mathematical models for simulating the effect of bidirectional reflectance, neither does it require a priori knowledge of the actual forest attributes in the inventory area, but relies only on the image data.

AB This study uses IKONOS imagery to quantify the combined spatial and spectral characteristics of urban reflectance in 14 urban areas worldwide. IKONOS 1-m panchromatic imagery provides a detailed measure of spatial variations in albedo while IKONOS 4-m multispectral imagery allows the relative contributions of different materials to the spectrally heterogeneous radiance field to be determined and their abundance to be mapped. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicate that the characteristic scale of urban reflectance is consistently between 10 and 20 m for the cities in this study. Spectral mixture analysis quantifies the relative contributions of the dominant spectral endmembers to the overall reflectance of the urban mosaic. Spectral mixing spaces defined by the two low-order principal components account for 96% to 99% of image variance and have a consistent triangular structure spanned by high albedo, low albedo and vegetation endmembers. Spectral mixing among these endmembers is predominantly linear although some nonlinear mixing is observed along the gray axis spanning the high and low albedo endmembers. Inversion of a constrained three-component linear mixing model produces stable, consistent estimates of endmember abundance. RMS errors based on the misfit between observed radiance vectors and modeled radiance vectors (derived from fraction estimates and image endmembers) are generally less than 3% of the mean of the observed radiance. Agreement between observed radiance and fraction estimates does not guarantee the accuracy of the a real fraction estimates, but it does indicate that the three-component linear model provides a consistent and widely applicable physical characterization of urban reflectance. Field validated fraction estimates have applications in urban vegetation monitoring and pervious surface mapping. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Biomass measurements of totora and bofedal Andean wetland grasses in the Bolivian Northern Altiplano were correlated over a growing season to vegetation indices derived from 1-km visible and near-infrared bands of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown on the NOAA-14 polar-orbiting meteorological satellite. This article discusses the potential and limits of these indices for the assessment of the spatial and temporal variation of biomass and of the fraction of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by these herbaceous native forages growing in water-saturated environments. Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization was also investigated based on simple kernel-driven models. BRDF normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed the best for both totorales and bofedales vegetation associations, followed by the uncorrected maximum-value composite NDVI. BRDF normalized NDVI was shown to be sensitive to the green leaf or photosynthetically active biomass.
   Estimation of biomass production after Kumar and Monteith (1982) was used to determine the efficiency of solar energy conversion into biomass (epsilon(b)) for the main phenological periods, corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons. Two approaches were investigated for the biomass production estimation: the first one is based on monthly field biomass measurements; the second one is based on estimates from the regression computed previously using Roujean's BRDF normalized NDVI. The values found for these efficiencies for the rainy season agree with those of the literature for grasslands of temperate regions. For the dry season, more accurate information on totora and bofedal senescence and on animal consumption is required to get a reasonable efficiency value. This is not surprising, as other workers have reported biomass estimation with remotely sensed data to be most relevant to the growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature retrieved with temperature-emissivity separation (TES) and split-window (SW) algorithms from six-channel Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data in the HAPEX-Sahel experiment agreed with contemporaneous ground temperature measurements to within +/-1degreesC (TES and SW with channels at 10.8 and 11.7 mum, or SW-56). The SW algorithm used with TIMS channels at 8.4 and 8.7 mum (SW-12) underestimated ground temperatures by 2-5 degreesC. The TES method required atmospheric correction of at-sensor radiances, which was done with local radiosonde data and MODTRAN 4, and an empirical relationship between the spectral range of emissivity and its minimum value. Emissivity data required for the SW algorithms were obtained using vegetation cover estimates from near-coincident reflective remote sensing data. The temperature underestimation of the SW-12 algorithm could be caused by errors in the emissivity inputs calculated from the vegetation cover. Such errors were due to the high variability of surface emissivity in the 8-9-mum waveband, which was much larger than in the 10-12-mum region. This was checked using TES derived emissivities as inputs of the SW algorithms, and comparing the resulting temperatures with the TES temperatures. In this case, both the SW-56 and SW-12 temperatures agreed with TES within +/-1degreesC for all sites and scenes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the first paper of this series, we developed narrowband to broadband albedo conversion formulae for a series of sensors. These formulae were determined based on extensive radiative transfer simulations under different surface and atmospheric conditions. However, it is important to validate the simulation results using independent measurement data. In this paper, the validation results for three broadband albedos (total-shortwave, -visible and -near-IR albedos) using ground measurement of several cover types on five different days at Beltsville, MD are presented. Results show that the conversion formulae in the previous paper are very accurate and the average residual standard errors of the resulting broadband albedos for most sensors are around 0.02, which meets the required accuracy for land surface modeling.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was launched in December 1999 on the polar orbiting Terra spacecraft and since February 2000 has been acquiring daily global data in 36 spectral bands-29 with 1 km, five with 500 m, and two with 250 m nadir pixel dimensions. The Terra satellite has on-board exterior orientation (position and attitude) measurement systems designed to enable geolocation of MODIS data to approximately 150 m (1 Q) at nadir. A global network of ground control points is being used to determine biases and trends in the sensor orientation. Biases have been removed by updating models of the spacecraft and instrument orientation in the MODIS geolocation software several times since launch and have improved the MODIS geolocation to approximately 50 m (1sigma) at nadir. This paper overviews the geolocation approach, summarizes the first year of geolocation analysis, and overviews future work. The approach allows an operational characterization of the MODIS geolocation errors and enables individual MODIS observations to be geolocated to the sub-pixel accuracies required for terrestrial global change applications.

AB Hyperspectral images were acquired along the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado to determine the feasibility of identification and mapping of expansive clay soils with two, high-SNR imaging spectrometers. Swelling soils are a major geologic hazard, and cause extensive damage world-wide every year. The cost of postconstruction mitigation and standard engineering soil tests for creation of regional maps are immense. Smectite is the clay mineral group that has the greatest swelling potential and is responsible for most of the severe swelling soil damage observed in Colorado. Data sets were acquired from 1997 to 1999 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap). Using a matched filtering algorithm, maps of exposed clay material were produced, despite a strong vegetation cover. Among those exposures, spectral discrimination and identification of variable clay mineralogy such as smectite, smectite/illite, and kaolinite, in decreasing order of swelling potential hazard, was possible. The comparison of the results from the two sensors showed that higher spatial resolution provided purer image endmembers in more heterogeneous sites, but did not exhibit more endmembers and did not identify new natural outcrops that a lower spatial resolution data set would miss in a homogeneous terrain. However, an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the instrument by pixel summation made possible the identification of low reflectance exposures. This work demonstrates that, using recent instruments and well-established methodologies, imaging spectrometry can be of practical. help for the detection and mapping of expansive clays.

AB Environmental heterogeneity characterizes Mediterranean regions and zones of transition between humid and and climates. Mapping of shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and herbaceous growth is of primary importance for understanding ecosystem function in these vulnerable environments. High spatial fragmentation in these three cover types implies that they are highly mixed at spatial resolutions greater than a few meters. A new methodology is presented which uses phenological differences between shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and herbs to map fractions of each at subpixel scales. To account for seasonal differences, Landsat images acquired at the end of winter and at the beginning and end of summer were analyzed, Differentiation between elementary vegetation and soil cover fractions was achieved using a well-known multispectral unmixing technique in an adaptive way. In this way, an image-based zonal partition facilitated spectral end-members selection according to seasonal variations and to climatic/biotic/lithologic transitions, The methodology was then applied to three Landsat images of an area representing a climatic gradient in the center of Israel. New maps of spatial changes in vegetation cover fractions along the climatic gradient were produced. An important element of the new data relates to the distribution of dwarf shrubs in general, and of Sacroproterium spinosium in particular. These dwarf shrubs are of major ecological significance in countries of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Basin due to their rapid invasion into abandoned fields and burnt areas.

ID THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; ACCURACY; MAINE
AB A time series of 23 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band 6 thermal infrared images over the period 1986-1996 is used to quantify variability of sea surface temperature (SST) along the central coast of Maine, a morphologically complex region of bays, estuaries, and islands. An iterative regression scheme using coregistered, temporally coincident, daily composites of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SST data is used to scale the TM digital numbers in each scene to SST, approximating an atmospheric correction. This approach provides temporally concurrent match-ups, even for Landsat scenes more than 10 years old and over 1000 data points to most regressions. Analysis of the TM scenes by year-day delivers temporal resolution sufficient for insight into overall seasonal pattern and allows identification of recurring seasonal features within the study area. The dominant seasonal patterns is a cross-shelf SST gradient of coldest water nearshore in winter which reverses sign in summer and disappears in spring and fall. Differences in summer SST are evident between four adjacent bays, attributable to differences in residual circulation, freshwater input, and flushing. Recurrent frontal zones evident in summer are identified and compare well to available but noncoincident in situ hydrographic data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We study the use of airborne and simulated satellite remote sensing data for classification of three water quality variables: Secchi depth, turbidity, and chlorophyll a. An extensive airborne spectrometer and ground truth data set obtained in four lake water quality measurement campaigns in southern Finland during 1996-1998 was used in the analysis. The class limits for the water quality variables were obtained from two operational classification standards. When remote sensing data is used, a combination of them proved to be the most suitable. The feasibility of the system for operational use was tested by training and testing the retrieval algorithms with separate data sets. In this case, the classification accuracy is 90% for three Secchi depth classes, 79% for five turbidity classes, and 78% for five chlorophyll a classes. When Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) data was spectrally averaged corresponding to Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) channels, the classification accuracy was about the same as in the case of the original AISA channels.

ID SPACECRAFT
AB The Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder (APP) data provides the first long-time series of consistent, calibrated surface albedo and surface temperature data for the polar regions. Validations of these products have consisted of individual studies that analyzed algorithm performance for limited regions and or time periods. This article reports on comparisons made between the APP-derived surface albedo and that measured at 14 automatic weather stations (AWS) around the Greenland ice sheet from January 1997 to August 1998. Results show that satellite-derived surface albedo values are on average 10% less than those measured by the AWS stations. However, the station measurements tend to be biased high by about 4% and thus the differences in absolute albedo may be less (e.g., 6%). In regions of the ice sheet where the albedo variability is small, such as the dry snow facies, the APP albedo uncertainty exceeds the natural variability. Further work is needed to improve the absolute accuracy of the APP-derived surface albedo. Even so, the data provide temporally and spatially consistent estimates of the Greenland ice sheet albedo.

ID AVHRR DATA; EMISSIVITY; SATELLITE; CHANNELS
AB Tendencies toward desertification or changes of the land surface can be detected by monitoring land surface temperature (LST), but accurate retrievals require good knowledge of the atmosphere and land surface parameters. Here, the effect of land surface emissivity, LST, and ground height on the error of LST associated with atmospheric correction is modeled for the thermal infrared (TIR) channel of METEOSAT using MODTRAN. The atmospheric conditions of midlatitude summer (MLS) and midlatitude winter (MLW) are considered. The results confirm that for accurate atmospheric corrections temperature and height variations have to be extended by an emissivity variation. LST maps for larger areas are generated using atmospheric corrections derived from EMCWF reanalysis and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The corrections are spatially and temporally interpolated using Shepards' method and a model of the diurnal LST wave, respectively. The interpolations allow the generation of spatially smooth LST maps for any time of the day. Modeling the diurnal wave can partially compensate for the adverse effect of cloudiness and radiometric noise. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

AB Multitemporal data sets of the LISS-III sensor mounted on the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1C) and field relectance spectra have been evaluated for estimating chlorophyll-a content in lakes. The results were compared to laboratory analyses of in situ water samples. Quantification from field reflectance spectra was carried out using the 678 nm absorption maximum and the 705 nm reflectance peak. For the evaluation of the LISS-III satelite data three approaches were compared: spectral height of the green peak, supervised maximum likelihood classification, and linear spetral unmixing. The latter gave the best results with the highest certainty measure of R-2=0.85 and was applied to all five LISS-III data sets. The results are maps of the chlorophyll-a content in 10 mu g/l classes for each for each of the five dates. For comparison of the accuracy of the different methods for water quality analysis, the trophic state index was calculated based on chlorophyll-a determination from laboratory, field spectra, and satellite data. Regarding the five lakes for which all the data were available, each method shows similiar results for the estimation of trophic state. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This report addresses a case of topographic air-sea interaction in the Gulf of Mannar, near the Indian tip, for the winter monsoon of 1996-1997. Using high spatial resolution NASA-Scatterometer (NSCAT) wind data, a 1 degrees x1 degrees region of strong wind is identified in the Gulf during the peak of the winter monsoon. The characteristic topography of South India and Sri Lanka and their orientation to the monsoon wind tend to channel this strong wind. Air-sea heat flux analyses, using the NSCAT wind and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast objective analyses surface data, reveal that the strong winter monsoon bursts cause large latent heat loss (180 W/m(2)) from a wind-fetch region centered on 7.5 degrees N, 77.5 degrees E during January. Weak air-sea temperature gradients result in weak sensible heat loss (<15 W/m(2)) from the ocean. The ocean response to this forcing is examined using weekly and monthly mean satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) maps; these indicate a sea surface cooling of about 1 degrees C along the axis of the wind flow. A by-product of this cooling is an emergence of a SST front along the periphery of the strong wind-stress region. Time-series analyses of the surface meteorology reveal that this forcing has a periodicity of about 15 days, with a peak during the last week of December. Wind stress curl derived from the NSCAT wind data exhibits high negative values (anticyclonic Ekman pumping) on a 2-week time scale, concomitant with strong wind bursts. The features observed in the Gulf of Mannar are similar to those reported form some other locations. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB In this article, we describe a reflectance model which parametrizes the reflectance of vegetation canopies from optical properties of leaves and soil, and dominant canopy structural parameters. The model assumes certain principles of geometric models, for example, that sensor integrates the radiance reflected from three components, plant, shaded soil, and illuminated soil. Its inversion provides compositional information of the ground surface that is linked with the interpretation of the linear spectral mixture modeling (LSMM). This model also offers the potential for retrieving other meaningful biophysical properties such as LAI. The model has been tested on simulated spectra of spectral mixtures in presence of significant multiple scattering. Results indicate that this modeling approach is a suitable remote sensing tool for retrieving the vegetation abundance in heterogeneous canopies, which is interpreted as the fractional cover of plants with well-defined structural parameters.

AB The MODIS sensor to be launched on tho EOS-AM platform will be the most important sensor for global vegetation mapping. Among the programmatic goals for the MODIS sensor are to assess and track changes in land use/landcover, leaf area index (LAI), and net primary productivity (NPP). For these products to be used in global models, they must be rigorously validated with site-specific data products. This article presents a review of some of the problems facing a regional- to global-scale validation effort and presents strategies for coordinating the land-cover classification process across multiple sites. We suggest the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) as the source of remotely sensed data for validation, and that the IGBP 17-class land-cover classification system be used to provide a link between more complex site-specific systems and global-scale data products.. We further recommend that the best site-specific land-cover classifications be obtained using whatever ancillary data are found to be useful as a basis for validation. In addition, we propose ways in which ambiguities in translation of classes, from specific to general systems may be identified. Finally, we stress that even though standardization of methodology among sites may not be appropriate to the goal of obtaining the best possible land-cover prodnets, there should be standardization of error analysis and metadata reporting.

AB Mapping and monitoring of leaf area index (LAI) is important for spatially distributed modeling of vegetation productivity, evapotranspiration, and surface energy balance. Global LAI surfaces will be an early product of the MODIS Land Science Team, and the requirements for LAI validation at selected sites have prompted interest in accurate LAI mapping at a more local scale. While spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) derived from satellite remote sensing have been used to map LAI, vegetation type, and related optical properties, and effects of Sun-surface-sensor geometry, background reflectance, and atmospheric quality can limit the strength and generality of empirical LAI-SVI relationships. In the interest of a preliminary assessment of the variability in LAI-SVI relationships across vegetation types, we compared Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery from thee temperate zone sites with on-site LAI measurements. The sites differed widely in location, vegetation physiognomy (grass, shrubs, hardwood forest, and conifer forest), and topographic complexity. Comparisons were made using three different red and near-infrared-based SVIs (NDVI, SR, SAVI). Several derivations of the SVIs were examined, including those based on raw digital numbers (DN), radiance, top of the atmosphere reflectance, and atmospherically corrected reflectance. For one of the sites, which had extreme topographic complexity, additional corrections were made for Sun-surface-sensor geometry. Across all sites, a strong general relationship was preserved, with SVIs increasing up to LAI values of 3 to 5, For all but the coniferous forest site, sensitivity of the SVIs was low at LAI values above 5. In coniferous forests, the SVIs decreased at the highest LAI values because of decreasing near-infrared reflectance associated with the complex canopy in these mature to old-growth stands. The cross-site LAI-SVI relationships based on atmospherically corrected imagery were stronger than those based on DN, radiance, or top of atmosphere reflectance. Topographic corrections at the conifer site altered th SVIs in some cases but had little effect on the LAI-SVI relationships. Significant effects of vegetation properties on SVIs, which were independent of LAI, were evident. The variability between and around the best fit LAI-SVI relationships for this dataset suggests that for local accuracy in development of LAI surfaces it will be desirable to stratify by land cover classes (e. g. physiognomic type and successional stage) and to vary the SVI.

AB Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (MIR) data, collected from a NASA ER-2 flight over the Great Lakes region and New England in February 1997, are used to identify snow cover. Data at 89 GHz, 150 GHz, and 220 GHz are compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover product. Additional data sets used in this analysis are the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover classification and the MODIS cloud cover mask. Results show that for cloud-free scenes, the MIR data are well related to the snow and vegetation cover. Under cloudy conditions the MODIS snow mapping algorithm, which uses visible and near-infrared data, is unable to detect snow cover. However, the surface cover is still clearly discernible in the MIR images. It is suggested that high frequency microwave data may be used to supplement the MODIS, or other visible and near-infrared derived snow cover products, during cloudy conditions. The development of snow cover algorithms combining future Earth Observing System (EOS) microwave, visible, and infrared data are discussed. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB AVHRR satellite imagery was evaluated as a potential data source for monitoring light attenuation (K-PAR), as a measure of turbidity, in Pamlico Sound estuary, North Carolina. In situ water quality data and reflectance imagery collected on 10 different dates were used to calibrate a general optical equation relating satellite-derived reflectance (R-d), nominally R-(630 nm) to K-PAR. Additional spectral data (e.g., absorption, subsurface reflectance), related reflectance and K-PAR to changes in phytoplankton pigments, organic matter, and suspended sediments. Optically, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina is dominated by scattering from suspended sediments, whereas the tributary rivers are dominated by absorption from both dissolved and particulate organic matter. A general relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR (r(2)=0.72) in Pamlico Sound was found useful in a variety of environmental conditions; however a relationship between R-d and suspended sediment concentration was less robust, and affected by changing sediment characteristics. In the rivers, high and variable absorption in the visible wavelengths precluded development of a relationship between R-d and K-PAR. The relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR in Pamlico Sound is similar to those determined for Delaware Bay and Mobile Bay in previous studies, suggesting possible broader regional application of algorithms for coastal bays and estuaries having similar sediment characteristics, with direct application to SeaWiFS data.

AB Imaging spectroscopy is of growing interest as a new approach to Earth remote sensing. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) was the first imaging sensor to measure the solar reflected spectrum from 400 nm to 2500 nm at 10 nm intervals. The calibration accuracy and signal-to-noise of AVIRIS remain unique. The AVIRIS system as well as the science research and applications have evolved significantly in recent years. The initial design and upgraded characteristics of the AVIRIS system are described in terms of the sensor, calibration, data system, and flight operation. This update on the characteristics of AVIRIS provides the context for the science research and applications that use AVIRIS data acquired in the past several years. Recent science research and applications are reviewed spanning investigations of atmospheric correction, ecology and vegetation, geology and soils, inland and coastal waters, the atmosphere, snow and ice hydrology, biomass burning, environmental hazards, satellite simulation and calibration commercial applications, spectral algorithms, human infrastructure, as well as spectral modeling.

AB A new technique, called multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), was developed and tested in the Santa Monica Mountains, using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired in the fall of 1994 to map California chaparral. The technique models remotely measured spectra as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis. In this manner, vegetation is characterized by a unique set of endmembers as well as by the fractions. Reference endmembers were selected from a library of field and laboratory measured spectra of leaves, canopies, nonphotosynthetic materials (e.g., stems), and soils and used to develop a series of candidate models. Each candidate model was applied to the image, then, on a per pixel basis, assessed in terms of fractions, root mean squared (RMS) error, and residuals. If a model met all criteria, it was listed as a candidate for that pixel. For this study, selection criteria included fractions between -0.01 and 1.01, an RMS less than 0.025 and a residual less than 0.025 in seven or more contiguous bands. A total of 889 two-endmember models were evaluated and used to generate 276 three-endmember models. To facilitate model selection from a large pool of candidates, an optimal set was selected to provide maximal areal coverage. A total of 24 two-endmember and 12 three-endmember models were chosen. These models were used to generate fraction images and vegetation maps showing evergreen and drought deciduous or senesced vegetation. We found that a majority of the image could be modeled as two-endmember models. Three-endmember models provided greater areal coverage, yet provided poorer vegetation discrimination due to an increase in model overlap (two or more model candidates modeling the same pixel). The vegetation maps demonstrate that the technique is capable of discriminating a large number of spectrally distinct types of vegetation while capturing the mosaic-like spatial distribution typical of chaparral. However, additional research is required to fully evaluate the technique and validate the vegetation maps that were produced. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

ID RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; SCATTERING
AB On board ESA's second European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2), launched in April 1995, two instruments perform measurements of the reflectivity of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere: the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) and the Along Track Scanning Radiometer-2 (ATSR-2). GOME is a spectrometer measuring radiation between 240 nm and 790 mn with a spectral resolution of 0.2-0.4 nm. The ATSR-2 is an imager with four channels in the solar part and three channels in the thermal infrared part of the spectrum. Both instruments observe the Sun via a diffuser plate for relative radiometric calibration, thereby yielding reflectivities. The ATSR-2 channels at 555 and 659 nm overlap with the wavelength range of GOME. In this article, the consistency of the reflectivity calibrations of GOME and ATSR-2 is investigated at both wavelengths, by analyzing data from collocated partly cloudy scenes over the Atlantic Ocean, acquired on 23 July 1995. The main result is that reflectivities measured by both instruments agree well; the ATSR-2 reflectivity differs from the GOME reflectivity by -4.0% at 555 nm and -2.2% at 659 nm (relative differences).

AB A simple multiple scattering model has been incorporated into a microwave canopy backscatter model for forest stands with continuous or discontinuous tree canopies. The multiple scattering model was empirically derived using available calculated multiple scattering values and Monte Carlo simulation. All orders of scattering within canopies beyond single scattering were assumed to be isotropic. Multiple scattering was divided evenly among HH, HV, VH, VV polarizations. The corresponding single scattering term was polarization-sensitive. The effect of the multiple scattering term on modeled canopy backscatter was less at long wavelengths than at short wavelengths. At a given wavelength, the multiple scattering term affected copolarized scattering less than cross-polarized scattering. These predictions were consistent with calibrated SAR observations and with our understanding of microwave scattering in forested environment. Including multiple scattering effects improved the agreement between modeled and measured canopy backscatter particularly for cross-polarized backscatter at short wavelengths.

ID CANOPY; VIEW
AB The semiempirical, kernel-driven Ambrals BRDF model was developed for correcting and studying view and illumination angle effects of a wide variety of land covers in remote sensing applications. This model, also scheduled for use in producing a global bidirectional reflectance distribution function and albedo data product from EOS-MODIS and MISR data, is validated in this article by demonstrating its ability to model 27 different multiangular data sets well, representing major types of land cover. The selection of the kernels used in the model is shown to relate to land cover type, and the inversion accuracy to be good in nearly all cases: the correlation coefficient between modeled and observed reflectances is larger than 0.9 for about half of the data sets and larger than 0.70 in all but two cases where the observations are irregular. The average root mean squared error of the inversions is 0.034. A new kernel modeling the sun zenith angle dependence of multiple scattering is introduced and shown to improve fits for dense vegetation. Operation of the Ambrals model is demonstrated by applying it to an ASAS image on a per-pixel basis. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Decision tree classification algorithms have significant potential for land cover mapping problems and have not been tested in detail by the remote sensing community relative to more conventional pattern recognition techniques such as maximum likelihood classification. In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms and evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and Zi-near discriminant function classifiers in regard to classification accuracy. In particular the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages far remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 mu m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 mu m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (rho(0.86 mu m) - rho(1.24 mu m))/(rho(0.86 mu m) + rho(1.24 mu m)), where rho represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-mu m and the 1.24-mu m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 mu m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 mu m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 mu m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24;um channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 mu m, NDWI should be considered as an. independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB An experiment has been conducted in which narrow-band field reflectance spectra were acquired of a roofed pinyon pine canopy with Fee different gravel backgrounds. Leaf area teas successively removed as the measurements were repeated. From these reflectance spectra, narrow-band and broad-band (AVHRR, TM, MSS) red and near-infrared (NIR) vegetation index values were calculated. The performance of the vegetation indices was evaluated based on their capability to accurately estimate leaf area index (LAI) and percent green cover. Background effects were found for each of the tested vegetation indices. However the background effects are most pronounced in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI). Background effects can be reduced using either the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) or soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) formulations. The narrow-band versions of these vegetation indices had only slightly better accuracy than their broad-band counterparts. The background effects were minimized using derivative based vegetation indices, which measure the amplitude of the chlorophyll red-edge using continuous narrow-band spectra from 626 nm to 795 nm.

AB Remote sensing data from the NOAA-11 AVHRR satellite were collected over the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern Arizona during the MONSOON 90 field campaigns. An energy balance model which relies primarily on remotely sensed inputs was used to extrapolate evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from one location containing near-surface meteorological data to other areas in the basin. Satisfactory results were obtained under a wide range of environmental conditions. However, the ET values are essentially instantaneous and therefore do not necessarily provide reliable estimates of daytime or daily ET fluxes required for many hydrological and resource management applications. An operational technique was developed to extrapolate one time of day ET estimates to daytime averages using the evaporative fraction concept and empirical methods for converting midday available energy to daytime average values. Model derived daytime average ET fluxes were in reasonable agreement with local ground-based measurements. The technique also was used to estimate daily ET at the basin scale.

AB Airborne multispectral videography is becoming a popular research and monitoring tool with the advent of charge coupled device (CCD) video technologies. However, most existing systems are not calibrated, resulting in radiometrically inaccurate imagery caused by nonuniform irradiance sensitivity of the CCD imaging arrays and lens vignetting. The latter effect results in a higher concentration of radiation in the center of the images. This article describes the Airborne Multispectral Video/Radiometer Remote Sensing System developed at Utah State University as well as the laboratory procedure developed to calibrate the spectral video imagery for radiance variations across the image plane.

TI MONITORING OF ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS IN TAIGA FORESTS USING ERS-1 SAR
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROWAVE SIGNATURES; MODEL; VEGETATION; ALASKA; SOIL
AB Synthetic-aperture radar images of a forest site near Manley Hot Springs (64-degrees-N, 151-degrees-W), Alaska, were collected between August 1991 and December 1991, day and night, every 3 days, at C-band frequency (lambda = 5.7 cm), vertical receive and transmit polarization, by the European Space Agency first Remote Sensing Satellite, ERS-1.  During the same period, air and soil temperatures and dielectric and gravimetric moisture properties of the forest canopy and forest floor were monitored in three forest stands dominated, respectively, by black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (Picea glauca), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera).  The calibrated ERS-1 radar backscatter values, sigma-degree, of the forest stands are shown to exhibit a pronounced temporal pattern, with little separability between tree species.  The largest change in sigma-degree, a 3-dB decrease almost independent of tree species, is observed in early winter when the soil and vegetation freeze.  In the summer, temporal fluctuations in sigma-degree are about 1-2 dB in magnitude, depending on tree species.  Diurnal variations in sigma-degree are as large as 2 dB during fall freeze-up, and less than 1 dB in summer and winter.  These temporal variations in radar backscatter from the forest are interpreted using the MIMICS radar backscatter model and the in situ surface observations as due to changes in the dielectric properties of the forest floor and forest canopy induced by precipitation (summer), drought (fall), and freezing (fall-winter) events.  In winter, sigma-degree increases across the entire landscape, probably because of volume scattering from large depth hoar ice crystals forming in the snow pack.

TI PRELIMINARY ERS-1 OBSERVATIONS OF ALASKAN AND ALEUTIAN VOLCANOS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Note
ID ACTIVE VOLCANOS; ARC
AB We used ERS-1 radar images collected between October 1991 and February 1993 to study volcanic landforms of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. These data were used to map a little-eroded even-textured unit that is a thick low-mobility pyroclastic deposit around Aniakchak caldera. Also we have identified possible caldera remnants at Black Peak, and located volcanically related collapse pits and depressions in the summit glacier of Veniaminof. Observations of Westdahl and Mt. Spurr, both of which erupted during our observation period, demonstrate that new lava flows and debris flows can be mapped by virtue of their high radar backscatter and contrast with the surrounding terrain. These data demonstrate the utility of frequent orbital radar observations in this area. Regional mapping can be carried out for volcanoes that are difficult to study in the field due to adverse working conditions (e.g., frequent cloud cover, bad weather, long periods of darkness during winter) and remote locations; timely acquisition of images soon after or during an eruption can assist in the monitoring of active volcanoes. The 23-degrees incidence angle causes strong foreshortening, and there is sometimes up to 35 days between repeat observations of certain locations. However, we conclude that the routine collection of SAR data from ERS-1 can provide valuable rapid information for assessing volcanic hazards in this region whatever the weather or time of year The situation will be improved with the additional use of JERS-1 data and the launch of the Radarsat spacecraft in 1995.

AB Spectral derivative indices were compared with the commonly used near-infrared to red reflectance ratio (NIR/red) and the normalized difference (ND) spectral indices. Two ''windows- of second derivatives, rho''0.69 mum, and rho''0.74 mum, exist in the visible and NIR spectral regions, which can be used to estimate vegetation characteristics such as percent cover and leaf area index (LAI). Second derivatives centered on the red and NIR wavebands (MSS Bands 3 and 4) were calculated using broadband radiometer data for grassland sites which had been previously burned or had been left unburned for several years. The second derivative indices minimized the effect of the soil background differences caused by the prior burning treatments, and clearly showed the advantages of the derivative technique over the conventional NIR/red ratio and ND spectral indices.

ID HIGHLY CORRELATED IMAGES; COLOR ENHANCEMENT; SCANNER; ROCK
AB Decorrelation contrast stretching is an effective method for displaying information from multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) images. The technique involves transformation of the data to principle components ("decorrelation"), independent contrast "stretching" of data from the new "decorrelated" image bands, and retransformation of the stretched data back to the approximate original axes, based on the inverse of the principle component rotation. The enhancement is robust in that colors of the same scene components are similar in enhanced images of similar scenes, or the same scene imaged at different times. Decorrelation contrast stretching is reviewed in the context of other enhancements applied to TIR images.

AB High resolution digital data were collected over an ecologically varied area to determine the extent to which different field data can be used to enhance vegetation mapping through remote sensing. Field data, in the form of tree and shrub densities, and herb frequencies were recorded for 155 vegetation plots at Presqu'ile Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. These field-plot data were analyzed using two-way indicator species cluster analysis (TWIN-SPAN) to produce an hierarchical, ecological classification scheme. A parallel classification scheme was also developed independently using only qualitative field notes. The results of field-plot data classifications were used to produce supervised classifications of Multi-detector Electro-optical Imaging Sensor (MEIS II) airborne digital data recorded in five spectral bands with a 5 m x 5 m spatial resolution. Accuracy assessments show a considerable range in the classification accuracies for different plant communities. In general, the more ecologically/spectrally unique the class is and the lower the species/spectral variations that occur, the higher the classification accuracy. In addition, a qualitative approach to field-plot description produces a more statistically accurate digital classification of MEIS II data than does the detailed quantitative ground information.

AB For the vast majority of oceanographic applications, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data must be preprocessed prior to meaningful analysis (e.g., empirical orthogonal function analysis, frontal analysis). Some of these preprocessing steps include, but are not limited to, land masking and coastline correction. Polygon fill operations and morphological transformations can be effective computational tools for land masking and coastline correction. Collectively, these tools can be used, in conjunction with cloud screening techniques, to isolate the oceanographically relevant portions of a satellite scene prior to analysis. These masking operations also can be used on other oceanographically useful satellite data: Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS); Geostationary Earth Observing Satellite (GOES); and Landsat data. Finally, the sensitivity of the methods to regional variations in atmospheric conditions and land-ocean temperature gradients is assessed using satellite data representative of tropical, mid- and high-latitude regions. These results indicate that polygon fill operations and morphological transformations can be used successfully in many global studies.

TI ESTIMATING THE EXTENT OF FLOODS IN BANGLADESH USING SPOT DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Nine SPOT XS scenes recorded during the dry season (January, February) and after cyclonic storms were analyzed to evaluate both the extent and consequences of floods in Bangladesh, in the deltaic complex of the Ganges.  Digital and visual analysis showed the following results:  1) Near the capital, Dahka, within a SPOT scene (3600 km2), the extent of water varies from 324 km2 during the dry season to 1303 km2 after a destructive flood.  This means that flood-prone areas in this overpopulated deltaic region are at least four times larger than the hydrographic network observed during the dry season.  2) The Sunderbans are the world's largest mangroves (about 6000 km2 in a single block); two-thirds of this forest (4050 km2) are in Bangladesh, and the rest is in India.  These ecosystems seem to resist cyclones.  No sign of any kind of mangrove alteration is seen on SPOT images recorded a few weeks after disastrous cyclonic storms (20 August 1987 and 6 September 1988).
   This is an important fact since the protective role of these coastal swamp forests is tremendously important.  3) The islands located in the very exposed area at the mouth of the Meghna are densely populated (more than 1000 inhabitants/km2).  Hathya island has been carefully surveyed.  According to the investigations carried out on SPOT images (25 February 1987 and 26 October 1988), the island seems to be at present satisfactorily protected against cyclones and tidal surges, behind newly planted mangroves (Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham.) and sheltered by a complex network of embankments which are visible on the images.  It was concluded that the spectral separability of classes (water, natural plant communities, land use suitable for coastal monitoring in this part of the Bangladesh.

TI THE FN METHOD FOR THE ONE-ANGLE RADIATIVE-TRANSFER EQUATION APPLIED TO
   PLANT CANOPIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NEUTRON-TRANSPORT THEORY; SCATTERING; MODEL
AB Solutions of the radiative transfer equation describing photon interactions with vegetation canopies are important in remote sensing since they provide the canopy reflectance distribution required in the interpretation of satellite-acquired information.  Although the most widely used transport models such as the moments formulations collapse the photon directional information into a limited number of directions (usually two or four), the more sophisticated methods such as discrete ordinates can, in principle, employ an unlimited number of discrete directions.  These discrete methods, however, also contain spatial discretization error and lack testing against more accurate numerical formulations for specific vegetation canopy scattering kernels.  In this article, we consider a semianalytical approach to the solution of the one-angle radiative transfer equation in slab geometry called the F(N) method.  This method has as its basis two integral equations specifying the intensities existing the vegetation canopy boundaries.  The solution is then obtained through an expansion in a set of basis functions with expansion coefficients to be determined.  These coefficients are obtained from a collocation procedure resulting in a set of algebraic equations solved by matrix inversion.  The advantage of this method is that only discretization in the angular variable is required, thus avoiding spatial truncation error entirely.  The paper begins by considering a canopy where all the leaves are oriented at the same angle.  Lambertian scattering will be assumed with unequal leaf reflectance and transmittance.  This simple model contains all the difficulties of the more complex model incorporating a general leaf angle distribution which is to be considered in the latter part of the presentation.  A sensitivity analysis is performed including variation of the numerical and model parameters.  In addition, discrete ordinates calculations as well as field measurements are compared to the F(N) results.

TI VEGETATION CANOPY PAR ABSORPTANCE AND THE NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE
   VEGETATION INDEX - AN ASSESSMENT USING THE SAIL MODEL
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

   REFLECTANCE; SPECTRA; INTERCEPTION
AB The SAIL canopy radiative transfer model is employed to examine relations between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) in a herbaceous vegetation canopy. This analysis extends previous work by using a bidirectional canopy radiative transfer model to consider relations between instantaneous NDVI measurements and diurnally integrated canopy APAR capacity. Effective use of periodic, instantaneous remote sensing observations in landscape process studies depends on stable estimation of diurnally integrated conditions. The results from this analysis show that instantaneous NDVI measurements provide a stable and near-linear estimate of vegetation canopy diurnal APAR capacity, as long as the remotely sensed observations are taken when the solar zenith angle is above 60-degrees and the sensor views within 40-degrees from nadir. The direct/diffuse ratio of incident radiance produces little variance in the relation. Variations in canopy optical properties and architecture, as well as background spectral reflectance, also cause deviations in the APAR/NDVI relation, with background spectral reflectance properties producing the largest effect. The practical significance of this landscape variability in remotely sensed APAR assessment is uncertain. Remote sensing observation strategies are explored which might be used to evaluate and ultimately overcome the influence of landscape variance in APAR assessment. The capacity of periodic, instantaneous remotely sensed observations to characterize the diurnally integrated APAR in vegetation canopies appears resonable within the constraints noted.

TI SUGAR MAPLE DECLINE ASSESSMENT BASED ON SPECTRAL AND TEXTURAL ANALYSIS
   OF MULTISPECTRAL AERIAL VIDEOGRAPHY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an application of digital airborne multispectral videography in sugar maple decline assessment.  Large scale four-band video imagery of several test plots located in sugar maple stands was acquired using a four-camera video system.  Various spectral and texture features were computed for individual trees selected from the video data within and around two of the test plots.  The features included principal components, a band ratio, and first-order and second-order texture transforms.  They were evaluated through correlation with results of color/color IR photographic interpretation of decline for the same trees.  The most significant features were selected to form a numerical maple decline index model, which was then applied to evaluate decline of trees in all test plots.  The results agreed well with results from ground surveys.  The combination of spectral and textural analysis of aerial multispectral video imagery is an objective, quantitative, and inexpensive means for maple decline assessment on a single tree basis.  It provides comparative information on tree health and can serve as an alternative or complementary technique to conventional photography and ground surveys.

TI THE ASSESSMENT OF REGIONAL CROP WATER CONDITIONS FROM METEOROLOGICAL
   SATELLITE THERMAL INFRARED DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

ID SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; IR DATA; DAILY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; NOAA-AVHRR;
   EVAPORATION; RAINFALL; IMAGES
AB Meteorological satellites (mainly NOAA AVHRR) have been extensively used these last years to monitor vegetation and crop conditions on a regional scale, using vegetation index NDVI data.  Recent work with Nimbus-7 passive microwave measurements has also shown the complementary potential of that spectral domain.  On the other hand, the thermal infrared channels, in spite of their well-known ability to detect water stress (as established by ground studies at a local scale), are less studied for the same purpose of long-term monitoring.  This paper intends to demonstrate their capabilities in assessing crop water conditions on a regional scale and estimating the actual evapotranspiration (ET) to be used in agrometerological models.  A brief analysis of past studies justifies the use of the cumulative SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) (difference between the midafternoon surface temperature by satellite and the maximum air temperature obtained from the meterological ground network), named stress-degree-day by Jackson et al. (1977) which may be related to ET by a simplified linear relationship.  This criterion, already tested in Sahelian regions (Seguin et al., 1989), is applied to France on a large scale, corresponding to the entire country, using 5-day syntheses from Meteosat, calibrated by NOAA AVHRR on selected dates, for 3 years (1985-1987).  Values of SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) may be considered as climatological data.  They reveal both spatial differences in regional climates and the main features of each year.  The use of the linear relationship, derived from ET values computed from a coupled energy budget-water balance model, allows one to estimate and map regional evaporation on a monthly to 6-month time basis.  The variations obtained along a latitudinal transect display the relations between ET and potential evapotranspiration (PET), also leading to an indirect estimation of PET from remote sensing data.  SIGMA-(T(s) - T(a)) / R(n) is proposed as an index of regional water stress, which may be derived from satellite data and appears as complementary to the intergrated NDVI, with the advantage of a more physically established relationship with ET.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Timely and reliable land-use maps are of great importance in urban planning and environmental monitoring. With the rich spatial structure information, very high resolution (VHR) imagery is an important data source for identifying complex urban land use. However, the existing scene datasets and land-use mapping products based on VHR images have the following three problems: 1) accurate geographic boundaries of urban land parcels are lacking; 2) the category systems are inconsistent with the definitions in urban land use; and 3) it is difficult to achieve efficient and fully automated mapping in multiple cities. To tackle these problems, the GlobalUrbanNetbased automatic multi-city mapping and analysis (GAMMA) framework is proposed in this article. The GAMMA framework is made up of the GlobalUrbanNet (GUN) dataset, the multi-city fully automatic urban land-use mapping (AutoULUM) method, and the analysis of urban development patterns. Specifically, the large-scale 42-category fine-grained VHR urban land-use dataset-the GUN dataset-was constructed to deal with the above global urban land-use mapping problems, which contains 1,846,151 samples and 42 land-use categories covering six continents. The GUN dataset samples with land-use semantics and parcel boundaries were generated automatically based on the open-source area of interest (AOI) data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). In addition, the AutoULUM method is proposed to automate the process of OSM road network rectification and land parcel generation. On this basis, efficient and complete multi-city land-use maps can be produced using the GUNpretrained scene classification models. To establish a benchmark for urban land-use classification, the representative urban land-use classification methods were evaluated on the GUN dataset. For further application, eight megacities from six continents were selected for automatic land-use mapping and analysis, i.e., Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu in Asia, Helsinki in Europe, Nairobi in Africa, New York in North America, Rio de Janeiro in South America, and Sydney in Oceania. The results show that the models trained on the proposed GUN dataset have good generalizability in global urban areas, the AutoULUM method achieves efficient and fully automatic land-use mapping, and the GAMMA framework will help boost the coordinated development of multiple cities around the world.

AB Crop phenology has been widely detected from multiple historical satellite observations. Conversely, Near-Real-Time (NRT) monitoring of crop progress from timely available remote sensing data is barely investigated because of the lack of high-frequency cloud-free satellite observations and future potential crop development. To address the challenge, this study proposes a novel algorithm for operational NRT monitoring of crop progress at the field scale. This algorithm first fuses the high spatial resolution (30 m) Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and the high temporal frequent (10 min) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) observations to generate cloud-free time series of HLS-ABI EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) with a Spatiotemporal Shape-Matching Model (SSMM). It then predicts future potential EVI2 values at a given pixel using a reference EVI2 time series obtained from the neighboring pixels in the preceding year. Integrating the currently available HLS-ABI observations and the predicted future EVI2 values to generate annual EVI2 time series, the algorithm finally detects six crop phenometrics including greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset. The NRT monitoring, which are separated as near-real-time prediction (phenological event detected after the occurrence), real-time prediction (phenological event detected around the occurrence), and short-term prediction (phenological event detected before the occurrence), are continuously updated and improved with new HLS and ABI observations at a weekly basis throughout the growing season. We evaluate the NRT monitoring against standard phenology products, PhenoCam observations, as well as the weekly Crop Progress Reports (CPRs) released from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2020 across Iowa. The evaluation demonstrates the robustness of the developed algorithm in NRT monitoring of crop phenology. Although the uncertainties are relatively large for short-term prediction compared with standard detections, the real-time prediction shows that the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) is <10 days for greenup and dormancy onset, and similar to 5 days in the other four phenometrics. Further, the real-time prediction aligns well with PhenoCam observations (R-2 = 0.96, P < 0.001) with a MAD of 7.8 days. Moreover, the HLS-ABI real-time prediction of crop phenometrics is capable of tracking NASS crop progress closely with small time shifts (<= 5 days) and significant correlations (R-2 > 0.85, P < 0.001) for various phenological stages of corn and soybean. These results prove that the algorithm could be implemented for NRT monitoring of various crop phenometrics from field, state, to national scales.

AB Soil moisture is an important variable controlling many land surface processes and is used to quantify precipitation, drought, flooding, irrigation and other factors that influence decision making and risk-assessment. This paper presents the retrieval of high resolution (-1 km) soil moisture data from Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter measurements using a new bistatic radiative transfer modeling framework (RT1) previously only tested for scatterometer data. The model is applied over a diverse set of landcover types across the entire Po-Valley in Italy over a 4-year time-period from 2016 to 2019. The performance of the soil moisture retrievals is analyzed with respect to the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. The model parameterisation and retrieval method are chosen such as to constitute a trade-off between a physically plausible and a computationally feasible modeling approach. The results demonstrate the potential of RT1 for the retrieval of high-resolution soil moisture data from SAR time series.

AB Three volcanic plumes were detected during the Tajogaite volcano eruptive activity (Canary Islands, Spain, September-December 2021) over the Iberian Peninsula. The spatiotemporal evolution of these events is char-acterised by combining passive satellite remote sensing and ground-based lidar and sun-photometer systems. The inversion algorithm GRASP is used with a suite of ground-based remote sensing instruments such as lidar/ ceilometer and sun-photometer from eight sites at different locations throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Satellite observations showed that the volcanic ash plumes remained nearby the Canary Islands covering a mean area of 120 & PLUSMN; 202 km2 during the whole period of eruptive activity and that sulphur dioxide plumes reached the Iberian Peninsula. Remote sensing observations showed that the three events were mainly composed of sulphates, which were transported from the volcano into the free troposphere. The high backscatter-related & ANGS;ngstro & BULL;m exponents for wavelengths 532-1064 nm (1.17 & PLUSMN; 0.20 to 1.40 & PLUSMN; 0.24) and low particle depolarization ratios (0.08 & PLUSMN; 0.02 to 0.09 & PLUSMN; 0.02), measured by the multi-wavelength Raman lidar, hinted at the presence of spherical small particles. The layer aerosol optical depth at 532 nm (AODL532) obtained from lidar measurements contributed between 49% and 82% to the AERONET total column AOD at 532 nm in event II (11-13 October). According to the GRASP retrievals, the layer aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AODL440) was higher in all sites during event II with values between 0.097 (Badajoz) and 0.233 (Guadiana-UGR) and lower in event III (19-21 October) varying between 0.003 (Granada) and 0.026 (& PRIME;Evora). Compared with the GRASP retrievals of total column AOD at 440 nm, the AODL440 had contributions between 21% and 52% during event II. In the event I (25-28 September), the mean volume concentrations (VC) varied between 5 & PLUSMN; 4 & mu;m3cm  3 (El-Arenosillo/Huelva) and 17 & PLUSMN; 10 & mu;m3cm  3 (Guadiana-UGR), while in event II this variation was from 11 & PLUSMN; 7 & mu;m3cm- 3 (Badajoz) to 27 & PLUSMN; 10 & mu;m3cm- 3 (Guadiana-UGR). Due to the impact of volcanic events on atmospheric and economic fields, such as radiative forcing and airspace security, a proper characterization is required. This work undertakes it using advanced instrumentation and methods.

AB Passive microwave observation at multiple frequencies has received increasing research interests due to its capability to provide comprehensive information of land surface properties. This paper contributes to the simulation of land surface emission and estimation of vegetation optical depth (VOD) at multiple frequencies using a discrete scattering model with a single set of model parameter values. Validity of the Tor Vergata (TVG) discrete scattering model in simultaneously reproducing the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) C-(6.925 GHz) and X-band (10.7 GHz) ob-servations over the Tibetan grassland ecosystem is evaluated. Frequency-specific and multi-frequency calibration strategies are implemented to find the suitable set of model parameter values and to isolate the impact of fre-quency on parameter values. On this basis, the calibrated TVG model is further used to estimate the VOD, and to investigate the impact of microwave frequency and observation angle on the emission simulations and VOD parameterization.The results show that both frequency-specific and multi-frequency calibration strategies achieve comparable and reasonable simulations of SMAP and AMSR2 observations, confirming the feasibility of using an identical physically-based model (i.e. the calibrated TVG model) to simulate multi-frequency land emission driven by a single set of model parameter values. As such, the dependence of emission components and VOD on frequency can be elaborated after isolating the impact of frequency on parameter values. The VOD values derived from the TVG simulations generally increase with increasing frequency and can be linearly correlated to the LAI varia-tions, while current satellite-based retrievals have almost the same magnitude at the L-, C-, and X-band. The explanation for this can be that the retrieved VOD is different from the theoretical definition. Sensitivity test performed using the calibrated TVG model further shows that polarization-dependence of VOD becomes more apparent with the increasing observation angle and frequency. New parameterization has thus been developed to characterize the dependence of VOD on the frequency, observation angle, and polarization for grassland based on the results of sensitivity test. This study may provide new insights in improving model of land emission and retrievals of SM and VOD with physical interpretability based on multi-frequency satellite observations.

AB Soil moisture (SM) plays a significant role in water, energy, and carbon cycles, and is a key variable related to multiple sustainable development goals. The frequent occurrence of extreme events in the 21st century complicates the understanding of terrestrial SM change and its drivers under diverse environmental conditions, particularly in the global scope. Here we globally explored the spatial-temporal trend of satellite-based SM (ESA CCI SM) and its possible drivers under a variety of environmental factors (land cover, soil texture, terrain, and vegetation coverage) during 2000-2021. Results indicate that global SM has generally declined with a rate of -0.10 x 10-3 m3m- 3 yr- 1 which is mainly dominated by the drying trend of the southern hemisphere. The moisture replenishment role of precipitation dominates in areas with relatively high SM values, and the positive influence of vegetation and precipitation on SM is prominent in regions where SM values are relatively low. But vegetation has a pronounced negative impact on SM north of 60 degrees N and in southeastern China. Compared with precipitation and vegetation, topsoil temperature has less impact on SM globally. Land cover types, soil properties, elevation, and vegetation cover influence SM variability and its response to climate and vegetation to varying degrees. For example, the overall wetting trend of SM is unique under loam soils and high elevations (> 1000 m) in terms of different soil texture and elevations. The increase in vegetation cover within a certain amount is accompanied by the wetting of SM, but in densely vegetated regions such as forests, the water retention effect of vegetation on SM is weakened. An evaluation of 'Dry gets drier, wet gets wetter' (DDWW) paradigm from the SM viewpoint shows the paradigm summarizes 41.06% of areas with significant SM changes. Precipitation replenishment and vegetation water retention profoundly impact the 'wet gets wetter' and 'dry gets wetter' patterns. Temperature is a strong influencing factor of the 'wet gets drier' pattern, while the reduction of vegetation and precipitation jointly affect the 'dry gets drier' pattern. These findings can deepen the understanding of SM changes in relation to climate, ecology, and land surface features, particularly in the 21st century with profound changes of the environment.

AB Maize (Zea mays), the second most-produced crop worldwide, serves as the cornerstone for global food security and human livelihood. Early-season maize mapping benefits maize production forecasting and other pre-harvest decision-making applications. However, most existing early-season mapping efforts rely heavily on either the current-year or historical crop labels to train classifiers, limiting the potential applications to new regions lacking crop labels. To explore the possibility of maize mapping only using satellite data in the early season, we proposed a Multi-temporal Gaussian Mixture Model (MGMM) to map maize planting areas without any crop labels. A chlorophyll content relevant proxy, named the Red-edge position (REP), was selected as model input, based on the truth that summer maize tends to show a higher chlorophyll content than other summer crops (e.g., soybean, cotton, peanut, sunflowers, etc.) in the peak season. The novel early-season mapping framework using the REP-based MGMM (MGMM-REP) was applied in four diverse areas (Iowa and Georgia in the US, Heilongjiang province (HLJ) in China, and Grand-Est in France). The MGMM-REP could generate maize maps more than two months before harvest with reasonable accuracy (F1 >= 77%) using all the available Sentinel-2 (S2) images and the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). Our early-season maps agreed well with the existing crop maps and official statistics. The correlation coefficient (R) of the maize acreage between our early-season maps and sta-tistics was higher than 0.94. The high inter-class difference of REP between maize and other summer crops could increase the F1 score by 2-47% compared to the other commonly used Vegetation indices (VIs). Since MGMM-REP does not rely on crop labels, it had the potential to be transferred to label-scarce maize-cropped regions and contribute to the international commodity trade and food security forecast.

AB When probability samples are not available, the model-based framework may be the only option for constructing inferences in the form of prediction intervals for population means. Further, for machine learning and some non-parametric and nonlinear regression prediction techniques, resampling methods such as the bootstrap may be the only option for obtaining the standard errors necessary for constructing those prediction intervals.All bootstrap approaches entail repeatedly sampling from the original sample, estimating the parameter of interest for each replication, and estimating the standard error of the estimate of the parameter as the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates over replications. The objective of the study was to develop a procedure for terminating resampling such that the resulting number of replications assures, at least in probability, that the estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the standard error corresponding to one million replications. The analyses used a variety of datasets: five forest inventory datasets with either volume or aboveground biomass as the dependent variable and metrics from either airborne laser scanning or Landsat as independent variables, three from Europe, one from Southwest Asia, and one from Africa; and two forest/non-forest versus Landsat datasets, one from Minnesota and one from Wisconsin, both in the USA. The primary contribution of the study was development and demonstration of a procedure that specifies criteria for terminating resampling that assure in probability that the bootstrap estimate of the standard error stabilizes to the estimate obtained with one million replications.

TI Mapping retrogressive thaw slumps using deep neural networks

   sensing; Deep learning; Arctic
AB Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are thermokarst features in ice-rich hillslope permafrost terrain, and their occurrence in the warming Arctic is increasingly frequent and has caused dynamic changes to the landscape. RTS can significantly impact permafrost stability and generate substantial carbon emissions. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of RTS is a critical step to understanding and modelling greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost thaw. Mapping RTS using conventional Earth observation approaches is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature and often small scale of RTS in the Arctic. In this study, we trained deep neural network models to map RTS across several landscapes in Siberia and Canada. Convolutional neural networks were trained with 965 RTS features, where 509 were from the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas in Siberia, and 456 from six other pan-Arctic regions including Canada and Northeastern Siberia. We further tested the impact of negative data on the model performance. We used 4-m Maxar commercial imagery as the base map, 10-m NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 and 2-m elevation data from the ArcticDEM as model inputs and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance training. The best-performing model reached a validation Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.74 and a test IoU score of 0.71. Compared to past efforts to map RTS features, this represents one of the best-performing models and generalises well for mapping RTS in different permafrost regions, representing a critical step towards pan-Arctic deployment. The predicted RTS matched very well with the ground truth labels visually. We also tested how model performance varied across different regional contexts. The result shows an overall positive impact on the model performance when data from different regions were incorporated into the training. We propose this method as an effective, accurate and computationally undemanding approach for RTS mapping.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have severe environmental and economic impacts worldwide. Improving HAB detection is crucial because massive blooms are likely to increase in both frequency and amplitude in the next decades due to global warming and escalating coastal eutrophication. While satellite remote sensing has proved useful to detect red tides and support HAB monitoring, the discrimination of the dominant bloom-forming species is still a challenge, all the more as the observation of highly concentrated phytoplankton patches can be hampered by a too coarse spatial resolution. Moreover, the majority of HAB studies generally had a regional focus, and a limited number of species were separately documented so far. Here, we provide a broader perspective for red tides remote sensing to better resolve HAB optical and taxonomical diversity. The main objective of the present study was to identify how many optical bloom types could be recognized with the high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission. For that purpose, an extensive database of massive, nearly monospecific blooms, both documented in situ and using synchronous S2 observation was compiled. More than 100 S2 images of various red tides were selected worldwide. Altogether, the S2 database covered the typical reflectance spectra of 27 red tide forming species. The remote-sensing reflectance of each red tide was analysed to evaluate S2 ability to distinguish the dominant species of the bloom. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that six optical bloom types could be identified: (1) surface accumulation of cyanobacteria or of green Noctiluca scintillans, (2) surface accumulation of red N. scintillans (a purely heterotrophic plankton devoid of chlorophyll a), (3) red tides of Mesodinium rubrum (a phycoerythrin-bearing ciliate), (4) green seawater discolorations of Lepidodinium chlorophorum (a dinoflagellate with unusual carotenoids), (5) blooms dominated by a dinoflagellate such as Prorocentrum, Gymnodinium, Lingulodinium polyedra, Gonyaulax or Alexandrium, and (6) brown tides dominated by a dinoflagellate (such as Karenia, Karlodinium veneficum, Protoceratium reticulatum, Margalefidinium polykrikoides, or Tripos fusus), a prymnesiophyte (Phaeocystis), or a pelagophyte (Aureococcus anophagefferens). While the results presented here are inherently limited by the concomitant availability of in situ and S2 observations, as well as by S2 spectral resolution, it is a step forward to an improved understanding of HAB bio-optical diversity.

AB Atmospheric humidity and temperature are the two most important geophysical variables for numerical weather forecasting and relevant Earth studies, contributing to the reduction of over 60% forecast errors. Conventional large satellite microwave radiometers provide the primary sounding data of moisture and temperature, with the V-band (near 50 GHz) and G-band (near 183 GHz) as the main spectra. In recent years, CubeSats are rapidly developing with compact sizes, novel designs, and low cost. The NASA TROPICS is an ongoing CubeSat constellation mission for studying tropical meteorology and storm systems, with the first Pathfinder satellite launched on 30 June 2021, which will provide a median revisit rate better than 60 min. TROPICS has innovative channels at F-band (near 118 GHz) and 205 GHz, providing a new perspective for atmospheric sounding. In this study, we have extended the NOAA MiRS system and applied it to TROPICS Pathfinder early-phase, provisionally calibrated data, focusing on moisture and temperature. We have examined the retrieval quality and compared with the ECMWF analysis and MiRS retrievals from NOAA-20 ATMS. An experiment of subsetting ATMS to match up with TROPICS channels is also conducted. Here we focus on atmospheric humidity and temperature retrievals, since they are of primary importance for microwave sounders and is tied to the core of the TROPICS mission along with precipitation retrieval. Compared to traditional channels, TROPICS F-band and 205 GHz provide new information content with distinct sensitivity to moisture and hydrometeors, showing for example over 20 K larger dynamic range of brightness temperature at 205 GHz compared to 190 GHz. The retrieved total precip-itable water compared to ECMWF has a correlation coefficient of 0.955, 0.985, and 0.977 for TROPICS, ATMS, and ATMS subset, respectively. For water vapor profile, the standard deviation of retrieval to ECMWF is 0.93, 0.76, and 0.80 g/kg for the three experiments, respectively, and regarding temperature, it is 2.5, 1.5, and 1.6 K, respectively. The retrieval shows dependence on surface type and clouds, where land and cloudy conditions degrade retrieval compared to ocean and clear condition. The early performance is promising, and the successful MiRS extension paves the way to explore improved data when the calibration validation is complete and from the forthcoming constellation.

TI Multi-sensor airborne lidar requires intercalibration for consistent
   estimation of light attenuation and plant area density

AB Leaf area is a key structural characteristic of forest canopies because of the role of leaves in controlling many biological and physical processes occurring at the biosphere-atmosphere transition. High pulse density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) holds promise to provide spatially resolved and accurate estimates of plant area density (PAD) in forested landscapes, a key step in understanding forest functioning: phenology, carbon uptake, transpiration, radiative balance etc. Inconsistencies between different ALS sensors is a barrier to generating globally harmonised PAD estimates. The basic assumption on which PAD estimation is based is that light attenuation is proportional to vegetation area density. This study shows that the recorded extinction strongly depends on target detectability which is influenced by laser characteristics (power, sensitivity, wavelength). Three different airborne laser scanners were flown over a wet tropical forest at the Paracou research station in French Guiana. Different sensors, flight heights and transmitted power levels were compared. Light attenuation was retrieved with an open source ray-tracing code (http://amapvox.org). Direct comparison revealed marked differences (upto 25% difference in profile-averaged light attenuation rate and 50% difference at particular heights) that could only be explained by differences in scanner characteristics. We show how bias which may occur under various acquisition conditions can generally be mitigated by a sensor intercalibration. Alignment of light weight lidar attenuation profiles to ALS reference attenuation profiles is not always satisfactory and we discuss what are the likely sources of discrepancies. Neglecting the dependency of apparent light attenuation on scanner properties may lead to biases in estimated vegetation density commensurate to those affecting light attenuation estimates. Applying intercalibration procedures supports estimation of plant area density independent of acquisition characteristics.

AB Characterizing error structures in precipitation products not only facilitates their proper applications for scientific and practical purposes but also helps improve their retrieval algorithms and processing methods. Despite the fact that multiple precipitation products have been assessed in the literature, factors that affect their error structures remain inadequately addressed. By interpreting 60 binary decision trees, this study disentangles the error characteristics of precipitation products in terms of their spatiotemporal patterns and geographical factors. Three independent precipitation products - two satellite-based and one reanalysis datasets: the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) late run (IMERG-L), Soil Moisture to RainAdvanced SCATterometer (SM2RAIN-ASCAT), and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 uncorrected precipitation output (MERRA2-UC), are evaluated across the contiguous United States from 2010 to 2019. The ground-based Stage IV precipitation dataset is used as the ground truth. Results indicate that the MERRA2-UC outperforms the IMERG-L and SM2RAIN-ASCAT with higher accuracy and more stable interannual patterns for the analysis period. Decision trees cross-assess three spatiotemporal factors and find that the underestimation of MERRA2-UC occurs in the east of the Rocky Mountains, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT underestimates precipitation over high latitudes, especially in winter. Additionally, the decision tree method ascribes system errors to nine different geographical characteristics, of which the distance to the coast, soil type, and DEM are the three dominant features. On the other hand, the land cover type, topography position index, and aspect are three relatively weak factors.

AB Flow regime changes of Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (IRES) can serve as an indicator under global warming, yet the distribution of IRES is rarely extracted at the alpine catchment scale due to their narrow water surface and the heavy cloud contamination on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, a new two-stage method using the deep learning model is proposed for Mapping alpine IRES from Sentinel-1 time series and Digital elevation models (MISD). Firstly, the median images of cross-orbits double-periods (i.e., the flowing period and the drying-up period of alpine IRES) Sentinel-1 time series are input to the deep learning model to synoptically extract alpine IRES in mixed pixels under the heavy cloud contamination. Secondly, the deep learning-based output is corrected by the critical drainage accumulation derived from digital elevation models to remove the disturbance of the non-channelized overland flow on upland. The MISD method was first applied to an alpine catchment, namely the Duodigou Catchment, and then was assessed in the whole Lhasa River Basin. The results showed that the application of cross-orbits double-periods Sentinel-1 time series in the deep learning model is helpful in handling the mixed-pixel problem. And the critical drainage accumulation correction further improves the deep learning-based output with F2 (the metric that measures precision and recall of model) and the median Euclidean distance error of 0.72 and 64.0 m, respectively. Subsequently, the newly proposed MISD method outperforms other river extraction methods in alpine IRES mapping with higher F2 (increased by 0.5) and lower median Euclidean distance error (decreased by 145.7 m). Moreover, the MISD method is characterized by the capability for detecting narrower or lower flow IRES with river width > 1.7 m and discharge >2 L/s, which is significantly ignored in the current global water products. Furthermore, the MISD method successfully recognizes most of the channelized IRES from permanent rivers in the whole Lhasa River Basin through essential training. Therefore, the MISD method is a powerful tool for monitoring the changes of IRES induced by the glacier retreats or the permafrost degradation, etc., on the warming Tibetan Plateau.

AB Near-real-time precipitation estimates based on geostationary meteorological satellites are of great importance for monitoring hydrology-related disasters. Currently, the contributions of multispectral infrared observations to precipitation estimation have not been fully understood thus far. Motivated by estimating precipitation based on real-time data from geostationary satellites, this study proposes the Precipitation Estimation using Chromato-graphic Analysis (PECA) methodology based on full-disc observations from Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) of FengYun-4A (FY-4A). Compared with PERSIANN-CCS and FY4AQPE-Official, the results of PECA (PECA-FY4A) are comprehensively evaluated against the GSOD (global gauge data), CMS (Chinese gauge data) and IMERG-LR (micro-wave precipitation products) for the period from January, 2019 to November, 2021. The findings and conclusions mainly include but are not limited to the following: (1) PECA clearly reveals that T12, Delta T10_ 14, Delta T7_ 14, and Delta T7_ 8 are effective for estimating precipitation volumes, with strong correlation to precipitation volumes but significantly less redundant information. (2) IR band differences are still sensitive to heavy precipitation although the abilities of single IR bands have become insufficient. For example, Delta T7_8 are sensitive to heavy precipitation in the eye walls of the typhoons. (3) The evaluation results show that PERSIANN-CCS generally outperforms FY4AQPE-Official, while PECA-FY4A features significant improvements over PERSIANN-CCS (the international benchmark of IR precipitation products) in terms of CC (-10%,-100%, and -21%), RMSE (-20%,-36%, and -11%), and CSI (-25%,-100%, and -12%) against IMERG-LR, CMS and GSOD, respectively. The findings are expected to considerably contribute towards extending the current three-geostationary-satellite-series network (GOES, Meteosat, and Himawari) in PERSIANN-CCS to a four-geostationary-satellite-series network (by adding FY-4A and FY-4B) using PECA with higher quality, especially over the Asia-Pacific areas.

AB Cloud detection is a crucial step in the optical satellite image processing pipeline for Earth observation. Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images ( "S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue " dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors.

AB The mapping of sugarcane plantations and their changes is relevant to the economy and the environment, notably due to sugarcane's interface in the biofuel industry through ethanol. The necessary mapping of sugar-cane crop changes is especially challenging when plantation occurs under smallholders' land ownership struc-tures used for heterogeneous crop management. We evaluated two approaches to address this challenge with the example of sugarcane abandonment in the Norte Fluminense Region, Northeastern Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The region is characterized by a large share of smallholders. We trained a random forest classifier for sugarcane for 2018 based on all available Landsat imagery. Based on the concept of temporal generalization, we applied the classifier trained in 2018 for the period from 1986 until 2020. The resulting annual sugarcane probability maps were used as input for two abandonment mapping methods: LandtrendR and muti-temporal cropland aban-donment mapping. The performance of both approaches was evaluated based on a stratified sampling approach. We detected three distinct trajectories for sugarcane farmland: i) permanently abandoned sugarcane, ii) fallow sugarcane, and iii) and stable sugarcane. The multi-temporal cropland abandonment mapping performed better for the sugarcane abandonment class (F1 = 0.84) than the LandtrendR approach (F1 = 0.21). The LandtrendR results revealed a higher omission (PA = 0.12) in mapping the sugarcane abandonment class. For the multi -temporal cropland abandonment mapping, we found that 66% (67,353 ha) of the stable sugarcane areas were abandoned between 1990 and 2016. The highest abandonment rates occurred between 1990 and 1994 and between 2010 and 2016. The spatial distribution of abandonment was heterogeneous. The earliest abandonment was concentrated in the northern part of the study area. The most recent abandonment was more extensive in the southern part of the study site. Our results highlight the advantages and challenges of using Landsat time series to map sugarcane abandonment in a heterogeneous management system. Our results also highlight the spatially and temporal heterogeneous pattern of sugarcane abandonment in the region and provide the necessary database for subsequent studies to identify underlying and proximate causes for the abandonment.

AB Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy.

AB Validation of the hot-spot theoretical model was carried out with extensive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements in the Jarvselja RAMI pine stand. A 120 m x 120 m x 12 m point cloud of laser hits of 1 cm resolution was built to describe the spatial structure of the crown layer. From this point cloud, foliage density was found at 1 dm resolution, and a Fourier analysis of the spatial structure of the crown layer was performed. The autocorrelation function of the transmittance of 1 dm slices of the crown layer, which controls the hot-spot profile of directional reflectance, was estimated directly from the point cloud. The determined value of the hotspot parameter was found to agree well with the value estimated indirectly from the measurements of reflectance profile in the principal plane.

AB For better use of well-performed water quality parameter estimation models and the comprehensive use of multisource remote sensing data, hyperspectral reconstruction is urgently needed in the remote sensing of optically complex inland waters. In this study, we proposed a bio-optical-based hyperspectral reconstruction (BBHR) algorithm to generate hyperspectral above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) data ranging in wavelength from 400 to 800 nm. One core advantage of the BBHR method is its in situ data independency, which theoretically renders the algorithm universal. The other advantage is its ability to reconstruct hyperspectral Rrs for the 400-800 nm spectral range, which facilitates the construction of more high accuracy chlorophyll-a concentration (Cchla) estimation models for optically complex waters. The reconstruction was tested by employing six widely used multispectral sensors: the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, (MERIS), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (S3 OLCI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2 MSI), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The model performance was validated by using a ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer-measured hyperspectral dataset containing 1396 samples and a satellite-in-situ match-up dataset with 66 samples. The results show that the proposed BBHR method exhibits satisfactory performance. The average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), R2 and bias indices of the BBHR-reconstructed Rrs over all spectral bands of the six multispectral sensors were 3.27%, 8.86 x 10-4 sr-1, 0.98, and - 6.53 x 10-5 sr-1, respectively. In the field Cchla estimation experiment that contained 391 samples (mean Cchla is 25.42 +/- 16.37 mu g/L), the BBHR algorithm improved the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral data from 0.47 and 12.80 mu g/L to 0.42 and 10.16 mu g/L, respectively. For the satellite image match-up dataset (66 samples), the BBHR method decreased the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral images from 0.51 and 12.94 mu g/L to 0.32 and 8.01 mu g/L, respectively. The proposed algorithm outperformed the other two high-accuracy models in terms of spectral fidelity and Cchla estimation. In addition, the BBHR method shows great potential for the multi-source monitoring of inland water bodies. This could improve the accuracy and robustness of the reconstruction when semi-synchronized multi-source data are input and increase the consistency of multi-source data when non-synchronized multisource data are provided. Our results revealed that BBHR is a trustworthy algorithm that offers hyperspectral Rrs data and facilitates the remote monitoring of turbid inland waterbodies.

AB In recent decades, nighttime light (NTL) images have been widely explored to portray human footprints. Most of the studies used monthly or yearly temporal composite NTL products as a solution for invalid observations due to cloud coverage and outlier signals. However, the impact of temporal compositing on NTL data and its applications remains largely unclear. Here, we utilized over 180,000 daily NTL tiles from NASA's Black Marble VIIRS product (VNP46A2, 2012-2020), covering 230 cities from China and the United States, to delve into the influence of temporal compositing on valid pixel coverage and spatiotemporal pattern of NTL data and the performance of three representative types of NTL-based applications. Our analysis showed temporal compositing was an imperative and efficient solution to the prevailing invalid observations. On average a 16-day composite was required to ensure at least 95% of valid pixel coverage for a city, where a longer composite period was needed for cities in a pluvial temperate climate zone. Compositing daily NTL data into a 3-day to 31-day period markedly reduced its spatiotemporal variation and incurred a 3-9 nWatts/cm2/sr, or 22%-37%, absolute difference in NTL magnitude, which was particularly high in developed cities and intra-city areas. We attributed such effect to the number of valid observations available for generating the composite data and the extremely high variation in daily NTL stemmed from human activities, as well as the uncertainties in VNP46 product and VIIRS instrument. The impact of temporal compositing on NTL-based applications varied greatly, from insignificant to very sensitive, across application types and spaces. Our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the capability and uncertainties in NTL data processing and applications, facilitating end-users to make the best use of NTL observations in high temporal frequency.

AB Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere. CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16 and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92 before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low confidence (19.2% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km, Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96% of the estimates are within 2 km of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance, cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate, although all input features have positive impact on the estimate accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud optical depth [COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded. Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of 1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian, CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65% of cloudy pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived from ABI measurements using this methodology.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a terrestrial essential climate variable that is required in a variety of ecosystem and climate models. The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product has been widely used, but its current version (V5) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has several limitations, such as frequent temporal fluctuation, large data gaps, high dependence on the quality of surface reflectance, and low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep learning model to generate a new version of the LAI product (V6) at 250-m resolution from MODIS data from 2000 onward. Unlike most existing algorithms that estimate one LAI value at one time for each pixel, this model estimates LAI for 2 years simultaneously. Three widely used LAI products (MODIS C6, GLASS V5, and PROBA-V V1) are used to generate global representative time-series LAI training samples using K-means clustering analysis and least difference criteria. We explore four machine learning models, the general regression neural network (GRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and identify Bi-LSTM as the best model for product generation. This new product is directly validated using 79 high-resolution LAI reference maps from three in situ observation networks. The results show that GLASS V6 LAI achieves higher accuracy, with a root mean square (RMSE) of 0.92 at 250 m and 0.86 at 500 m, while the RMSE is 0.98 for PROBA-V at 300 m, 1.08 for GLASS V5, and 0.95 for MODIS C6 both at 500 m. Spatial and temporal consistency analyses also demonstrate that the GLASS V6 LAI product is more spatiotemporally continuous and has higher quality in terms of presenting more realistic temporal LAI dynamics when the surface reflectance is absent for a long period owing to persistent cloud/aerosol contaminations. The results indicate that the new Bi-LSTM deep learning model runs significantly faster than the GLASS V5 algorithm, avoids the reconstruction of surface reflectance data, and is resistant to the noises (cloud and snow contamination) or missing values contained in surface reflectance than other methods, as the Bi-LSTM can effectively extract information across the entire time series of surface reflectance rather than a single time point. To our knowledge, this is the first global time-series LAI product at the 250-m spatial resolution that is freely available to the public (www.geodata.cn and www.glass.umd.edu).

AB Timely monitoring of above-ground biomass (AGB) is essential for indicating the crop growth status and pre-dicting grain yield and carbon dynamics. Non-destructive remote sensing techniques with a large spatial coverage have become a promising method for crop biomass monitoring. However, most existing crop biomass models have only been tested at a single growth stage or only at a small number of growth stages at a single location. This has limited the ability of these AGB models to be transferred spatially, to other fields or regions, to predict AGB at any growth stage during the season, or to be potentially used with data from other sensing systems. Here, a new crop biomass algorithm (CBA-Wheat) was developed to estimate AGB over the entire growing season. It uses information on the crop growth stage, based on phenological scale observations (Zadoks scale or ZS), the day of the year or thermal indices (growing degree days), to correct AGB estimations from remotely sensed vegetation indices. The model transferability was evaluated across multiple regional test sites and different data sources (UAV and hand-held spectroscopic data). Results showed that the coefficient values [slope (k) and intercept (b)] of ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) of AGB with vegetation indices had a strong relationship with ZS. These k and b relationships were used to correct the OLSR model parameters based on the observed phenological stage (ZS value). The two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was the best vegetation index for predicting AGB with the new CBA-WheatZS model, with R-2 and RMSE values of 0.83 and 2.07 t/ha for an experimental trial site, 0.78 and 2.05 t/ha for multiple independent regional test sites, and 0.69 and 1.87 t/ha when transferred to EVI2 derived from UAV. Model performance was lower with the day of the year and thermal index corrections; however, the use of relative growing degree-days (RGS; CBA-WheatRGS), instead of ZS information, to adjust the model parameters showed a high consistency with the CBA-WheatZS model, and a good potential for estimation of AGB at regional scales without the need for local phenological observations. The CBA-WheatRGS had validated R-2 and RMSE values of 0.82 and 2.01 t/ha for the experimental trial site, 0.76 and 2.39 t/ha for multiple independent regional test sites, and 0.66 and 2.14 t/ha for UAV hyperspectral imagery. These results demonstrated a good potential to estimate biomass from remotely sensed imagery at varying spatio-temporal scales in winter wheat.

AB Field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for monitoring leaf functional traits in situ, but it remains unclear whether universal statistical models can be developed to predict traits from spectral information, or whether recalibration is necessary as conditions vary. In particular, multiple leaf traits vary simultaneously across growing seasons, and it is an open question whether these temporal changes can be predicted successfully from hyperspectral data. To explore this question, monthly changes in 21 physiochemical leaf traits and plant spectra were measured for eight deciduous tree species from the UK. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to evaluate whether each trait could be predicted from a single PLSR model from reflectance spectra, or whether species- and month-level models were needed. Physiochemical traits and spectra varied greatly over the growing season, although there was less variation among mature leaves harvested between June and September. Importantly, leaf spectroscopy was able to predict seasonal variations of most leaf traits accurately, with accuracies of prediction generally higher for mature leaves. However, for several traits, the PLSR estimation models varied among species, and a single PLSR model could not be used to make accurate species-level predictions. Our findings demonstrate that leaf spectra can successfully predict multiple functional foliar traits through the growing season, establishing one of the fundamentals for monitoring and mapping plant functional diversity in temperate forests from air- and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for hydrology, climate monitoring, and ecological and environmental research. LST products from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data have been widely used for that. However, TIR information cannot provide LST data under cloudy-sky conditions. All-sky LST can be estimated from microwave measurements, but their coarse spatial resolution, narrow swaths, and short temporal range make it impossible to generate a long-term, high-resolution, accurate global all-sky LST global. This study proposes a methodology for generating the all-sky LST product by combining multiple data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), reanalysis, and ground in situ measurements using a random forest. Field measurements from the AmeriFlux and Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) networks were used for model training and validation. Cloudy-sky and clear-sky LST models were developed separately. To further improve the accuracy of the cloudy-sky LST model, the conventional RF model was extended to incorporate temporal information. The models were validated using in situ LST measurements from 2010, 2011, and 2017 that were not used for the model training. For the cloudy-sky and clear-sky models, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 2.767 and 2.756 K, R2 = 0.943 and 0.963, and bias = -0.143 and - 0.138 K, respectively. The same validation samples were used to validate both the MODIS LST product under clear-sky conditions and allsky Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) LST product at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, with RMSE = 3.033 and 4.157 K, bias = -0.362 and - 0.224 K, and R2 = 0.904 and 0.955, respectively. Additionally, the 10-fold cross-validation results using all the training datasets further indicate the model stability. The models were applied to generate the all-sky LST product from 2000 to 2015 over the conterminous United States (CONUS). Our product shows similar spatial patterns to the MODIS and GLDAS LST products, but it is more accurate. Both validation and product comparisons demonstrated the robustness of our proposed models in generating the allsky LST product.

AB The Monitoring Nitrous Oxide Sources (MIN2OS) satellite project aims at monitoring global-scale nitrous oxide (N2O) sources by retrieving N2O surface fluxes from the inversion of space-borne N2O measurements that are sensitive to the lowermost atmospheric layers under favorable conditions. MIN2OS will provide emission estimates of N2O at a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees on the global scale and 10 x 10 km(2) on the regional scale on a weekly to monthly basis depending on the application (e.g., agriculture, national inventories, policy, scientific research). Our novel approach is based on the development of: 1) a space-borne instrument operating in the Thermal InfraRed domain providing, in clear sky conditions, N2O mixing ratio in the lowermost atmosphere (900 hPa) under favorable conditions (summer daytime) over land and under favorable and unfavorable (winter nighttime) conditions over the ocean and 2) an atmospheric inversion framework to estimate N2O surface fluxes from the atmospheric satellite observations. After studying three N2O spectral bands (B1 at 1240-1350 cm(-1), B2 at 2150-2260 cm(-1) and B3 at 2400-2600 cm(-1)), a new TIR instrument will be developed, centered at 1250-1330 cm(-1), with a resolution of 0.125 cm(-1), a Full Width at Half Maximum of 0.25 cm(-1) and a swath of 300 km. To optimally constrain the retrieval of N2O vertical profiles, the instrument will be on-board a platform at-830 km altitude in a sun-synchronous orbit crossing the Equator in descending node at 09:30 local time in synergy with two other platforms (Metop-SG and Sentinel-2 NG) expected to fly in 2031-32 aiming at detecting surface properties, agricultural information on the field scale and vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents and temperature. The lifetime of the MIN2OS project would be 4-5 years to study the interannual variability of N2O surface fluxes. The spectral noise can be decreased by at least a factor of 5 compared to the lowest noise accessible to date with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer-New Generation (IASI-NG) mission. The N2O total error is expected to be less than similar to 1% (similar to 3 ppbv) along the vertical. The preliminary design of the MIN2OS project results in a small instrument (payload of 90 kg, volume of 1200 x 600 x 300 mm(3)) with, in addition to the spectrometer, a wide field and 1-km resolution imager for cloud detection. The instruments could be hosted on a small platform, the whole satellite being largely compatible with a dual launch on VEGA-C. The MIN2OS project has been submitted to the European Space Agency Earth Explorer 11 mission ideas.

AB Spaceborne imaging spectrometers are expected to facilitate regional-scale vegetation analyses with multi-season hyperspectral imagery. However, we still lack a better understanding on both whether multi-season hyper spectral approaches are favorable over single-season approaches, as well as on the benefits of hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. Our study investigates the potential of multi-season unmixing of simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data for vegetation class fraction mapping across diverse natural and semi-natural ecoregions in California, USA. We utilized spring, summer and fall 2013 simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data covering study sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Santa Barbara. Regression-based unmixing with synthetic training datasets from spectral libraries was implemented for mapping needleleaf tree, broadleaf tree, shrub, herbaceous and non-vegetation fractions, and independent reference data was used for validation. Multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP had average Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over all classes of 8.7% for the Bay Area, 8.5% for Lake Tahoe and 9.6% for Santa Barbara. However, larger errors in the low and high end of the fraction range remained, particularly in open-canopy woodlands and xeric shrub-dominated regions. Single season unmixing of simulated EnMAP revealed large seasonal and regional variations within individual vegetation classes. In most cases, the best performing single-season unmixing had similar errors as the multi-season unmixing, i.e., increment MAEs within +/- 1.0%. This points to the advantage of the multi-season integration strategy for more robust and generalized mapping independent from season and study site. Relative to EnMAP analyses, multi-season unmixing of multispectral Landsat composites for the same seasons yielded increases in average MAEs of +1.7%, +2.3% and +1.4% for the three study sites. This indicates that the higher spectral resolution of simulated EnMAP provides more relevant discriminative information when comparing contemporary image pairs. Unmixing of seasonal spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) from all available Landsat images for an entire year took advantage of the full temporal detail provided by these ongoing missions. We found Landsat STMs to effectively map vegetation class fractions, with average MAEs of 9.9%, 10.0% and 9.7% for the three study sites. Still, improvements particularly for mapping fractions of the woody vegetation classes through multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP point to the benefit of high spectral resolution data, and we assume that a comparable higher temporal resolution of hyperspectral satellites will further positively influence results. Overall, we conclude that multi-season unmixing of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data holds great potential for advancing vegetation class fraction mapping across natural and semi-natural ecosystems.

AB Pakistan ranks third in the world in terms of mortality attributable to air pollution, with aerosol mass concentrations (PM2.5) consistently well above WHO (World Health Organization) air quality guidelines (AQG). However, regulation is dependent on a sparse network of air quality monitoring stations and insufficient ground data. This study utilizes long-term observations of aerosols and trace gases to characterize and rank the air pollution scenarios and pollution characteristics of 80 selected cities in Pakistan. Datasets used include (1) the Aqua and Terra (AquaTerra) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer) Level 2 Collection 6.1 merged Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval products; (2) the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 data; (3) the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) reanalysis PM2.5 data, (4) the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and VCD of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), (5) the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nighttime Lights data, (6) MODIS Collection 6 Version 2 global monthly fire location data (MCD14ML), (7) population density, (8) MODIS Level 3 Collection 6 land cover types, (9) AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) Version 3 Level 2.0 data, and (10) ground-based PM2.5 concentrations from air quality monitoring stations. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analyses were performed by integrating with ground-based PM2.5 concentrations and the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) air parcel back trajectories to identify potential pollution source areas which are responsible for extreme air pollution in Pakistan. Results show that the ranking of the top polluted cities depends on the type of pollutant considered and the metric used.For example, Jhang, Multan, and Vehari were characterized as the top three polluted cities in Pakistan when considering AquaTerra DTB AOD products; for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 Lahore, Gujranwala, and Okara were the top three; for tropospheric NO2 VCD Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad and for PBL SO2 VCD Lahore, Mirpur, and Gujranwala. The results demonstrate that Pakistan's entire population has been exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations for many years, with a mean annual value of 54.7 mu g/m(3), over all Pakistan from 2003 to 2020.This value exceeds Pakistan's National Environmental Quality Standards (Pak-NEQS, i.e., <15 mu g/m(3) annual mean) for ambient air defined by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) as well as the WHO Interim Target-1 (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 < 35 mu g/m(3)).The spatial analyses of the concentrations of aerosols and trace gases in terms of population density, nighttime lights, land cover types, and fire location data, and the PSCF analysis indicate that Pakistan's air quality is strongly affected by anthropogenic sources inside of Pakistan, with contributions from surrounding countries.Statistically significant positive (increasing) trends in PM1, PM2.
   5, PM10, tropospheric NO2 VCD, and SO2 VCD were observed in similar to 89%, similar to 67%, similar to 48%, 91%, and similar to 88% of the Pakistani cities (80 cities), respectively.
   This comprehensive analysis of aerosol and trace gas levels, their characteristics in spatio-temporal domains, and their trends over Pakistan, is the first of its kind. Results will be helpful to the Ministry of Climate Change (Government of Pakistan), Pak-EPA, SUPARCO (Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission), policymakers, and the local research community to mitigate air pollution and its effects on human health.

AB Remote sensors, onboard orbital platforms, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance our understanding of changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function of forests, offering multi-scale monitoring of forest restoration. UAV systems can generate highresolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data-canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI-and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data-15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of UAV-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes serves as a substrate for heterotrophic bacterial growth, a regulator of the global carbon cycle, and a light absorption agent. DOC in eutrophic lakes is greatly influenced by phytoplankton phenology and terrigenous input by rivers. Therefore, it is necessary and significant to dynamically monitor the concentration, storage, and riverine exchange flux of DOC. By using in-situ DOC measurements from 2004 until 2018 (N = 2019), a machine learning algorithm, namely, a multilayer back-propagation neural network (MBPNN) model, was developed in this work to improve the remote sensing estimation of DOC concentrations in eutrophic Lake Taihu. The model yielded a mean estimation error of 15.14% for the testing dataset. The monthly mean DOC concentration significantly increased from 2003 to 2018 (N = 192, p < 0.01). High DOCs were observed in lake bays with high chlorophyll a (Chl-a) levels, and phytoplankton growth explained more than 50% of the monthly DOC variations. Then, given the evenly mixed DOC in the water column on the monthly and annual scales, we further estimated the monthly mean DOC storage in the lake from 2003 until 2018 and DOC fluxes (input and output) due to rivers during 2008-2018. Although the mean net riverine DOC input (50.56 +/- 32.22 x 10(3) t C) was approximately 5.2 times the average DOC storage (9.73 +/- 1.23 x 10(3) t C), phytoplankton growth controlled DOC variations, which indicated that much terrigenous DOC was transformed into other carbon forms after entering Lake Taihu. This study verified the feasibility of remote sensing of DOC (surface concentration, storage, and riverine exchange flux) in eutrophic lakes.
